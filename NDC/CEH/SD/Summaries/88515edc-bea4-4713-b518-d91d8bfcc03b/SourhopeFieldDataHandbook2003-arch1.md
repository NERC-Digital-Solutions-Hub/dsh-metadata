# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview and purpose
- Documents the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Field Site (established 1998) for long-term soil-vegetation experiments.
- Focuses on site-level data: climate, geology/soils, land use, vegetation, and soil analyses to study relationships between soil, vegetation, and management.
- Aims to enable data-driven analyses of biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem function, including cross-block comparisons and long-term ecological inferences.

## Study site and experimental design
- Location and context:
  - Sourhope Experimental Farm, Bowmont valley (Cheviot Hills), upland, humid climate; near England–Scotland border.
  - Site comprises Blocks 1–5 with multiple plots per block; Block 4 and Block 5 data detailed in the provided excerpt.
- Layout and treatments:
  - Main plots per block (A–F) with subplots within each main plot; Ecotron/controlled-environment plot also included.
  - Treatments at main-plot level:
    1) Control
    2) Lime applied annually
    3) Nitrogen applied as NH4NO3 (twice yearly)
    4) Lime + Nitrogen
    5) Biocide
    6) Fallow (initially included; later used as additional controls)
  - Grazing regime: plots cut regularly in growing season; stock excluded from April 1998; fencing to control access.
  - Sampling and baseline: first vegetation survey in 1998; soil cores and pits collected in August 1998; ongoing long-term monitoring.
- Data scope:
  - Multiyear framework including climate data, soil chemistry/physical properties, vegetation surveys, and site-specific block/plot metadata.
  - ECN (Environment Change Network) integrated data streams and MLURI metadata framework for storage and discoverability.

## Data types and variables (structure and content)
- Soil profiles (Block 4 and Block 5 excerpts):
  - Horizon designations and depths (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg/Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges (0–1 cm through ~100 cm).
  - Soil descriptions: color, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), structure, root presence, mottling, stones.
  - Profile summaries provide horizon-by-horizon detail across blocks, including the presence of igneous stones, boundary types, and moisture status.
- Soil chemical and physical analyses:
  - Key variables across horizons and samples: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Additional measurements: bare moisture content indicators, exchangeable cations, and depth-associated chemical profiles.
  - Notable patterns: surface horizons tend to be acidic (low pH), LOI high indicating organic matter content; Ca and Mg often dominate cation pools; block-to-block differences in certain cations and pH exist.
- Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5):
  - Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2) for individual auger points.
  - Data capture depth-integrated properties at fine spatial resolution (relative to subplots and plots).
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Subplot and plot-level species presence/absence and abundance indicators; species totals per plot/subplot.
  - Dominant and indicator species (e.g., Agrostis capillaris frequently dominant; Deschampsia spp., Carex spp., Holcus, Ranunculus) and NVC (National Vegetation Classification) associations.
  - Vegetation sampling details: 50 × 50 cm quadrats within randomly selected subplots; 25 points per quadrat; early-year surveys noted as indicative/baseline.
- ECOTRON and ECN components:
  - ECOTRON plot soil analysis (Wy/weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, pH, moisture-related metrics).
  - ECOTRON vegetation survey with plot-level species counts and relative abundances.
- Site metadata and block-level context:
  - Grid references, altitude, slope, soil drainage, parent materials, rock types.
  - Block-specific horizon descriptions and horizon-level chemical data, including anomalies and spatial patterns.
  - Appendices and block-level data tables with extensive horizon-by-horizon soil data, and subplots/plots details.

## Key patterns and interpretations (data-driven insights)
- Plant–soil relationships:
  - Vegetation composition shows correlations with soil properties (e.g., pH, LOI, %N, %C) and with management treatments.
  - Four principal plant communities identified, with Agrostis capillaris as a dominant species across many plots; NVC classifications indicate broader community structure and indicator species (Deschampsia, Carex, Holcus, Juncus, etc.).
  - Richness tends to increase downslope, while edge plots may show reduced species diversity; spatial heterogeneity evident across blocks.
- Soil properties and depth:
  - Surface horizons are acidic with high LOI; deeper horizons reveal changes in exchangeable cations and pH, reflecting soil development and moisture gradients.
  - Block-level variations in Ca, Mg, Na; some blocks show anomalous readings—randomization implemented to minimize treatment effects.
  - Detailed horizon descriptions reveal heterogeneity in soil development across blocks, reflecting topography and microclimate influences.
- Data readiness and long-term potential:
  - The data framework supports cross-block comparisons, enabling analyses of responses to lime, nitrogen, biocide, and grazing regimes.
  - Rich metadata and standardized data storage facilitate discoverability and reuse for modelling biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem function over time.

## Data collection, quality, and limitations
- Early vegetation sampling was limited (subset of subplots), so baseline insights are indicative rather than exhaustive.
- Treatments are perturbations intended to simulate management practices; interpretations should consider perturbation context.
- Local microclimate and topography influence species composition and soil properties, contributing to block/plot-level variation.
- Data are designed to support cross-block comparisons and long-term ecological inference, with careful documentation of methods and horizons.

## Data accessibility and stewardship
- Data tracked with metadata to support discoverability; ECN and MLURI frameworks underpin storage, accessibility, and dissemination.
- Block-level and plot-level data are documented in appendices with horizon-by-horizon chemical data and site details.
- ECOTRON and ECN components ensure integration of climate, soil, and vegetation datasets across the Sourhope site.

## Relevance for analysts and data-driven questions
- Enables exploration of correlations between soil chemistry (C, N, LOI, Ca/Mg/K/Mg, pH) and plant community structure (dominant/indicator species, NVC classifications) under varied treatments and grazing.
- Supports modelling of management impacts on biodiversity, soil health, and ecosystem function over the long term.
- Provides a comprehensive, multi-layered data framework (climate, geology/soils, vegetation surveys, soil chemistries) for robust ecological analyses at local scale with potential for regional comparisons.
