Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

## Aim
- Demonstrate environmental condition and policy performance over time using standardized monitoring of above-ground productivity, plant composition, and diversity at the Sourhope site.
- Examine how management practices (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) influence plant communities and functional groups, with attention to data quality and long-term dataset value.

## Context and Site
- Four-year field experiment at Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Monitored changes in above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
- Site management: fencing from 1998, monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept), five prescribed treatments (Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Insecticide/Biocide), plus two controls (Control 1 and Control 2).

## Data Collected and Methods
- Data types: weather (Automatic Weather Station), above-ground biomass per 0.5 m2 cell, point quadrat surveys for species hits, soil pH (0–5 cm), soil moisture, bryophyte assessment, and species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes).
- Sampling design: 5 replicate blocks, each with 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly; 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V.
- Analysis: repeated biomass measurements (May–Sept, 1999–2002); treatment effects assessed with split-plot ANOVA; PCA on point-analysis data; Shannon diversity indices; functional-group classification using CSR (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerators, Ruderals) and SR/CSR combinations.

## Key Findings by Theme

### 1) Mowing Effect
- Consistent reduction of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis since 2000; likely a site-wide response to mowing rather than a specific treatment.
- Festuca rubra expands, especially in more fertile (lime and/or nitrogen) plots.
- Stress-tolerant (S) species expand across most treatments, linked to reduced disturbance after grazing cessation.
- Bryophytes (mosses) expand broadly across the site, supported by a ~6 cm sward height and lack of grazing; more pronounced in unimproved plots.
- Overall plant diversity and functional composition shift toward dominance by a few faster-growing, nutrient-responsive species in fertilised plots; unimproved plots show greater bryophyte and stress-tolerant richness.

### 2) Fertilisation Effect
- Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increase above-ground productivity; plots with both N and lime show the strongest productivity gains.
- Productivity trends: 2002 biomass lower than 2001 across most plots, but long-term rise since 1999 with fertilisation; possible plateau as soil pH approaches ~7.0 in lime-treated plots.
- Soil pH effects: lime markedly increases pH (to ~7 in upper soil), correlated with higher productivity but potentially reduced soil moisture and plant stress under high pH.
- CSR dynamics: fertilised plots shift toward competitive (C) and stress-ruderals (SR) types; C-S-R species expand most in N+L plots; SR/C-S-R species decline in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
- Nutrient-driven changes interact with moisture and pH: higher pH in lime plots linked to lower moisture during dry periods, potentially limiting gains.

### 3) Insecticide Effect
- Shannon diversity tends to be higher in plots with insecticide treatment, but evidence is circumstantial regarding direct causation via reduced herbivory.
- Plant community responses align with complex plant-herbivore interactions; some patterns mirror classical herbivory-exclusion studies, but definitive attribution remains cautious.
- Bryophyte increases occur in unimproved plots, indicating other factors (grazing exclusion, moisture, disturbance) also drive diversity.

### 4) Trampling / Disturbance
- 2002 C2 plots show productivity reductions potentially due to trampling during intense activities (e.g., labelled 13CO2 pulses), highlighting how short-term disturbances can influence biomass measurements.

### 5) Plant Diversity and Functional Groups (Point Analysis)
- Two dominant grass species (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) become more frequent in improved plots; Agrostis spp. decline; overall shifts toward more fertile-condition species in fertilised plots.
- Bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and others) increase in frequency over time, especially in unimproved plots; bryophyte hits rise from ~10.8% (2001) to ~19.9% (2002).
- Litter/mortality indicators show increasing differences among treatments in 2001–2002.
- Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 shows a 15% decline in N+L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments display mixed increases; divergence among treatments becomes more pronounced over time.
- Functional-group composition (S, CSR, SR/CSR) reveals:
  - In N+L plots: dominance by CSR and SR/CSR species.
  - In unimproved plots: greater balance with stress-tolerators still rising.
  - Across years, treatment differences become statistically significant, indicating treatment-specific shifts in functional strategies.

## Weather and Site Context
- 2002 had uneven rainfall, with lowApril/September but wetter Feb, July, and late-year periods; unusually mild winter 2001/02.
- Temperature and moisture patterns influence productivity and community responses, with moisture and pH interactions evident in biomass trends.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Large dataset: over 11,600 soil samples collected since start; data from multiple projects and years.
- Ongoing aim to increase data value by integrating datasets and enabling access to underlying data for broader scrutiny and reuse.
- Datasets are stored and linked to project outputs and portals to support transparency and reuse.

## Conclusions and Implications for Monitoring
- Mowing and disturbance regimes strongly shape plant community structure and function, driving a shift toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities in unfertilised plots, and toward competitive, nutrient-responsive communities in fertilised plots.
- Fertilisation boosts productivity but may reduce diversity in high-pH, high-nitrogen contexts; careful management of lime and nitrogen is needed to balance productivity and biodiversity.
- Insecticide application shows potential for maintaining higher diversity, but causal links require further investigation; herbivore-plant interactions are complex and context-dependent.
- Data value and accessibility should be enhanced by integrating site datasets and improving data portals to support long-term environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Implications for Practice
- Monitoring programmes should account for indirect effects of disturbance removal (grazing/exclusion) on plant functional groups and bryophyte dynamics.
- Regularly re-evaluate liming and nitrogen regimes to balance productivity with biodiversity goals.
- Maintain comprehensive data-sharing practices to maximize the utility of long-term environmental datasets for policy scrutiny and scientific insight.
