# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide broad context for related studies and enable data linking and inter-year comparisons.
  - Comprehensive monitoring across weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; data management and cross-team accessibility emphasized.

- Data collection and methods
  - Site and design
    - Field experiment with multiple treatments and blocks to test nutrient and management effects on grassland.
    - Treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
  - Measurements and schedule
    - Automatic Weather Station: continuous headline weather data (1999–2001) with daily downloads.
    - Above-ground biomass: five summer cuts per year (1999–2001); 0.5 m2 sampling cells per sub-plot; biomass dried and summed; data transformed for analysis.
    - Soil pH: measured for the top 5 cm; October 2001 values compared with baseline Aug 1998.
    - Botanical composition: Point Analysis surveys (July 2001; ~50% of quadrats per surveyor; 100-cell frame; 25 pins per cell) to determine species hits and relative abundance.
  - Data handling and analysis
    - Genstat 5 used for ANOVA, PCA; biomass data ln-transformed for analysis.
    - Inter-surveyor consistency checked (no significant differences between surveyors in 2001 data).
    - Results expressed relative to a control (C1) for year-by-year comparisons.
  - Important context
    - 2001 site activity affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May); activities resumed under veterinary protocol.
    - Change in site management: shift from manual mowing to mechanical cuts in 2001; change in site personnel (Officer in Charge).

- Key results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slight drop in average temperatures; higher soil moisture than in 2000.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments maintained through sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than in 1999–2000; likely due to personnel change and switch to mechanical cutting.
    - Normalising to C1 (1999 baseline) confirms nitrogen and/or lime as main drivers of increased productivity; Nitrogen & Lime most effective.
    - ANOVA: significant treatment effects (improved vs non-improved plots); significant year × treatment interactions; no significant block effects.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime raised surface pH to 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N&L plots) by Oct 2001; nitrogen alone also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since Aug 1998 baseline.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - 2001 total species hits 58% higher than 2000, indicating greater sward density (potentially due to reduced grazing since 1998).
    - Species-level shifts across treatments:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
      - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (N and/or L) and especially N&L.
      - Fertilised plots showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; diversity decreased in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime).
    - PCA (point quadrat data): clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots more uniform and bryophyte-rich; improved plots linked with higher frequency of Festuca rubra and related grasses.
    - Biomass vs species abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases; litter frequency higher in N and/or Lime plots, indicating faster turnover with higher fertility.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial variation: columns E and F (right-hand side facing up-slope) tended to be more acidic; underlying heterogeneity across site suspected.
    - Biomass distribution showed central plots tending to higher biomass; strong positive pH–biomass relationship; no significant differences among blocks.
  - Species and data notes
    - Appendix includes annualised biomass per plot and detailed species hits; species list includes common grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and litter components.
    - Relationships between lab measurements (pH) and field outputs (biomass) supported by correlation analyses (Fig. 9).

- Implications and interpretation
  - Fertilisation and liming shift plant communities toward more productive grasses, with corresponding increases in above-ground biomass.
  - Higher soil fertility and pH correlate with increased biomass and changes in species composition, including potential reductions in overall plant diversity in the most fertilised plots.
  - Management changes (staff, mowing method) had notable effects on productivity data, emphasizing the need to account for procedural differences when comparing years.
  - Spatial heterogeneity suggests site-scale planning is important when interpreting treatment effects.
