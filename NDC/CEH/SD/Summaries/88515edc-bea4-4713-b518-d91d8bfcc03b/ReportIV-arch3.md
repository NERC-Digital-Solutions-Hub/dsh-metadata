# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Summary

- The document reports four years of monitoring at Sourhope as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground productivity, plant composition, and diversity under five management regimes.

## Context and aims of monitoring

- Purpose: identify environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, evaluate management, and inform future decisions.
- Site: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders; long-term field experiment linking above- and below-ground processes.
- Core focus: how management practices affect vegetation productivity, species composition, and functional traits over time.

## Experimental design and management treatments

- Site layout: Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments (five plot-level): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (formerly Biocide; Dursban 4, applied after mowing)
- Site-wide management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied to designated plots after mowing; nutrient additions applied in spring.
- Treatments are randomized within blocks; 0.5 m2 cells used for data collection; multiple complementary surveys (point analysis, biomass, soil pH, moisture).

## Data collection and monitoring methods

- Climate and site data: on-site Automatic Weather Station; daily/periodic weather measurements since 1999.
- Vegetation productivity: annual above-ground biomass by clipping 0.5 m2 samples, oven-dried and weighed.
- Botanical surveys:
  - Baseline 1998 survey and annual point analyses (2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell and a 100-hole grid, with 25 points determined per sampling event.
  - Bryophyte and liverwort identification enhanced in 2002.
- Soil measurements: soil pH at 5 cm depth; soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002; soil sampling since 1998 (total soils analyzed ~11,621 samples to date).
- Data processing: split-plot ANOVAs to test treatment, year, and interaction effects; PCA for point-analysis species data; diversity indices (Shannon) computed across surveys.
- Appendices provide extensive datasets: species lists, biomass series, year-by-year treatment comparisons, and detailed site activity.

## Key findings: productivity, diversity, and composition

- Overall productivity trends
  - Nitrogen and Lime together (N&L) and Nitrogen alone generally boost above-ground biomass; fertilised plots most productive, with the N&L treatment giving the strongest productivity.
  - In 2002, biomass across several treatments declined relative to 2001 (ranging from 13.7% to 31.2%), with slope position influencing productivity (lower blocks more negative gains).
  - Control plots showed pronounced declines in 2002; productivity remained higher overall than 1999 baselines, indicating long-term fertilisation benefits but year-to-year variability.
- Soil chemistry and moisture
  - Lime dramatically increases soil pH toward ~7.0 in treated plots; nitrogen also raises pH but less strongly.
  - A strong negative relationship exists between soil moisture and pH (higher pH associated with drier conditions in limed plots).
  - Positive general relationship between soil pH and biomass when considering all treatments; however, in plots receiving both N and lime, the relationship weakens and may become negative, possibly due to moisture stress or other interacting factors.
- Species composition and diversity
  - Festuca rubra expands notably in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina declines, while Festuca rubra increases relative abundance, altering species balance in improved plots.
  - Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis decline by over 40% since 2000, suggesting a mowing-related shift away from these species across all treatments.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) increase across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus rising to ~19.9% of total hits in 2002 (up from 10.8% in 2001 and 6.5% in 2000). Moss proliferation is linked to mowing height and the reduction of grazing disturbance.
- Functional groups (CSR framework)
  - Plants categorized into stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and SR/CSR groups.
  - Across years, S-dominated communities increase in unimproved plots; CSR and SR/CSR species become more dominant in N and/or Lime treatments.
  - By 2002, significant differences among treatments emerged in the composition of functional groups, with C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups more abundant in fertilised plots and stress-tolerant species favored in unimproved plots.
- Point-analysis insights (species-level trends)
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show higher incidence of grasses associated with fertilised pastures (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) in the point-hits data.
  - Unimproved plots show higher relative abundance of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophyte incidence remains higher in unimproved plots; however, overall bryophyte hits have increased across the site, particularly in less fertile plots.
  - Litter (dead vegetation) hits increased in 2001 and 2002, with fertilised plots showing higher litter counts in later years.
- Diversity metrics
  - Shannon diversity indices reveal treatment differences emerging from 2000 onward, with 2002 showing significant declines in N&L plots (about 15% lower than baseline) while other treatments show diversity gains (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).
  - PCA of point data broadly separates improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots show distinct groupings, with some nitrogen-treated samples clustering with limed plots.
- Insecticide effects
  - The insecticide treatment (Dursban 4) did not provide a clear, direct link to diversity increases; potential mechanism could involve enhanced survival of palatable species under lower herbivory, but evidence remains circumstantial.
- Trampling/experimental disturbance
  - The 2002 C2 plots (receiving heavy sampling and 13CO2 pulses) show marked productivity reductions, attributed largely to trampling during pulse activities rather than treatment effects per se.

## Implications for monitoring and policy-oriented data management

- Long-term, multi-factor monitoring is essential to separate treatment effects from site-level dynamics (e.g., mowing regime, slope position, and disturbance history).
- Functional trait frameworks (CSR and its extensions) provide insight into how management shifts drive ecosystem function, not just species lists.
- Data governance considerations highlighted by the study:
  - Importance of metadata, data access, and transparent sharing of underlying data to support policy evaluation and cross-project synthesis.
  - Potential barriers include data silos, public data-sharing constraints, and the need for robust metadata quality and standardization.
  - The monitoring framework benefits from consistent measurement protocols, clear data provenance, and open data practices to inform future decisions.
