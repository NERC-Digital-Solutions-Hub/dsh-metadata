# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons; baseline data were documented in 1998.
- Data collected 1999–2001 across multiple measurement types (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical composition) to understand treatment effects and site heterogeneity.
- Site management impacted by Foot and Mouth restrictions in 2001 and a change of site officer mid-year; most management activities proceeded under a 2001 Site Management Plan.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Data types and collection timing:
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline measures (1999–2001) including rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, air and soil temperatures; data retained by the CEH Data Manager.
  - Above-ground biomass: five mowing events per summer (May–September) across plots; biomass dried and summed for annual totals; preliminary normalisation against the C1 control to compare year-to-year impacts.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm sampled in 1998 baseline and October 2001 to assess liming and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys conducted in July 2000 and 2001 to assess species hits and relative abundance; 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; two surveyors validated for consistency.
- Experimental layout and protocols:
  - Treatments include Control (unimproved), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, and Biocide, applied in sub-plots across blocks.
  - Data collected using standardized protocols (Point Analysis, mowing regime, soil sampling), with substantial documentation (Tables and Figures referenced in the report) and species codes for reporting.
- Data quality and governance notes:
  - Surveyors’ measurements cross-checked; no significant inter-surveyor difference in 2001 (NS).
  - Data normalization and transformation applied (e.g., log transformation for biomass in ANOVA).
  - 2001 access restrictions due to FMD; ongoing sampling followed an agreed protocol supervised by a vet and the Officer in Charge.
  - Acknowledgement of personnel and farm staff contributions; weather data managed by CEH.

## Key Results by Data Type

- Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average after very wet 2000 year; radiation similar across years; slight decline in average temperatures; higher soil moisture in 2001 vs prior years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Biomass showed a consistent treatment hierarchy with nitrogen and/or lime generally boosting production.
  - 2001 biomass was notably higher than in 1999–2000, potentially due to a shift from manual to mechanical cutting and staffing changes.
  - ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved vs non-improved plots, a significant year-by-treatment interaction, and no significant block effects.
- Soil pH
  - Liming markedly raised surface pH by October 2001 (approx. 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in Nitrogen + Lime plots); nitrogen alone also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots remained close to baseline pH.
- Botanical composition
  - Species composition varied with treatments; Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, while Festuca species increased.
  - Improved plots showed greater presence of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and Poa trivialis; unimproved plots remained more dominated by species associated with poorer pastures.
  - Diversity appeared to decline in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in Nitrogen + Lime).
  - PCA separated improved vs unimproved treatments; biomass generally increased with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance, while several bryophytes and dry-land species declined as biomass rose.
  - Relative litter increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Implications
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site (columns E/F more acidic than others; some columns with higher proportions of Control/Biocide).
- Surface soil pH and biomass showed spatial patterns; central plots often exhibited higher biomass.
- Strong positive correlation between surface pH and biomass, suggesting fertility-related productivity gradients within the experimental layout.
- No significant differences between blocks in biomass, but clear spatial structure affecting treatment responses.

## Data Governance, Provenance, and Reuse
- Documentation and reporting align with Baseline Data Survey practices; data are organized by plot, treatment, and year, with clear measurement dates and methods.
- Data management and sharing considerations:
  - Weather data explicitly managed by CEH and linked to the Sourhope site data manager.
  - Standardized data processing and statistical analyses (ANOVA, PCA) described, enabling cross-year comparability and replication.
  - Explicit metadata elements include site location, plot identifiers, treatment codes, measurement methods, species coding, and units.
- Implications for data reuse:
  - Provides a robust multi-year context for evaluating nitrogen and limestone effects on biomass and plant communities.
  - Useful for meta-analyses of treatment effects, nutrient dynamics, and plant community shifts under varying management regimes.
  - Requires careful attention to year-to-year methodological changes (e.g., switch to mechanical cutting) and site-specific heterogeneity when aggregating results.
