# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of this data chunk
- Presents detailed soil profiles and analyses for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5.
- Includes horizon descriptions, soil physical/chemical analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON data as part of long-term monitoring.
- Data designed to support linking soil properties with vegetation responses and management practices within a multi-site ECN framework.

## Data types, sampling methods and structure
- Soil profile data:
  - Horizon sequences (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, B sg, C gx; and equivalent in Block 5 such as ABg, Bg, BCg, Cg).
  - Depths from 0 cm down to ~100 cm, with boundary descriptions and soil texture notes.
- Soil analyses (per horizon and per auger sample):
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g).
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI).
  - pH in water (pH(H2O)) and in CaCl2 (pH(CaCl2)).
  - Wt (mg) for each horizon/sample; additional barcode identifiers for sample tracking.
- Auger samples:
  - A series of 4A–4F (Block 4) and 5A–5F (Block 5) horizon-like sub-samples with corresponding chemical (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg) and physical properties.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plot-level species counts and totals across multiple subplots (A–F) within each plot.
- ECOTRON site data:
  - Separate ECOTRON PLOT soil analyses and vegetation surveys to compare managed microclimate/control conditions with ambient plots.

## Key soil and site characteristics (Rigg Foot)

- BLOCK 4 (Rigg Foot):
  - Topology and soil context: shallow horizons from LF to Cx with Ah and Abg horizons; presence of many andesite/igneous stones; sandy silt loam textures; acidic to strongly acidic surface horizons.
  - Horizon features: Ah horizon shows dark colour and high LOI; Cx horizon shows accumulated weathered material with stones; B sg and C gx horizons indicate progressive maturation and mottling patterns.
- BLOCK 5 (Rigg Foot):
  - Deeper profile with additional BCg and Bg horizons; textures range from sandy to clay loams; mottling (clear, prominent), suggesting imperfect drainage and variability across depth.
  - Richness in stones (medium to very small igneous fragments) and variable root presence across horizons.
- Parent material and drainage context:
  - Igneous/andesitic contributions with Brown forest soil overlying gleying tendencies; drainage described as imperfect in several entries.

## Representative soil analytical patterns (highlights)

- pH and acidity:
  - pH(H2O) values typically in the mid-4s (roughly 4.5 to 4.9).
  - pH(CaCl2) generally around 3.8 to 4.2, indicating acidity in a more buffered extract.
- Organic matter and LOI:
  - High LOI values in Ah and surface horizons (block-specific, with some horizons showing LOI well above 60% in deeper analyses), reflecting substantial organic matter residues.
- Nitrogen and carbon:
  - %N values range from approximately 0.4% to just over 2% in some upper horizons, with %C values often higher (up to ~38% in certain horizons), leading to C:N ratios typically in the low-to-mid teens (e.g., ~12–20) but varying by horizon.
- Base cations and exchange properties:
  - Calcium (Ca meq/100g) values span from near 0 up to around 10 meq/100g in some horizons; Mg and K show wide horizon-dependent variation; Na often near negligible in several horizons.
- Moisture and ignition:
  - %Moisture loss generally in the range of roughly 4%–10% across horizons, with LOI values corroborating organic matter content.
- Texture and structure notes:
  - Textures described as sandy silt loam to clay loams in various horizons; presence of strong brown/yellow mottling in some B horizons; abundant very fine fibrous roots in upper horizons.
- Auger sample summaries (Block 4 and Block 5):
  - A suite of horizon-level measurements (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH) with some Na data missing in select horizons.
  - C:N ratios and nutrient pools vary by horizon and block, reflecting heterogeneous nutrient dynamics along the profile.

## Vegetation and ECOTRON components

- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plot- and subplot-level tallies indicating species presence/absence and totals across blocks and plots; data support linking plant communities to underlying soil properties.
- ECOTRON PLOT:
  - Separate soil analysis and vegetation data for an ECOTRON site, enabling comparisons between manipulated/control conditions and ambient plots.
  - ECOTRON soil: %N 0.59, %C 8.22, C:N 13.83, Ca 2.76, Mg 1.7 (meq/100g), pH(H2O) 4.79, pH(CaCl2) 3.82.

## Data governance, accessibility and archiving context

- Sample identification and traceability:
  - Data are associated with MLURI barcodes for each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; and auger samples 4A–4F, 5A–5F; ECOTRON 1).
- Data structure for reproducibility:
  - Horizon-level data (depth, soil description) paired with chemical/physical analyses and sample weights, enabling cross-plot, cross-horizon comparisons.
- Metadata and data sharing:
  - The dataset is designed with clear plot/horizon identifiers, sampling dates, and analysis methods; open sharing of underlying data is a recurring governance theme, though gaps exist (e.g., some Na data not available in all horizons).
- Archival and long-term value:
  - Data are part of long-term monitoring within Sourhope ECN and ECOTRON contexts, with explicit emphasis on archiving sub-samples for future analyses.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks

- Multi-parameter, horizon-level data:
  - Demonstrates the value of collecting integrated soil chemistry, physical properties, and vegetation data across depth, horizon, and plot scales to evaluate management impacts.
- Metadata and data governance:
  - Highlights the need for rigorous metadata, standardized horizon coding, and sample tracking to enable data reuse and cross-site comparability.
- Data access and interoperability:
  - Shows practical barriers and opportunities related to data sharing and avoiding data silos; emphasizes open data practices and consistent archiving.
- Long-term site-specific monitoring value:
  - Provides a rich baseline for tracking ecological and soil changes over time, supporting policy evaluation and future decision-making on land management and soil health.
- Practical challenges:
  - Heterogeneous horizons, variable drainage, and stone-rich profiles illustrate the complexity of translating field data into policy-relevant indicators without clear standardization across sites.
