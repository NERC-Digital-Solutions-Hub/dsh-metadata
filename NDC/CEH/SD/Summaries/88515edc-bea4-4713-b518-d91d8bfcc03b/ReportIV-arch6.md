# SUMMARY

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground productivity, species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in a large field experiment.
- Three main management processes driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application (Dursban 4). The study aims to link these treatments to community functional changes and productivity.

## Site, design, and treatments
- Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with treatments allocated randomly.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
- Site management: mowing of entire vegetation to ~6 cm monthly May–September; insecticide applied to Insecticide plots after mowing; nitrogen and/or lime added in spring per year.
- Data collection and activity: ongoing field data collection since 1998–1999 across multiple groups; 1999–2002 saw major fieldwork including collaboration with CEH laboratories for tracer studies.

## Data collection and products
- Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station collecting temperature, rainfall, and related data since Feb 1999.
- Above-ground productivity: regular clipping by 0.5 m2 cell per plot, dried and weighed; baseline vegetation survey in 1998; ongoing point analyses in July/August 2000–2002 with 0.5 m2 cells and a 100-point grid.
- Plant biodiversity and structure: species-level surveys including bryophytes; detailed point quadrat analyses (cover, hits), and species lists (Appendices with full lists).
- Soil measurements: soil pH (water-based) at ~5 cm depth since 1998; soil moisture measured at points during point analysis surveys.
- Data handling and analysis: Genstat 6 used for ANOVA and PCA; long-term datasets include biomass time series, treatment-year interactions, and functional-group classifications (CSR framework).
- Scale of effort: over 11,600 soil samples collected overall; extensive annual and multi-year datasets across six plots per block and five blocks.

## Key findings on productivity and community composition
- Biomass productivity
  - A general long-term increase in above-ground biomass across all treatments since 1999, with the strongest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - In 2002, overall biomass declined relative to 2001 across most treatments; reductions ranged ~13.7% (N&L) to ~31.2% (Control 2).
  - A clear slope-related pattern: Block 1 (lower on slope) showed larger biomass declines than Block 5, indicating microtopographic influence on productivity.
  - ANOVA (Treatment, Year, and Treatment×Year) showed highly significant effects, with Year and Treatment×Year interactions driving much of the variability.

- Fertilisation and soil chemistry
  - Nitrogen and lime consistently increased productivity; lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0, especially in lime-treated plots.
  - Soil moisture tended to be lower in fertilised plots, potentially contributing to stress during dry periods and leaf chlorosis in lime-heavy plots.
  - In plots fertilised with both nitrogen and lime, a shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) functional types is evident, driven by higher pH and growth rates; nitrogen-only plots performed less strongly for CSR compared with lime-only plots.

- Functional plant groups and diversity
  - Point analyses show three dominant functional groups: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR (stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals); these groups accounted for most hits per plot (69–95% across years).
  - By 2002, CSR species dominated in nitrogen-and-lime plots, while stress-tolerant species were more prominent in unimproved plots.
  - Mosses and bryophytes expanded across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; bryophyte hits rose from ~6% (2000) to ~19.9% (2002).
  - Densities of two forage grasses associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) increased in fertilised plots, helping distinguish improved vs unimproved treatments in point analyses.
  - Diversity (Shannon index): 2002 saw a 15% decline in the nitrogen-and-lime plots relative to baseline; other treatments experienced increases (up to ~29% in insecticide plots). Overall, community diversity shifted with treatment.

- Species composition and community structure
  - PCA of 2002 point analysis data clearly separated improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct grouping; some nitrogen-treated samples clustered with limed plots, showing convergence under certain conditions.
  - Bryophyte representation rose across treatments, with notable reductions in bryophyte hits in nitrogen- and lime-treated plots for certain bryophyte species.

- Insecticide effects and trampling considerations
  - The insecticide treatment (Dursban 4) shows complex interactions with plant diversity; while evidence suggests a potential link between reduced herbivory and higher diversity in some contexts, definitive causality is not established due to limited direct herbivore data.
  - The introduction of trampling in the C2 plots (from 13CO2 pulse experiments) likely contributed to reduced productivity in 2002 for those plots, highlighting the effect of experimental disturbances on biomass.

## End-of-report synthesis and implications
- Mowing consistently reduces certain competitive grasses (Agrostis spp.) and promotes Festuca rubra and stress-tolerant species; the reduction of disturbance (grazing) appears to facilitate bryophyte expansion.
- Fertilisation broadly boosts productivity, but the response is modulated by pH and soil moisture; very high lime-induced pH and drier conditions can lead to diminishing returns or stress signals (chlorosis) in some instances.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are not conclusively proven but align with some prior work suggesting herbivore removal can alter plant community structure, potentially favoring certain palatable species.
- Trampling and site-level disturbances in C2 plots highlight the importance of accounting for non-treatment influences on productivity and ecological responses in long-term experiments.
- The study provides rich, long-term data for modelling data-driven insights into how management actions influence productivity, species composition, and functional diversity in grassland ecosystems, with clear implications for land management strategies and policy-relevant data products.

## Notes on data and methods (for Data Support perspective)
- Experimental design enables self-serve data products: time-series biomass by treatment, species composition trajectories, functional-group dynamics (CSR framework), and soil chemistry relationships (pH, moisture vs productivity).
- Analyses employ robust multivariate techniques (PCA) and split-plot ANOVA to capture treatment-year interactions, supporting transparent data-driven storytelling and decision support.
- Appendices and datasets (species lists, biomass tables, weather data, and point analysis results) underpin reproducible insights and potential dashboards for end users and policy partners.
