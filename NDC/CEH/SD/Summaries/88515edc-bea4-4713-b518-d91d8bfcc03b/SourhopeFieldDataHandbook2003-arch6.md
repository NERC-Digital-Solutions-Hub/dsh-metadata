# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- This section provides detailed soil profile descriptions and correspond­ing chemical/physical analyses for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus ECOTRON plot data. It also includes vegetation surveys tied to each plot/subplot.
- Data scope includes horizon-level soil descriptions, soil chemical properties, bulk auger samples, moisture loss, loss on ignition, pH measurements, and major cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg) across horizons and blocks.
- Complementary site details cover location, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and rock types, enabling multi-domain analyses (soil, vegetation, and microtopography).

- Data structure and layout
  - BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 present sequential horizon descriptions with depth ranges and names:
    - BLOCK 4 horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
    - BLOCK 5 horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Horizon descriptions include texture (e.g., sandy silt loam), structure (blocky/granular), color, moisture, roots, and presence of stones.
  - ECOTRON PLOT provides a separate soil-analytical and vegetation dataset.

- Soil analyses and measurements
  - Per horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) in blocks 4 and 5:
    - Weight (Wt in mg)
    - %N, %C, C:N ratio
    - Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
    - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition
    - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2)
  - AUGER SAMPLES (Block 4 and Block 5):
    - Wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg
    - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition
    - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2)
  - REVIEWS include multiple specific barcode IDs and horizon-specific values, illustrating in-depth horizon-level chemistry and physical properties.

- Vegetation data
  - Vegetation surveys accompany each plot/subplot, listing Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pp, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc, with presence/absence indicators, counts, and totals for each plot.
  - ECOTRON plot vegetation data provided separately, capturing species counts and totals per subplot.

- Site details and context (Blocks 4, 5, and ECOTRON)
  - BLOCK 5 site details include grid reference, altitude (315 m), slope (5 degrees), imperfect drainage, soil series (SH 74714 Sourhope, Bellshill), and major soil subgroups (Brown forest soil with gleying). Rock type noted as undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
  - Block-level and horizon-level metadata are provided to support proper interpretation and cross-domain analyses (soil–climate–vegetation interactions).

- Data storage, archiving, and metadata
  - Data entries are associated with MLURI barcodes for each horizon and sample (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, and Auger samples), with records for weights and chemical measurements.
  - Soil samples are archived (e.g., at MLURI/CEH) and linked to horizon and block IDs.
  - Vegetation and soil data are organized by block and plot, enabling multi-block cross-domain dashboards and analyses.

- Practical relevance for Data Support
  - Demonstrates integration of multi-domain data (soil physics/chemistry, vegetation, site context) within a consistent plot-based framework.
  - Provides rich data products suitable for cross-linking soil properties with vegetation patterns, enabling dashboards and self-serve analyses.
  - Highlights metadata needs and data quality considerations, such as horizon-specific labeling, occasional missing values (e.g., some Na entries), and variable sampling coverage across horizons and plots.

- Practical takeaways for data work
  - Leverage the standardized horizon-based schema (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) to align future data collection and integration across blocks.
  - Preserve horizon IDs and barcodes to maintain traceability between soil analyses, auger samples, and vegetation data.
  - Document sampling coverage and gaps explicitly to support transparent interpretation and reuse.
  - Integrate climate/soil/vegetation datasets to build cross-domain dashboards that illuminate soil-vegetation relationships and site heterogeneity.
  - Use the dataset to prototype data products (e.g., self-serve soil-vegetation analyses) while acknowledging horizon- and block-level variability.
