# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders (NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme).
- Baseline data survey completed November 1998; broad monitoring prescribed to provide context for groups and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Experimental design includes monitoring of above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical composition, along with environmental data (Automatic Weather Station).
- Target data products include plot- and treatment-level maps of soil/biomass variables and species composition to aid cross-study comparisons.
- 2001 site management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor ban Feb–May 2001); subsequent sampling governed by a site protocol. Officer in Charge changed mid-2001.
- Measurements and data collection schedule summarized (Table 1 reference); mowing, biomass harvests, Point Quadrat surveys, and related vegetation/soil assessments conducted across plots.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near long-term annual average (reduced from prior very wet year).
- Total radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower.
- Average soil moisture content modestly higher than earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy in treatment effects on biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than previous years, likely due to:
  - Change in personnel.
  - Switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass analyses: all treatment measures normalized against C1 within each year.
- ANOVA (ln-transformed biomass) showed:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant year-by-treatment interaction.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise soil pH (upper 5 cm):
  - Limed plots: average pH ~6.19 (October 2001).
  - Nitrogen + Lime plots: average pH ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots’ mean pH remained close to August 1998 baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey: 58% more total hits than 2000; no significant difference between surveyors.
- Species richness: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; Nitrogen + Lime plots had 18 species—suggesting potential early decline in diversity in more improved plots.
- Species composition changes (2001 vs 2000):
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; remained most abundant only in Control1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and N&L (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more evident in fertilised plots (especially N+L).
  - Species linked to less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- PCA (Point Quadrat 2001) generally separated improved (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; unimproved plots associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass vs species abundances: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes and Agrostis vinealis tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Litter frequency increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (on the right side facing up the slope) exhibited more acidic plots.
- These patterns may be exaggerated by treatment distribution (60% within these columns are Controls or Biocide), but indicate underlying spatial variability, particularly low pH inNitrogen and/or Lime plots in those columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- 2001 biomass distribution: several outlier plots with low biomass across treatments (e.g., Control1 5A, Control2 1D, Nitrogen 2A, Lime 5B, Nitrogen+Lime 1A, Biocide 1E).
- Higher biomass generally found in more central site locations (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control1 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical ANOVA results: low block effect).

## Methodology and data notes
- Experimental design: field plots with 5 blocks and 6 treatments (Control1, Control2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Biocide); annual data collected 1999–2001.
- Measurements:
  - Above-ground biomass harvested at five summer cuts per year; drying and summing to compute annual biomass (log-transformed for analysis).
  - Point Quadrat botanical surveys (July 2001) for species presence/abundance.
  - Soil pH measured in upper 5 cm (baseline 1998; follow-up 2001).
  - Vegetation turnover assessed via litter/relative cover associated with biomass changes.
- Data handling: results include ANOVA tables (Tables 4–5) and PCA (Figure 5); data tables summarize annual and cumulative biomass (Appendix).
