# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme Sourhope Site Report

- Four years of intensive monitoring at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Focus on above-ground productivity (biomass), plant community composition, and diversity under five main management regimes, plus an insecticide treatment.

## Aims and context

- Examine links between soil biodiversity research and above-ground plant communities.
- Track how management interventions (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) and disturbance influence biomass production, species composition, and diversity.
- Classify plant functional groups (CSR framework) to interpret responses to soil–plant–climate interactions.

## Site setup and treatments

- Location: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments (plot-level):
  - Control 1: no treatment
  - Control 2: no treatment
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; soil insecticide)
- Site-wide management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; spring application of N and/or lime as specified.

## Data collection and activity

- On-site Automatic Weather Station; continuous weather data since 1999.
- Above-ground biomass: yearly sampling from 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; samples dried and weighed.
- Baseline botanical survey (1998) and annual point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell and 100-point grid; bryophytes identified later (2002) to species.
- Soil sampling: pH (approx. 5 cm depth) and soil moisture measurements; additional targeted vegetation and bryophyte surveys.
- Research group activity: Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II fieldwork involving 13CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements occurred; data totals and samples accumulated over time.

## Key results

- Biomass and productivity
  - Clear treatment hierarchy maintained: plots receiving nitrogen and lime together show the highest above-ground productivity; nitrogen or lime alone also boost productivity relative to unfertilised plots.
  - In 2002, overall biomass declined compared with 2001 across most treatments; strongest declines observed in the Control 2 plots.
  - A notable block (Block position on slope) shows lower productivity toward the upper slope (Block 5), indicating a spatial productivity gradient.

- Fertilisation effects and soil chemistry
  - Lime application raised soil pH significantly, approaching pH ~7 in limed plots; nitrogen also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Strong negative relation between soil moisture and soil pH observed; when pH increases (limed plots), moisture content tends to decrease.
  - Positive, often linear or polynomial, association between higher soil pH and biomass production across treatments; in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship is less straightforward and may become negative, suggesting complex interactions.

- Plant functional groups (CSR framework)
  - Fertilised plots (especially N&L) show a shift toward competitive (C) and stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) species; unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) favor stress-tolerant (S) species.
  - By 2002, three functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) consistently dominate across plots; nitrogen and lime strongly promote C-S-R group dominance.
  - Stress-tolerant species gain in less-disturbed/unfertilised plots; ruderal groups decline with increased disturbance from management changes.

- Species composition and diversity
  - Point analysis reveals Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis (improved-pasture indicators) are abundant in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum persist in unimproved plots.
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline markedly across the site since 2000, suggesting mowing-related or habitat-shift pressures.
  - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becomes more prevalent site-wide.
  - Shannon diversity index: 2002 shows declines in N&L plots relative to other treatments, while some other treatments show stability or increases; overall, diversity responses are treatment- and year-dependent.

- Insecticide effects
  - Insecticide plots show the highest Shannon diversity indices in 2000–2002, but causality is not firmly established; the potential mechanism is reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist, though direct links require caution due to data limitations.

- Trampling effects
  - 2002 C2 plots show notable productivity suppression, likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse activities; indicates disturbance can confound productivity measurements.

- Community structure and ordination
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on 2002 point-analysis data separates improved (nitrogen, lime, N&L) from unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly, with some nitrogen-treated samples clustering near limed plots.
  - Species loadings differentiate fertile indicators (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) from less fertile indicators (Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp.).

## Discussion highlights

- Mowing effects (major driver)
  - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments since 2000, suggesting a site-level response to mowing regime rather than a single-treatment effect.
  - Festuca rubra expands particularly in fertilised plots; moss proliferation is linked to mowing height maintenance and absence of grazing, contributing to bryophyte expansion.

- Fertilisation effects
  - Long-term productivity benefits from soil improvements (N and/or lime), with strongest responses when both nutrients and lime are applied.
  - High lime application raises pH, which can enhance productivity up to a point but may also reduce soil moisture and potentially lead to stress under dry periods.
  - Nutrient and pH dynamics influence functional-group shifts: higher pH with N&L promotes C-S-R species; NR-based changes differ from lime-only plots.

- Insecticide effects
  - Complex and context-dependent interactions between insect herbivory and plant diversity; observed diversity increases in insecticide plots align with some historical findings but do not prove causality without further controlled experiments.

- Trampling and experimental disturbance
  - Disturbance events (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) can transiently depress productivity in affected plots, underscoring the importance of separating treatment effects from incidental disturbance.

## Conclusions and implications

- Management choices have clear, measurable impacts on both productivity and plant community composition.
- Nitrogen and lime together produce the strongest long-term increases in biomass, but they also drive shifts toward competitive, light-demanding functional groups and can alter soil moisture dynamics.
- Regular mowing without grazing appears to promote bryophyte expansion and stress-tolerant species, changing community structure, especially in unfertilised plots.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are suggested but require cautious interpretation; further targeted analysis would help separate direct insect-control effects from indirect habitat changes.
- The Sourhope site demonstrates interactive, scale-dependent responses to management; implications for soil biodiversity and grassland management emphasize balancing productivity with maintenance of functional diversity and habitat stability.
