# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Snapshot: Rigg Foot Data (Blocks 4, 5 and related plots)

- Soil profile descriptions for BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5
  - Block 4: sequence includes LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm); notes show fibrous to semi-fibrous textures, moist conditions, root abundance, and presence of igneous stones; boundary types transition from sharp smooth to sharp wavy.
  - Block 5: sequence includes LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm); descriptions similarly emphasize fibrous roots, mottles, variable blocky structures, and abundant small stones.
  - Horizons commonly described as mineral-free or organic-rich layers (fibrous textures), with color descriptors (black, very dark brown, reddish brown) and transitions indicating increasing clay/organic content with depth.
- Soil analyses (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 profiles)
  - Measured across horizons: Wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca (meq/100 g), Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Observations include block-to-block variability in Ca, Na, Mg, pH, and other cations; some horizons show low Na data or missing values; pH values range from acidic (around 3.8–5.0 in CaCl2) to near-neutral in H2O measurements.
  - Notable trends: higher LOI and moisture loss in surface horizons; increasing C and N content with depth in several horizons; Ca often elevated in surface to subsurface horizons, with Mg and K showing more variable distributions.
- Auger sample analyses (AUGER SAMPLES for BLOCK 4)
  - Metrics include Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2).
  - Data show consistent patterns with horizon analyses, including low Na in most samples and varying pH values; Ca and Mg contents reflect underlying mineralogy and soil development.
- Vegetation survey data (BLOCK 4)
  - Plot-level composition recorded in subplots (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F) with presence/absence and abundance indicators for multiple species; totals per subplot indicate species richness and patchy distribution.
  - Indicator species and totals suggest spatial variation in vegetation across plots, aligning with underlying soil gradient and horizon properties.
- ECOTRON PLOT data
  - Soil analysis: WL (weight), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey: presence/absence counts per subplot with totals for species groups; data show a structured, integrated approach to linking soil properties with plant communities on a managed Ecotron plot.
- SITE DETAILS (BLOCK 5)
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude: 315 m; Slope ~5°; Drainage: Imperfect; Soil series: SH 74714 Sourhope, Bellshill; Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite.
  - Block 5 soil profile (0–100 cm) mirrors Block 4 structure with LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons; clear smooth boundary transitions between horizons and notable mottling and stone content.
  
## Data Provenance, Structure and Organization

- Source identifiers and traceability
  - MLURI barcodes accompanying each horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.) and auger samples (A–F) to ensure traceability from field collection to laboratory analyses.
- Data organization
  - Profiles by block (Block 4, Block 5) with detailed horizon descriptions; auger sample sets per block; associated soil chemistry and physical properties.
  - Vegetation surveys aligned to plots and subplots; species totals recorded per subplot.
- Long-term context
  - Data collected as part of Sourhope site activities linked to ECN and Micronet programs, enabling cross-project comparisons and long-term environmental monitoring.

## Data Quality, Gaps and Limitations

- Completeness and gaps
  - Occasional missing values in Na across horizons; some horizon-level measurements may be incomplete or not uniformly reported across all blocks/subplots.
  - Vegetation sampling shows patchy coverage in establishment year and across blocks, indicating that data should be treated as a guided snapshot rather than a full census.
- Variability and anomalies
  - Block-to-block and horizon-to-horizon variability in cation concentrations (Ca, Mg), pH, LOI, and moisture loss; some blocks show anomalous values requiring screening and normalization for cross-site analyses.
- Data integrity and documentation
  - Horizon labeling, coordinates, and treatment codes are documented to enable traceability; cross-referencing with appendices is recommended for linking samples to plots, horizons, and subplots.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Governance and architecture
  - Establish standardized metadata templates capturing horizon codes, sample IDs, coordinates, and year of sampling to enable cross-study reuse and reproducibility.
  - Create a centralized data repository linking plots, blocks, subplots, horizons, auger samples, and year of sampling to support traceability.
- Data quality assurance
  - Implement uniform sampling protocols across blocks and horizons; flag anomalous values with clear annotations; implement quality control checks for Na data gaps.
  - Maintain archival strategies for soil cores and auger samples (e.g., -80°C storage) to support future re-analysis as methods evolve.
- Interoperability and reuse
  - Use consistent vocabularies and align with vegetation classifications (e.g., NVC references) to facilitate cross-site comparisons and integration with ECN, Micronet, and other grassland datasets.
- Insights and decision support
  - Use the integrated soil (chemistry, texture, LOI) and vegetation data to model responses to management practices (e.g., lime, nitrogen, grazing regimes) and to inform long-term sustainability of upland grasslands.
- Community and governance
  - The Sourhope data program demonstrates the value of multi-project governance, standardized metadata, and data archiving to enable community access and long-term ecological research.

## Bottom-line takeaway

- The Rigg Foot and Block 5 data within the Sourhope field experiment illustrate a rigorous, long-term, multi-horizon soil and vegetation data program, emphasizing standardized provenance, comprehensive metadata, archival storage, and cross-disciplinary integration. For Data Leaders, it underscores the importance of structured governance, consistent data definitions, complete provenance, and ongoing data quality practices to maximize value for wider research communities and future analysis.
