# SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE : BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES

- Purpose: Detailed soil chemical properties from Block 4 auger samples as part of the Sourhope long-term monitoring, alongside adjacent blocks and ecotron plots to support environmental health assessment over time.
- Scope: Includes Block 4 auger analyses, Block 5 soil profile data, ECOTRON site data, and accompanying vegetation surveys to link soil chemistry with plant communities.
- Data organization: Measurements are provided per main plot and subplots (4A–4F), with standardized QA and archival practices (barcodes, weights, and multiple soil and chemical parameters).

## Data structure and sampling design

- Block 4 auger samples
  - Main plots: 4A–4F across six subplots per plot; each sample labeled A–F.
  - Measurements: Weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg (all as specified units), %moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation data (Block 4, associated plots)
  - Vegetation surveys recorded per sub-plot with species totals and presence/absence metrics across plots 4A–4F.
- Data recording
  - Standardized formats, with per-plot and per-subplot aggregation; QA steps aligned with field monitoring protocols.

## Block 5 soil profile (Sourhope) and auger data

- Soil horizons and depths
  - Profiles described from 0 cm to 100 cm with horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg and descriptive features (e.g., texture, roots, mottling, stone content).
- Chemical and physical properties (per horizon)
  - %N: variable, from ~0.01 up to ~2.17
  - %C: high in surface horizons (e.g., FH, H, Ah) up to ~33.81% (FH) and substantial values across Ah and AB horizons; lower in deeper horizons.
  - C:N: ranges from about 10.20 to 16.46
  - Ca (meq/100g): broad range from ~0.35 up to ~11.91 across horizons and blocks
  - Na (meq/100g): generally near zero in several horizons
  - K (meq/100g): 0.32 to 3.3 depending on horizon
  - Mg (meq/100g): 0.58 to 5.92
  - %Moisture loss: 2.79 to 9.43 across horizons
  - %Loss on Ignition: 4.12 to 67.00
  - pH(H2O): 4.34 to 5.20
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.53 to 4.48
- Visual and horizon notes
  - Surface horizons are acidic with relatively high LOI in Ah and surface horizons; horizon Bg/BCg show mottling and clay-rich characteristics.
  - Deeper horizons (Cg) show variable chemistry, higher Ca in some sections, and more neutral to slightly acidic pH values.

## ECOTRON soil site data

- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT)

  - %N: 0.59
  - %C: 8.22
  - C:N Ratio: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76 meq/100g
  - Na: 0.15 meq/100g
  - K: 0.62 meq/100g
  - Mg: 1.70 meq/100g
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79
  - %Loss on Ignition: 17.42
  - pH(H2O): 4.79
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.82
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT)
  - Plot-level species counts and totals recorded across subplots A–F; data show species presence/absence by subplot with totals per subplot.

## Vegetation survey data (Blocks 4 and ECOTRON)

- Plot-level totals
  - 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F and ECOTRON plots include detailed species tallies per subplot (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, etc.).
  - Species totals per plot vary widely, indicating differing plant community richness and composition across plots.
- Subplot-level detail
  - Subplots contain varying numbers of species and counts, illustrating micro-habitat variation within plots.

## Data management and accessibility

- Documentation and provenance
  - Barcodes link each sample to a physical specimen and analysis record; data captured with standardized metadata.
- QA and archiving
  - QA procedures aligned with field monitoring protocols; data archived within MLURI systems and linked to ECN and Micronet project databases.
- Reuse and interoperability
  - The dataset is structured to support cross-site comparisons and long-term ecological health assessment, enabling policy-relevant analysis.

## Implications for environmental monitoring

- Long-term baseline
  - The Block 4 auger, Block 5 horizon data, and ECOTRON data collectively establish a comprehensive baseline for upland soil chemistry and vegetation responses.
- Analytical potential for analysts
  - Enables calculation of soil fertility indices, C:N dynamics, pH trends, and horizon-depth variation.
  - Facilitates linking soil chemical properties with vegetation composition and indicator species across plots and over time.
- Policy and health monitoring
  - Standardised data collection and cross-site comparability support scrutiny of environmental health, ecosystem processes, and the effectiveness of management and policy interventions.
