# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- The report summarizes the Sourhope field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, with a baseline description in November 1998.
- Early, broad monitoring aimed to provide context for detailed studies and facilitate cross-year comparisons.
- 2001 management events included: (i) temporary restrictions due to the Foot and Mouth outbreak (Feb–May 2001) with limited site visits, and (ii) a change of site Officer in Charge.
- Key management activities (liming, N application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued in 2001; the first biocide application in May was missed.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather overall unremarkable; rainfall close to long-term average, with 2001 total around 839 mm.
- 2001 radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
- Average soil moisture content in 2001 was about 0.37 m3 m-3.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatments showed a consistent biomass hierarchy, with peaks in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than 2000, likely due to a combination of staff changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- After normalising against the C1 treatment, nitrogen and/or lime consistently promoted biomass.
- Split-plot ANOVA: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised surface pH (0–5 cm) to 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots' mean pH remained close to baseline values since Aug 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis recorded 58% more hits than July 2000, suggesting increased sward density (possibly from 1998 grazing removals).
- Clear treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining dominant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments, especially in fertilised plots (especially Festuca rubra in limed plots; Festuca ovina in nitrogen plots).
  - Fertilised plots (notably N and N+L) showed more Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra, indicating a shift toward more productive forage species.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) harboured more Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta, suggesting lower fertility associations.
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime, implying reduced diversity with improved fertility.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clustering of improved plots away from unimproved ones; improvements were strongly associated with Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass vs species abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Litter presence increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic plots, likely influenced by a higher proportion of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
- Underlying spatial variation across the site contributed to lower pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots within these columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Total biomass varied across plots; some outliers (low biomass) were distributed among several treatments, while higher biomass tended to be in more central plots (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant difference in biomass between blocks (statistically non-significant).
