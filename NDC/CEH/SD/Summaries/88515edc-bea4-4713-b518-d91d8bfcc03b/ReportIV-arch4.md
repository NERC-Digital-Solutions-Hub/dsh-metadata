# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, this report documents the Sourhope field site’s longitudinal study of above-ground biomass (productivity), plant species composition, and diversity, in relation to controlled management treatments and site conditions.
- The project integrates multiple data streams (biomass Harvests, point quadrat surveys, species lists, soil pH, soil moisture, and weather data) to understand how mowing, fertilisation, insecticide application, and trampling influence plant communities and their functional traits.

## Study Design and Data Collected

- Location and layout
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells (S, T, U, V) used by different research groups.
- Treatments and management
  - Plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
  - Site-level mowing: about 6 cm height, monthly May–September.
  - Insecticide applied after mowing; lime and/or nitrogen added in spring to designated plots.
- Data collection and timing
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station (weather data since 1999).
  - Above-ground biomass: monthly harvests (May–Sept) per 0.5 m2 cell; samples dried and weighed (since 1999).
  - Baseline vegetation survey (July–August 1998) and annual point analysis surveys (July–August 2000–2002) using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole frame to record species at 25 grid points.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (measured in water) every year; soil moisture via theta probe in 2002; additional soil and vegetation surveys (various small-scale methods) documented in appendices.
  - Biological inventories: bryophyte identification to species level in 2002; extensive species lists (Appendix 3) and biomass tallies (Appendix 6).
  - Data continuity notes: 2002 weather data had missing periods due to a station malfunction; some data were supplemented from a nearby station (Konza) for those intervals.
- Scale and datasets
  - 11621 soil samples collected since the start of the experiment (as of 2002).
  - Comprehensive datasets and appendices cover site activities, automatic weather data, biomass per plot, species lists, and point-analysis results.

## Key Findings by Management Theme

- Mowing effect
  - Consistent reduction of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis since 2000, across most treatments (likely due to mowing as a homogeneous disturbance versus historical grazing).
  - Festuca rubra expands, especially in more fertilised plots; mosses (bryophytes) expand across the site, aided by mowing height (~6 cm) and lack of grazing.
  - Stress-tolerant species increase broadly, with diminished SR/C-S-R (ruderal/competitive-stress-tolerant) species under regular mowing and grazing absence.
- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and/or lime positively affect above-ground biomass; plots receiving both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity increases.
  - Some signs of productivity peaking in high-nitrogen/limed plots, possibly due to higher soil pH (approaching 7) and reduced soil moisture stress under drier conditions.
  - A functional shift: N+L plots show increased competitive (C) and C-S-R traits; unfertilised plots retain more stress-tolerant (S) species. Lime and nitrogen together influence plant functional composition more than either alone.
  - Soil pH and moisture: lime raises pH significantly; higher pH correlates with higher productivity overall, though within some plots (e.g., N+L) the pH–productivity relationship may be weaker or nonlinear.
- Insecticide effect
  - Point analyses and diversity indices suggest insecticide-treated plots may support higher plant diversity, aligning with some literature on herbivore suppression increasing diversity.
  - However, the link between reduced herbivory and higher Shannon diversity is not definitive; effects may reflect indirect changes in palatable species able to persist in altered nutrient contexts.
- Trampling effect
  - 2002 biomass reductions in newly surveyed C2 plots likely reflect trampling during intensive sampling/manipulation (e.g., during labelled 13CO2 pulses) rather than treatment effects alone.

## Data Analyses and Outputs

- Biomass and productivity
  - Biomass remained higher in fertilised plots over time, with the nitrogen+lime combination giving the greatest productivity; however, 2002 saw overall declines across many treatments.
  - A clear year-by-treatment interaction in biomass; block (plot location on slope) also influenced productivity.
- Community composition and diversity
  - Point analysis shows shifts in species frequency: increased dominance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots; decline of Agrostis spp; bryophyte hits increased, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophyte abundance rose across years, contributing to greater moss presence on the site.
  - Shannon diversity indices declined in nitrogen+lime plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while other treatments showed diversity increases or smaller declines.
- Functional group analysis
  - Using CSR classification, three functional groups (stress tolerators S, competitive-stress combinations CSR, and SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of observed species.
  - Fertilised plots increasingly dominated by C-S-R types; unimproved plots favored stress-tolerant species; lime and nitrogen interactions strongly shaped functional composition.
- Multivariate analyses
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2002 point analysis data separates improved vs. unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots forming a distinct group; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots.
  - Within functional groups (CSR, S, SR/CSR), significant treatment effects emerged by 2002, especially for SR/CSR and CSR categories.
- Data quality notes
  - While most data show clear treatment and year effects, the 2002 weather data gap and the trampling conduct during C2 sampling are important contextual factors for interpreting productivity and diversity.

## Implications for Data Leaders (Data Strategy Perspective)

- Longitudinal, multi-factorial data are essential for understanding how management actions translate into ecological outcomes; this dataset exemplifies value in linking above-ground productivity, biodiversity, and functional traits with precise management variables (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide, trampling).
- Complex interactions exist between nutrient status, soil chemistry (pH), moisture, disturbance regime, and plant functional strategies; data systems should capture these interdependencies and enable cross-plot comparisons over time.
- Data governance and standardization needs
  - Consistent trait definitions (e.g., CSR classifications) and standardized sampling protocols across years are crucial for comparability.
  Data gaps (e.g., weather station outages) must be anticipated with contingency data sources and documented metadata.
- Data products and dissemination
  - The project demonstrates value from diverse outputs: biomass time series, species abundance tables, bryophyte lists, point-analysis results, PCA loadings, and appendices detailing site activity and treatments.
  - For data leaders, governance should ensure clear provenance, versioning, and availability of primary datasets (Appendices 1–8 references) to enable future reuse beyond the original project goals.
- Cross-system and cross-partner collaboration
  - The Sourhope dataset illustrates how above-ground and below-ground studies can be integrated conceptually; future data architectures should facilitate linking land-use practices, soil biota, and vascular plant responses across networks and partner projects.
