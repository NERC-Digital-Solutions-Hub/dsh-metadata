## Overview
- Presents soil profiles and associated vegetation data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5 and the ECOTRON plot.
- Includes detailed horizon descriptions, soil chemical analyses, auger sample data, and vegetation surveys by plot/subplot.
- Uses MLURI barcodes to identify samples and links soil measurements with vegetation observations, enabling traceability and cross-block comparisons.
- Part of a broader long-term field data framework integrating soil chemistry, vegetation dynamics, and environmental measurements.

## Data Content and Structure

- Soil profiles (BLOCK 4)
  - Block 4 horizons with depths and descriptive text for each: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous horizons, root presence, colour, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), structure, mottling, and boundary characteristics.

- Soil analyses (BLOCK 4 PROFILE)
  - Per horizon: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Sample identifiers include MLURI barcodes for FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx horizons.

- Auger samples (BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES)
  - For sub-samples A–F (4A–4F): weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2).
  - Data show slight variability across sub-samples and horizon contexts.

- Vegetation survey (BLOCK 4)
  - Plots 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F with subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc.
  - Records include species totals per subplot; many entries are blank or indicate counts for several species, reflecting presence/absence and abundance indicators.

- ECOTRON S approaches
  - ECOTRON PLOT soil analysis with horizon-level data and vegetation survey results similar in structure to BLOCK 4.
  - Includes MLURI barcodes and horizon-specific measurements.

- Block 5 details (BLOCK 5)
  - Site details: grid reference NT8544019520, altitude 315 m, 5° slope, imperfect drainage, Sourhope series, brown forest soil with gleying; parent material undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
  - Soil profile (BLOCK 5): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm) with horizon descriptions (fibrous, semi-fibrous, distinct colour changes, mottles, structure, roots, stones).
  - Soil analyses (BLOCK 5 PROFILE): horizon-level metrics including wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (BLOCK 5 AUGER SAMPLES 5A–5F): comparable metrics for each sub-sample with detailed values.
  - Vegetation survey (BLOCK 5): plots 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F with subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc; includes species totals and counts per subplot.
  - Notes indicate extensive, plot-by-plot tallies of species and totals, useful for cross-plot comparisons.

- ECOTRON soil site
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1): Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT): plots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, with per-plot tallies and species counts.

- Data references
  - References to sample identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) and horizon codes to support reproducibility and data linking.
  - Cross-block comparability supported by consistent horizon naming and measurement types.

## Site Details and Sampling Context

- Block 4 and Block 5 site context
  - Detailed horizon sequences and descriptive soil chemistry reflect multi-layer profiles with distinct horizons and mottling.
  - Profiles include horizons with undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite stones, indicating parent material influences on soil development and mineralogy.
- ECOTRON context
  - Dedicated plot for controlled environment studies, enabling comparison with main blocks and assessment of management or environmental perturbations.

## Data Provenance and Metadata

- Sample identification
  - All samples and horizons are tracked with MLURI barcodes and horizon labels (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg).
- Data lineage
  - Horizon-level analyses, auger sub-samples, and vegetation counts are organized by block and plot, enabling block-to-block provenance and longitudinal comparability.
- Documentation cues
  - Structure aligns with the Sourhope data framework: block-level soil profiles, chemical data by horizon, auger data, vegetation by subplot, and ECOTRON supplementary data.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Limitations

- Data completeness
  - Some plots/subplots contain missing entries (represented by blanks or dots), indicating incomplete records in certain horizons or sub-samples.
- Variability
  - Across horizons and blocks there is notable variability in C, N, LOI, pH, and exchangeable cations, reflecting natural heterogeneity and potential sampling differences.
- Interpretive cautions
  - Complex horizon sequences and the presence of stones or mottling in certain horizons may require careful interpretation when aggregating across blocks or comparing to other sites.

## Practical Considerations for Data Stewards

- Standardization and interoperability
  - Maintain consistent horizon codes, units, and measurement conventions across blocks (e.g., meq/100 g for Ca, Mg, K; percent C/N; pH scales).
  - Align vegetation species coding and subplot nomenclature to ensure cross-block integration.
- Provenance and reproducibility
  - Preserve raw horizon data and processed outputs (e.g., LOI, weight, C:N, element concentrations) with clear version history.
  - Link soil data to vegetation data by block, plot, and subplot to support integrative analyses and ecological modeling.
- Data storage and preservation
  - Ensure centralized, queryable repositories for soil and vegetation data, with backing archives for critical samples and barcoded identifiers.
- Data quality reporting
  - Document data gaps, anomalies, and sampling limitations; provide metadata on sampling dates, methods, and any deviations from standard protocols.
- Reuse and governance
  - Facilitate data reuse by exposing metadata, sample IDs, horizon designations, and cross-referenced outputs (e.g., auger results, horizon-wise chemistry, vegetation tallies) through a data portal or repository.
