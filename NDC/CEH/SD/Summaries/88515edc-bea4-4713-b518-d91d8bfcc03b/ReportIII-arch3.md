# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scotland.
  - Purpose: establish a broad monitoring context for related studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; provide data to link with other research and inform management decisions.
  - 2001 context: site access restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease and a change of officer in charge, with management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, cutting, and Point Analysis) continuing under a revised plan.

- Monitoring framework and indicators
  - Automatic Weather Station (AWS)
    - 2001 headline measures collected: rainfall, radiation, air/soil temperatures, soil moisture.
    - Data regularly downloaded and transmitted to CEH Data Manager.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Five summer harvests per year; clippings dried and weighed; plots normalized to a reference treatment (C1) for cross-year comparison.
    - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots and a significant year-by-treatment interaction.
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments most strongly promoted biomass; increased biomass in 2001 partly attributed to personnel changes and switch to mechanical cutting.
  - Soil pH
    - Upper 5 cm soil sampled; liming raised pH to ~6.19 (limed) and ~6.38 (N&L) by Oct 2001; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so; controls unchanged since baseline (1998).
  - Botanical composition
    - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) showed no surveyor bias; total hits higher in 2001 (58% more than 2000) suggesting denser sward, possibly from grazing removal in 1998.
    - Clear treatment differences in dominant species: Agrostis capillaris declined with fertilization; Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina increased; Poa pratensis and other modern pasture species more prevalent in fertilized plots; more bryophytes and Nardus stricta in unimproved plots.
    - 24 species detected in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime plots, hinting at declining diversity with higher productivity treatments.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline with higher biomass.
    - Larger litter incidence in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with increased fertility.

- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Variation in surface soil pH and plant community across site columns (E/F tending more acidic).
  - Biomass distribution shows central plots generally more productive; strong positive correlation between surface pH and biomass.
  - No significant block differences in biomass; spatial heterogeneity influences interpretation of treatment effects.

- Data quality and governance notes
  - Cross-surveyor validation for botanical surveys; no significant differences between surveyors in 2001.
  - Data management connections highlighted (AWS data managed by CEH; multiple datasets integrated for year-to-year comparisons).
  - Documentation includes detailed measurement schedules (Table 1) and annualized biomass data (Appendix 1), facilitating reproducibility and comparability.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a multi-indicator monitoring approach (climate, biomass productivity, soil chemistry, plant community structure) integrated into a consistent experimental design.
  - Highlights the importance of standardized protocols and metadata to enable cross-year comparisons and data sharing.
  - Shows how management actions (nitrogen, lime) drive ecological responses, with clear links between soil chemistry, productivity, and community composition.
  - Underlines potential data governance considerations: need for consistent data transmission, archival, metadata, and accessibility to support broader policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
