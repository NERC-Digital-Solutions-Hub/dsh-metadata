- Block 5 profile notes:
  - FH and H horizons show markedly higher %C and LOI, indicating organic-rich surface material.
  - Calcium concentrations are notably higher in FH and H horizons; acidity remains evident with pH in the low- to mid-4 range across horizons.
  - BCg and Cg horizons show notable decreases in nutrients with depth; some horizons have very low or near-zero Na and K in deeper layers.
  - Horizon-to-horizon variation demonstrates pronounced vertical stratification, consistent with Brown forest soil with gleying in this site context.
- Block 5 auger samples (AUGER SAMPLES 5A–5F) provide consistent sets for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, moisture loss, pH, etc., across horizon-specific samples, enabling depth-resolved GIS analyses.

## Vegetation surveys: blocks 4 and 5
- Block 4 and Block 5 vegetation data accompany the soil results, enabling habitat mapping and community classification (aligned with NVC classifications and indicator species analyses in the broader Sourhope dataset).
- Species totals and per-subplot counts provided, supporting GIS-based habitat typing and spatial patterns in relation to slope, aspect, and soil depth.

## Spatial coverage and coordinates
- Block 5 site details:
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope ~5°; soil drainage: imperfect; major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying.
- Block 4 coordinates and plot references are provided in accompanying materials for precise GIS layering and spatial analyses.
- Horizon-level soil attributes are catalogued per horizon per profile, enabling depth-resolved soil mapping and modeling.

## Key GIS and data product takeaways
- The dataset offers multi-scale, horizon-resolved soil chemistry and physical properties (Block 4 augers and Block 5 profiles) plus horizon-specific lime, calcium, and cation data, suitable for creating soil-type maps and nutrient distribution layers.
- Vegetation data at plot/subplot levels complement soil data, enabling analyses of soil-vegetation relationships and habitat classification within a map-based framework.
- The inclusion of ECOTRON plots provides controlled-context data for comparison with the broader Sourhope field matrices.
- Data are organized to support long-term GIS analyses, change detection, and environmental-change investigations at Sourhope, with explicit sampling protocols and horizon- and plot-level identifiers.

## Accessibility and format
- Data are prepared for GIS use with plot, subplot, block identifiers, and horizon-level soil attributes.
- Appendices and accompanying materials consolidate coordinates, horizon descriptions, and raw measurements to facilitate integration into map-based data products and analyses.
