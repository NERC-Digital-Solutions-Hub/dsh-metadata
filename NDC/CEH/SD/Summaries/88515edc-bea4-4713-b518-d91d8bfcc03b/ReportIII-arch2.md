# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview and Aim
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field study at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
- Purpose: monitor environmental condition using standardized, cross-year datasets to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Provides a broad context for groups’ detailed studies and facilitates year-to-year comparisons (1999–2001).

## Monitoring Approach and Data Management
- Site design and treatments:
  - Plots include Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Biocide (B).
  - Above-ground biomass measured via five summer cuts on 0.5 m2 cells; biomass weights totalled per plot and year.
  - Soil surface pH measured in upper 5 cm; lime and nitrogen effects tracked.
  - Botanical composition assessed by Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 mirrored 2000 survey).
- Data collection and QA:
  - Automatic Weather Station on-site; data transmitted to MLURI data manager.
  - Inter-observer check for botanical surveys showed no significant difference between surveyors.
  - Data normalized to a control (C1) to compare treatment effects consistently.
- Operational context:
  - 2001 management impacted by Foot and Mouth restrictions (Feb–May); sampling resumed under controlled protocols.
  - Change of site Officer in Charge occurred in 2001.
- Output format:
  - Results presented with year-to-year comparisons, and standardized figures/tables to aid cross-project linkage.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near long-term annual average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak production in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass normalized to C1 show that nitrogen and/or lime treatments had the strongest positive impact on productivity.
- ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime raises surface pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ≈ 6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ≈ 6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser degree.
- Control plots show no significant pH change since baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 point quadrat survey: 58% more total hits than 2000; no significant surveyor bias.
- Treatment-driven shifts in species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declines across all treatments (except remains most abundant in some control plots).
  - Festuca spp. increase across treatments; Festuca rubra associated with N&L and lime-treated plots.
  - Improved plots show higher abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots retain species linked to poorer soils (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Diversity changes:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots—suggesting possible reduction in plant diversity with improved fertility.
- Multivariate patterns:
  - PCA separates improved (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; higher interaction with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis in improved plots.
- Biomass linkage:
  - Positive correlations between biomass and abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Negative associations between biomass and species like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
- Litter turnover:
  - Increased litter incidence in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating accelerated vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns

- Spatial variation:
  - Columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots; underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site observed.
  - Lower pH in nitrogen and/or lime plots in these columns noted.
- Biomass distribution:
  - Outlying plots tend to have lower biomass across treatments.
  - Higher biomass typically in plots more centrally located on the site (e.g., certain N, L, and B plots).
- pH–biomass relationship:
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant differences in biomass between blocks.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Multi-faceted, standardized monitoring (biomass, soil chemistry, plant community, and weather) effectively detects treatment-induced ecosystem responses.
- Nitrogen and lime applications drive soil chemical changes, biomass gains, and shifts in plant communities, with potential reductions in species diversity under enhanced fertility.
- Spatial heterogeneity at Sourhope influences treatment outcomes; cross-plot comparisons should account for site position and soil pH gradients.
- External factors (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions) can alter management and data collection, underscoring the value of robust, comparable methodologies and documentation.
