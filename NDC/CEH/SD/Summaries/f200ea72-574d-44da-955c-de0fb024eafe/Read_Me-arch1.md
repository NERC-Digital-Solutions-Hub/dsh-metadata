# Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf - Supporting documentation SD_Litterfall_Clocaenog.rtf - Details of data structure

- Overview
  - Provides metadata and structural details for the SD_Litterfall_Clocaenog data series, describing purpose, scope, and intended use for analyzing litterfall patterns at Clocaenog.

- Data collection and measurement methods
  - Describes litter trap setup, location within the Clocaenog area, sampling frequency, and protocols for handling, drying, and weighing litter samples.
  - Indicates whether litter is measured as total mass or separated by components, and notes any standard corrections (e.g., moisture corrections).

- Data structure and variables
  - Outlines the dataset organization and the meaning of each field/variable.
  - Typical variables likely include date/time, trap identifier, trap location, mass measurements (wet/dry), sampling area, and derived flux rates (e.g., g/m2/day).
  - Specifies units and data types for each field and any code lists used (e.g., trap_id formats, categorical descriptors).

- Data processing and calculations
  - Details steps to transform raw measurements into final analytical values (e.g., dry mass calculation, flux rate computations, aggregation levels).
  - Describes any quality control steps, data cleaning rules, and handling of missing or anomalous values.

- Metadata, provenance, and versioning
  - Provides data dictionary content and definitions for all variables.
  - Documents data provenance, sources, and the lineage of the data series, including any reprocessing or updates.
  - Includes versioning information and change logs to track modifications over time.

- Quality assurance and limitations
  - Lists QA checks applied (consistency checks, cross-validation with other datasets, outlier detection).
  - Highlights known limitations, such as spatial/temporal gaps, scale considerations, or uncertainties in measurements and calculations.

- Access, reuse, and licensing
  - Specifies how to access the data (repositories or portals) and intended audience.
  - States licensing terms, citation requirements, and any restrictions on use or redistribution.

- Related documentation
  - Points to additional supporting materials (e.g., broader study documentation, related data series) and notes on how to integrate this data with other datasets.
