# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- A climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming conditions over the next ~20–30 years.
- On-site, solar and wind powered, established in 1998 with replicated drought and warming treatments plus controls.

## 1.0 Site information

- Location: Clocaenog Forest, NE Wales (53°03′19″N, 03°27′55″W); upland west Atlantic moorland habitat.
- Dominant vegetation: Calluna vulgaris (heather) >60% of biomass; other species include Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, and various bryophytes.
- Soils: humo-ferric podzol; horizon development variable; E horizon 6–17 cm when visible.
- Climate/energy: designed for remote, sensitive sites; solar and wind powered; growing season June–August; dormancy Nov–Feb.
- Experimental design: 9 plots total (3 warming, 3 drought, 3 control) with replicates arranged in blocks; scaffolding mirrors shading effects on treatment plots.

## 2.0 Climate change treatment information

- Treatments and layout:
  - Drought (D): retractable polyethylene roof reduces rainfall over plots (4 m × 5 m); operated May–Sept 1999–2011; since 2012, April–October. Reduces annual rainfall by ~20% (and excludes ~80% of large events within treatment window).
  - Warming (W): retractable aluminium curtains over plots to reduce nighttime heat loss; roof retracted during rain to avoid rainfall loss; ~14% annual rainfall reduction. Curtains do not operate in winds >10 m s−1.
  - Controls (C): scaffolding to mirror shading from the structure (n=3 controls per block).
- Scheduling and context: Each treatment has three replicates; blocking scheme described; data include yearly changes in drought timing and warming degree-days across 1997–2014.
- Key notes: some data gaps and variability due to weather and equipment; high winds can suspend curtain operation.

## 3.0 Equipment, protocols and data processing methodology

- Data collection framework:
  - Automated weather station (AWS) met data and plot-based micro-met data.
  - Abiotic and biotic data collected within plots; timescales and methods vary by dataset.
  - Primary data storage and access: not all data stored in a single repository; some datasets hosted by CEH Bangor; contact for access details.
- Datasets and data types (examples of the comprehensive list):
  - AWS meteorological data (daily, 1999–present): air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data (daily, 1998–present): soil/air temperature, soil moisture at multiple depths.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry (biweekly): site-level rainfall from a storage rain gauge; chemistry including pH, NO3, Cl, SO4; DOC; ammonium.
  - Throughfall data (plot level, biweekly): plot rainfall collectors to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes.
  - Water table depth (from 2009, biweekly): permeable tubes down to bedrock.
  - Soil respiration (fortnightly and automated): CO2 efflux measured with collars; multiple instrument types over time; data converted to mg CO2-C m−2 h−1.
  - Trace gases CH4 and N2O (1999–2000, 2007–2009): static chambers and gas chromatography; sampling at 0.25, 15, and 30 minutes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) and photosynthesis (2002–2004, 2009–2011; 2010–2011 for NEE with respiration partitioning): chamber-based CO2 fluxes; adjustments for biomass.
  - Photosynthesis (2001–2003): leaf-level measurements with a CIRAS-2 and leaf cuvettes.
  - Vegetation survey data (pin-point biomass; 1998–2012, and beyond): three quadrats per plot; 100-pin grid; conversion from pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibrations.
  - Canopy reflectance (2000–2001, 2003–2004): ground-based spectrometry; NDVI and PRI indices from 400–950 nm.
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth and pathogens (2000, 2002, 2004): shoot elongation, budburst, leaves, and herbivory/pathogen signs.
  - Vegetation chemistry (green and litter material; 1998–present): carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates.
  - Litterfall (1999–2002 monthly; later less frequent): 12 collectors; drying and weighing; carbon and nitrogen analysis.
  - Root biomass (2003–2013): multiple core-based methods; extraction and biomass estimation.
  - Soil microbial biomass (2000–2001, 2012): chloroform fumigation–extractable DOC analysis; conversion to microbial biomass carbon.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation (1998–2004): incubation cores; ammonium and nitrate by autoanalyser.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density (1999–2004, 2013): soil core analyses; thermal gravimetric/dry-weight methods; bulk density for area-based conversions.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry (1998–2008): lysimeters and tension lysimeters; pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium analyses.
- Data processing notes:
  - Units and conversions standardized for cross-dataset comparability (e.g., soil respiration and NEE units; conversions to mg CO2-C m−2 h−1; use of established biomass calibration factors for pin-hit to biomass).
  - Data quality control primarily visual (Excel-based) rather than automated limits; legacy datasets may have documentation gaps.
  - Some datasets are described as infrequent or legacy data; processing details may not meet current best practices.
- Data access and contact:
  - Not all data are stored in a single public repository (EIDC); contact Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) or Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk) at CEH Bangor for details.
  - Some data may be hosted at CEH Bangor or other CEH facilities; data availability may vary by dataset and year.
