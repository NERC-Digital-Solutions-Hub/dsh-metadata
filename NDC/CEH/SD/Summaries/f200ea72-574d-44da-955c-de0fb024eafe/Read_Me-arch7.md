## Overview
- References two RTf files: one for general supporting documentation of the Clocaenog data series, and one detailing the data structure for litterfall in Clocaenog.
- Indicates a focus on metadata and structural definitions needed to understand and use the litterfall dataset.

## GIS implications
- Provides essential context to support map-based data products, including how variables are defined and how data are organized for spatial analysis.
- Facilitates data integration, quality assurance, and provenance tracking for spatial visualisations and analyses.

## What to expect in the documents
- Metadata about the data series (sources, methods, and provenance).
- Details of the litterfall data structure (fields, units, formats, spatial/temporal resolution).
- Guidelines or conventions to standardise data use within GIS workflows.

## Next steps
- Open and review both RTf files to extract specific field definitions, units, data quality checks, and collection methods.
- Align GIS datasets with the documented structure to ensure consistent mapping and analysis.
