# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Purpose: climate change manipulation site using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years; established 1998; solar and wind powered.
- Location and ecosystem: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; upland moorland with Calluna vulgaris heather dominating >60% of biomass; typical species list provided; soil is humo-ferric podzol.
- Treatments: two climate treatments (drought and warming) with three replicate plots each plus three control plots; total of 9 plots. Drought reduces rainfall (~20% site-wide; ~80% of rainfall excluded during drought months) in respective plots; warming uses retractable aluminium curtains to reduce night-time heat loss; rainfall adjustments occur via a rain-triggered roof retraction. Curtains not operated in high winds (>10 m/s).
- Data scope: extensive multi-parameter data across abiotic and biotic domains, collected since 1998 with ongoing updates and legacy datasets.

## Data collection and datasets
- Climate and meteorology
  - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements since 1999 (temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind). Sensors mounted on a secured mast after 2007; minute-level data aggregated to hourly.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily measurements of plot-scale soil and air temperature and soil moisture; depths 5, 10, 20 cm; data from 1998 onward (TDR sensors from 2008).
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: biweekly site-level rainfall and chemistry (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium) with lab analyses; rain gauge preferred for robust long-term data.
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes; occasional data gaps infilled with year-average reductions.
  - Water table depth: biweekly measurements from 2009 onward using permeable tubes to bedrock; maximum detectable depths recorded per plot.
- Ecosystem fluxes and biogeochemistry
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly to automated measurements from 1999 onward; multiple collar-based methods used over time; conversions between measurement systems documented.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measured with static chambers at soil collars; sampling at 0.25, 15, and 30 minutes; analyses by gas chromatography; legacy processing notes indicate uneven documentation.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measured 2002–2004 and 2011 using Perspex/Li-Cor-based systems; adjustments for biomass were applied using pin-point biomass data.
  - Photosynthesis: occasional measurements (2001–2003 for dominant species) using CIRAS-2 and leaf cuvettes; standardization for leaf area via leaf mass data.
- Vegetation and structure
  - Vegetation survey (pin-point biomass): conducted 1998–2012; three quadrats per plot with 100-pin grids; biomass calibrated via destructive sampling and species-specific conversion factors; data later used to adjust flux calculations.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2000–2004) with background and species-specific calibrations.
  - Phenology, growth, pathogens: spring phenology and annual growth of C. vulgaris, V. myrtillus, and E. nigrum; stages and growth metrics recorded from April to September; pathogen indicators noted.
  - Vegetation chemistry: elemental analyses (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates) on green and litter material.
  - Litterfall: collectors deployed; biomass weighed and converted to g m-2; carbon and nitrogen analyses on collected litter.
- Soil and soil biology
  - Root biomass: multiple campaigns (2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) using soil cores; roots manually extracted and analysed; modern approaches used WinRHIZO for some cores.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012); DOC measured to estimate microbial biomass carbon.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: 1998–2004 measurements via paired cores, ammonium and nitrate analyses to derive net mineralisation rates.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: cores used to determine SOM, SOC and bulk density; results converted to g m-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers installed in 1998; biweekly samples analyzed for pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, ammonium.
- Documentation and metadata
  - Datasets stored with file-level metadata; some data not in EIDC; contact CEH Bangor for details.
  - Data processing notes include unit conversions and calibration details; legacy data may lack complete processing documentation.

## Data processing and quality
- Data processing: various instruments and protocols used over time (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, EGM/EGM4, etc.); unit conversions provided to harmonize flux measurements (e.g., mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; µmol m-2 s-1).
- Quality and consistency
  - Legacy data: explicit note that current best practices were not always followed in processing; some datasets require careful provenance checks.
  - Data gaps and infilling: throughfall data gaps occasionally infilled using average reductions; some replicates may be omitted from treatment means due to data loss.
  - Instrument and method changes: multiple updates to measurement methods (e.g., soil respiration instrumentation) with documented conversion relationships.
- Data accessibility and discoverability
  - Some data stored offsite or outside EIDC; reach out to data contacts for access and provenance.

## Data governance, access and stewardship
- Data stewardship: data and supporting material curated by CEH Bangor; key contacts for details and data access include Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett.
  Email references provided in documentation for data queries.
- Access model: not all data are centralized in a single repository; potential need to coordinate across datasets and years for comprehensive analyses.
- Metadata and standards: dataset descriptions cover sensors, methods, time scales, and units; however, some processing details are incomplete due to legacy practices.

## Challenges and considerations for Data Leaders
- Large, long-running, multi-domain data set with heterogeneous methods and evolving instrumentation.
- Decades of data with variable documentation quality; need for robust provenance, metadata harmonization, and data cataloging.
- Gaps in throughfall, weather, and biotic measurements require careful treatment when aggregating treatment effects.
- Centralized data governance and standardized metadata would improve discoverability, re-use, and cross-study collaboration.
- Opportunities to enhance data discoverability and collaboration with explicit data products, lineage, and data-sharing agreements.
