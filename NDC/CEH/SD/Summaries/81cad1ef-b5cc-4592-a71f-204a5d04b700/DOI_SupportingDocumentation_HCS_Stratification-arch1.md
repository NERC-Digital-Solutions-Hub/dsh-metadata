# High Carbon Stock (HCS) Stratification of the SAFE project site, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, 2015 [HMTF] (2017) Deere, N.J., Guillera-Arroita, G., Baking, E.L., Bernard, H., Pfeifer, M., Reynolds, G., Wearn, O.R., Davies, Z.G. and Struebig, M.J.

## Overview of data
- The HCS_Stratification.shp shapefiles contain spatial data detailing the stratification of the study site based on the spectral signature of satellite images in accordance with the High Carbon Stock (HCS) methodology.

## Experimental design, sampling regime and data collection
- Study area: Stability of Altered Forest Ecosystems (SAFE) project site and surrounding Benta Wawasan managed oil palm estates in Kalabakan Forest Reserve, Sabah, Malaysian Borneo (coordinates: 4 ⁰ 46'N, 116 ⁰ 57' E).
- Context: Landscape-scale forest modification experiment including highly disturbed lowland and hill dipterocarp forest, near-pristine forest, twice-logged forest, and plantations (primarily oil palm; some acacia).
- HCS_Stratification.shp methods: Landsat 8 (15 m) and SPOT5 (2.5 m) imagery from 2012–2014; multiple data sources used to mitigate cloud/haze; supervised classification complemented by visual interpretation to correct topographic shadow effects.
- HCS classification: Four discrete HCS classes, listed in descending order of carbon value:
  1) Dense Forest
  2) Young Regenerating Forest
  3) Scrub
  4) Open Land
- Calibration: Classes calibrated using above-ground carbon values derived from forest inventory data collected as part of the core SAFE monitoring program (N = 139).
- Purpose: Data were produced to assess the response of medium-large tropical forest mammals to the disturbance gradient, informing reduced-impact land-use practices in human-modified landscapes.
- Personnel: N.J. Deere led data collation and implementation of the HCS protocol, with help from M. Pfeifer; other contributors include G. Guillera-Arroita, E.L. Baking, H. Bernard, M. Pfeifer, G. Reynolds, O.R. Wearn, M.J. Struebig, and Z.G. Davies.
