# Peaknaze Moor field site

## Overview
- A manipulation experiment evaluating how upland moorland ecosystems recover from reduced nitrogen deposition and interacting climate change effects.
- Located in Peak District, England; aims to inform land managers on recovery rates and when local action is effective versus national-scale solutions.
- Focuses on plants, animals, and soil responses under simulated future pollution and climate scenarios.

## Area, history and site setup
- Size: 208.45 hectares; Atlantic Heathland in Peak District; elevation ~433 m.
- Current ecological status: unfavourable recovering dwarf shrub heath (2004); large area burnt in 2003 wildfire; grazing ceased in 2004 and site fenced off for recovery.
- Establishment: automated manipulation site set up in 2006 with replicated pollution and climate treatments; powered by solar and wind with retractable roof systems to modify rain interception.

## Climate change and pollution treatments
- Design: three blocks with four treatments plus an untreated control.
- Treatments and timeline:
  - Drought and Warming start: 2010.
  - Pristine and Optimum Moisture start: 2012.
- Methods:
  - Drought: rain exclusion via retractable roof.
  - Pristine: removal of rain with controlled addition of polluted rainfall to simulate pollution.
  - Warming: night-time infrared-heat-trapping covers.
  - Optimum Moisture: continuous soil moisture monitoring and targeted irrigation to maintain ideal moisture.
- Baseline monitoring maintained prior to full treatment implementation.

## Plant biodiversity and vegetation treatments
- 2005 baseline plant survey using a non-destructive pin-point method across three quadrats per plot (approximately 300 pins per plot).
- Species tracked (examples): Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angistifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus spp.
- Nested biodiversity treatments introduced December 2011/2012:
  - Moss Removal: all moss removed from designated subplots; moss biomass separated from debris; weight-based estimates of removal.
  - Cover Removal: vegetation clipped to bare soil within marked squares; samples dried and analyzed.
- Data handling for plant surveys:
  - 300 pins per plot, 3 quadrats; tallies recorded by height, species, and structure.
  - Transcription double-checked for accuracy; codes aligned with Table 4; missing-pin adjustments applied to ensure complete coverage.

## Soil, climate, and biogeochemical measurements
- Soil and site characteristics recorded (example details):
  - Soil depth: 0–8.4 cm (mineral horizon) and 14.1–22.5 cm (deeper horizon) with coarse data gaps in some parameters.
  - pH in H2O: ~4.1–4.25; organic matter and nutrients variably reported; cation exchange capacity and base saturation low.
  - Initial soil nutrient data and exchangeable cations documented; recording emphasized variability across the site.
- Meteorology and hydrology:
  - 2006–2012 meteorological data including mean annual temperature (MAT) and rainfall; several years with missing entries (e.g., 2006 MAT and 2009 MAT not determined); representative values in 2007–2012 (MAT around 12–14°C; rainfall 964–1703 mm).
- Pollutant deposition:
  - 2006–2007 nutrient loading: ~14 kg N/ha/yr; sulfur deposition ~27 kg S/ha/yr (averaged).
- Plot layout and sampling:
  - 15 plots established in 2006; plots 5 m x 4 m with a buffer edge and a core 3 m x 3 m for manipulation and sampling.
  - Measurements include: soil respiration (root-free chambers), lysimeters, leaf litter and fine-weather components, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), radiocarbon sampling, enzyme activity and microbial biomass, and 2012 soil sampling.

## Extreme events
- Vapourer (Orgyia antiqua) outbreak and fungal infections monitored from 2010 onward.
- Signs of defoliation varied by treatment and year; outbreak largely affected Vaccinium myrtillus with high defoliation in several plots, while some plots showed limited or no attack.
- Data presented as per-plot, per-quadrat defoliation percentages; includes observed fungal symptoms and timing.

## Data management, accessibility and outputs
- Data creation follows standardized protocols with documented codes (species and treatments) and QA steps (double-checking transcription, ratio-based adjustments for missing data).
- Data products anticipated as maps, charts, and reports enabling temporal comparisons of environmental health and treatment effectiveness.
- Findings intended to inform land managers about recovery trajectories under reducing pollution and climate change, and to identify actions requiring broader (national) solutions.
