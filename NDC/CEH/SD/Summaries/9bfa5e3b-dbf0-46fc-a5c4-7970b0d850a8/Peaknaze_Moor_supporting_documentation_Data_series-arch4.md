# Peaknaze Moor field site Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose: A manipulation experiment to evaluate how moorland ecosystems recover from reduced nitrogen deposition and interact with climate change; aims to inform land managers on when actions are effective locally and what requires national-scale solutions.

## Aims of the project
- Assess speed and degree of moorland recovery under reduced pollution and changing climate.
- Compare recovery trajectories with climate-change effects to identify drivers of ecosystem response.
- Provide insights to land managers for decision-making on habitat preservation and improvement under future scenarios.

## Area, site history and context
- Location: Peaknaze Moor, Peak District, England; 53.47 N, 1.91 W; elevation ~433 m; Atlantic Heathland, 208.45 ha.
- Status: Unfavourable recovering dwarf shrub heath (as of 2004).
- History: Fire in 2003 burnt large areas; grazing ceased in 2004; fenced and left to recover.
- Setup: Automated manipulation site with retractable roofs for rain exclusion and climate manipulation; solar/wind powered; established 2006 with replicated pollution and climate treatments.
- Vegetation: Dominated by Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris; growing season May–Sept.
- Data context: Site provides meteorological data (partial records between 2006–2012), soil/land-surface measurements, and treatment responses for long-term analysis.

## Climate change and pollution treatments
- Experimental design: Three blocks with four treatments plus an untreated Control; drought and warming started in 2010; pristine and optimum moisture treatments started in 2012.
- Treatments:
  - Drought: Retractable roof excludes bulk precipitation to create drought conditions.
  - Pristine: Rain is removed and equivalent polluted rain is sprayed back to simulate polluted conditions.
  - Warming: Nighttime infrared-reflection covers to reduce heat loss.
  - Optimum Moisture: Continuous soil moisture control by feedback to irrigation to maintain target moisture.
- Implementation: Treatments applied to plots after baseline data collection; rainfall measurements used to calibrate treatment intensities.

## Plant biodiversity treatments
- Baseline survey (2005): Plant species composition per plot using non-destructive pinpoint method; 3 pin-point quadrats per plot with 300 pins per plot; detailed species hits recorded by height and structure; transcription quality checks performed; data coding for species tracked.
- Species monitored (example species): Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angistifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus.
- Nested biodiversity treatments (2011/2012): Each plot divided into three subplots—Control, Moss Removal, Cover Removal.
  - Moss Removal: All moss removed; biomass weighed to determine percentage moss in each sample.
  - Cover Removal: All vegetation clipped to bare soil within defined squares; clipped material dried and weighed.
- Biomass data: Total moss or biomass removed recorded for establishment (2012) with separate measurements for moss, debris, and clip biomass.

## Data collection methods and data quality
- Plot and quadrat layout: 15 plots (5 m x 4 m) with 3 m x 3 m experimental area; sampling quadrats (0.5 m x 0.5 m) and fixed base pegs for repeat surveys.
- Measurements and instruments: Net Ecosystem Exchange (NEE), soil respiration (SR), lysimeters, litterfall, soil sampling, 14C-based soil respiration signatures, and enzyme/microbial biomass sampling (2012).
- Data handling and QC:
  - Pinpoint data transcribed with cross-checks to prevent typos; verification of total pins (should be 300 per plot).
  - Adjustments made for missing pins by proportional scaling of category counts.
  - Detailed documentation of data codes, species, and sampling methods to support discoverability and interpretation.
- Data coverage notes: Some meteorological and soil detail values are missing or not determined for certain years; 2006–2012 meteorological data exist for MAT and rainfall with gaps; soil characteristic values include several placeholders and highly variable measurements.

## Soils and site characteristics
- Soils: Organo-mineral horizons with various measured properties, including depth ranges (0–8.4 cm and 14.1–22.5 cm), bulk density, pH (~4.1–4.25), organic matter indicators, carbonate/nitrogen content, cation exchange capacity, and base saturation (some values highly variable or not determined).
- Chemical context: Exchangeable cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg) generally low; acidity relatively high; soil organic matter and carbon content show substantial spatial variability.
- Data gaps: Many soil metrics have missing or not determined entries in the documentation; variability is acknowledged.

## Extreme events and biological responses
- Outbreaks observed: Vapourer (Orgyia antiqua) outbreaks and fungal infections affecting vegetation, with timing starting around 2010–2012 observations.
- Monitoring: Plots and subplots inspected for signs of vapourer attack and fungal infection; defoliation quantified as a percentage in multiple quadrats.
- Findings (illustrative): Outbreaks varied by treatment; some plots showed high defoliation (up to 100%), others showed little to no signs; fungal symptoms noted, sometimes confounded with caterpillar damage; responses differed among Control, Moss Removal, and Cover Removal plots over time.
- Implications: Extreme event data provide context for resilience and recovery analyses under different biodiversity and moisture regimes.

## Key takeaways for data management and use
- Comprehensive, multi-layered experimental design with clear treatment definitions and temporally staggered implementations.
- Detailed biodiversity measurement protocol enabling repeatability across years; robust QC processes for manual data transcription and pin-hit counts.
- Rich instrument suite and monitoring (NEE, soil respiration, moisture, soils, and 14C tracers) enabling ecosystem-level process understanding.
- Notable data gaps, particularly for some meteorological years and several soil properties; explicit metadata and documentation are essential to interpret variable quality and completeness.
- Extreme event data provide important context for interpretation of treatment effects and long-term recovery trajectories under climate and pollution changes.
