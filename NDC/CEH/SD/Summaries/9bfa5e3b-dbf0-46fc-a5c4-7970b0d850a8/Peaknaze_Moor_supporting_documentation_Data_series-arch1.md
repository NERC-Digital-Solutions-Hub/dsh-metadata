# Peaknaze Moor field site

- Purpose: A manipulation experiment to evaluate the recovery of damaged upland moorland ecosystems in response to reductions in nitrogen deposition and interactive effects of climate change. It aims to inform land managers about recovery dynamics and when local actions are feasible versus national-scale solutions.

## Site overview

- Location and size: Peaknaze Moor, Peak District, England; 208.45 hectares; typical Atlantic Heathland with Eriophorum vaginatum blanket mire and Calluna vulgaris–Cladonia sub-community.
- History: Large wildfire in April 2003; sheep grazing removed in 2004; fenced off and allowed to recover from 2004 onward.
- Establishment: Automated, solar/wind-powered manipulation site established in 2006; replicated pollution and climate change treatments across plots.
- Environment: Elevation ~433 m; growing season May–September; key vegetation includes Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum vaginatum/angustifolium, Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris.

## Treatments and experimental design

- Climate change and pollution treatments
  - Structure: Three blocks; each contains four treatments plus an untreated control.
  - Treatments and timing:
    - Drought and Warming initiated in 2010.
    - Pristine and Optimum Moisture initiated in 2012.
  - Methods:
    - Retractable roof system to exclude nitrogen inputs during rain (Drought).
    - Curtains exclude rain and sprayed polluted rain to simulate Pristine.
    - Warming via reflective covers to reduce infrared heat loss at night.
    - Optimum Moisture uses real-time soil moisture data to maintain constant soil moisture through controlled irrigation.
  - Purpose: Assess plant, soil, and community responses to reduced pollution and climate-change-driven moisture/temperature changes.

- Plant biodiversity treatments
  - Initial baseline survey in 2005 using non-destructive pin-point method across three quadrats per plot (30 cm grid with 300 pin touches per plot).
  - Major biodiversity manipulation (2011–2012):
    - Nested subplots within plots: Control, Moss Removal, and Cover Removal.
    - Moss Removal: remove moss biomass; subsamples weighed to determine proportion of moss vs debris.
    - Cover Removal: clip vegetation within randomly placed squares to bare soil; all clipped vegetation weighed after drying.
  - Moss removal specifics (2012): subsampling to estimate moss biomass percentage; biomass totals corrected by moss-debris proportion.
  - Data capture aims: quantify how above-ground plant structure and moss communities respond to different biodiversity manipulations under altered moisture/pollution conditions.

## Data collection and measurements

- Plot and quadrat layout
  - 15 plots established in 2006; each 5 m by 4 m with a 3 m by 3 m experimental area and buffer zones.
  - Quadrats: 0.5 m by 0.5 m for targeted measurements; multiple sampling keys and sampling events (see Figures referenced in the documentation).
  - Measurements recorded include plant hits by species, height, and structure; data transcribed with quality checks to ensure consistency (e.g., 300 pin touches per plot; corrections for missing pins).
- Biodiversity and biomass data
  - Species targeted in pin-point surveys include: Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angistifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus spp.
  - Moss and cover removal biomass data collected to determine effect sizes of the two biodiversity manipulations.
- Soil and environmental measurements
  - Soil characteristics recorded (examples):
    - Depths: 0–8.4 cm and 14.1–22.5 cm
    - pH in H2O: around 4.1–4.3
    - Carbon ~15% (variable across site); Nitrogen ~0.49% (variable)
    - Cation exchange capacity ~18.2 meq/100 g (varying)
    - Base saturation very low in some measurements
    - Bulk densities: ~0.2–1.27 kg/m3 (two horizons)
  - Meteorological data available (2006–2012): Mean annual temperature (MAT) and rainfall; some values missing or marked not determined for certain years (e.g., 2006 MAT not determined; later years show values 9–13 °C MAT and rainfall ~964–1703 mm).
- Extreme events (5) - vapourer outbreak and fungal infection
  - Timeframe: February 2010 monitoring for signs of Orgyia antiqua (vapourer) and fungal infections.
  - Findings: defoliation percentages varied by plot and treatment; Vaccinium myrtillus most affected; notes of possible fungal damage versus caterpillar damage in several entries.
  - Data presentation: year-by-year defoliation percentages per plot and per treatment (Control, Moss Removal, Cover Removal), with multiple quadrats sampled (C3, E3, C5, etc.).

## Data quality, metadata, and accessibility

- Quality controls
  - Data transcription double-checked; pin-hit counts validated (expected 300 per plot); missing data adjusted by proportional scaling.
  - Detailed procedural notes for biodiversity data collection, moss separation, and sub-sample processing to enable reproducibility.
- Metadata and data gaps
  - Some climate and soil measurements have missing values or "Not determined" entries across years.
  - The documentation emphasizes robust data collection protocols and the need to track data sources and metadata for discoverability and reuse.
- Relevance for analysis
  - Rich, multi-dimensional dataset enabling analysis of interactions among pollution reduction, climate-change simulations, and biodiversity manipulations on plant communities, soil characteristics, and ecosystem processes.
  - Includes treatment replication, long-running data collection, and extreme-event records, valuable for modeling recovery trajectories and predicting management outcomes.

## Key takeaways for analysts

- The Peaknaze Moor field site provides a replicated, multi-factor experiment combining pollution reduction, climate manipulation, and biodiversity interventions to study upland moorland recovery dynamics.
- Data types available include plant community composition (pin-point method), moss/biomass measurements, soil properties, meteorological records (with some gaps), and extreme-event defoliation data.
- The experimental design enables assessment of both direct treatment effects and interactions (e.g., how drought or optimum moisture conditions modulate recovery under reduced nitrogen input and warming).
- Notable data challenges include incomplete historical climate data for some years and partial soil data in certain depths, highlighting the importance of careful imputation, cross-validation, and clear metadata documentation when analyzing the dataset.
