Peaknaze Moor field site

- Aims of the project
  - Assess how upland moorland ecosystems recover from reductions in nitrogen deposition and how climate-change effects interact with pollution.
  - Replicate future pollution and climate scenarios to understand plant, animal, and soil responses.
  - Inform land managers and policy by identifying local actions and indicating when national-scale solutions are needed.

- Site overview
  - Location and size: Peak District, England; 208.45 hectares; Atlantic Heathland with a typical blanket mire community.
  - History: wildfire in 2003 (75% burned); grazing removed in 2004; fenced off and allowed to recover from 2004 onward.
  - Establishment: automated manipulation site (roofs and watering) set up in 2006; solar/wind powered.
  - Elevation and climate: ~433 m; variable meteorological data (2006–2012 rainfall and mean annual temperature; some data gaps).
  - Soils: organic-rich organo-mineral horizons; pH around 4.1–4.3; notable variability in carbon, nitrogen, and other soil properties; several measurements missing or placeholders.
  - Pollutant context: 2006–2007 nitrogen loading ~14 kg N ha^-1 yr^-1; sulfur deposition ~27 kg S ha^-1 yr^-1 (average 2006–2008).

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Plots and layout: 15 plots (5 m x 4 m; with buffer zones and 3 m x 3 m experimental area); quadrats of 0.5 m x 0.5 m for measurements.
  - Climate and pollution treatments: 3 blocks; four treatments plus Control. Drought and Warming initiated in 2010; Pristine (polluted rain) and Optimum Moisture started in 2012.
  - Treatment implementation: retractable transparent roofs exclude nitrogen inputs during rain (Drought); rainwater is manipulated to simulate pristine conditions (Pristine); warming via infrared-reflective covers; Optimum Moisture uses constant soil moisture with controlled watering.
  - Biodiversity treatments (baseline and manipulations): pre-treatment plant survey in 2005 using a non-destructive pin-point method across three quadrats per plot; species tracked include Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum spp., Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, Juncus, etc.
  - Nested biodiversity treatments (2011–2012): Moss Removal and Cover Removal subplots within each plot; moss removed and biomass estimated; Cover Removal areas clipped to bare soil; vegetation collected and dried for analysis.

- Data collection, metadata, QA, and governance
  - Data collection and integrity: multiple continuous measurements (plant hits per pin, vegetation structure, litter, soil respiration, net ecosystem exchange with soil collars, enzymes and microbial biomass, 14C soil respiration workups, etc.); strict QA steps including double data entry and cross-checks.
  - Temporal scope: baseline data collection before treatments; ongoing monitoring through 2010s with several new treatments added in 2011–2012.
  - Metadata and accessibility notes: extensive methodological details (plot layout, sampling schemes, species codes, and data processing steps); some soil and meteorological data are incomplete or missing; standardization and data sharing are central considerations in this monitoring context.
  - Data management considerations: site designed for automated, remote data collection; open data sharing is challenged by metadata gaps and data governance needs.

- Plant biodiversity measurements and treatments
  - Baseline survey (2005) using pin-point method across three quadrats per plot; 300 pin touches per plot; species identified and tallied with height-related structure captured.
  - Data quality controls: transcription checks, species code validation, and normalization for missing pins (adjusted to maintain 300 pins per plot).
  - Species included: Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angistifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus spp.

- Extreme events and ecological responses
  - Vapourer moth outbreak (Orgyia antiqua) observed in eruption around 2010; monitoring included defoliation assessment and signs of fungal infection.
  - Defoliation varied by plot and treatment; Vaccinium myrtillus most affected; other vegetation showed varying levels of impact; several plots recorded high defoliation (up to 100%).

- Notable data gaps and challenges for monitoring framework authors
  - Incomplete or missing site data (e.g., several MAT and soil parameters; some soil horizon data and chemistry values are missing or unspecified).
  - Metadata gaps hinder reuse and cross-site comparability; data governance and openness require careful handling of provenance and quality assurance.
  - Data transformation needs (e.g., transforming sparse or inconsistent soil data, aligning plots and treatments over time).
  - Balancing data sharing with protection of sensitive information and ensuring timely access to data across organisations (silos barrier).
  - Translating complex, multi-factor ecological responses into clear, policy-relevant outputs for land managers.
