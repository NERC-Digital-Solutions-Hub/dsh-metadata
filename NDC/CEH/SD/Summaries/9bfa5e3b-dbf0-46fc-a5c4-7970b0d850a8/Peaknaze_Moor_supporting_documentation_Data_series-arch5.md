# Peaknaze Moor field site Supporting documentation for data

## Aims of the project
- Evaluate how upland moorland ecosystems recover from nitrogen deposition reductions and how climate change interacts with this recovery.
- Use a manipulated Peak District moor site to simulate future pollution and climate scenarios and assess responses of plants, animals, and soil.
- Inform land managers on when local action is effective and when national solutions may be required.

## Site information

### Area and site history
- Location: Peaknaze Moor, Peak District, England; Atlantic Heathland, 208.45 hectares; elevation ~433 m; coordinates 53.47 N, 1.91 W.
- Ecological status: unfavourable recovering dwarf shrub heath – upland.
- History: large area burnt in 2003; sheep grazing removed (2004); fenced and allowed to recover (2004 onwards).
- Purpose: automated manipulation experimental site producing potential climate change scenarios; established 2006 with replicated pollution and climate treatments; powered by solar/wind with automated retractable roofs.

### Field site and vegetation
- Typical community: Eriophorum vaginatum blanket mire with Calluna vulgaris, Cladonia spp., Vaccinium myrtillus, Deschampsia flexuosa.
- Dominant flora: Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum vaginatum/angustifolium, Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulgaris.
- Growing season: May–September.
- Plot layout: 15 plots (5 m × 4 m) per site with a 3 m × 3 m experimental core and edge buffer; 0.5 m × 0.5 m quadrats within plots for measurements.

### Climate and soils context
- Meteorological data available for several years, with some 2006 values not determined; 2007–2012 data include mean annual temperature and rainfall.
- Soils labeled as organo-mineral; variable across site with limited complete measurements for some properties (e.g., C/N not fully determined; pH around 4.1–4.3; cation exchange capacity and base saturation variable and sometimes missing).

### Data collection structure
- Pollutant loading (2006–2007): ~14 kg N/ha/yr; sulfur deposition ~27 kg/ha/yr (average of 2006–2008).
- Plot and quadrat sampling: destruction/harvests, soil respiration chambers, lysimeters, litterfall, net ecosystem exchange, radiocarbon soil efflux sampling, soil/vegetation chemistry, and annual plant growth measurements.

## Treatments

### Climate change and pollution treatments
- Design: three blocks; each with four treatments plus untreated Control.
- Treatments initiated: Drought and Warming in 2010; Pristine and Optimum Moisture in 2012.
- Methodology: retractable transparent roofs exclude rainfall to create Drought; rain removal plus simulated polluted rain for Pristine; reflective night covers for Warming; Optimum Moisture uses real-time soil moisture monitoring and controlled watering to maintain target moisture.
- Baseline data collection continued during treatment setup.

### Plant biodiversity treatments
- Baseline biodiversity survey (2005) across plots using non-destructive pin-point method in three quadrats per plot (300 pin hits per plot).
- Data capture: species hits per height, with separate codes for each species; double-checked transcription and quality controls to ensure accuracy and completeness.
- Species tracked: Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus.

### Nested biodiversity treatments (2012)
- Plot subdivision: each plot split into Control, Moss Removal, and Cover Removal subplots.
- Moss Removal: quantify moss vs. debris; collect and weigh to determine moss proportion; biomass removed calculated and corrected for debris.
- Cover Removal: clip vegetation within randomly placed squares to bare soil; vegetation dried and processed.
- Biomass removed recorded per subplot for establishment phase (details provided in the dataset).

## Extreme events - vapourer outbreak and fungal infection
- Monitoring for Orgyia antiqua (vapourer) defoliation and fungal infections conducted in February 2010.
- Defoliation and infection percentages tracked by plot and treatment.
- Outbreak primarily affected Vaccinium myrtillus; other species showed variable or limited signs of herbivory.
- Data presented as stage-wise defoliation percentages across Control, Moss Removal, and Cover Removal subplots over multiple quadrats and years.

## Data management and governance (Data Steward perspective)

- Data types and datasets
  - Climate: growing-season and annual mean temperatures; rainfall.
  - Soils: texture, pH, carbon, nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, base saturation, bulk density, depth profiles (where available).
  - Treatments: drought, warming, pristine, optimum moisture; moss removal; cover removal.
  - Biodiversity: pin-point species composition per plot/quadrat; species codes; tallies by height.
  - Extreme events: defoliation and infection records by plot and treatment.
  - Additional measurements: soil respiration, litterfall, net ecosystem exchange, radiocarbon sampling, and enzymatic/microbial analyses (as referenced in measurements timeline).

- Data collection methods and QA
  - Pin-point method with fixed quadrats; standardized counting and height recording; routine data transcription to Excel with validation steps.
  - Use of baseline calibration (e.g., destructive harvests) and routine checks for missing pins, data input codes, and total pin counts (e.g., 300 per plot) with ratio-based adjustments for missing data.
  - Documentation of measurement codes and species lists to enable reproducibility.

- Metadata, documentation, and provenance
  - Documented author and version: Sabine Reinsch; Version 1, 11/10/2016.
  - Site metadata: precise location, elevation, habitat type, and vegetation community.
  - Experiment design: plot layout, block structure, treatment initiation dates, and methods (e.g., retractable roofs, moisture control).

- Data availability and sharing
  - Plan to upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue data holdings; ongoing documentation of work performed on datasets.
  - Emphasis on maintaining up-to-date data access while respecting treatment-specific limitations and potential embargoes or proprietary constraints (where applicable).

- Data quality, limitations, and considerations
  - Incomplete meteorological data for 2006; several soil and chemical measurements marked as not determined or missing; variability across site is high.
  - Some values shown as "." or not determined in soils characteristics; indicates gaps that should be captured in metadata.
  - Complex, multi-component treatments and large datasets with long temporal scope require careful versioning and consistent coding.

- Archiving and governance recommendations
  - Adopt consistent dataset naming, variable definitions, units, and coding schemes across years and treatments.
  - Maintain linkage between datasets (climate, soils, biodiversity, biomass, and extreme events) via shared plot IDs, treatment codes, and geospatial references.
  - Provide a data dictionary and codebook for species codes, measurement techniques, and QA procedures.
  - Ensure provenance trails for any data transformations (e.g., moss removal corrections) and detailed method descriptions to support reproducibility and re-use.
