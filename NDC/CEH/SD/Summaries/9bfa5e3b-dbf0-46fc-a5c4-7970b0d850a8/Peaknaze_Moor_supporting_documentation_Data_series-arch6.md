# Peaknaze Moor field site Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Documentation for a field manipulation experiment on Peaknaze Moor to study recovery of upland moorland ecosystems under nitrogen deposition reductions and climate change.
- Aims to generate data on plant, soil, and ecosystem responses to pollution and climate treatments, enabling data-driven land management decisions.

## Aims of the project
- Assess how moorland communities recover from pollution as nitrogen deposition changes, and how climate change interactions modulate this recovery.
- Replicate future pollution and climate scenarios to compare against baseline conditions.
- Inform land managers about when local action is effective and when broader solutions are required.
- Enable end-users to explore data via self-serve outputs and to promote data-driven management.

## Site information
- Location: Peaknaze Moor, Peak District, England (53.47 N, 1.91 W; elevation ~433 m).
- Size and status: 208.45 hectares; Atlantic Heathland, unfavourable recovering dwarf shrub heath (EN 2004).
- History: 75% burned in a wildfire (Apr 2003); sheep grazing ceased (Feb 2004); fenced and left to recover (from 2004).
- Habitat: typical blanket mire with Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium, Vaccinium myrtillus, Calluna vulagris.
- Growing season: May–September.
- Site infrastructure: automated retractable roof climate/pollution manipulation system powered by solar/wind; established 2006 with replicated treatments.

## Meteorological and soil data context
- Meteorological data (2006–2012) include yearly measurements for mean annual temperature (MAT) and rainfall; growing-season MAT typically around 12.5–13.1°C, with annual rainfall from ~964 to ~1703 mm. Some early-year data are Not Determined.
- Soils: organo-mineral soils with pH around 4.1–4.3 in H2O; variable organic content and nutrients; several soil properties (e.g., bulk density, carbon and nitrogen, cation exchange capacity) recorded but with substantial gaps and variability across the site.
- Data notes: partial data coverage and gaps; site provides detailed soil and plot-scale measurements intended for integration with biodiversity and climate data.

## Experimental design and data collection

### Climate change and pollution treatments
- Experimental layout: 3 blocks, each with four treatments plus an untreated Control.
- Treatments and timing:
  - Drought and Warming began in 2010.
  - Pristine (polluted rain exclusion) and Optimum Moisture began in 2012.
- Methods:
  - Retractable roof system excludes nitrogen inputs with rain exclusion to simulate drought.
  - Polluted rain introduced to simulate Pristine conditions using a tipping-bucket-based rainfall capture and spraying system.
  - Warming achieved with nighttime reflective covers to reduce infrared heat loss.
  - Optimum Moisture maintained via continuous soil moisture monitoring and controlled irrigation.

### Plant biodiversity treatments
- Baseline plant survey (2005) across plots using non-destructive pin-point method in three quadrats per plot (300 pins per plot total).
- Data collection and QA:
  - Species presence recorded at hit height; multiple hits of the same species at a given height counted once.
  - Transcriptions double-checked to prevent typos; pin counts and species codes validated; missing pins adjusted proportionally to 300.
- Species tracked (example codes): Nardus stricta, Deschampsia flexuosa, Eriophorum angistifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris, Empetrum nigrum, Vaccinium myrtillus, Juncus.

### Nested biodiversity treatments (2012)
- Subplot design within each plot: Control, Moss Removal, Cover Removal (three subplots per plot).
- Moss Removal: total moss biomass removed measured by subsamples, accounting for debris; biomass corrected for proportion of moss in samples.
- Cover Removal: vegetation clipped to bare soil within defined squares; samples dried for analysis.
- Moss and vegetation processing performed to quantify biomass removal and moss cover changes.

### Data collection details and outputs
- Plot layout: 15 plots, each 5 m x 4 m; a 3 m x 3 m experimental area; buffer zones at edges.
- Sampling framework:
  - Quadrats: 0.5 m x 0.5 m within each plot for targeted measurements (destructive harvests, soil respiration chambers, lysimeters, litterfall, net ecosystem exchange, and other soil/vegetation samples).
  - Permanent bases and grids ensure consistent yearly sampling.
- Extreme events and disturbances (2010–2012):
  - Vapourer (Orgyia antiqua) outbreak with widespread defoliation, mainly affecting Vaccinium myrtillus; fungal infections also observed.
  - Defoliation percentages recorded per quadrat across plots, highlighting differential impacts by treatment and species.

## Key data products and contents
- Pollution and climate treatment metadata (block, treatment type, start year, management method).
- Meteorological context data (MAT, rainfall) by year and season.
- Plant biodiversity data (pin-point tallies by species and height, QA-adjusted totals).
- Nested biodiversity treatment outputs (moss biomass, moss removal proportion, clipped vegetation biomass).
- Soil and site characteristics (pH, texture proxies, organic matter, nutrient indicators, cation exchange properties; many fields variably populated).
- Disturbance data (defoliation percentages by quadrat; signs of vapourer outbreak and fungal infections).

## How this supports data use and management
- Enables cross-cut analyses of pollution reduction and climate change interactions on plant communities, soil processes, and ecosystem recovery.
- Provides a robust, self-serve data framework through standardized plotting, sampling, and QA procedures.
- Supports land-management decision-making by illustrating potential responses to mitigation strategies and extreme events.
- Highlights data completeness gaps to guide future data collection and integration efforts.
