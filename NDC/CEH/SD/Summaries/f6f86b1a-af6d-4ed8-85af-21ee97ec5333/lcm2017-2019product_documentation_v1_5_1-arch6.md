# The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017, 2018 and 2019 v1.5.1

## Overview

- UKCEH released three new national land cover maps: LCM2017, LCM2018 and LCM2019.
- Maps contain 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats) and are generated automatically using Bootstrap Training plus Random Forest (RF) classification.
- Input data are Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (TOA reflectance) plus 20m Context Rasters; classification Scenes are created to reduce spectral confusion.
- Objective: rapid production of UK-wide land cover maps with annual updates, enabling timely analysis and change detection.
- Validation and quality: visual checks and formal validation were performed; UK-scale validation against countryside survey 2019 data, National Forest Inventory data, IACS, and bespoke validation points. Overall accuracy around 78–80% for 2017–2019; outputs are intended as best-available indicators with ongoing improvement planned.

## What’s in the data (Product Content)

- Dataset family and extents
  - 42 datasets total (GB and Northern Ireland), duplicated for each year.
  - Coordinate systems: Great Britain in British National Grid (EPSG:27700); Northern Ireland in Irish Grid (EPSG:29903).
- 20m Classified Pixels
  - New addition in this release; RF classification results for each 20m pixel.
  - Band 1: nominated land cover class; Band 2: per-pixel confidence (0–100) for the nominated class.
  - Preserves high detail; not generalised by the Land Parcel Framework.
- Land Parcels
  - Generated by intersecting 20m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Attributes include gid, hist (per-class pixel frequencies), mode, purity, confidence, stdev, n.
  - Note: gid values differ from LCM2015; parcel comparisons use gid only for cross-year alignment.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcels
  - 3-band raster: band 1 = modal class (_mode); band 2 = parcel-averaged confidence (_conf); band 3 = parcel purity (_purity).
- 1km Raster Datasets (derived from Land Parcels)
  - 1km Percent Cover: 21-band raster (per-class percentages).
  - 1km Percent Aggregate Cover: 10-band raster (aggregate class percentages).
  - 1km Dominant Cover: 1-band raster (dominant class per 1km cell).
  - 1km Dominant Aggregate Cover: 1-band raster (dominant aggregate class per 1km cell).
- Dataset scope
  - GB version and NI version provided for each dataset/year, enabling cross-region comparisons and change detection.

## How the data were produced

- Bootstrap Training
  - Fully automatic, using historic LCMs to create a training set for the RF classifier without fresh field samples.
  - Training data drawn from UKCEH LCM2015 bootstrap using parcels with purity ≥ 99%.
  - Future plans: bootstrap from majority signals across multiple years (e.g., 2017–2019 for 2020 map).
- Random Forest classification
  - RF classifier trained with balanced sampling: 10,000 samples per class per Classification Scene.
  - Production uses bespoke software integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL.
- Classification Scenes and processing
  - GB: 100x100 km overlapping tiles; 74 Classification Scenes per year used to cover the GB land surface.
  - NI: a single 43-band (36 spectral + 7 context) scene per year due to smaller area.
  - Overlaps can cause multiple classifications for the same area; visual inspection selected the best results for the final cut.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Maintains the same parcel geometry as LCM2015 (approx. 0.5 ha MMU) but with reorganised storage and new indices for faster processing.
  - Frame enables consistent parcel-based summaries and change detection.
- Context rasters and Seasonal Composite Images
  - 20m Context Rasters provide terrain, proximity, and land-cover context (e.g., height, slope, distance to roads, coast, freshwater, etc.).
  - Seasonal Composite Images are generated from Sentinel-2 data (TOA) per season; some cloud gaps are represented as nulls, but the classifier tolerates partial data.
- Data quality and future proofing
  - No manual corrections were applied this cycle to maintain automation and speed; visual checks and validation still performed.
  - The team plans to explore broader satellite inputs (e.g., Sentinel-1) to fill potential seasonal gaps.

## Relationships and classification framework

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned with 1990–2015 maps, based on UK BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson 2000).
  - Clarifications on terminology and class derivations provided in Appendices; communities map UKCEH classes to BAP Broad Habitats with notes on detection and spectral limitations.
- Data structure and metadata
  - Tables describe dataset extents, pixel sizes, class counts (21 classes; 10 aggregate), and naming conventions.
  - The Land Parcel framework provides per-parcel statistics (hist, mode, purity, conf, stdev, n) to support detailed parcel-level analyses.

## Data format, display, and examples

- Pixel and parcel representations
  - 20m Classified Pixels preserve intricate features; 25m parcels provide a summarized view with confidence and purity.
  - 1km rasters summarize parcel-level information to broader scales for easier regional assessments.
- Visual representations
  - RGB color mappings recommended for each UKCEH Land Cover Class are provided (Appendix 3) to support consistent display across platforms.
- Example figures
  - Figures illustrate how 20m Classified Pixels compare with Land Parcels and 25m Rasterised Land Parcels, highlighting the trade-off between detail and generalisation.

## Validation and accuracy

- Validation approach
  - 22,325 validation points collected from multiple sources (Countryside Survey 2019, National Forest Inventory, IACS, bespoke validation points).
  - Cross-year validation benchmarks show:
    - LCM2017: ~78.6% overall accuracy
    - LCM2018: ~79.6% overall accuracy
    - LCM2019: ~79.4% overall accuracy
- Notes on interpretation
  - Validation data are not absolute truth; they come from datasets with different class structures and required conversions to UKCEH classes.
  - Approximate 80% correspondence is considered strong for an automatic, annually produced 21-class map; expectations for accuracy may improve with methodological refinements.

## Practical considerations for users (Data Support perspective)

- Data integration
  - For cross-year or cross-region analyses, use gid for cross-year parcel comparisons (note gid mismatch with LCM2015; use parcel overlap for spatial comparisons).
- Data use caveats
  - 20m Classified Pixels retain detailed features; 25m and 1km products generalise information, which is useful for trend analysis and regional assessments.
  - Some spectral confusion remains, especially among spectrally similar habitats; context rasters and seasonal information help mitigate misclassifications.
- Access and reference
  - Datasets are provided in GB and NI formats; users should refer to Appendix 5 for the full dataset list and naming conventions.
  - Coordinate systems and extents are specified for accurate GIS integration.
- Future improvements
  - Potential expansion to include more seasons or additional data sources (e.g., Sentinel-1) and refined bootstrapping strategies to improve accuracy and resilience to cloud cover.
