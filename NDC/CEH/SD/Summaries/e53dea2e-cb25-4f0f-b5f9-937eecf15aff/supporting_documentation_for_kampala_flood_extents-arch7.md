# Supporting documentation for Kampala Flood Extents

## Overview
- Flood extents for Kampala district generated by simulating rainfall events over a 5 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a 2D fully hydrodynamic model (Glenis et al., 2018).
- DEM sourced from Makerere University; rainfall events sampled across multiple depths and durations.
- Infiltration accounted for within green areas using spatial data from Makerere.
- Maximum depths converted to extents using different thresholds; extents simplified with Douglas-Peucker algorithm (tolerance 5 m) to reduce file size.

## Data Product and Access
- GeoPackage containing polygons that describe flooding extents above a chosen threshold for each rainfall depth and duration.
- Web viewer for the extents available at: http://shear.ncl.ac.uk/flood
- Source code for the project downloadable from: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3949902

## Data Processing and Modelling Details
- Modelling approach: 2D finite-volume hydrodynamic model representing buildings, green space, and interventions (Glenis, Kutija & Kilsby, 2018).
- Process includes converting maximum water depths to extents using defined thresholds and incorporating infiltration in green areas.

## GeoPackage Contents and Field Units
- The GeoPackage includes polygons for flooding extents defined by:
  - Threshold: flood depth threshold (units: meters) used to define flooded areas from a grid of maximum water depth.
  - Rainfall: total rainfall depth during the event (units: millimeters).
  - Duration: duration of the rainfall event (units: seconds).
- These fields and their descriptions are summarized in Table 1 of the documentation.

## Practical Considerations for GIS Specialists
- Each polygon corresponds to a specific combination of rainfall depth, duration, and threshold, enabling multiple map layers to be created for comparative visualization.
- The 5 m Douglas-Peucker simplification helps manage file sizes for web or desktop GIS workflows without substantial loss of spatial fidelity.
- Useful for policy analysis, planning flood risk communication, and integrating with other spatial datasets (e.g., buildings, green spaces) to understand exposure.
