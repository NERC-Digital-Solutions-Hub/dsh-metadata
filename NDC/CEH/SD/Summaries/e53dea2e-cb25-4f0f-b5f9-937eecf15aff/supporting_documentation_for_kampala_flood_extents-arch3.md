# Supporting documentation for Kampala Flood Extents

- What was produced
  - Flood extents for Kampala district generated by simulating rainfall events over a 5-meter resolution Digital Elevation Model (DEM) using a fully hydrodynamic 2D model.
  - The approach represents urban features (buildings, green space, and interventions) and uses rainfall scenarios across a range of depths and durations.

- Data sources and modelling approach
  - DEM: 5m DEM obtained from Makerere University.
  - Hydrodynamic modelling: 2D finite-volume hydrodynamic model (Glenis, Kutija & Kilsby, 2018) to simulate rainfall-driven flooding.
  - Infiltration: Effects included within green areas using spatial data from Makerere University.
  - Modelling system: Described as a fully hydrodynamic urban flood modelling system that accounts for buildings, green space, and interventions.

- Data processing and outputs
  - Conversion to extents: Maximum water depths converted into flooded extents using defined thresholds.
  - Simplification: Extents simplified with the Douglas-Peucker algorithm (tolerance 5m) to reduce file size.
  - Data product: A GeoPackage containing polygons describing flooded extents above a threshold for each rainfall depth and duration.
  - Metadata in dataset: Fields include Threshold (units: m; description of flood definition), Rainfall (units: mm; total rainfall), and Duration (units: s; rainfall event duration).

- Data structure and accessibility
  - User-facing interface: Web interface available to view the flood extents at http://shear.ncl.ac.uk/flood.
  - Data and code availability: GeoPackage with the extents; source code available for download via the provided Zenodo DOI (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3949902).
  - Documentation: Field units and descriptions are provided in a tabular metadata (Table 1) accompanying the GeoPackage.

- Reproducibility and governance considerations
  - Provenance and transparency: Modelling approach, data sources, and the ability to view and download the code/database support reproducibility.
  - Data sharing: Extents, methodology, and code are publicly accessible, facilitating reuse in monitoring frameworks.
  - Metadata clarity: Explicit unit definitions and descriptions for key fields (threshold, rainfall, duration) to support interpretation and integration with other datasets.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle relevant to environmental health monitoring: data sourcing, modelling, data transformation (simplification), product generation, and dissemination.
  - Provides a reproducible workflow and openly available outputs that can inform policy decisions, risk assessment, and future monitoring iterations.
  - Highlights the importance of metadata clarity (units and descriptions) for interoperability and governance in monitoring products.
