# Supporting documentation

- The data comprise measurements of the soluble, adsorbed and organically bound 99Tc concentrations in a set of soils following experimental addition of 99TcO4 in the laboratory and incubation under controlled conditions for 897 days.

## Objective and significance
- Addresses long-term environmental impact of technetium-99 (99Tc), a long-lived radionuclide from spent nuclear fuel and wastes.
- Aims to understand long-term bioavailability of 99Tc to plants in aerobic soils after contamination, to inform models of environmental health and policy decisions.
- Provides a dataset to quantify kinetics of 99Tc transformation as a function of soil properties and land use (arable, grassland, moorland/woodland) under temperate, aerobic conditions.

## Experimental design and scope
- Soil collection: Twenty topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from central England, with four sub-samples per site combined to form composite samples (~3 kg field-moist soil).
- Land-use representation: Arable (multiple sites), grassland (several), moorland/woodland (several).
- Physicochemical characterization: pH (via CaCl2 extraction) and organic carbon (via CNS analyzer).

## 99Tc contamination and incubation
- Contamination: 99Tc added as NH4 99TcO4 to achieve ~108 µg 99Tc per kg dry soil, using ~3970 kBq total activity per soil.
- Microcosms: Each soil divided into three bottles (microcosms) with a small lid hole for gas exchange and to minimize water loss; incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0°C for 897 days (Nov 2014–May 2017) at University of Nottingham.

## Sequential extraction and fractionation of 99Tc
- Analytical approach: Three-step sequential extraction to quantify pools of 99Tc.
  - Soluble 99Tc: extracted with 20 mL 0.01 M KNO3 for 16 h (simulates soil pore water).
  - Specifically adsorbed 99Tc: extracted with 20 mL 0.16 M KH2PO4 for 16 h (competitor for anions on Fe/Al/Mn oxides).
  - Organically bound 99Tc: extracted with 10% tetramethylammonium hydroxide at 90°C for 14 h (dissolves humic/fulvic-acid–associated 99Tc).
- Processing: Centrifugation and collection of supernatants after each step; data reported as µg 99Tc per kg dry weight (DW).

## Analytical methodology
- Instrumentation: iCAP-Q ICP-MS with collision-cell mode using helium, 10 ms dwell time, 150 scans per sample.
- Sample introduction: Autosampler with ASXpress rapid uptake and PFA-ST nebulizer.
- Quality control: Internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir) added; calibration with NIST SRM 4288B 99TcO4− standard (0.5–25 µg L−1).
- Data handling: Results organized by soil and incubation day, expressed as µg 99Tc kg−1 DW for each pool (soluble, adsorbed, organic).

## Intended application
- Enables quantification of 99Tc transformation kinetics in aerobic soils as a function of soil properties and land use.
- Provides data to support development of models for long-term 99Tc bioavailability in temperate, aerobic soils, informing environmental monitoring and policy decisions.
