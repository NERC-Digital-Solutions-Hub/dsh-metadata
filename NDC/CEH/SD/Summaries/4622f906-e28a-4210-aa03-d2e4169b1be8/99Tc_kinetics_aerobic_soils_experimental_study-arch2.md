- Objective and scope
  - Investigate long-term transformations and bioavailability of technetium-99 (99Tc) in aerobic soils under temperate conditions.
  - Use a laboratory incubation of soils contaminated with 99TcO4 to quantify how 99Tc partitions among soluble, adsorbed, and organically bound pools over time.
  - Generate data to inform models of long-term 99Tc bioavailability in aerobic soils and how soil properties and land use influence kinetics.

- Study design and soils
  - 20 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from central England, representing arable, grassland, moorland, and woodland uses.
  - Soils characterized for pH and organic carbon content; pH ranges from strongly acidic to near neutral/alkaline; organic carbon ranges from ~1.7% to 38.6%.

- 99Tc contamination and incubation
  - Soils contaminated with 99TcO4 at approximately 108 µg 99Tc per kg dry soil using a solution of NH4 99TcO4.
  - Each soil sample divided into three microcosms (approx. 1.5 kg soil per bottle) with gas exchange holes to maintain aerobic conditions.
  - Incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0 °C for 897 days (about 2.5 years), enabling study of long-term transformations.

- Sequential extraction scheme (to fractionate 99Tc pools)
  - Step 1: Soluble 99Tc extracted with 20 mL 0.01 M KNO3 for 16 h (mimics soil pore water).
  - Step 2: Specifically adsorbed 99Tc extracted with 20 mL 0.16 M KH2PO4 for 16 h (competes for adsorption on Fe/Al/Mn oxides).
  - Step 3: Organically bound 99Tc extracted with 10% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide and heating at 90 °C for 14 h (mobilizes humic/fulvic bound Tc).

- Analytical methods
  - 99Tc quantified by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q) with collision-cell using He, 10 ms dwell time, 150 scans per sample.
  - Sample introduction via autosampler with rapid uptake module; internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir) added to measure matrix effects.
  - Calibration with a radioactive standard (NIST SRM 4288B) across multiple concentrations.
  - Quality-control and data integrity supported by established calibration and standard addition measurements.

- Data outputs and potential use
  - For each soil and time point, concentrations of soluble, adsorbed, and organic Tc reported in µg 99Tc kg⁻¹ dry weight.
  - Data enable quantification of Tc transformation kinetics as a function of soil properties and land use (arable, grassland, moorland/woodland).
  - Dataset supports development of models predicting long-term Tc bioavailability in aerobic soils under temperate conditions.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring and policy
  - Provides a standardized approach to assess long-term mobility and plant bioavailability of 99Tc in aerobic soils, informing risk assessments related to radioactive waste disposal.
  - The approach and datasets can be linked to broader monitoring programs to compare soil systems and track temporal trends in radionuclide bioavailability.

- Development and documentation notes
  - Comprehensive soil sampling, characterization, and controlled incubation conditions documented to support reproducibility.
  - Detailed sequential extraction protocol and rigorous analytical methodology described to enable data reuse and cross-study comparisons.
