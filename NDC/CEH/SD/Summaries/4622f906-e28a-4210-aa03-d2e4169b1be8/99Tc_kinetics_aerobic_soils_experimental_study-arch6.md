# Supporting documentation

- This dataset reports measurements of soluble, adsorbed, and organically bound 99Tc concentrations in soils after laboratory addition of 99TcO4 and long-term incubation to 897 days.
- Objective: understand long-term bioavailability of 99Tc to plants in aerobic soils under temperate conditions, informing models of environmental risk after disposal of radioactive wastes.

## Experimental design and samples

- 20 topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from central England, representing arable, grassland, moorland, and woodland land uses.
- For each soil: composite of ~3 kg field-moist soil assembled from sub-samples within ~5 m²; sieved to <4 mm.
- 99Tc contamination: 3970 kBq NH499TcO4 solution added to ~1.5 kg soil to achieve about 108 μg 99Tc per kg dry soil; mixed to uniformity.
- Microcosms: soils divided into three bottles per soil (individual incubation units) with gas-exchange lid holes; incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0 °C for 897 days (Nov 2014–May 2017).
- Soils characterized for pH (CaCl2 extraction) and organic carbon (C content) using CNS analyzer.

## Sequential extraction and data collected

- A three-step sequential extraction to fractionate 99Tc in each soil microcosm:
  1) Soluble 99Tc with 0.01 M KNO3 (mimics soil pore water), 16 h shaking.
  2) Specifically adsorbed 99Tc with 0.16 M KH2PO4, 16 h shaking.
  3) Organically bound 99Tc with 10% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMH) at 90 °C for 14 h.
- For each time point and soil, approximately 4 g of soil per extraction were analyzed.
- Data are reported as μg 99Tc per kg dry weight (DW) for each pool (soluble, adsorbed, organic).

## Analytical methods

- 99Tc quantification by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q, Thermo Fisher) with collision-cell He, 10 ms dwell time, 150 scans per sample.
- Sample introduction via autosampler with rapid uptake module and PFA nebulizer.
- Internal standards: Ge, Rh and Ir in HNO3, plus Re and Ir in TMH-based matrix.
- Calibration using Radioactive Standard NIST SRM 4288B (99TcO4− in 0.001 M KOH; 31.55 kBq g−1).
- Quality control references: multiple calibration levels (0.5, 1, 5, 10, 25 μg L−1).

## Dataset content and structure

- 20 soils with varied land use and spatial coordinates; accompanying Table 1 provides soil location, land use, latitude/longitude, organic C (%), and pH.
- For each soil and time point: measurements of soluble, adsorbed, and organically bound 99Tc pools (μg 99Tc kg−1 DW); data organized by incubation day and pool.
- Notable soil contrasts include wide pH range (approximately 3.41 to 8.00) and organic carbon ranging up to 38.6% in certain moorland soils.

## Quality, provenance, and limitations

- Controlled laboratory incubation under consistent temperature and darkness to isolate soil-specific transformation kinetics.
- Use of a well-characterized calibration standard and internal standards enhances measurement reliability.
- The dataset focuses on aerobic, temperate soil conditions; results may not directly extrapolate to anaerobic or non-temperate environments.
- Extraction-based fractions reflect operationally defined pools subject to the chosen reagents and conditions; actual speciation in situ may be more complex.

## Potential uses and applications

- Quantify and compare the kinetics of 99Tc transformations across diverse soil types and land uses.
- Develop and calibrate models of long-term 99Tc bioavailability in aerobic soils under temperate climates.
- Explore relationships between soil properties (pH, organic carbon) and the distribution of 99Tc fractions over time.
- Support risk assessment for 99Tc mobility following disposal of radioactive wastes and inform remediation or monitoring strategies.
- Provide a reusable data product for dashboards or pivot-table analyses linking soil characteristics to Tc speciation dynamics.
