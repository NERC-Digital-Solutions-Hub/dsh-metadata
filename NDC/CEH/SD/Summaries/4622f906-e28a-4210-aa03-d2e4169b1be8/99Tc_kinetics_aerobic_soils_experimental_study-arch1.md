## Objective and significance
- Technetium-99 (99Tc) is long-lived and can migrate as the soluble TcO4− anion, raising long-term environmental concerns after nuclear waste disposal.
- The study investigates long-term bioavailability of 99Tc to plants in aerobic soils, using a laboratory incubation over 897 days.
- Goals include quantifying transformations of 99Tc as soluble, adsorbed, and organically bound pools across soils with different land uses (arable, grassland, moorland/woodland) to inform models of long-term bioavailability in temperate, aerobic soils.

## Experimental design and soils
- Twenty topsoil samples (0–15 cm) from central England, collected as composites (~3 kg per sample) from multiple locations.
- Soils characterized for pH (CaCl2 extraction) and organic carbon content (FLASH CNS analyser); land uses include arable, grassland, and moorland/woodland.
- Incubation: soils contaminated with 99Tc in the laboratory, placed in microcosms (three bottles per soil) incubated in darkness at 10.0 ± 1.0°C for 897 days.
- Microcosms designed with a small lid hole to allow gas exchange while limiting water loss.

## 99Tc addition and incubation setup
- Contamination with 99Tc achieved by adding ~3970 kBq NH4 99TcO4 in water to achieve a concentration of 108 µg 99Tc per kg dry soil.
- Uniform mixing ensured by mechanical blending; three microcosm bottles used per soil.

## Sequential extraction scheme
- Periodic sampling used a three-step sequential extraction to partition 99Tc into:
  - Soluble 99Tc: extracted with 20 mL 0.01 M KNO3 (mimics soil pore water) for 16 h.
  - Specifically adsorbed 99Tc: extracted with 20 mL 0.16 M KH2PO4 for 16 h.
  - Organically bound 99Tc: extracted with 10% tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide (TMAH) at 90°C for 14 h.
- Each step involves centrifugation and collection of the supernatant; results expressed as µg 99Tc kg−1 dry weight.
- The scheme provides a flow diagram and detailed column descriptions for each soil.

## Analytical methods
- 99Tc in extracts measured by ICP-MS (iCAP-Q, Thermo Fisher) with a collision cell (He) and kinetic energy discrimination.
- Instrument parameters: 10 ms dwell time, 150 scans per sample; sample introduction via autosampler with PFA nebuliser and rapid uptake module.
- Internal standards (Ge, Rh, Ir) added to sample stream; calibration using NIST SRM 4288B (99TcO4− in 0.001 M KOH) across multiple concentrations.
- Data quality supported by internal standards and matrix separation via collision/reaction cell technology.

## Data potential and applications
- The dataset enables evaluation of how 99Tc transforms between soluble, adsorbed, and organically complexed pools over time and across soil types and land uses.
- Enables development of kinetic models and correlations between 99Tc pools and soil properties (pH, organic carbon, land use, etc.).
- Supports predictions of long-term bioavailability of 99Tc in aerobic soils under temperate conditions, informing risk assessments and management strategies for radioactive waste disposal environments.

## Additional notes
- The study contributes to understanding long-term mobility of 99Tc in soils and provides a structured, time-resolved dataset across diverse soil types for modelling and comparative analyses.
