# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

- Purpose: One data file used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist to study trait-based dynamics of a top predator under climate change. Dataset contains fecundity information for female pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, collected from 1963 to 2002.
- Scope: Files document fecundity (number of eggs) alongside body size data for individual female pike.

## Data Content

- Format: CSV (81 KB)
- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year of capture
  - LENGTH: Fork length at capture (cm; measured to 1 mm)
  - EGGS: Estimated number of eggs for the individual female
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (approximate center grid reference provided)
- Species: Esox lucius (Pike), females only
- Related metadata/datasets: Metadata record for Pike 1944-2002; Pike Growth Data 1944-1995; Pike Survival Data 1953-1990; Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

## Sampling Design and Methods

- Basins: Windermere Lake north and south basins
- Sampling method: Gill netting with variations prior to 1982; standardized since 1982
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Net size: 40 m length x 3 m depth
  - Sampling period: October to December
  - Depth: approximately 4–5 m
  - Sites: 10 sites per basin; 5 nets active at any time
  - Coverage: Systematic coverage with site rotation; each site fished for two weeks per season
- Sampling effort:
  - 1982–1989: ~348 net days per year (distributed between basins)
  - From 1990: ~240 net days per year (distributed between basins)

## Measurements and Quality Control

- In the laboratory:
  - Length: measured (fork length to 1 mm)
  - Weight: measured (to 100 g)
  - Sex: determined
  - Age: determined from left opercular bone, birth date assumed to be 1 April
  - Fecundity: determined for females following Kipling & Frost (1969)
- Quality control: measurements checked by permutations involving three individuals

## Data Provenance and Usage

- Original data collectors: Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); later collected by CEH and its predecessor IFE since 1989
- Analytical references for Pike data and methods:
  - Frost & Kipling (1959) on aging from opercular bones
  - Kipling & Frost (1969) on fecundity variation
  - Winfield, James & Fletcher (2008) on pike population dynamics in a warming lake
- Context: Part of a broader Windermere fisheries data suite, including growth, survival, and temperature datasets

## Access, Metadata, and Related Datasets

- Related metadata record: Pike 1944-2002 data series
- Related datasets:
  - Pike Growth Data 1944-1995
  - Pike Survival Data 1953-1990
  - Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002
- Usage considerations: Dataset is publicly described with metadata; standardization began in 1982, which may influence longitudinal analyses across the full time span

## Considerations for Environmental Monitoring and Policy

- Provides a long-running, female-specific fecundity dataset linked to body size, enabling trait-based analyses in a climate-context framework
- Useful for understanding reproductive potential changes over time in a warming lake system
- Data accessibility may be affected by historical methodological changes prior to standardization in 1982 and by metadata/format considerations
- Supports integration with related datasets (growth, survival, temperature) to inform ecosystem monitoring and management decisions in freshwater systems
