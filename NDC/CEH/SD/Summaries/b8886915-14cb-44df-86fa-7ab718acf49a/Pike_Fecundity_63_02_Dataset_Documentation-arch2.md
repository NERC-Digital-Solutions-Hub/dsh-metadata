# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of female pike (Esox lucius) fecundity (number of eggs) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Time span: 1963–2002; used in the study by Vindenes et al. (2013) on climate change effects in a top freshwater predator.
- Data intended for monitoring environmental health and trait-based responses over time; part of a set of linked pike datasets.

## Data Contents
- File: Pike Fecundity Data 1963_2002.csv
- Format/size: CSV, 81 kb
- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year of capture
  - LENGTH: Fork length of the fish at capture (cm, to 1 mm)
  - EGGS: Estimated number of eggs for the individual female
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria (approx. grid reference SD393960; coordinates provided in metadata)
- Species: Esox lucius (Pike)
- Sample: Only female pike included

## Sampling and Field Methods
- Sampling regime: Pike monitored in the north and south basins by gill netting; long-running design with variations in sites/efforts prior to standardisation.
- Standardised method (since 1982):
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Net dimensions: 40 m × 3 m
  - Deployment: On the bottom, between mid-October and late December, at depths ~4–5 m
  - Sites: 10 sites per basin; five nets per site (netting five nets simultaneously)
  - Schedule: Daylight operations with rotating site coverage; each site fished for two weeks per season
  - Sampling effort: ~348 net days/year (1982–1989) distributed roughly equally between basins
- Post-1989/1990 changes:
  - Since 1990, total annual sampling ~240 net days, still split between basins

## Analytical Methods and Measurements
- Laboratory processing per fish:
  - Measurements: fork length (to 1 mm) and wet weight (to 100 g)
  - Sexing: Determined to focus on females for fecundity
  - Age determination: Left opercular bone; birth date assumed 1 April
  - Fecundity assessment: Females’ egg counts following Kipling & Frost (1969)

## Quality Control and Provenance
- Quality control: Measurements checked by permutations involving three individuals
- Provenance:
  - Initial data collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) (prior to 1989)
  - Since 1989, data collection by CEH and its predecessor IFE
- Metadata and related datasets:
  - Metadata record for the data series available
  - Related datasets include Pike Growth Data (1944–1995), Pike Survival Data (1953–1990), and Windermere Lake Temperature (1944–2002)
