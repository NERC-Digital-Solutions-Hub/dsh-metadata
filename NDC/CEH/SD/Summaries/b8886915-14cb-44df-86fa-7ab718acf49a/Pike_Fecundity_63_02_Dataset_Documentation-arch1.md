# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of female pike (Esox lucius) fecundity (number of eggs) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, UK.
- Collected 1963–2002; originally by the Freshwater Biological Association, later by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- One of the data files used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist on climate-change effects in trait-based dynamics of a top freshwater predator.
- Format: CSV; size approximately 81 KB; metadata and related datasets available.

## Data Content
- Columns: YEAR, LENGTH (fork length in cm to 1 mm), EGGS (estimated eggs per individual, for females).
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, central coordinates OS grid reference SD393960; approximate geographic context provided.
- Species: Esox lucius (Pike); only females included for fecundity.

## Sampling Regime and Collection
- Sampling performed in the Windermere north and south basins via gill netting.
- Since 1982: standardized methodology using 64 mm bar mesh multifilament nets, 40 m x 3 m, set on the bottom, October–December, at about 4–5 m depth, across 10 sites per basin.
- Since 1990: total annual sampling effort ~240 net days, distributed roughly equally between basins.
- Early period (1944–1982) used varying methods; standardization implemented from 1982 onward.

## Analytical Methods and Measurements
- Laboratory measurements: fork length (LENGTH) to 1 mm; wet weight to 100 g; sex determined.
- Ageing: left opercular bone with birth date nominally 1 April (as per Frost & Kipling 1959).
- Fecundity: counted eggs for each female pike (EGGS) following Kipling & Frost (1969).
- Quality control: measurements validated via permutations among three individuals.

## Data Provenance and Related Datasets
- Data originally collected by FBA; since 1989 collected by CEH/IFE.
- Related datasets (metadata links provided):
  - Pike 1944-2002: Metadata record
  - Pike Growth Data 1944-1995
  - Pike Survival Data 1953-1990
  - Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002
- Citation and methodological references accompany the dataset (ageing, fecundity procedures, and standardization papers).

## Potential Analytical Uses
- Analyze fecundity as a function of body size (EGGS vs LENGTH) across years.
- Explore temporal trends in fecundity and potential climate or prey-related effects (in context with growth, survival, and temperature datasets).
- Integrate with Growth and Survival datasets for trait-based life-history modeling under climate scenarios.

## Data Quality and Access Notes
- Data are limited to female pike fecundity data for Windermere Lake; spatial scope is specific to Windermere.
- Measurements are standardized post-1982; careful handling of historical method differences when combining periods.
- Data available as CSV with accompanying metadata and cited procedural references.
