# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of fecundity (number of eggs) for female Pike (Esox lucius) from net sampling.
- Data span: 1963–2002; used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist (Effects of climate change on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems).
- Collected originally by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 collected by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Related metadata and datasets available within the CEH data ecosystem.

## Data content and format
- File: PikeFecundityData1963_2002.csv
- Format: comma separated values (CSV)
- Size: 81 kb
- Columns: YEAR, LENGTH, EGGS
  - YEAR: year of capture
  - LENGTH: fork length of fish at capture (cm)
  - EGGS: estimated number of eggs (fecundity) for the individual female

## Study site and temporal scope
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate grid reference: SD393960 (OS Grid); Easting/Northing 339385,496080; coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836 (WGS84)
- Species: Esox lucius (Pike)
- Sampling would include pike from Windermere’s north and south basins

## Sampling design and collection methods
- Field sampling: gill netting with variations in site and effort from 1944–present; standardised since 1982
- 1982 onwards standard methodology:
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Size: 40 m length, 3 m depth
  - Setting: on the lake bottom, between mid-October and late December
  - Depth: ~4–5 m
  - Sites: 10 per basin (north and south)
  - Sampling cadence: five nets in use per sampling, sites rotated; each site fished for two weeks per season
  - Annual effort: ~348 net days (1982–1989); ~240 net days (since 1990), distributed roughly equally between basins
- Historical variation: earlier nets (pre-1982) differed; post-1982 standardised methods ensure consistency

## Laboratory analysis and data generation
- Measurements: each pike measured for fork length (to 1 mm) and weighed (to 100 g)
- Sexing: individuals dissected to determine sex
- Ageing: left opercular bone aged with standard method (birth date assumed 1 April)
- Fecundity: female fecundity (EGGS) determined as per Kipling & Frost (1969)

## Data quality and provenance
- Quality control: measurements verified by permutation checks involving three individuals
- Data provenance and methodology referenced in accompanying metadata and literature:
  - Ageing method: Frost & Kipling (1959)
  - Fecundity method: Kipling & Frost (1969)
  - Contextual field methodology: Le Cren (2001); Winfield et al. (2008)
