# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

- Description: One dataset from Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist, examining trait-based dynamics of a top predator under climate change. Contains fecundity data (EGGS) for female Pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, collected 1963–2002. Initial data collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Related datasets: Metadata for Pike 1944-2002; Pike Growth Data 1944-1995; Pike Survival Data 1953-1990; Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002.
- Format and size: CSV file named FecundityData1963_2002.csv; format is comma separated values; size ~81 KB.
- Columns: YEAR (year of capture), LENGTH (fork length in cm, measured to 1 mm), EGGS (estimated number of eggs per female).
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain. Approximate center coordinates: OS Grid SD393960; WGS84 54.360193, -2.935836.
- Species: Esox lucius (Pike). Only female individuals included in this dataset.
- Purpose and usage: Data used to analyze fecundity in relation to fish size and over time; suitable for self-serve data exploration, trend analysis, and incorporation into broader ecological or climate-change related studies.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Monitoring conducted in the northern and southern basins via gill-netting from 1944 onward; sampling sites and effort varied historically.
  - Standardised method since 1982:
    - 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
    - Each net: 40 m long, 3 m deep
    - Set on the bottom, typically between mid-October and late December
    - Depths around 4–5 m, at 10 sites per basin (north and south)
    - Five nets in the water at a time; sites rotated to cover the lake
    - One site fished for two weeks per sampling season
    - Annual effort: ~348 net days (1982–1989)
    - Since 1990: ~240 net days per year
  - Pre-1982 methods varied before standardisation.

- Field and laboratory procedures
  - In the field, pike measured for fork length (to 1 mm) and weighed (to 100 g).
  - Sex determined; left opercular bone removed and aged with established methods (birth date assumed 1 April).
  - Fecundity (EGGS) determined for females using methods described by Kipling & Frost (1969).

- Quality control and provenance
  - Measurements validated by permutations involving three individuals.
  - Data and methods referenced to established literature (Frost & Kipling; Le Cren; Winfield et al.).
  - Data are part of ongoing Windermere pike projects; metadata and related datasets are linked in the dataset record.

  - Data available via CEH data portals with related metadata records linked in the description.

- Considerations for analysis and interpretation
  - Single-lake, female-only dataset; may limit generalization to other populations or sexes.
  - Long time span with methodological consistency since 1982; pre-1982 data may have more variability due to changing methods.
  - Fecundity estimates are tied to individual length and time of capture; careful normalization may be required for inter-annual comparisons.
  - Useful for exploring relationships between body size, fecundity, and potential climate-related changes within Windermere.
