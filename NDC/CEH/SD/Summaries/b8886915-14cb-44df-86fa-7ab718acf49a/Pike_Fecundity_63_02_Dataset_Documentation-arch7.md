# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of fecundity (number of eggs) for female pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Covers 1963–2002; used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist on climate change effects in trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.
- Format: comma separated values (CSV); size ~81 KB.
- Columns: YEAR (year of capture), LENGTH (fork length in cm, to 1 mm), EGGS (estimated eggs per female).
- Location: Windermere Lake; approximate center grid reference OS Grid SD393960; coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836 (WGS84).

## Data Format and Content
- Columns:
  - YEAR = Year of capture
  - LENGTH = Fork length at capture (cm, to 1 mm)
  - EGGS = Estimated number of eggs
- File type: CSV
- Dataset name: FecundityData1963_2002.csv

## Sampling and Field Methods
- Target species: Pike (Esox lucius); females measured for fecundity.
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, with north and south basin coverage.
- Historical method: Gill netting; standardized since 1982.
- Net details (post-1982 standardisation):
  - 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets
  - Each net: 40 m long, 3 m deep
  - Placed on the lake bottom at depths ~4–5 m at 10 sites per basin
  - Sampling window: mid-October to late December
  - Procedure: five nets in water at a time; sites fished for two weeks per season; weekly rotation of sites
- Sampling effort: since 1990, ~240 net days annually, distributed roughly equally between north and south basins
- 1982–1989: small additional netting; overall monitoring continues from 1944 onward

## Laboratory Methods and Quality Control
- Measurements:
  - Length (fork length to 1 mm)
  - Wet weight (to 100 g)
  - Sex determined via dissection
  - Age determined from left opercular bone (birth date assumed 1 April)
- Fecundity: females examined to determine egg number (EGGS column)
- Quality control: measurements cross-checked by permutations of three individuals
