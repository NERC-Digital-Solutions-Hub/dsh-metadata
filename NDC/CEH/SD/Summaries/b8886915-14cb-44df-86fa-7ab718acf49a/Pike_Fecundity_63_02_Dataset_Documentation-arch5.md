# Pike Fecundity Data 1963-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of pike (Esox lucius) fecundity (egg counts) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Time span: 1963–2002 (females only).
- Origin: collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and, from 1989 onward, CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Context: used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist to study climate-change effects on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.
- Related datasets and metadata records are provided for broader data lineage and integration.

## Data Content and Format
- File: FecundityData1963_2002.csv
- Format: CSV; size ~81 KB.
- Columns: YEAR (year of capture), LENGTH (fork length in cm), EGGS (estimated number of eggs per individual).
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain; precise coordinates and grid references included.

## Sampling Design and Collection Methods
- Species: Pike (Esox lucius).
- Sampling sites: Windermere North and South basins; standardized since 1982 with 10 sites per basin.
- Gear and effort (since 1982): 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets, 40 m x 3 m, set on the bottom at depths ~4–5 m.
- Sampling schedule: five nets deployed at five sites during daylight on Mondays, inspected Wednesdays, lifted Fridays; sites rotated; two weeks per site per season.
- Since 1990: total annual sampling ~240 net days (roughly equal between basins); 1982–1989 had ~348 net days.
- Collection processing: all pike killed and processed in the lab; birth date assumed 1 April.

## Laboratory Analysis and Data Columns
- Measurements: fork length (to 1 mm) and wet weight (to 100 g).
- Sexing: based on dissection.
- Aging: left opercular bone aged with Frost & Kipling (1959); birth date set to 1 April.
- Fecundity: female eggs counted/estimated as per Kipling & Frost (1969).

## Quality Control
- Measurements validated through permutations involving three individuals as part of quality control procedures.
