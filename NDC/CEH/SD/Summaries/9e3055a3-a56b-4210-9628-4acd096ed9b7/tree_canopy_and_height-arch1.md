# Landscapes

- Overview
  - The two landscapes are part of the Treescapes STAND project, led by the RSPB: North Pennines & Dales in England, and Elenydd in mid Wales.
- Data and sources
  - England: LiDAR-derived DTM and DSM from Environment Agency National LIDAR Programme, accessed via R package gblidar.
  - Wales: LiDAR Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs from Welsh Government, imported into QGIS and clipped to the Elenydd boundary.
  - Buildings: OS OpenMap - Local data used to remove buildings from tree-top and crown data.
- Processing workflow
  - Create canopy height models (CHM) by CHM = DSM − DTM.
  - Identify dominant treetops, heights, and tree crowns from CHM using ForestTools (R) with vwf and mcws functions.
  - Height threshold set at 1.5 m to capture shrubs/scrub while excluding structures.
  - Remove buildings from the tree tops and crowns using OS building data.
  - Compute outputs at 10 m resolution: total canopy cover (%) and mean tree height for each landscape.
- Outputs and visualization
  - Figure 2 shows a comparison between satellite imagery of woodlands/trees and LiDAR-derived canopy cover.
  - Reported metrics: canopy cover percentage and mean tree height per landscape.
- Tools and reproducibility
  - R packages: gblidar (England data), ForestTools (vwf, mcws), and Welsh data processed in QGIS.
- Key considerations
  - Data scale and resolution (10 m) influence sensitivity to small vegetation.
  - The 1.5 m threshold impacts inclusion of shrubs vs. trees.
  - Building removal relies on the accuracy and completeness of OS data.
  - Wales data clipped to Elenydd ensures landscape-specific analysis.
