# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview and context
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed at providing a broad monitoring context for detailed studies, enabling year-to-year comparisons and links to other data.
  - Monitoring design and measurements documented in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
  - 2001 management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change in site leadership.

- Study site and monitoring design
  - Large field experiment at Sourhope with standardized monitoring to support multiple research groups.
  - Measurements span 1999–2001 with procedures intended to facilitate cross-study comparisons.
  - Key measurement types include weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
  - Data collection schedule and methods are outlined (e.g., mowing regimes, Point Analysis surveys, and weekly/seasonal sampling).

- Data collected and methods (highlights)
  - Automatic Weather Station: continuous weather data at Sourhope; used for annual summaries and interpretation of biological responses.
  - Above-ground biomass: quantified via five summer harvests per year from 0.5 m^2 cells within subplots; biomass summed annually and log-transformed for analyses.
  - Soil pH: measured from top 5 cm; pH changes tracked in response to lime and nitrogen additions.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July (two surveyors) to assess species hits and relative abundances; supplemented with PCA to explore community shifts.
  - Data analysis: ANOVA (Genstat 5) to test treatment effects; PCA used to identify associations among plots and treatments; biomass and species relationships examined against biomass yields.
  - Data management: emphasis on consistency across observers, data QA, and integration with broader datasets.

- Key results by measure

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near the long-term average, following a very wet previous year.
    - Radiation largely unchanged; average temperatures slightly cooler in 2001.
    - Soil moisture content higher in 2001 than in 2000.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments throughout the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass increased substantially relative to 2000, likely due to a change in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass responses normalized to the C1 (control) plots to reveal treatment effects.
    - ANOVA: significant differences between improved (N and/or Lime) and unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
    - Nitrogen and Lime (especially N+L) produced the strongest biomass promotion.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime additions raised topsoil pH, averaging 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone raised pH to a lesser extent; controls showed no significant baseline change since 1998.

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 saw 58% more total hits than July 2000, suggesting increased sward density (likely from grazing removal in 1998).
    - Distinct treatment differences in the most frequent species:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
      - Festuca species increased across all treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N+L (F. rubra).
      - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were prominent in fertilized plots, especially N+L.
      - Species linked to poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more evident in unimproved plots.
    - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity loss in more fertile plots.
    - PCA showed clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control and biocide plots; unimproved plots tended to cluster together with bryophyte and less fertile species.
    - Biomass correlations: higher Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance associated with higher biomass; abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tended to decline with increasing biomass.
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicated higher vegetation turnover with increased soil fertility.

- Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site; columns E and F showed more acidic plots, partially due to higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
    - Residual pH differences across columns suggest underlying spatial structure affecting responses to treatments.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Total biomass showed spatial patterns, with lowest biomass in outlying plots and higher biomass in more central plots (e.g., some N+L and lime plots).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical tests indicated no block effect).

- Data quality and monitoring continuity
  - Inter-surveyor consistency verified: no significant differences between surveyors in 2001 Point Quadrat surveys.
  - Quality assurance and standardized protocols maintained despite site disruptions (FMD and staff changes).
  - The monitoring framework supports cross-year and cross-treatment comparisons and integrates weather, soil, biomass, and botanical data.

- Management context and disruptions
  - 2001 FMD outbreak temporarily restricted site access; sampling continued under controlled protocols.
  - Change of Officer in Charge in 2001; site management plans maintained, with most management activities proceeding as planned.

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Demonstrates the value of integrating multiple data streams (weather, soil chemistry, biomass production, and species composition) for assessing environmental responses to management treatments.
  - Highlights the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity in long-term field experiments.
  - Shows that standardized monitoring and cross-year analyses (e.g., normalizing to controls, PCA) can reveal consistent treatment effects and shifts in plant communities over time.

- Note on data interpretation
  - Observed 2001 increases in biomass and shifts in species composition are linked to both treatment effects and operational changes (e.g., mowing method), underscoring the need to separate management-driven artifacts from genuine ecological responses in environmental monitoring.
