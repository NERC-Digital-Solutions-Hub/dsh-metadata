# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (SCOTLAND) to contextualize detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - Baseline data survey completed November 1998; 1999–2001 measurements designed to link with other projects and assess links between management, soil, vegetation, and biomass.
  - 2001 management events affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site Officer in Charge, but core management activities (liming, N application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued according to the 2001 Site Management Plan.

- Data and Methods ( summarized as used in the report)
  - Treatments and plots: multiple treatments including Control (two plots), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide; biomass and soil measurements collected across sub-plots and blocks.
  - Key measurements and dates:
    - Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests (May–September) 1999–2001; biomass summed per plot and later ln-transformed for analysis.
    - 2001 biomass analyses: normalised against C1 to compare treatment effects and year-to-year changes.
    - Botanical surveys: July 2000 and 2001 point quadrat surveys (100 cells per cell, 25 cells per plot in each of five blocks) to determine species hits and relative abundances.
    - Soil pH: upper 5 cm measured in baseline (Aug 1998) and Oct 2001; lime and nitrogen impacts tracked.
    - Additional surveys: mini-rhizotron related surveys and various relative cover surveys on subplots for targeted projects.
  - Data integrity and analysis:
    - Inter-surveyor comparison: no statistically significant difference between surveyors in 2001 (NS); supports data reliability across observers.
    - Statistical analyses included split-plot ANOVA, transformations (ln) for biomass, and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to explore species associations and treatment group separation.
  - Weather data: Automatic Weather Station on site; headline measures (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture) tracked for 1999–2001.

- Key Findings by Topic

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term annual average; radiation steady; slightly cooler temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.
    - Weather context supports interpretation of biomass and productivity changes in 2001.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase over previous years, likely influenced by a change in personnel and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass normalized to C1 revealed:
      - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments significantly promoted biomass vs controls; interaction between treatment and year significant.
      - No significant differences among blocks, indicating treatment effects were robust across spatial replication.
    - Overall, nitrogen and lime (especially N+L) produced the strongest biomass response.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming continued to raise pH in the topsoil: ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone raised pH too, but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - 2001 surveys recorded 58% more hits than 2000, suggesting a denser sward, possibly due to removal of grazing stock in 1998.
    - Treatment differences in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except Control 1 and Limed plots remained relatively abundant there).
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; particularly Festuca rubra in limed plots and with nitrogen.
      - Fertilised plots (especially N+L) showed greater presence of species associated with improved pastures (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, etc.); poorer pasture species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Species diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime, suggesting potential decline in diversity with higher fertility/improvement.
    - PCA indicated clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots showed more extreme points with higher abundance of Festuca rubra and related taxa.
    - Biomass vs species composition: higher biomass generally correlated with increases in Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with higher biomass.
    - Litter: increased frequency of litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with increased soil fertility.

- Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibited more acidic conditions; underlying spatial patterns persist in 2001 with acid plots more common in certain columns, particularly where N and/or Lime treatments concentrated.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
    - Biomass varied by plot location; central plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen and Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D).
    - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, suggesting fertility/liming effects drive productivity.
    - No significant differences in biomass across blocks, reinforcing treatment-driven spatial effects.

- Considerations for Data Leadership and Data Management

  - Data richness and breadth:
    - Multiple intertwined data streams (biomass, soil pH, species composition, weather, management events) enabling cross-variable analyses and cross-project integration.
  - Data quality and comparability:
    - Consistent methodologies across years; inter-surveyor agreement validated; normalization against C1 enables cross-year comparability of treatment effects.
  - Data interpretation and transparency:
    - Clear documentation of measurement methods, dates, and analysis approaches (e.g., ln-transformation, ANOVA, PCA) to support reproducibility and cross-study synthesis.
  - Data challenges and context:
    - External disruption (FMD) and personnel changes introduced potential confounding factors, yet core management activities continued, allowing robust assessment of treatment effects.
  - Implications for data strategy:
    - Demonstrates importance of long-term, multi-factor experiments with standardized data collection to elucidate treatment effects on productivity, soil chemistry, and plant communities.
    - Highlights value of spatial replication and heterogeneity assessment for robust interpretation of field data.
    - Emphasizes documentation of site events and management changes to contextualize year-to-year data variation.
