# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview and purpose
- Part of a long-term environmental monitoring dataset from Sourhope, focusing on soil profiles, soil chemistry, and vegetation across replicated blocks.
- This excerpt documents Block 4 and Block 5 profiles, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON plot data to illustrate integrated soil–vegetation monitoring.

## Site context
- Location: Rigg Foot, Sourhope (grid references and site details provided in block summaries).
- Elevation: around 315 m; slope approximately 5 degrees; drainage described as imperfect.
- Soil and geology: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite; block profiles show typical hillside soil development with igneous inclusions.

## Methods and measurements

- Soil profiles (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Horizons described with depth ranges and field textures/color/morphology:
    - Block 4: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), Bg/B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
    - Block 5: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Descriptions include moisture, root presence, color/mottling, structure, and presence of stones.
- Soil chemical and physical analyses
  - Measured per horizon/plot: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.
  - Block 4 example highlights: high LOI in surface horizons (e.g., LOI values around 63–73% in surface horizons; pH H2O around 4.7–5.0; Ca generally highest among cations in FH/H; Mg and K present in smaller amounts; substantial amounts of igneous stones noted in deeper horizons).
  - Block 5 example highlights: comparable horizon sequence with high LOI in surface horizons (Ah/AB/Bg), substantial Ca in FH/H horizons (Ca around 11–12 meq/100 g in FH/H), pH H2O ~4.5–5.2; moisture loss and LOI values indicate organic-rich upper horizons diminishing with depth.
- Auger sampling (Blocks 4 and 5)
  - 0–100 cm augmented cores (A, B, C, D, etc.) analyzed for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.
  - Observed ranges:
    - Block 4 augers: %N typically 0.56–0.58; %C ~7.0–8.0; C:N ~12.4–14.3; Ca ~1.0–5.1; Mg ~0.58–1.59; LOI ~15–18%; pH H2O ~4.0–4.9; pH CaCl2 ~3.6–4.5.
    - Block 5 augers: %N ~0.53–0.60; %C ~7.0–9.0; C:N ~10.2–14.7; Ca ~1.1–5.1; Mg ~0.58–2.89; LOI ~14–21%; pH H2O ~4.3–4.95; pH CaCl2 ~3.5–4.1.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Conducted on plots within blocks, recording species presence/absence and totals per subplot.
  - Results show varying species totals across plots/subplots, with detailed tallies indicating community composition and richness differences by plot depth and horizon context.
- ECOTRON soil site data
  - Includes targeted soil analyses (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) and vegetation survey counts for ECOTRON plots.
  - Indicates soil chemistry and moisture traits comparable to the main blocks, enabling cross-site comparisons within the monitoring network.

## Key observations and implications for monitoring

- Horizon structure and organic content
  - Surface horizons (Ah/Ah-like layers) are rich in organic matter (high LOI) and relatively acidic (pH roughly 4.7–5.0 in H2O); organic-rich upper horizons become increasingly mineral with depth.
- Calcium and base cations
  - Top horizons in several blocks show elevated Ca and other base cations (Ca often among the highest cations in FH/H), with Mg and K present in varying but generally lower amounts.
- pH and acidity
  - pH values indicate acidic soils across horizons, with CaCl2 values below neutral ranges, highlighting potential limitations for some plant communities and nutrient availability.
- Soil texture and structure indicators
  - Descriptions reveal a mix of sandy loams to clay loams with varying mottling and structure; presence of igneous stones throughout the profile affects drainage and root penetration.
- Data richness and governance
  - The dataset exemplifies multi-domain monitoring: soil chemistry/physical properties tied to vegetation data, across replicated blocks and depth-resolved profiles.
  - Emphasizes the need for robust metadata (horizon designations, depths, laboratory codes, barcodes), archiving standards, and clear data-sharing protocols to enable long-term analyses and cross-site comparisons.

## Relevance for Monitoring Framework Authors

- Illustrates a structured, multi-parameter monitoring framework combining soil chemistry, soil physical properties, and vegetation data across replicated blocks and depth intervals.
- Demonstrates practical data governance considerations:
  - Standardized horizon labeling and depth intervals
  - Comprehensive metadata and archiving (e.g., MLURI barcodes, horizon codes, lab measurements)
  - Challenges around data access, data silos, and the need for open sharing to support reproducibility and cross-site comparability
- Highlights integration with national networks (e.g., ECN/Micronet context) to enhance long-term biodiversity and soil-health assessments.
- Provides a model for communicating complex, multi-domain findings through consistent sampling designs (blocks, plots, subplots), transparent measurement protocols, and standardized classifications in vegetation analyses.

## Endnotes (implications for practice)

- Baseline data from Sourhope underpin long-term biodiversity and soil-health assessments and support cross-site monitoring initiatives.
- The material reflects an iterative, collaborative approach to environmental monitoring, with attention to metadata quality, data management, and alignment with larger data networks.
