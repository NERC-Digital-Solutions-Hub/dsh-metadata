# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme studies a large, intensive field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to provide context for related studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
- Baseline data and experimental design are described in a prior Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- A broad monitoring plan was implemented to contextualize detailed studies; measurements span multiple years with data presentation aligned to Report II to facilitate data linkage and year-to-year comparisons.
- 2001 site management was affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions (Feb–May) with protocols for restricted visits; a new Officer in Charge took over in May 2001.
- Table 1 lists the types and dates of measurements across the field experiment.

## Data collection and methods
- Measurements include automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH (top 5 cm), and botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys.
- Above-ground biomass was collected at five mowing occasions each summer (1999–2001) from random 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; clippings were oven-dried and weighed.
- Botanical composition used a July Point Quadrat survey (grid of 100 cells; 25 cells sampled per quadrat) to record species hits; surveyors’ results were compared for consistency.
- Data handling and analysis: biomass data were ln-transformed for ANOVA; treatments were compared against the C1 control; PCA was used to examine species associations; correlations were explored between species frequencies and biomass; litter frequency was assessed as a turnover indicator.
- Treatments included nitrogen (N), lime (L), nitrogen plus lime (N&L), and biocide (B), with control plots (C1, C2).
- Data quality notes: there was no statistically significant difference between surveyors in 2001 (p = 0.18), supporting cross-survey consistency.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data were generally unremarkable compared with long-term trends.
- Rainfall near the long-term average after a very wet year; total radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent treatment hierarchy of biomass estimates persisted across sampling periods; peak biomass occurred in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass was substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to changes in personnel and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass was normalised against the C1 control to emphasize treatment effects; analyses showed:
  - Significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L) and unimproved plots (control/biocide).
  - A significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Overall, nitrogen and lime additions had the strongest positive impact on above-ground productivity, with the combination (N&L) often most effective.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime additions continued to raise surface soil pH (0–5 cm depth).
  - Limed plots averaged pH 6.19 in October 2001.
  - Nitrogen + Lime plots averaged pH 6.38 in October 2001.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey replicated 2000 protocol; inter-surveyor differences were not significant.
- Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment effects on major species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across all treatments, most frequent in N and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and N&L (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed higher frequencies of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Diversity changes:
  - unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; nitrogen-lime plots had 18 species, suggesting potential early signs of reduced diversity with improved fertility.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed clear separation: nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots clustered apart from control/biocide plots; control/biocide plots tended to be associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus), Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass–species relationships:
  - Higher biomass correlated with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Decreases in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis with higher biomass.
  - Noted increase in litter occurrence in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic plots than other columns, an effect possibly influenced by higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
- In 2001, deeper spatial heterogeneity appeared as relatively more acidic surface pH in N and/or Lime plots within these columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Biomass values showed outliers with very low biomass across treatments; central site plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (ANOVA: F = 0.69, p = 0.61).

## Data quality and notes
- Inter-year comparability achieved by aligning data presentation with prior reports and normalising key metrics (e.g., biomass against C1).
- The 2001 FMD-related disruption was mitigated by following a veterinary-mandated protocol; key site management activities (liming, N application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting) proceeded according to the 2001 Site Management Plan, with minor timing deviations (biocide application timing).
