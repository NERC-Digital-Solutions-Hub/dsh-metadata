# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and scope
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders.
  - Full site description and baseline data are in the 1998 Baseline Data Survey; this report presents monitoring results to enable cross-year comparisons and links to other studies.
  - Measurements span weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition (Point Analysis), with site management and data collection notes.

- Key management context for 1999–2001
  - 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions halted visitors Feb–May; sampling proceeded under a controlled protocol.
  - Officer in Charge changed in May 2001.
  - Management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued in 2001; first biocide application in May was missed, subsequent applications completed.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather data: rainfall near long-term average; radiation and temperature similar to prior years with a slight dip in average temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.
  
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: plots with nitrogen and/or lime consistently yield higher biomass than unimproved plots.
    - Peak biomass occurred in July or August each year; 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
    - Normalising against the C1 control confirms the positive impact of nitrogen and lime on productivity.
    - Year-by-treatment interaction significant; differences among blocks not significant.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming raises surface soil pH (0–5 cm): to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen addition alone also raises pH, but less than lime; control plots show little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Analysis: total number of “hits” (rough measure of plant contacts) 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting a denser sward, possibly from past grazing removal in 1998.
    - Treatment effects on species:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
      - Festuca species increased across all treatments; most frequent in nitrogen and biocide-related plots.
      - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis (and Poa trivialis in some cases); less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
    - Diversity indicators:
      - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in nitrogen+lime plots, hinting at a possible early decline in plant diversity with higher fertility.
    - Multivariate perspective:
      - Principal Components Analysis separates nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots tend toward bryophyte-rich communities and less fertile indicators.
      - Biomass correlates with higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; as biomass increases, the relative abundance of several bryophytes and less fertile species declines.
      - Increased litter is associated with nitrogen and/or lime treatments, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F closer to the slope tend to host more acidic plots, particularly where nitrogen and/or lime treatments are applied; this pattern is partly influenced by treatment distribution (e.g., higher representation of Control/Biocide in those columns).

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass distribution shows outliers with lower biomass scattered across plots.
    - Generally higher biomass in central or better-located plots (e.g., some nitrogen+lime and lime plots).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences among blocks in biomass.

- Implications for data analysis
  - The 2001 biomass increase likely stems from a combination of personnel change and a switch to mechanical cutting, underscoring the importance of accounting for methodological changes when comparing biomass across years.
  - Fertility enhancements (nitrogen and lime) consistently shift plant communities toward more productive, species associated with improved pastures, with potential implications for biodiversity.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site affects pH and biomass patterns; analyses should consider column-level and centrality effects to avoid confounding treatment effects with site geometry.

- Acknowledgements and data notes
  - Acknowledges contributions of staff and surveyors; detailed methodology includes mowing regime, Point Quadrat protocol, and species coding (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Fr = Festuca rubra, etc.).
  - Data management involved routine weather data capture and cross-year comparisons to align with other reports in the series.

- Summary takeaway for data-focused interpretation
  - In this field experiment, adding nitrogen and/or lime reliably enhances above-ground biomass and shifts botanical composition toward more fertile pasture-associated species, while raising soil pH.
  - 2001 changes in workflow and site management influenced biomass measurements, highlighting the need to control for methodological variations in time-series analyses.
  - There is detectable spatial heterogeneity in pH and biomass across the Sourhope site that interacts with treatment effects, which should be incorporated into statistical models (e.g., blocking, column effects) to isolate true treatment responses.
