# SUMMARY

- Four years on from the start of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders), the site has been intensively monitored for above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition and diversity, with a focus on how management treatments influence botanical change.
- Key management processes being examined
  - Mowing: monthly cuts to ~6 cm height (May–Sept) since 1999, following fencing to exclude grazing.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime applied to designated plots; nitrogen and lime effects on productivity and plant community structure are central to the analysis.
  - Insecticide application: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to insecticide plots after mowing; potential effects on plant diversity via herbivore interactions.
  - Trampling/experimental disturbances: particular attention to plots subjected to 13CO2 pulses (notably C2), which can influence productivity.
- Site design and data collection
  - Experimental site: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with 0.5 m2 cells allocated to different research groups.
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, Insecticide; detailed application dates and rates provided in Appendices.
  - Data streams:
    - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station (headlines for 1999–2002; 2002 data partially missing due to a station fault and substituted with data from Konza).
    - Vegetation productivity: regular biomass sampling from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed, since 1999.
    - Baseline and ongoing vegetation surveys: 1998 baseline; annual July/August point analyses (2000–2002) using a 100-hole grid within a 0.5 m2 cell, with bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
    - Soil monitoring: soil pH (0–5 cm) measured since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002 with theta probe; periodic soil sampling and additional small-scale botanical surveys.
    - Biodiversity inventories: extensive species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes) and analysis of functional groups; Appendix 3 lists species observed in 2002; Appendix 8 provides long-term species-hits data by treatment.
- Primary findings (2002 reporting)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - A clear management-driven hierarchy in biomass across treatments persists; nitrogen and lime together yield the highest productivity, with Control 2 plots consistently less productive.
    - Overall 2002 biomass declines relative to 2001, with reductions ranging from ~14% (N&L) to ~31% (Control 2); slope position also influences productivity (lower plots previously showing larger gains).
    - Split-plot analyses confirm significant treatment effects and year-by-treatment interactions.
  - Fertilisation and soil chemistry
    - Lime markedly increases soil pH (approaching ~7.0 in limed plots); nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
    - A strong negative relationship exists between soil moisture and soil pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier.
    - Across treatments, positive relationships between soil pH and above-ground biomass are generally observed, though per-treatment patterns vary.
  - Plant community structure and functional groups
    - Changes in functional groups align with CSR theory: in fertilised plots, there is a shift toward competitive and stress-ruderals; unimproved plots are more dominated by stress-tolerant taxa.
    - In 2002, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species expand in nitrogen+lime plots, while stress-tolerant species predominate in unimproved plots; lime and insecticide plots show reductions in SR-C-S-R dominance.
  - Species-specific and bryophyte dynamics
    - Festuca rubra increases are especially pronounced in lime- and nitrogen-treated plots; Agrostis spp. decline across the site, with mowing potentially contributing to this trend.
    - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) become more abundant site-wide, particularly in unimproved plots; bryophyte contributions to total hits and biomass increase over years, with larger relative increases in unimproved plots.
    - Point Analysis indicates shifts in the relative abundance of Festuca vs. Agrostis and in the proportion of grasses associated with improved pastures (e.g., Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) in fertilised treatments.
  - Diversity and community composition metrics
    - Shannon diversity indices show treatment-related changes over time, with increases in several treatments but a notable decline in nitrogen+lime plots compared with baselines.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of 2002 point data shows clear separation between improved (lime-treated) plots and unimproved plots; nitrogen-treated samples sometimes align with limed plots, indicating convergent vegetation characteristics under certain nutrient amendments.
  - Insecticide effects and interpretation
    - The insecticide plots exhibit notable diversity patterns, consistent with theoretical expectations that herbivore exclusion can alter plant community composition; however, the authors caution against over-interpreting a direct causative link without further data.
- Discussion: integrated interpretation
  - Mowing appears to foster expansion of stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities by reducing disturbance regime and nutrient turnover; this effect can promote bryophyte expansion and reduce dominance by Agrostis spp.
  - Fertilisation enhances productivity but can lead to decreased moisture availability and chlorosis under high pH and moisture stress, potentially offsetting biomass gains in Fertilised plots.
  - High soil pH (lime) generally supports greater productivity and shifts in functional groups toward competitive species; however, excessively high pH may eventually constrain growth in drier periods.
  - Insecticide-treated plots may support higher plant diversity due to altered herbivory patterns, but causality remains tentative.
  - Trampling effects in C2 plots likely reduced productivity during intense 13CO2 pulse activities, highlighting the sensitivity of biomass estimates to short-term disturbances.
- Data governance and monitoring implications
  - The study demonstrates the feasibility of long-term, multi-treatment monitoring combining above-ground productivity, species composition, functional classifications, soil chemistry, and moisture data.
  - Data completeness challenges include 2002 weather data gaps due to equipment failure and the need to substitute external data; this underscores the importance of robust metadata, data provenance, and contingency data sources in monitoring frameworks.
  - The comprehensive Appendix materials (treatment descriptions, species lists, biomass/time-series, and voice-on-site activity) provide a valuable data archive for longitudinal biodiversity monitoring and for cross-project data harmonisation.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is an operational consideration for monitoring programmes, illustrating potential barriers to data dissemination in large, multi-partner studies.
- Bottom-line implications for monitoring practice
  - Management choices (mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use) produce measurable, interpretable shifts in productivity, species composition, and functional group structure over four years, with clear interactions among soil chemistry, moisture, disturbance regime, and plant strategy types.
  - The CSR framework is a useful lens for interpreting plant community responses to nutrient enrichment and disturbance, helping to translate complex species data into actionable monitoring signals.
  - Longitudinal, site-embedded monitoring with standardized data collection protocols and thorough documentation (Appendices) is essential for informing policy decisions and future management of semi-natural grassland ecosystems.
