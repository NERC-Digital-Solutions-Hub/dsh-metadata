# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents Sourhope Soil Biodiversity field site data from long-term experimental work.
- Covers site context, data collection methods, data processing, and archive practices for physical samples and digital records.
- Reflects an emphasis on data governance, provenance, metadata, and sharing readiness for reuse.

## Data assets and structure (BLOCK 4 to BLOCK 5 excerpts and ECOTRON)
- Vegetation data
  - Methods: vegetation surveys using plot-level and sub-plot observations; presence/absence with abundance inferred from counts.
  - Outputs: species lists and frequencies by plot; dominance patterns; species totals across plots and subplots.
  - Subsets: establishment-year data available; ongoing year-to-year sampling across blocks.
- Soil data
  - Profile data: horizons described (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges (0–1 cm to 100 cm+); detailed horizon descriptions and boundary types.
  - Chemical analyses by horizon/plot: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Auger samples: weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2; multiple samples per auger set.
  - Data formats: per-horizon and per-plot data tables; horizon-level metadata; Appendix A with site, horizon, and sample IDs.
- Site-specific and ecotron data
  - Ecotron plots: soil analysis and vegetation survey data for Ecotron Plot.
  - Includes barcoded samples and horizon-specific measurements linking physical samples to digital records.
- Appendices and datasets
  - Appendix A: block-level site details, horizon descriptions, grid references, altitude, slope, soil series, rock type, and sample IDs.
  - Tables 6–9 and related vegetation/soil data summaries referenced for detailed analyses.

## Data standards, provenance, and metadata
- Classification and analysis frameworks
  - Vegetation: National Vegetation Classification (NVC) with key community types (e.g., U4d, U5b variants); Twinspan groupings for recurring associations.
  - Data provenance: explicit linkage between plots, subplots, treatments, horizons, and horizon-level samples using MLURI barcodes and grid coordinates.
- Provenance and traceability
  - Clear mapping from field observations to laboratory analyses and archived samples; horizon and plot IDs maintained to ensure reproducibility.
  - Appendix A provides granular site details (grid references, altitude, slope, soil series, parent material).
- Data integrity and limitations
  - Acknowledges establishment-year data limitations (subset of subplots sampled for initial year analyses).
  - Notes anomalies in some plots/blocks (e.g., unusual N, LOI, pH values) requiring cautious interpretation and potential curation.

## Data storage, access, and archiving
- Physical and digital storage
  - Soil archive samples stored at -80°C (CEH Merlewood) alongside digital data tables and horizon metadata.
  - Barcoded samples ensure linkage between physical materials and dataset records.
- Dissemination and cataloging
  - Emphasizes a publishing/sharing mindset; datasets intended for upload to appropriate portals and catalogs.
  - Datasets include vegetation lists, plot-level species data, horizon-level soil chemistry, and horizon descriptions.

## Quality, challenges, and limitations
- Quality and limitations
  - Natural seasonal variability and grazing history influence establishment-year data; limited plot sampling may affect generalizability.
  - Strong correlations among soil variables (e.g., %N, %C, LOI, C:N; Ca/Mg/Na/K; pH relationships) inform interpretation but suggest potential confounding factors across blocks/horizons.
- Governance and operational challenges
  - Incomplete picture of user needs for data reuse; timely data delivery from long-term field sites; metadata harmonization across blocks, horizons, and data types.
  - Handling multiple data formats/systems; integrating archived physical samples with digital records; managing large, multi-dimensional datasets.

## Practical takeaways for data stewardship
- Establish a formal data management plan for field sites
  - Develop comprehensive metadata standards for vegetation and soil datasets (variables, units, methods, horizon definitions, sampling dates, plot IDs, treatment codes).
  - Create explicit provenance trails linking physical samples (barcodes) to digital records and horizon analyses.
  - Implement documented QA/revision processes to address anomalies and block-level differences.
  - Maintain a centralized data catalog or portal with standardized schemas to enable cross-site comparisons and long-term reuse.
- Ensure ongoing archiving and access controls
  - Archive physical samples and digital data with clear storage locations, access policies, and embargo/permission controls as needed.
- Promote interoperability and standards alignment
  - Align with recognized vegetation classifications (NVC) and established data analysis approaches (Twinspan, association analyses) for consistency.
- Guidance for data creators
  - Provide clear metadata requirements (e.g., horizon names, depth ranges, pH measurement specifics, LOI calculations) to reduce ambiguities during sharing.
