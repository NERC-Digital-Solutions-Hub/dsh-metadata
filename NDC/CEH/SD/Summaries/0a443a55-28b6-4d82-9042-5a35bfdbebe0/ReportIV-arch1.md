# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report (2002)

## Introduction
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on the Sourhope field site in the Scottish Borders.
- Aims: understand soil biota diversity and their functional roles, and assess links to above-ground plant communities (productivity and diversity).
- Site history: previously grazed by sheep; fencing in 1998 removed grazing; management since 1999 includes five summer cuts to 6 cm and five plot-level treatments (fertilised vs unfertilised with nitrogen and/or lime; an insecticide treatment; and controls).
- Plant community baseline: initial NVC community described as Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland; monitoring combines above-ground biomass, species composition, and diversity.
- Functional framing: plant communities analyzed using CSR (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal) to interpret responses to disturbance and soil changes.

## Methods (Incorporating Site Activity)
- Experimental design: Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
- Management details:
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly May–September to ~6 cm.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 (chlorpyrifos) applied to designated insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime added in spring to designated plots.
- Data collection:
  - On-site automatic weather station for temperature, rainfall, and radiation since 1999.
  - Above-ground productivity: regular clipping and drying/ weighing of 0.5 m2 samples within sub-plots.
  - Baseline vegetation survey in July–August 1998; annual point-analysis surveys since 2000 (large 0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot with a 100-hole frame to record species touches).
  - Soil sampling: pH (5 cm depth) regularly since 1998; soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002.
  - Additional field surveys: biomass sorting by species, bryophyte identification, litter hits, and diversity indices (Shannon) derived from point analyses.
- Analysis: statistical tests include split-plot ANOVA (treatment, year, and interactions); PCA of point-analysis data; species-group (monocot/dicot/bryophyte) assessments; and trend comparisons from 1999–2002.

## Results

### 3.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2002 featured low rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and late-year months; overall year had above-average rainfall.
- Winter 2001/02 was unusually mild (Dec–Feb average air temperature ~3.88 C).

### 3.2 Above-ground Biomass Estimates
- A consistent rank order of biomass by treatment persisted each summer; however, mid-summer biomass declined across several treatments in 2002.
- Fertilised plots (nitrogen and/or lime) showed the strongest biomass production; the combination of nitrogen and lime produced the highest productivity overall.
- Control 2 plots generally underperformed relative to Control 1 plots in 2002.
- Long-term trend from 1999–2002 shows overall biomass increasing relative to the 1999 baseline, despite the 2002 drop.
- Geographic pattern: biomass tended to decrease moving upslope (Block 5 fell more than Block 1), reflecting slope-related productivity differences.
- Table/figure notes indicate significant treatment effects and a strong year effect, with notable interaction between treatment and year.

### 3.3 Interaction Between Soil pH, Moisture, and Productivity
- Lime additions produced a highly significant rise in soil pH (near 7.0 in limed plots), with nitrogen also raising pH but to a lesser extent.
- A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68) distinguished more fertile, limed plots (drier) from wetter, unfertilised plots.
- Overall, positive relationships between higher soil pH and biomass productivity across treatments; when examined per-treatment, the pH–biomass relationship strengthens in lime-treated plots but weakens or reverses in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime (the latter showing a more complex, potentially non-linear relationship).
- In limed plots, pH elevation appears especially linked to shifts toward more competitive species; nitrogen additions further modulate outcomes depending on whether lime is also applied.

### 3.4 Point Analysis Survey
- 2002 point-analysis revealed treatment differences in species hits:
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and lime) dominated by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, comprising about 54% (N&L), 30% (limed), and 25% (nitrogen-only) of total hits; these species were much less frequent in Control and Insecticide plots.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) showed greater incidence of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increased across the site, accounting for 19.92% of total hits in 2002 (up from 10.82% in 2001 and 6.48% in 2000); particularly prominent in unimproved plots, with notable rises in bryophyte biomass in 2000 and 2002 in these plots.
- Litter/habitats: the proportion of litter hits varied by year and treatment, with higher litter hits in 2002 particularly in N&L plots.
- Diversity (Shannon index): baseline diversity differences appeared in 2000 and became more pronounced in 2001 and 2002; by 2002, the Shannon index had fallen by 15% in N&L plots, while other treatments saw increases (2–29%), with the insecticide plots showing notable gains.
- Functional group analysis (S = stress-tolerators; CSR = competitive-stress tolerators; SR/CSR = stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals):
  - Across treatments, a core dominance of S, CSR, and SR/CSR functional groups accounted for 69–95% of vascular plant hits.
  - By 2002, CSR species expanded dramatically in N&L plots; S taxa expanded in unimproved plots; SR/CSR species reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2002 data shows clear separation between improved and unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together; some nitrogen-treated samples also aligned with limed plots, while others aligned more closely with controls and insecticide plots.

## Discussion

### 4.1 Mowing Effect
- Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across almost all treatments, suggesting a site-level factor (not tied to a single treatment) such as the mowing regime or broader climatic/biotic factors.
- Festuca rubra expanded notably in more fertile plots, consistent with lime- and nitrogen-associated improvements.
- Widespread expansion of stress-tolerant species across treatments points to reduced disturbance (grazing exclusion) as a key driver; reduced disturbance likely contributed to declines in SR/C-S-R species.
- Bryophyte expansion appears linked to regular mowing and the current relatively infertile, low-disturbance environment; the effect is dampened somewhat in more fertile plots.

### 4.2 Fertilisation Effect
- Since 1999, nitrogen and/or lime additions have consistently boosted above-ground biomass; plots receiving both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity, though signs suggest possible saturation or peak productivity in the N+L plots (potentially linked to very high pH and reduced soil moisture).
- Lime raised mean soil pH toward 7.0; high lime rates may push productivity beyond optimum if soil moisture is limiting.
- The combination of nitrogen and lime promoted a shift toward competitive, fast-growing species (C-S-R) driven by improved growing conditions; lime’s role in driving higher pH appears especially important for these shifts, sometimes more influential than nitrogen alone.
- Chlorosis in lime-treated plots during dry periods suggests water stress may become limiting under high pH, affecting overall productivity.

### 4.3 Insecticide Effect
- The relationship between insect herbivory and plant diversity is complex and context-dependent; field evidence is mixed and dependent on insecticide type and life-history groups of plants.
- While the data do not establish a direct causal link between reduced herbivory from Dursban 4 and higher Shannon diversity, the results align with studies suggesting that reduced herbivory can alter species composition in favor of more palatable, potentially more diverse assemblages, particularly under relatively infertile conditions.
- Given uncertainties about the specific spectrum of insect control, interpretations should remain cautious.

### 4.4 Trampling Effect
- The first-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 coincided with visible productivity reductions, likely caused by trampling during intense 13CO2 pulse activities, highlighting how experimental procedures can influence plant productivity in sensitive plots.

## Summary of Implications
- Management actions (grazing exclusion, mowing, and fertility amendments) drive visible shifts in plant community structure and function at Sourhope.
- Fertilisation, particularly the combination of nitrogen and lime, markedly increases biomass but may drive functional shifts toward competitive species and reduce diversity in the short term.
- Regular mowing favors Festuca rubra and bryophyte proliferation, especially under low disturbance and fertile nutrient conditions.
- Insecticide effects remain uncertain; potential diversification under certain conditions warrants cautious interpretation.
- Spatial gradients (downslope blocks) interact with treatments, influencing productivity and community composition, underscoring the importance of scale and site context in ecological responses.
