# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- This document fragment presents detailed soil chemistry, profile descriptions, and vegetation data for Sourhope, focusing on Block 4 and Block 5 at Rigg Foot, plus ECOTRON plotting. It supports long-term environmental monitoring by linking soil properties, horizonation, and vegetation at fine spatial scales.

## Data collected and sampling methods (Block 4, Block 5, ECOTRON)

- Auger sampling at Block 4 (Rigg Foot):
  - Six auger samples (4A–4F) with measurements: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, exchangeable Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, % LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation surveys (Block 4, Block 5, ECOTRON):
  - Plot-based vegetation inventories with presence/absence and species totals for each subplot within plots.
- Block 5 soil profile data:
  - Site details and soil profile descriptions across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; depth ranges and qualitative descriptions (structure, colour, texture, roots, stones).
  - Corresponding chemical data per horizon (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Auger data (Block 5):
  - Analysis of auger samples 5A–5F with same suite as Block 4 augers (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
- ECOTRON soil site:
  - ECOTRON Plot soil analysis: Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Vegetation survey for ECOTRON plots detailing totals per subplot.
- Data organization identifiers:
  - Barcodes (MLURI) tied to each sample (e.g., Block 4 augers 4A–4F; Block 5 augers 5A–5F; ECOTRON 603930 series), enabling traceability and archival storage.

## Highlights by block

- Block 4 auger samples (4A–4F):
  - %N ~0.51–0.58; %C ~6.80–8.22; C:N ~12.6–14.3.
  - Exchangeable Ca ~1.01–2.96 meq/100g; Mg ~0.58–1.59 meq/100g; K ~0.58–0.81 meq/100g; Na ~0.12–0.15 meq/100g.
  - pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.82; pH CaCl2 ~3.64–4.05.
  - %LOI ~14–18%; %Moisture loss ~4.3–5.5%.
  - Data show modest variability among sub-samples, with some blocks showing local heterogeneity in cation exchange and pH.
- Block 5 soil profiles:
  - Horizon sequence FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with depth from 0 to 100 cm (and beyond in some sections).
  - Ah horizons in the upper profile are very organic-rich (Ah 7–25 cm) with high LOI and variable C:N, and relatively low Ca in Ah (2.38 meq/100g) compared with deeper horizons.
  - Surface horizons (FH, H) show higher LOI and C; AB and Bg horizons show mottling and clay-rich textures; BCg and Cg horizons indicate accumulation of illuvial clay and complex red/yellow mottling.
  - pH H2O around 4.34–4.66 across horizons; pH CaCl2 around 3.53–4.48.
  - Exchangeable Ca generally higher in surface horizons (FH 11.91 meq/100g; H 12.54) and drops in Ah/AB horizons (Ah 2.38; AB 0.35); Mg and K generally low in upper horizons but increase in deeper horizons (Cg Ca 5.08; Mg Cg 3.5).
  - %N ranges from ~0.27–2.17; %C ranges from ~3–33% across horizons, with Ah and FH showing the highest values.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI reflect high organic content in Ah and FH horizons, diminishing with depth.
- ECOTRON soil site:
  - ECOTRON Plot 1: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Mg 1.7; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82; %Moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42.
  - Vegetation survey shows varyingTotals across Ac/Ao/At/Fr, with sporadic occurrences of several taxa across subplots.
  - Overall, ECOTRON data align with Sourhope soil characteristics: acidic pH, modest N and C in surface soils, and measurable exchangeable bases.

## Enduring relevance for environmental monitoring

- The data provide standardized, long-term records linking soil chemistry, horizon development, and vegetation composition under field management and experimental perturbations (lime, nitrogen, grazing, etc.).
- Block 4 and Block 5 datasets illustrate spatial heterogeneity, soil depth differentiation, and the interactions between organic matter, moisture, and mineral chemistry.
- ECOTRON data enable cross-site comparisons within the Environmental Change Network framework, supporting policy-relevant insights on grassland soil health and hill farming sustainability.

## Data structure and storage

- Data are organized by blocks, plots, subplots, horizons, and barcoded samples, with accompanying vegetation inventories.
- Collected samples are stored with their MLURI barcodes and archived for long-term analysis, enabling reproducibility and cross-referencing with broader Sourhope datasets.
