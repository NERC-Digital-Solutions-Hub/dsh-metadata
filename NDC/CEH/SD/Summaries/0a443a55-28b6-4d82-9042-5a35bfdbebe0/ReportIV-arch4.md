# SUMMARY

- Purpose and context
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on intensive study of a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Primary aims: understand soil biodiversity and functional roles in key ecological processes, linking below-ground activity to above-ground plant communities and feedbacks.

- Study design and data streams
  - Site layout: Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; research groups use a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide). Treatments applied annually with detailed schedules.
  - Data collection and monitoring (since 1998-1999):
    - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station recording temperature, rainfall, radiation, and soil moisture.
    - Above-ground productivity: regular biomass harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; samples oven-dried and weighed.
    - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998, then annual/biannual point analyses (2000-2002) using 100-hole grids to record species hits; bryophyte species identification enhanced in 2002.
    - Soil chemistry and moisture: periodic soil pH measurements near 5 cm depth; theta probe-based soil moisture in point analysis cells (2002 onwards).
    - Additional surveys: vegetation cover, litter, biomass by sub-plot, minirhizotron-related measurements, and site activity logs.
  - Data volume and resources: total soil samples collected since the start = 11,621; extensive appendices document species lists, biomass data, weather data, and activity summaries.

- Key data findings (beginning to end)
  - Mowing effect (site-wide management): regular mowing to ~6 cm and removal of grazing pressure favored Festuca rubra and stress-tolerant species; decline in Agrostis spp.; bryophyte (moss) expansion linked to reduced disturbance and mowing regime.
  - Fertilisation effect: nitrogen and/or lime generally increased above-ground biomass, with the strongest production where both N and lime were applied; signs of potential peak productivity in high-pH, lime-rich plots; higher pH correlated with reduced soil moisture and possible plant stress in some areas.
  - Interaction with soil properties: stronger positive correlations between soil pH and biomass when considering all plots; when isolated by treatment, relationships varied; high lime application raised pH toward 7.0 in 2002, influencing community composition and productivity.
  - Insecticide effect: enzyme-like indications that insecticide-treated plots exhibit higher diversity measures (Shannon index) over time, possibly due to altered plant-herbivore dynamics and improved establishment of palatable species; however, causality remains cautious due to limited direct insectary data.
  - Functional plant groups (CSR framework): shifts observed over time toward competitive species in fertilised plots; stress-tolerant species dominated unfertilised/improved plots; disturbance- and ruderal-driven dynamics affected by mowing and trampling.
  - Point Analysis and community structure: PCA effectively separated improved versus unimproved plots; lime-treated plots clustered distinctly; bryophyte incidence increased across years, especially in unimproved plots; litter and bryophyte dynamics varied with treatment.
  - Trampling and experimental activities: first-year C2 plots showed notable productivity reductions, likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse activities.
  - Overall productivity trends: while 2002 biomass fell relative to 2001 across several treatments, long-term (1999-2002) biomass generally increased relative to baseline; nitrogen and lime combinations consistently produced the highest productivity across years.

- Methods and analyses (data handling relevance)
  - Statistical approaches: split-plot ANOVA (for biomass across years and treatments); examination of year-by-treatment interactions; linear and polynomial correlations between soil pH, moisture, and biomass.
  - Multivariate analyses: PCA on point-analysis data with within-treatment ranking to reveal treatment groupings and species associations (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis vs. Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp.).
  - Diversity and functional grouping: Shannon Diversity Indices tracked over time; classification of species into stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress (CSR), and stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) groups to interpret ecological strategies under management regimes.
  - Appendices and data assets: extensive datasets including species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes), biomass per plot, weather data, and detailed treatment matrices; data include multiple years, enabling longitudinal analyses and cross-project comparisons.

- Data governance, quality, and continuity implications for Data Leaders
  - The study demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-faceted data collection to disentangle treatment effects, disturbance regimes, and environmental drivers.
  - Key governance considerations:
    - Consistent, well-documented data schemas across years and treatments (biomass, species hits, pH, moisture, litter).
    - Clear metadata for plots, sub-plots, and cell-level sampling locations to ensure comparability across years and researchers.
    - Robust handling of missing or compromised data (e.g., 2002 weather data gaps due to station malfunction); transparent annotations and substitution rules (e.g., substituting data from nearby stations).
    - Use of standardized analytical workflows (ANOVA, PCA, diversity indices) to enable reproducibility and cross-project integration.
  - Opportunities for Data Leaders:
    - Establish a data catalog with linkages between above-ground productivity, species composition, soil chemistry, and disturbance variables.
    - Promote data standardization and interoperability across sites to support meta-analyses and broader soil biodiversity insights.
    - Ensure long-term archiving of appendices and species lists to support future re-analysis and model development.
    - Leverage the CSR-framework and functional-group data for cross-site governance and policy-relevant interpretation.

- Challenges and limitations highlighted
  - Site-level factors affecting species independently of treatments (e.g., mowing regime influencing Agrostis decline) suggest potential confounding variables needing explicit documentation and modeling.
  - Data gaps in 2002 weather data due to instrument malfunction; reliance on substitute data reduces precision for those periods.
  - Complexity of linking insecticide effects to plant diversity without direct mechanistic insect herbivory data; interpretations remain cautious.
  - Trampling effects in C2 plots indicate that experimental procedures can influence productivity measures, necessitating careful attribution in analyses.

- Practical implications and takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Longitudinal, multi-dimensional data are essential to understand how management and environmental factors shape ecosystem function.
  - Integrating above- and below-ground measurements with disturbance regimes yields richer insights into biodiversity and productivity dynamics.
  - Transparent, well-documented data pipelines, metadata standards, and open data appendices empower cross-project learning and evidence-based decision-making.
  - Functional classification (CSR) enhances the interpretation of ecological responses to management and informs data strategy for complex, multi-treatment studies.
