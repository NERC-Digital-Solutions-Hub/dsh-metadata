# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- A regional field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, located at Sourhope, Scotland, with baseline data collected in 1998 and ongoing monitoring through 2001.
- Aimed at providing context for broader research programs via a broad, consistent monitoring framework across multiple datasets (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, vegetation).
- 2001 management was affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site officer, with protocol-driven access and one missed biocide application.

## Datasets and Measurements
- Automatic Weather Station (1999–2001)
  - Headline measures: rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, and soil moisture.
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; slight temperature decrease; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.
- Above-ground biomass (1999–2001)
  - Hierarchy of treatment effects observed consistently; peak biomass in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass analyses show significant differences between improved (N and/or Lime) vs non-improved plots; year-by-year interactions present.
- Soil pH (baseline 1998, measurements through 2001)
  - Lime additions raise soil pH; Oct 2001 averages: limed plots around 6.19, Nitrogen+Lime plots around 6.38; nitrogen alone also increases pH but to a lesser extent; control remains near baseline.
- Botanical composition (Point Quadrat survey, 2001)
  - High survey effort; two surveyors showed no significant difference in results, supporting data consistency.
  - 2001 saw 58% more hits than 2000; potential densification due to earlier grazing removal.
  - Species-level shifts across treatments: Agrostis capillaris declines with treatment; Festuca spp. increase across treatments; mixtures with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis associated with improved pastures; diversity declines in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime).
  - Principal Components Analysis differentiates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; biomass correlates with species composition (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta decline as biomass increases).
  - Increased litter frequency in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots suggests faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Experimental Design and Site Management
- Plot structure
  - Main plots with sub-plots S, T, U, V across 5 blocks; treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide.
  - Multiple measurement timepoints each summer for above-ground biomass; periodic botanical surveys and additional niche analyses (minirhizotron-related surveys) on selected subplots.
- Data collection schedule and methods
  - 0–5 cm soil sampling; pH measured in distilled water.
  - Above-ground biomass harvested from 0.5 m2 cells, dried at 80°C, and summed across five summer cuts per plot per year.
  - Point quadrat surveys used a 100-cell grid, with 25 hits per cell to assess species presence/absence and abundance.
  - 2001 included full botanical landscape assessments and supporting surveys (e.g., between 1999–2001, plus Appendix data).
- Management disruptions and responses (2001)
  - FMD restrictions limited site access February–May 2001; activity shifted to an officer-led plan with veterinary-protocol monitoring.
  - First biocide application in May 2001 missed; subsequent applications completed.

## Site Heterogeneity
- Spatial variation
  - Columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots, suggesting underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site.
  - Greater acidity associated with certain columns corresponds to lower biomass in corresponding plots.
- Biomass distribution
  - Central site plots tended to yield higher biomass; outliers often align with location on-site.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass across plots.

## Data Quality and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards
- Data provenance and consistency
  - Alignment with Baseline Data Survey (1998) and subsequent annual measurements; clear documentation of data collection dates and methods (e.g., mowing schedules, biomass harvesting).
- Data integrity
  - Inter-surveyor reliability validated (no significant difference between surveyors in 2001).
  - Biomass data were log-transformed for ANOVA to meet model assumptions; results show robust treatment effects across years.
- Metadata and lineage
  - Requirement to capture methodological changes (e.g., shift to mechanical cutting in 2001, crew changes) to explain year-to-year variability in biomass data.
  - Clear coding for species (e.g., Ac, Ao, Fr, etc.) and for treatments to maintain cross-study compatibility.
- Gaps and limitations
  - 2001 FMD restrictions created a data handling constraint with restricted access and limited sampling windows.
  - One biocide application was missed in 2001, introducing a potential anomaly in that treatment’s dataset.
- Data accessibility and stewardship
  - Weather data managed via a central data manager; other datasets (biomass, soil pH, Point Quadrat) require consistent storage, versioning, and cross-linking to enable integrated analyses.

## Implications and Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Ensure integrated datasets across weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and vegetation for holistic analysis by clearly linking measurement timelines and treatment metadata.
- Maintain detailed metadata on protocols, equipment changes (e.g., mowing methods), personnel changes, and external disruptions (FMD) to enable reproducibility and accurate interpretation of year-to-year changes.
- Preserve and standardize species codings and botanical survey methods to support cross-year and cross-study comparisons.
- Highlight data quality checks (e.g., inter-surveyor reliability) and document any deviations in methodology or sampling windows due to external events.
- Prepare for data revision or supplementation in light of site heterogeneity and potential non-interoperable regional differences across columns or blocks.

## Endnotes
- The report emphasizes context-rich, multi-dimensional data collection to support broad analyses of soil biodiversity and grassland management, with clear implications for data governance, metadata fidelity, and cross-dataset interoperability.
