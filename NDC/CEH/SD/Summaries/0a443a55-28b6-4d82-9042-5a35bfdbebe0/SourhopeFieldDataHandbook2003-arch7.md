  - Alignment with National Vegetation Classification: predominantly upland grassland communities (U4d; and moister zones showing U5b associations).
  - Indicator and co-occurring species include D. flexuosa, D. cespitosa, A. canina, H. mollis, R. repens, C. binervis, J. effusus, among others.
- Spatial patterns:
  - Vegetation composition shows clear block- and plot-scale structuring along the slope, with typical upland grassland assemblages and microhabitat variation (edge, moister furrows, damper zones).

## Block 5 Soil and Vegetation Data
- Site context: Block 5 soil and vegetation across 0–100 cm horizons with detailed horizon descriptions (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg).
- Soil profile (selected horizons):
  - FH (0–5 cm): fibrous to semi-fibrous, high OM accumulation; strong root presence.
  - H (5–7 cm): very dark, high organic content with blocky structure.
  - Ah (7–25 cm): very dark brown, sandy silt loam; strong rooting.
  - AB (25–35 cm): grey horizon with friable structure.
  - Bg (35–49 cm) and BCg (49–70 cm): reddish-brown to yellow-red mottling; clay loam to sandy clay loam; structured; moist.
  - Cg (70–100 cm): light reddish brown clay loam; massive to weak blocky structure.
- Analyses (per horizon; summary ranges):
  - %N: variable, with higher values in surface horizons (e.g., FH 11.91 meq/100g in Ca, 12.54 in H, but Ah and deeper horizons show lower values).
  - %C: high in surface horizons (e.g., FH 33.81%, H 31.06%), decreasing with depth (Ah 9.36%, AB 3.17%, Bg 0.72%, BCg 0.43%, Cg 0.12%).
  - C:N: surface values ~10–16; decreasing with depth (Fg values follow horizon-specific trends).
  - Ca: variable by horizon and subsoil layer; upper horizons (FH/H) show higher Ca (FH 11.91 meq/100g; H 12.54), AB/Bg/B cg horizons show diverse patterns (AB 0.35–5.08; Cg 5.08).
  - Na: generally low; often reported as blank or very low.
  - K: generally low to moderate (0.59–0.83 in auger samples; deeper horizons show variable values).
  - Mg: broad range; surface horizons can be high (FH 5.92; Cg 3.5).
  - %Moisture loss: surface horizons high (FH 8.16, H 9.43) decreasing with depth (Ah 5.42; Bg 2.79; BCg 3.17; Cg 3.21).
  - %Loss on Ignition: very high in surface FH (67.00%), H (59.64%), Ah (19.27%), decreasing with depth (Bg 6.05%; BCg 4.83%; Cg 4.12%).
  - pH H2O: surface horizons ~4.34–4.94; CaCl2 lowers (FH 4.48, H 4.41, Ah 3.88, AB 3.95, Bg 4.02, BCg 3.84, Cg 3.97).

  - pH CaCl2: 3.53–3.97
- Vegetation (Block 5):
  - Plots 5A–5F show species totals per subplot; upland grassland taxa present with varying abundances; patterns indicate continued alignment with upland grassland communities and microhabitat variation.

## ECOTRON SOIL SITE
- ECOTRON PLOT 1 soil: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7; %Moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
- ECOTRON PLOT vegetation: presence of grasses and other taxa; data suitable for cross-site GIS comparisons with main blocks.

## GIS and Data Product Implications
- Multilayer, horizon-resolved soil chemistry by block (4 and 5) and auger samples, with depth profiles (0–100 cm).
- Plot- and sub-plot level vegetation data linked to soil attributes, enabling spatial analyses of soil-vegetation interactions, slope-position effects, and heterogeneity along the Rigg Foot site.
- ECOTRON and Block data enable cross-site comparisons within ECN/Micronet frameworks.
- Rich metadata (horizon names, horizons by depth, horizon-specific pH, LOI, and base cations) supports soil mapping, habitat classification, and habitat suitability modelling in GIS.

## Appendices / Data Access (Context)
- Detailed horizon descriptors, horizon-by-horizon chemistry, and plot-by-plot vegetation lists accompany the data, facilitating reproducible mapping, cross-tabulations, and integration with broader ECN datasets.
