# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- A multi-site soil biodiversity study at Sourhope (Rigg Foot), establishing comprehensive vertical profiles, chemical properties, and vegetation data to enable correlation analyses, community classification, and predictive modeling of upland grassland ecosystems.

## Block 4: Soil Profile, Analyses, and Vegetation

- Soil profile and horizons (Depth and description)
  - LF: 0–1 cm – fibrous, no mineral grains, moist, smooth boundary.
  - FH: 1–4 cm – semi-fibrous, abundant fine roots, moist, smooth boundary.
  - H: 4–8 cm – black matrix colour, amorphous, moist, weak blocky structure.
  - Ah: 8–29 cm – dark reddish brown sandy silt loam, friable, many fine roots; several igneous stones; sharp boundary.
  - Abg: 29–40 cm – pinkish grey with mottling; coarse sandy loam; many igneous stones; sharp boundary.
  - B sg: 40–61 cm – brown with mottles; sandy silt loam; moist, firm; many very fine roots; many stones.
  - C gx: 61–95 cm – reddish brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; few roots; abundant igneous stones.
- Profile-level soil analyses (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx)
  - Key variables: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O), pH (CaCl2).
  - Example ranges (across horizons shown):
    - %N: ~0.42–2.14; %C: ~6.41–38.12; C:N ~10–20.
    - Ca: ~0.36–11.91 meq/100g; Mg: ~0.33–5.92 meq/100g; K: ~0.07–3.41 meq/100g; Na: generally low or not reported.
    - %Moisture loss: ~4.1–10.9; LOI: ~4.1–73.3; pH H2O: ~3.95–5.05; pH CaCl2: ~3.64–4.19 (varies by horizon).
- Auger samples (4A–4F)
  - Variables include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Notable intra-horizon variation: organic-rich surface horizons with higher LOI and lower pH; deeper horizons show higher Ca and Mg in some plots.
- Vegetation survey (Plot-level)
  - Species presence/absence and totals across subplots (4A) with per-plot totals and patterning (e.g., edge vs interior trends, dominance of certain grasses in subplots).
  - Data structured to support association analyses and NVC matching when integrated with soil data.
- ECOTRON PLOT (block 4 context)
  - Soil: Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Vegetation: presence/absence and counts across ecotron subplots; used to explore controlled-environment comparisons with field data.

## Block 5: Soil Profile, Analyses, and Vegetation

- Soil profile and horizons (Depth and description)
  - LF: 0–1 cm – fibrous; moist; no stones.
  - FH: 1–5 cm – semi-fibrous; moist; many very fine roots.
  - H: 5–7 cm – black; semi-fibrous; moist; weak blocky structure.
  - Ah: 7–25 cm – very dark brown; sandy silt loam; many fine roots; many medium igneous stones.
  - AB: 25–35 cm – grey with mottles; coarse sandy loam; friable; many fine roots; abundant igneous stones.
  - Bg: 35–49 cm – reddish brown; yellow-red mottling; sandy clay loam; mottling evident.
  - BCg: 49–70 cm – reddish-brown with mottles; clay loam; massive to blocky structure; many igneous stones.
  - Cg: 70–100 cm – light reddish brown; clay loam; massive structure; few roots; abundant igneous stones.
- Profile-level soil analyses (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg)
  - Variables similar to Block 4: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Observed patterns: surface horizons with high LOI and organic matter; pH typically acidic (~4.0–5.2 H2O; CaCl2 ~3.6–4.3); Ca and Mg show block-to-block variation; C content decreases with depth; moisture loss and overall LOI indicate substantial organic matter in surface horizons.
- Auger samples (5A–5F)
  - Variables include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Trends mirror Block 4: higher %N/%C and LOI in upper horizons; depth shows lower %N, %C, and LOI with varying cation content.
- Vegetation survey (Plot-level)
  - Plot-level species counts and totals across subplots; data prepared for cross-plot comparisons and potential association with soil chemistries.
- ECOTRON context
  - Comparable soil chemistry and vegetation data available for ecotron plots, enabling controlled-environment vs field-dataset comparisons.

## Data structure, provenance, and management

- Data identifiers and provenance
  - Data organized by blocks (Block 4 and Block 5) with horizon-specific descriptions and horizon codes; auger samples and profile pits linked to MLURI barcodes and plot IDs.
  - Vegetation and soil data paired at plot and sub-plot levels to support multivariate analyses.
- Data goals for analysis
  - Enables correlations between soil chemistry (C, N, LOI, pH, major cations) and vegetation composition.
  - Supports multivariate classifications (e.g., association analyses, community-type designation) and depth-dependent modeling of soil-vegetation relationships.
- Data integration and cross-project use
  - Data are documented for cross-project integration, with emphasis on metadata, sample provenance, and the ability to combine field and ecotron data for robust analyses.

## Implications for analysis and modeling

- Analytical opportunities
  - Correlate horizon-specific soil chemistry with vegetation patterns to understand drivers of plant community structure.
  - Use C:N, LOI, and moisture loss as proxies for soil fertility and organic matter dynamics in relation to plant species distributions.
  - Compare field data with ecotron plots to assess environmental versus soil-driven controls on biodiversity.
- Pattern indicators
  - Surface horizons show higher organic matter and lower pH; deeper horizons show more mineral-dominated chemistry and variable cation contents.
  - Block-to-block differences in Ca, Mg, and pH suggest heterogeneity that should be accounted for in statistical models (e.g., blocking, random effects).

## End notes

- The Sourhope field data handbook compiles a rich, multi-faceted dataset—combining detailed soil profiles, horizon-level chemistry, auger-based chemistry, and vegetation surveys—to support correlation analyses, community classification, and predictive modeling in upland grassland ecosystems.
