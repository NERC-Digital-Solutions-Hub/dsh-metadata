  - LOI values high in upper horizons (reflecting organic matter), declining with depth; moisture content moderate to high in upper horizons.

## Block 4: Vegetation Survey (Summary)

- Plot-level data (4A–4F) indicate species presence/absence and totals across subplots.
- Dominant signals include presence of perennial grasses and forbs; variation across plots suggests microtopography and horizon-dependent vegetation responses.
- Overall pattern indicates vegetation composition linked to shallow to deeper horizons and organic-rich surface layers.
