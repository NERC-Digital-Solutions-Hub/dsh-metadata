# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, Sourhope Site - Summary (2002)

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders).
  - Intensive botanical monitoring focused on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity.
  - Investigates how management treatments influence plant communities and their functions, within a larger soil biodiversity research context.

- Site and experimental design
  - Rigg Foot site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots (randomized), subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated per plot.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4).
  - Site management since 1999 includes: monthy mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) and insecticide application after mowing to insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots.
  - Baseline botanical survey in 1998; ongoing annual monitoring with 0.5 m2 biomass samples and 0.5 m2 point analyses; bryophyte and soil measurements added as data progressed.

- Data collection and methods
  - Weather: continuous data from on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
  - Above-ground productivity: biomass harvested from randomized 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots prior to each mowing, dried and weighed since 1999.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998 using 25-point quadrat; annual 2000–2002 point analyses with 100-hole frame and pin drops; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth) regularly since 1998; soil moisture (theta probe) measured in 2002 within point-analysis cells.
  - Data analyses: statistical comparisons (ANOVA), PCA for community composition, and calculation of Shannon diversity indices.

- Key findings: biomass and productivity
  - Long-term trend: overall biomass productivity increased from 1999 baseline, with greater gains in fertilised plots (particularly Nitrogen + Lime).
  - 2002 results: biomass production declined relative to 2001 across several treatments; most productive plots remained those with both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots were consistently less productive.
  - Slope effect: lower blocks (toward the bottom of the slope) showed larger reductions in biomass in 2002; productivity varied by position on the slope.
  - Relationship with soil properties: lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil; higher pH correlated with higher biomass, though in plots with both nitrogen and lime the relationship weakened or reversed when considered per-treatment.

- Key findings: species composition and functional groups
  - Mowing effects: consistent decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments (≈40% drop since 2000), suggesting a site-wide response to mowing and uniform disturbance; Festuca rubra expanded particularly in more fertile (lime/N) plots.
  - Fertilisation effects: nitrogen and/or lime increased productivity; combined N+L plots remained the most productive, but signs of potential peak in highly fertilised plots, possibly linked to higher pH and lower soil moisture.
  - Insecticide effects: Shannon diversity higher in some plots with insecticide; potential link to reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to establish, though evidence is circumstantial and not definitive.
  - Trampling effect: first year of C2 plots (with increased sampling activity) showed reduced productivity, likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments.
  - Bryophyte expansion: mosses increasingly abundant across the site, contributing to higher bryophyte hits (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and greater bryophyte biomass in unimproved plots; moss expansion linked to mowing height and lack of grazing.
  - Diversity and structure: Shannon diversity declined for nitrogen+lime plots between 1998 and 2002, while other treatments showed increases; point analyses revealed shifts in species groups with fertilisation and lime advancing fertile-associated grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and unimproved plots maintaining forbs and bryophytes.
  - CSR functional types and community shifts: in unimproved plots, stress-tolerant (S) species expanded; in N+L plots, competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR) and SR/CSR groups expanded, reflecting enhanced growth and altered resource conditions. Lime- and insecticide-treated plots showed reductions in certain bryophyte and SR/CSR groups.

- Key findings: data patterns and analyses
  - Point-analysis PCA: improved plots (lime and/or nitrogen) separated from unimproved plots; some nitrogen-treated samples clustered with limed plots, indicating converging vegetation traits under fertilisation and liming.
  - Treatment effects on functional groups: CSR and SR/CSR groups showed significant shifts by 2002; stress-tolerant species were favored in unimproved plots, while competitive and ruderal groups gained under lime and/or nitrogen.
  - Bryophyte dynamics: bryophytes increased across most treatments, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to changes in overall vegetation structure and biomass allocation.
  - Litter and dead vegetation: increases in litter hits in 2001–2002, especially in fertilised plots.

- Implications and interpretation (discussion highlights)
  - Mowing reduces certain grasses (Agrostis spp.) and favors Festuca rubra under nutrient-rich conditions; mosses benefit from reduced disturbance and taller swards.
  - Fertilisation enhances productivity but can lead to high pH and drier soils, potentially limiting further gains and altering species balance; nitrogen + lime fosters C-S-R type communities with greater growth but can reduce stress-tolerant flora.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are not straightforward; observed increases in diversity may reflect indirect plant-herbivore interactions but require careful interpretation given lack of direct causal evidence.
  - Trampling from 13CO2 experiments can noticeably depress productivity in nearby plots (e.g., C2), illustrating short-term disturbance effects on ecosystem function.

- Overall conclusions
  - The Sourhope site shows clear, treatment-driven shifts in productivity, species composition, and functional group balance over four years.
  - Management regimens that add nutrients or modify soil chemistry (N, Lime) have the strongest and most consistent effects on biomass and community structure, with notable interactions with soil pH and moisture.
  - Regular mowing without grazing and the absence of herbivory appear to promote bryophyte expansion and shift community dynamics toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated assemblages in unimproved plots.
  - Long-term monitoring remains essential to distinguish short-term fluctuations from persistent ecological trajectories and to evaluate policy and management implications for soil biodiversity and grassland production.
