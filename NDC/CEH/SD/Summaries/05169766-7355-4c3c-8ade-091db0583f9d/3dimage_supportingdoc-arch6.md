# OVERVIEW

- This dataset comprises 3D colour images of scanned insect specimens, plus modified intermediate images that merge traits from two specimens. The intermediate versions are prepared for 3D printing.

## Data collection and imaging methods

- Specimens collected June 2020 to August 2021 from various locations in England using a hand net.
- Euthanized by freezing at -18 C for ~30 minutes; pinned through the thorax and dried for 6–24 hours.
- Photogrammetry protocol adapted from Nguyen et al. 2014.
- Imaging setup: motorized turntable, white background, indirect LED lighting, Canon EOS 600D with a macro lens; 36 photos per specimen (12 orientations, 3 vertical positions).
- Wings removed and photographed separately to preserve detail; legs and antennae removed digitally for processing/printing and re-added later in simplified form.
- 3D shape created with 3DSOM; color texture mapped onto the 3D model to produce raw reconstructions (.obj with .jpg textures).

## 3D reconstruction, morphometrics, and intermediate images

- Starting point: photogrammetry-derived shapes and textures; Bristol-based editing with Blender.
- Transects of similarity are created in 3D morphometric space across four axes: shape, colour, pattern, and size.
- Intermediates generated by selecting points along these axes (often parallel variation; some independent variation sets).
- Deformations of shape produced with Deformetrica using large deformation diffeomorphic mapping; a single template is morphed to endpoints to derive intermediate shapes.
- Pattern manipulation: custom R scripts map patterns onto meshes, segment vertices via K-means (RGB), compute distance maps, and blend maps to create intermediate colour/patterns.
- Practical constraints: very thin structures (legs/antennae) simplified to standardized shapes for printing; wings printed as flat shapes with uniform 50% grey colour to simulate translucency.
- All components (body, legs, antennae, wings) are assembled into a full insect mesh, scaled to endpoint length, and attached to a base for stability in printing.
- Resulting assets are “modified intermediate images” provided as .ply files.

## Data formats, file naming, and structure

- Raw reconstructions: 39 instances, each with:
  - .obj file (shape),
  - _map0.jpg (texture),
  - .mtl (material details),
  - Filenames e.g., Amellifera7 (example using genus/species naming).
- Modified intermediate images (for printing): 130 .ply files.
  - Filenames encode contributions from two specimens and trait emphasis, e.g., Ca1_025_Vv12_075.ply or Tf3_C_Vv5_SPZ.ply.
  - transect_details.csv documents the specimen-trait combinations for each file.
- Reconstructed specimens metadata: reconstructed_specimens.csv (39 rows, 15 columns) with fields such as specimen_id, genus, species, sex, order, family, collection date/location, image date, and quality indicators (specimen_quality, shape_quality, texture_quality).
- Transect details: transect_details.csv (130 rows, 6 columns) including file_name, category, specimen1/specimen2 and their contributions (s1_prop, s2_prop), or trait codes (S, P, C, Z) and their modifiers.
- Coordinate system and units: .obj and .ply files use millimetres (XYZ Cartesian coordinates).

## Quality control and data governance

- Each raw scan evaluated for artefacts (holes, missing parts, mistextures); quality notes recorded in reconstructed_specimens.csv (specimen_quality, shape_quality, texture_quality).
- All modified intermediate images checked for integrity of shapes.

## Units and standards

- 3D geometry stored in standard formats (.obj, .ply) with millimetre units.
- Textures stored as standard image textures (.jpg) linked in .mtl for .obj files.
- Metadata and transect details maintained in CSV files for traceability and reproducibility.

## How this data supports data use and reuse

- Enables exploration of morphometric variation across insect specimens via multiple axes (shape, colour, pattern, size).
- Provides both real-endpoint 3D reconstructions and a suite of interpolated intermediates suitable for analysis or 3D printing.
- Rich metadata facilitates data discovery, provenance tracking, and reproducibility of analyses and data products.
- Suitable for creating self-serve data visualizations or 3D-printed educational or research models, with documented quality indicators to inform data confidence.
