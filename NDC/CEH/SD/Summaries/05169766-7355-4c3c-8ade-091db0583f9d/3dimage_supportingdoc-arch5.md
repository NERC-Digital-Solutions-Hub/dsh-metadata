# 3D insect specimens dataset with modified intermediate images suitable for 3D printing

## Overview
- A dataset comprising 3D colour images from scanned insect specimens, plus modified intermediate images that combine traits from two specimens for 3D printing.
- Raw reconstructions (.obj with textures) and modified intermediate images (.ply) are provided, with extensive metadata and provenance information.

## Dataset contents and formats
- Raw reconstructions
  - 39 specimens, each with:
    - .obj file (shape)
    - _map0.jpg (texture)
    - .mtl (material details)
  - File naming follows genus/species conventions (e.g., Amellifera7 for seventh specimen)
- Modified intermediate images (for 3D printing)
  - 130 .ply files, representing morphing between endpoints
  - File names encode specimen contributions and trait selections (e.g., Ca1_025_Vv12_075.ply)
  - Naming format details provided in transect_details.csv
- Metadata and supporting documents
  - reconstructed_specimens.csv: 39 rows, 15 columns detailing specimen_id, taxonomy, sex, collection date/location, and quality assessments (specimen_quality, shape_quality, texture_quality)
  - transect_details.csv: 130 rows, 6 columns describing file_name, contributing specimens, and their trait-based contributions (s1_prop, s2_prop; or trait letters S/P/C/Z)
- Data units and conventions
  - 3D coordinates in millimetres (OBJ: XYZ; PLY: XYZ)
  - Printing-related base and scaled attachments included for structural integrity

## Collection and generation methods
- Collection
  - Insect specimens collected June 2020 – August 2021 across various locations in England using hand nets
  - Euthanized by freezing (-18 C for ~30 minutes), pinned, and dried 6–24 hours
- Photogrammetry and modeling
  - 3D images captured via photogrammetry with a DSLR setup, 36 angles per specimen (3 vertical positions, 12 turntable orientations)
  - Wings removed and photographed separately
  - 3D meshes created using 3DSOM; color texture projected onto meshes
  - Initial “raw reconstructions” edited in Blender
- Morphometric and pattern manipulation
  - Shape deformations via Deformetrica (large deformation diffeomorphic mapping)
  - Patterns manipulated in R (K-means clustering for color segmentation; distance maps for pattern interpolation)
  - Intermediate phenotypes generated by sampling along axes of shape, color, pattern, and size
- Practical adjustments for printing
  - Legs, antennae, and wings simplified or standardized for printing
  - Wings given uniform color; leg/antenna shapes standardized to printable dimensions
  - Final assembly combines body, legs, antennae, wings, and base into a complete mesh
- Documentation of experiments
  - transect_details.csv records exact specimen contributions for each intermediate image
  - pristine note: some files include _v2 or _v3 variants representing minor design changes

## Quality control and provenance
- Raw scans and modified intermediates underwent human quality checks
  - Reconstructed specimens annotated with specimen_quality, shape_quality, texture_quality in reconstructed_specimens.csv
  - All modified intermediates checked for integrity of shapes
- File-level and specimen-level documentation included to support traceability and reproducibility

## Data governance and accessibility considerations
- Strong provenance links across data files:
  - specimen identifiers connect .obj/.mtl/.jpg to reconstructed_specimens.csv
  - transect_details.csv links each intermediate .ply to contributing specimens and trait composition
- Formats chosen for long-term accessibility and reuse:
  - Raw geometry: .obj with accompanying textures; .mtl for materials
  - Derivatives for printing: .ply
- Metadata richness supports discovery and reuse by data users and developers, including:
  - Taxonomic details, geolocation references, collection dates, and microhabitats
  - Quality indicators to assess suitability for downstream analyses orReproducibility
- Considerations for data stewards:
  - Large dataset size and multiple file formats require robust storage, metadata curation, and versioning
  - Complex naming conventions necessitate strict governance to maintain cross-reference integrity
  - Some processes involve bespoke steps (morphometric transformations, pattern mapping) that should be documented for reuse and interoperability

## Reuse and practical guidance
- Suitable uses
  - 3D printing and physical specimen replication for education or display
  - Morphometric studies leveraging the defined axes of variation (shape, color, pattern, size)
  - Visualization and dissemination of insect morphology with textured 3D models
- Reuse considerations
  - Ensure appropriate citation of both raw reconstructions and modified intermediates
  - Respect the provenance and documented processing steps when integrating with other datasets
  - Maintain links among files via specimen_id and file_name mappings to preserve traceability

## Notable challenges for data stewards (from the dataset description)
- Incomplete or uneven user needs documentation for all potential downstream users
- Obtaining timely access to data and ensuring metadata/standards are consistently applied
- Interoperability challenges due to multiple formats and specialized processing tools
- Managing very large 3D datasets and legacy/ non-interoperable pipeline components
- Ensuring accurate and consistent metadata across legacy and derivative files, including high-resolution textures and complex file naming conventions
