# Land Cover/Use Classes

## Overview
- Classifies land cover/use for four areas of interest in Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar, using SPOT 6 imagery and open-source tools.
- Classes include: Closed Canopy Forest (1), Tree Fallow (2), Shrub Fallow (3), Bare (4), Water (5), Cloud/Shadow (6), Tany Maty (Dead land) (7), Permanent Agriculture (8); NoData (0).
- Some classes are zonal-specific: Tany Maty present only in ZOI1, ZOI3, ZOI4; Permanent Agriculture present only in ZOI4.
- Approach: supervised classification with feature-rich predictors and random forest for variable selection.

## Data and Study Areas
- Study area: Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar.
- Four zones of interest (ZOI1–ZOI4) analyzed with very high-resolution imagery.
- SPOT 6 imagery used for all classifications at 6 m resolution.
- Acquisition details:
  - ZOI1: 07/21/2013, Incidence Angle 21°, 6 m resolution, ZOI1_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI2: 07/21/2013, Incidence Angle 21°, 6 m, ZOI2_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI3: 09/25/2013, Incidence Angle 22.6°, 6 m, ZOI3_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI4: 05/23/2013, Incidence Angle 21°, 6 m, ZOI4_LU_classification.tif

## Data Transformation and Preprocessing
- Pan-sharpening to create 4-band multispectral images at 6 m resolution; resampling to unify resolution.
- Image segmentation to delineate homogeneous areas for training and classification.
- Mean-shift smoothing applied prior to segmentation; segmentation followed by merging small segments into larger ones.
- Vector coverage created from the segmented image.
- Texture analysis using Haralick metrics (two versions: Simple and Higher Order) via Monteverdi/OTB; 12 most significant texture variables retained based on Random Forest results.
- Texture bands used: 12 texture bands plus four SPOT 6 bands; NDVI included as an additional band, totaling 17 input bands for feature calculation.

## Features and Feature Engineering
- 17 input bands used to compute predictor features:
  - 4 pan-sharpened SPOT 6 bands
  - 12 Haralick texture bands
  - 1 NDVI band
- For each segment, calculated features using zonal statistics:
  - Mean and standard deviation for each band
  - Mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation after clipping/removing outliers (40% total; 20% of pixels clipped and 20% highest DNs)
  - Median for each band
- Feature extraction performed in R, aligning segment zones with corresponding pixel values.

## Training Data and Modeling
- Training data generated by digitizing polygons that include several segments of the same class within a single polygon feature.
- Supervised classification approach employed.
- Random Forest classifier implemented in R (randomForest package) used for classification and to determine variable importance.

## Outputs and Application
- Produces land cover/use classification maps for CAZ zones, with classes as defined (1–8, plus NoData).
- Emphasizes using open-source software (QGIS, Monteverdi/OTB, R) for visualization, data processing, feature extraction, and classification.
- Selected the 12 most significant variables to optimize model performance and reduce dimensionality.
