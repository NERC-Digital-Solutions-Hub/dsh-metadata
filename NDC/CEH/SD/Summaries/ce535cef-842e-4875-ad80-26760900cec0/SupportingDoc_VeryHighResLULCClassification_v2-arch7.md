# Land Cover/Use Classes

## Overview
- Defines land cover/use classes with corresponding class numbers and brief comments.
- Includes special notes on presence by zone for certain classes.

## Land Cover/Use Classes (Class Numbers)
- 1 Closed Canopy Forest
- 2 Tree Fallow
- 3 Shrub Fallow
- 4 Bare
- 5 Water
- 6 Cloud/Shadow
- 7 Tany Maty (Dead land)
  - Only present in ZOI1, ZOI3, and ZOI4
- 8 Permanent Agriculture
  - Only present in ZOI4
- 0 NoData

## Data Transformation Methods
- SPOT 6 imagery used for each classification
  - ZOI1: Acquisition 2013-07-21; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI1_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI2: Acquisition 2013-07-21; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI2_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI3: Acquisition 2013-09-25; Incidence Angle 22.6°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI3_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI4: Acquisition 2013-05-23; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI4_LU_classification.tif

## Analytical Methods
- Study area: four Areas of Interest in Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar
- Data sources: very high resolution imagery; open source software
- Software tools and roles
  - QGIS: visualize imagery/classification results; digitize training data
  - Monteverdi/OTB: pan-sharpening, image segmentation, texture processing; can handle large images
  - R: generate features from multispectral/texture images and perform classification
- Preprocessing steps
  - Pan-sharpening to create 4-band multispectral image at panchromatic resolution
  - Image segmentation to delineate homogeneous areas
  - Segmentation workflow: 1) mean-shift smoothing, 2) segmentation of smoothed image, 3) merge small segments via threshold, 4) create vector coverage of segments
- Texture analysis
  - Haralick Texture Extraction (Monteverdi/OTB)
  - Two variants: Simple and Higher Order
  - Selected 12 most significant texture variables based on random forest results
  - Texture bands used: Simple (bands 3,4,5,7,8); Higher Order (bands 1,2,3,4,5,7,9)
- Feature extraction
  - 17 input bands: 4 pan-sharpened SPOT 6 bands, 12 texture bands, and NDVI
  - Features computed per segment using zonal statistics
  - For each band: mean, standard deviation; mean/std/coef. of variation after outlier clipping (remove 20% lowest and 20% highest pixels to reduce outliers)
  - Median per band
- Training data
  - Generated by digitizing and attributing polygons; include multiple segments of the same class within a single polygon feature
- Classification approach
  - Supervised classification
  - Implemented using the randomForest package in R

## Model and Output
- Objective: classify land cover/use for the four CAZ AOIs
- Output includes classified rasters corresponding to SPOT 6 imagery and the defined land cover/use classes
- Approach emphasizes data integration from multiple resolutions, feature engineering, and open source tooling with iterative, feedback-driven refinement through training data.
