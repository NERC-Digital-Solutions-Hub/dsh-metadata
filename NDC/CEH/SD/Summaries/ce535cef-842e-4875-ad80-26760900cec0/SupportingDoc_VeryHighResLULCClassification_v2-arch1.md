# Land Cover/Use Classes

## Overview
- Land cover/use classifications produced for four areas of interest in the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), Madagascar.
- Classes include: Closed Canopy Forest (1), Tree Fallow (2), Shrub Fallow (3), Tany Maty (Dead land) (7), Permanent Agriculture (8), Water (5), Cloud/Shadow (6), and NoData (0).
- Approach: supervised classification using very high-resolution imagery and open-source software.

## Class Definitions
- 1. Closed Canopy Forest
- 2. Tree Fallow
- 3. Shrub Fallow
- 4. Bare
- 5. Water
- 6. Cloud/Shadow
- 7. Tany Maty (Dead land)
- 8. Permanent Agriculture
- 0. NoData

## Data Sources and Transformation
- SPOT 6 imagery used for each classification.
- Zones of Interest (ZOI) and details:
  - ZOI1: Acquisition 07/21/2013; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI1_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI2: Acquisition 07/21/2013; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI2_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI3: Acquisition 09/25/2013; Incidence Angle 22.6°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI3_LU_classification.tif
  - ZOI4: Acquisition 05/23/2013; Incidence Angle 21°; Resolution SPOT 6 (6m); Filename ZOI4_LU_classification.tif
- Data provided with acquisition metadata and filenames.

## Preprocessing Workflow
- Pan-sharpening to create 1.5m multispectral imagery.
- Image resampling to unify resolution using the superimpose/pan-sharpening workflow.
- Image segmentation to delineate homogeneous regions.
- Texture processing to derive texture layers.

## Feature Extraction and Bandset
- Input bands (17 total) used to compute features:
  - Four pan-sharpened SPOT 6 bands
  - Twelve Haralick texture bands (two versions: Simple and Higher Order)
  - NDVI band
- Haralick texture extraction performed with:
  - Simple texture metrics
  - Higher Order texture metrics
  - A subset retained based on variable importance from random forest
- Specifics:
  - Simple texture: bands 3,4,5,7,8
  - Higher Order texture: bands 1,2,3,4,5,7,9
- Feature creation for each segment:
  - For each input band: mean, standard deviation
  - After clipping (remove 40% of pixels: 20% lowest and 20% highest DN pixels): mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation
  - Median
- 17-band feature set used to model inputs.

## Segmentation and Training Data
- Segmentation produces segments used as training data; several segments of the same class within a single polygon were included as a single feature.
- Training data generated by digitizing and attributing polygons corresponding to each class.
- Training data prepared for a supervised learning approach.

## Modeling and Classification
- Classification approach: supervised classification using a Random Forest model.
- Software used for modeling: R with the randomForest package.
- Objective: derive land cover/use classifications for CAZ areas using extracted features and labeled segments.

## Software and Tools
- Open-source software:
  - QGIS: visualization, digitizing training data, and result inspection
  - Monteverdi/OTB: pan-sharpening, image segmentation, texture processing, handling large images
  - R: feature calculation, statistical summarization, random forest classification

## Scope and Public Health/Accessibility Notes
- The workflow emphasizes reproducibility and open-source tooling.
- Focused on four CAZ zones with high-resolution imagery to derive detailed land cover/use maps.
- Data and processing steps include provenance (acquisition dates, angles, resolutions, and file names) to support traceability.
