# Dissolved Carbon and Gas Analysis in Black Burn Stream (2007–2011)

## Overview
- Weekly streamwater sampling from the Black Burn (coordinates provided) between January 2007 and December 2011; measurements ongoing at the time of writing.
- Aim is to analyse particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) using headspace techniques and standard laboratory analyses.
- Headspace method used to estimate dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O; replicate headspace samples collected for quality assurance.

## Terminology
- POC: Particulate organic carbon (size > 0.7 µm)
- DOC: Dissolved organic carbon
- DIC: Dissolved inorganic carbon

## Collection Methods
- Sampling: ~300 mL glass bottles used for POC, DOC, and DIC analysis.
- Headspace technique: For each occasion, 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air at stream temperature to form headspace; two replicate headspace samples collected plus a separate ambient air sample.
- Sampling cadence: Approximately weekly.
- Preservation: Filtrate stored in the dark at 5°C until analysis (within 2 weeks).

## Analytical Methods
- Filtration: Water samples filtered within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm); POC determined by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964 method).
- DOC/DIC: Filtrate analyzed for DOC and DIC using a Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 TOC analyser (2007) or a PPM LABTOC Analyser (2008 onwards); detection range 0.1–4000 mg C L⁻¹.
- Headspace analysis: Headspace samples analyzed within two weeks using an HP5890 Series II GC with electron capture detector (for N2O) and flame ionisation detector with methaniser (for CH4/CO2).
- Quantification: Concentrations derived from linear regression of GC peak areas against four known standards.

## Dissolved Gas Calculation
- Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations calculated via Henry’s Law.
- Inputs: mean of replicate headspace concentrations, ambient air concentrations, stream water temperature (measured at sampling), and air pressure.

## Units of Recorded Values
- POC: mg C L⁻¹
- DOC: mg C L⁻¹
- DIC: mg C L⁻¹
- CO2: mg C L⁻¹
- CH4: µg C L⁻¹
- N2O: µg N L⁻¹
