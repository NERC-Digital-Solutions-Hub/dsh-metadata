# Measurement of POC, DOC, DIC, CO2, CH4 and N2O in Black Burn Stream Water (2007–2011)

- Study scope and goal
  - Weekly streamwater sampling at the Black Burn (55°47'41" N, 3°14'52" W) from January 2007 to December 2011; measurements ongoing at the time of writing.
  - Aimed at quantifying particulate and dissolved carbon species and dissolved greenhouse gases.

- Terminology
  - POC: Particulate Organic Carbon, defined as >0.7 µm in size.
  - DOC: Dissolved Organic Carbon.
  - DIC: Dissolved Inorganic Carbon.

- Collection methods
  - On each occasion, a 300 mL glass bottle collected for POC, DOC, and DIC analysis.
  - Dissolved gas measurements via headspace technique: 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air at stream temperature; vigorous shaking for 1 minute; headspace transferred to a gas-tight syringe; two replicate headspace samples collected, plus a separate ambient air sample.

- Analytical methods
  - Filtration within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm); POC determined by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964).
  - Filtrate stored in the dark at 5°C and analyzed for DOC and DIC within 2 weeks using a Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 or a PPM LABTOC TOC analyzer (detection 0.1–4000 mg L-1).
  - Headspace gases analyzed within two weeks via HP5890 Series II GC with electron capture detector (N2O) and flame ionisation detector (CH4/CO2, with methaniser).

- Dissolved gas calculation
  - CO2, CH4, and N2O dissolved concentrations calculated using Henry’s Law from the mean headspace concentrations, ambient air concentrations, stream water temperature, and air pressure.

- Units of recorded values
  - POC: mg C L-1
  - DOC: mg C L-1
  - DIC: mg C L-1
  - CO2: mg C L-1
  - CH4: µg C L-1
  - N2O: µg N L-1

- Data governance and quality notes
  - Filtration and storage protocols (filtration within 24 h; dark storage at 5°C; analysis within 2 weeks) support data quality.
  - Replication: two replicate headspace samples per event plus ambient air sample to ensure measurement reliability.
  - Instrumentation and methods are described with calibration context (standards used for GC analysis).
