# Dissolved Gases in Black Burn Stream Water: Collection and Analysis Methods (2007–2011)

- Purpose and scope: Assess concentrations of POC, DOC, DIC, CO2, CH4, and N2O in stream water to inform environmental monitoring; weekly sampling at the Black Burn from January 2007 to December 2011 (measurements ongoing at the time of writing).

- Terminology:
  - POC: Particulate organic carbon, defined as >0.7 µm
  - DOC: Dissolved organic carbon
  - DIC: Dissolved inorganic carbon

- Collection methods:
  - Sampling frequency and location: Approximately weekly streamwater samples collected at the Black Burn (coordinates provided) from January 2007 to December 2011; ongoing measurements.
  - Sample handling: On each occasion, 300 mL glass bottles used for POC, DOC, and DIC analysis.
  - Gas sample collection: Two replicate headspace samples per occasion, plus a separate ambient air sample.
  - Headspace technique: Equilibrate 40 mL of streamwater with 20 mL ambient air at stream temperature by vigorous shaking under water for one minute; transfer equilibrated headspace to a gas-tight syringe for laboratory analysis.

- Analytical methods:
  - Filtration and POC determination: Filters pre-ashed (500°C for 6 hours) and pre-weighed; filtration within 24 hours; POC determined by loss-on-ignition following Ball (1964).
  - DOC and DIC analysis: Filtrate stored in the dark at 5°C and analyzed within 2 weeks using a Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 total organic carbon analyser (2007) or a PPM LABTOC analyser (2008 onwards); detection ranges 0.1–4000 mg C L^-1.
  - Gas analysis: Headspace samples analyzed within two weeks using an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph with electron capture detector (for N2O) and flame ionisation detector with attached methaniser (for CH4/CO2); concentrations determined from linear regression of peak areas against four standards.

- Dissolved gas calculation:
  - Gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in solution calculated using Henry’s Law from the mean of replicate headspace concentrations, ambient air concentrations, water temperature, and air pressure.

- Units:
  - POC: mg C L^-1
  - DOC: mg C L^-1
  - DIC: mg C L^-1
  - CO2: mg C L^-1
  - CH4: µg C L^-1
  - N2O: µg N L^-1

- Quality and reporting notes:
  - Replicate measurements for headspace samples and inclusion of ambient air samples for calibration.
  - Data interpretation relies on temperature and pressure corrections via Henry’s Law to convert headspace data to dissolved concentrations.
