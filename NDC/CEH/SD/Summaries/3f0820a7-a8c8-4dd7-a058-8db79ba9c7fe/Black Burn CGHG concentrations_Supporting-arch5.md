# Collection and Analytical Methods for Carbon Species in Black Burn Stream Water (2007-2011)

## Overview
- Document details the collection, analysis, and calculation methods for particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in stream water from the Black Burn.
- Sampling occurred approximately weekly from January 2007 to December 2011; measurements are ongoing at the time of writing.
- Data are intended to support understanding of carbon fluxes and require careful data governance, metadata, and method documentation for reuse.

## Sampling and Collection
- Location: Black Burn (55º 47' 41" N, 3º 14' 52" W).
- Sample type and volume: 300 mL glass bottles for POC, DOC, and DIC analyses.
- Headspace sampling: on each occasion, two replicate headspace samples were collected, plus a separate ambient air sample.
- Dissolved gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) measured using headspace technique with gas transfer from water to air.

## Analytical Methods
- Filtration and POC determination:
  - Filtration within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
  - POC quantified by loss-on-ignition (Ball, 1964).
- DOC/DIC analysis:
  - Filtrate stored dark at 5°C; analyzed within 2 weeks.
  - Instruments: Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 or PPM LABTOC Total Organic Carbon analyser.
  - Detection range: 0.1–4000 mg L-1 for DOC/DIC.
- Headspace gas analysis:
  - Gas chromatography (HP 5890 Series II) with electron capture detector for N2O and flame ionisation detector (with methaniser) for CH4/CO2.
  - Analysis performed within two weeks of collection.
  - Concentrations derived from calibration with four standards.
- Calculations:
  - Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O computed from mean replicate headspace concentrations using Henry’s Law.
  - Inputs: mean headspace concentrations, ambient air concentration, stream temperature (measured at sampling), and air pressure.

## Data and Units
- POC: mg C L-1
- DOC: mg C L-1
- DIC: mg C L-1
- CO2: mg C L-1
- CH4: µg C L-1
- N2O: µg N L-1

## Data Stewardship and Governance Considerations
- Documentation and traceability:
  - Clear record of sampling dates, locations, volumes, filtration procedures, instrument models, and calculation methods.
  - Metadata should capture temperature, pressure, and ambient air concentrations used in calculations.
- Data quality and interoperability:
  - Adherence to standardized units and detection ranges to enable cross-study comparisons.
  - Use of consistent Henry’s Law-based calculations and reference standards.
- Data availability and updates:
  - Ongoing measurements require versioned methods and timely updates to datasets.
  - Documentation of any methodological changes (e.g., instrument upgrades) to maintain data comparability.
