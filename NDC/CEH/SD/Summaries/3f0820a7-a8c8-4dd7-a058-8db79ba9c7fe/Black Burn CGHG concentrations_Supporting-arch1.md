# Collection Methods and Analytical Techniques for Dissolved Carbon and Gases in Black Burn Stream (2007–2011)

- Terminology
  - POC: Particulate organic carbon (size > 0.7 µm)
  - DOC: Dissolved organic carbon
  - DIC: Dissolved inorganic carbon

- Collection Methods
  - Streamwater sampling conducted approximately weekly on the Black Burn (coordinates: 55º 47' 41" N, 3º 14' 52" W) from January 2007 to December 2011; measurements ongoing at the time of writing.
  - On each occasion, 300 mL glass bottles used to collect water for analysis of POC, DOC, and DIC.
  - Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O calculated using the headspace technique.
    - A 40 mL water sample equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air at stream temperature by vigorously shaking under water for one minute.
    - Equilibrated headspace transferred to a gas-tight syringe for laboratory analysis.
    - Two replicate headspace samples collected per occasion, plus a separate ambient air sample.

- Analytical Methods
  - Filtration: Stream water filtered within 24 hours through pre-ashed (6 hours at 500°C) Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
  - POC: Calculated by loss-on-ignition (Ball, 1964).
  - DOC and DIC: Filtrate stored in the dark at 5°C and analyzed within 2 weeks.
    - Instruments:
      - 2007: Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 total organic C analyser
      - 2008 onwards: PPM LABTOC Analyser
    - Detection range: 0.1–4000 mg C L⁻¹ for both DOC and DIC.
  - Headspace gas analysis: Within two weeks of collection using an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph with:
    - Electron capture detector (ECD) for N2O
    - Flame ionisation detector (FID) with attached methaniser for CH4/CO2
    - Concentrations derived from linear regression of peak areas against four known standards.

- Dissolved Gas Calculation
  - Concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O dissolved in stream water calculated using Henry’s Law.
  - Inputs: mean of replicate headspace concentrations, ambient air concentration, measured stream water temperature, and air pressure.

- Units of Recorded Values
  - POC: mg C L⁻¹
  - DOC: mg C L⁻¹
  - DIC: mg C L⁻¹
  - CO2: mg C L⁻¹
  - CH4: µg C L⁻¹
  - N2O: µg N L⁻¹
