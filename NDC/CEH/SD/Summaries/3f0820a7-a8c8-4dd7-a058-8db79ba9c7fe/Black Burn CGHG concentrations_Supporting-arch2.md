# Terminology and Methods for Measuring POC, DOC, DIC and Dissolved Gases in Stream Water

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides terminology and standardized collection, analytical, and calculation methods for evaluating particulate organic carbon (POC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and dissolved gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) in stream water.
  - Aims to support consistent data to monitor environmental health over time.

- Terminology
  - POC: Particulate organic carbon, defined by size > 0.7 µm
  - DOC: Dissolved organic carbon
  - DIC: Dissolved inorganic carbon

- Collection methods
  - Sampling site: Black Burn (approximately weekly from January 2007 to December 2011; measurements ongoing at the time of writing) at coordinates 55º 47' 41" N, 3º 14' 52" W.
  - Sample volumes: 300 mL water samples collected for POC, DOC, and DIC analysis.
  - Dissolved gases: CO2, CH4, and N2O quantified via headspace technique. For each sampling:
    - 40 mL water sample equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air at stream temperature by vigorous shaking for 1 minute.
    - The equilibrated headspace is transferred to a gas-tight syringe for laboratory analysis.
    - Two replicate headspace samples collected per occasion, plus a separate ambient air sample.

- Analytical methods
  - Filtration and POC
    - Water samples filtered within 24 hours through pre-ashed (500°C, 6 h) Whatman GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
    - POC determined by loss-on-ignition following Ball (1964).
  - DOC and DIC
    - Filtrate stored in darkness at 5°C until analysis within 2 weeks.
    - DOC and DIC concentrations measured with either a Rosemount-Dohrmann DC-80 total organic carbon analyzer (2007) or a PPM LABTOC analyzer (2008 onwards).
    - Detection range: 0.1–4000 mg L−1 for both DOC and DIC.
  - Headspace gas analyses
    - Headspace samples analyzed within two weeks using an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph with electron capture detector (for N2O) and flame ionisation detector (with attached methaniser for CH4/CO2).
    - Concentrations derived from linear regression of peak areas against four known standards.
  - Ambient air
    - A separate ambient air sample collected and used as a reference in calculations.

- Dissolved gas calculations
  - Dissolved CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations calculated from Henry’s Law using:
    - Mean replicate headspace concentrations
    - Ambient air concentration
    - Stream water temperature (measured at sampling)
    - Ambient air pressure

- Units
  - POC: mg C L−1
  - DOC: mg C L−1
  - DIC: mg C L−1
  - CO2: mg C L−1
  - CH4: µg C L−1
  - N2O: µg N L−1

- Data handling and quality considerations
  - Replicate headspace samples and ambient air samples support measurement reliability.
  - Filtration and sample storage conditions are specified to preserve sample integrity.
  - Analyses conducted within defined timeframes to ensure data validity.
