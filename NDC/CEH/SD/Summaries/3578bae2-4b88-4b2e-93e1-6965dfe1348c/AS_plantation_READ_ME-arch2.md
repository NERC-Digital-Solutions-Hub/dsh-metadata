# Nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity of 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees in Panama

## Overview
- Dataset on nitrogen fixation, phosphatase activity, plant nitrogen and phosphorus demand, and soil nitrogen and phosphorus availability for 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees across seven species.
- Collected in an experimental plantation at Agua Salud Native Species Plantation, El Giral, Panama (wet season, Aug–Sep 2011).
- Aimed to test two hypotheses about plant investment in nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity: nutrient trading and nutrient balance.
- Associated with Batterman et al. (2018) Ecology Letters; metadata file accompanies the dataset; citation requested.

## Dataset contents
- One CSV file with 13 columns and 98 rows; missing values indicated as NA.
- Each row represents a single tree; includes measurements of:
  - Nitrogen fixation (measured via multiple approaches) and nodule biomass
  - Phosphatase activity from 5 fine root samples per tree
  - Soil nitrate, ammonium, and Bray-extractable phosphorus at the base of the tree
  - Formatted to express nitrogen and phosphorus demand based on tissue biomass

## Methods and site context
- Planting: trees established ~3 meters apart in plots across a sloped landscape in 2008; fertilized once with N-P-K; competition minimized by annual hand clearing.
- Growth estimation: basal diameter converted to tissue-specific biomass (leaves, branches, stem) using site- and species-specific allometric equations; 2009 basal diameter used to project growth to 2011.
- Nutrient content and demand: species-specific leaf and wood N and P contents drawn from literature; used to convert biomass growth (2009–2011) into N and P demand.
- Nitrogen fixation measurements:
  - Nodule biomass assessment from six 5.5 cm soil cores near each tree
  - Acetylene reduction assays on nodules from fine roots
  - 15N isotope incorporation in nodules for a subset to determine N fixed relative to controls
  - Results expressed as nodule biomass and nitrogen fixation rate per area of rooting zone
- Phosphatase measurement: conducted on 5 fine root samples per tree within two weeks of collection
- Data timeline: roots and soils sampled in August–September 2011; assays performed soon after collection

## Data handling and usage notes
- Data are aligned for cross-species comparisons of nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity.
- Columns include derived estimates of nutrient demand and soil availability, enabling analyses of nutrient dynamics under tropical rainforest conditions.
- The dataset is complemented by a metadata file with the dataset key for interpretation and reuse.
- When using the dataset, please cite Batterman et al. (2018) and the dataset citation.
