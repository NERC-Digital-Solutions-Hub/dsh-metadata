# Nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity of 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees in Panama

## Overview
- A dataset accompanying a study that tested nutrient trading and nutrient balance hypotheses in tropical rainforest trees.
- Focuses on nitrogen fixation, phosphatase activity, plant nitrogen and phosphorus demand, and soil nitrogen and phosphorus availability across seven species in Panama.
- Used to compare species differences in phosphatase activity and nitrogen fixation.

## Dataset contents
- One CSV file with 13 columns and 98 rows (row per tree).
- Includes data for 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees; missing values are indicated as NA.
- Accompanies a metadata file that provides the key to the dataset.

## Site, design, and timing
- Location: Agua Salud Native Species Plantation, El Giral, Panama (9°12'50.15"N, 79°43'.26"W).
- Planted in 2008 with trees spaced ~3 meters apart on sloped terrain.
- One-time fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (N-P-K); surrounding vegetation cleared annually to reduce competition.
- Data collected in August–September 2011 (wet season).

## Measurements and methods
- Phosphatase activity:
  - Measured on 5 fine root samples per tree within two weeks of collection.
  - Expressed per root biomass of dry roots; means calculated per tree.
- Soil nutrients:
  - Samples taken at the base of each tree for nitrate, ammonium, and Bray-extractable phosphorus.
- Nitrogen fixation (three approaches):
  1) Nodule biomass from six 5.5 cm diameter soil cores near each tree base.
  2) Acetylene reduction assay on nodules excavated from fine roots.
  3) Isotope approach: incubation with labeled 15N and analysis via isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine nitrogen fixed relative to controls.
- Data are expressed as nodule biomass and grams of nitrogen fixed per area of rooting zone.
- Basal diameter converted to tissue-specific biomass (leaves, branches, stem) using site- and species-specific allometric equations.
- Growth between 2009 and 2011 used to estimate biomass changes; species-specific leaf and wood N and P contents taken from literature to compute N and P demand.

## Data processing and quality
- Data collection and analysis conducted by Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute, Princeton University, and University of Leeds.
- Data quality considerations include missing values (NA) and reliance on literature-based conversion factors.
- Requires reference to the accompanying metadata file for dataset key and context.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Dataset structure: 13 columns, 98 rows; measurements per tree, including root samples, soil nutrients, nodules, fixation rates, and biomass/demand estimates.
- Data and methods described in Batterman et al. 2018 (Ecology Letters) with the dataset described and accessible via the associated metadata and citation.

## Metadata, citation, and provenance

## Relevance for monitoring and governance
- Demonstrates end-to-end data life cycle: from field collection and laboratory assays to biomass and nutrient demand calculations, with explicit metadata needs and data provenance.
- Highlights data challenges relevant to monitoring frameworks: data gaps, complexity of measurements, need for metadata completeness, data transformation requirements, and transparent data sharing and governance.
