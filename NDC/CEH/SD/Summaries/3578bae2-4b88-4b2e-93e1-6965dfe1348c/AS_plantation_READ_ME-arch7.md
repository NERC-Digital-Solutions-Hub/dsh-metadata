# Nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity of 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees in Panama

## Overview
- Dataset from seven tree species at the Agua Salud Native Species Plantation, El Giral, Panama, analyzing nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity in relation to nutrient demand and soil availability.
- Aims to test two hypotheses: nutrient trading and nutrient balance; results indicate species differences drive phosphatase activity and nitrogen fixation more than the trading/balance hypotheses.
- Data collection conducted by Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Princeton University; analyzed by the University of Leeds.
- The dataset accompanies a 2018 Ecology Letters paper (Batterman et al.) describing site characteristics, methods, and metadata.

## Data file and structure
- One CSV file with 13 columns and 98 rows.
- Missing values indicated as NA.
- Each row represents a tree; seven species are represented across plots on a sloped landscape.
- Site coordinates provided for the plantation location: 9°12'50.15"N, 79°43'.26"W.

## Measurements and methods
- Phosphatase activity: measured on 5 fine root samples per tree; results expressed per root biomass; means calculated per tree.
- Soil nutrients sampled at each tree base: nitrate, ammonium, and Bray-extractable phosphorus.
- Nitrogen fixation assessed via three approaches:
  1) Nodule biomass from six 5.5 cm soil cores near the tree base.
  2) Acetylene reduction assay on nodules excavated from fine roots.
  3) 15N isotope labeling with incubation and isotope ratio mass spectrometry to determine fixed nitrogen relative to controls.
- Data presentation: nitrogen fixation and nodule biomass expressed per area of rooting zone.
- Basal diameter used to estimate tissue-specific biomass (leaves, branches, stem) via species-specific allometric equations.
- Growth between 2009 and 2011 inferred from starting basal diameter in 2009.
- Nitrogen and phosphorus contents in leaves and wood, from literature, used to convert biomass growth into N and P demand.

## Site and sampling context
- Planting: trees were planted approximately every 3 meters in plots during 2008; fertilized once with N-P-K; vegetation cleared annually to reduce competition.
- Sampling period: August–September 2011 (wet season).
- Location details enable spatial interpretation within the plantation; data structure supports per-tree spatial analyses if coordinates are available.

## Data processing, provenance, and citation
- Data processing and analysis performed to test nutrient-trading and nutrient-balance hypotheses.

- The dataset is linked to the Ecology Letters 2018 paper: Phosphatase activity and nitrogen fixation reflect species differences, not nutrient trading or nutrient balance, across tropical rainforest trees (DOI provided in associated publication).

## GIS relevance and integration
- Suitable for map-based visualization of species differences and spatial patterns of soil nutrients, root phosphatase activity, and nitrogen fixation within a plantation.
- Can be combined with soil N, soil P, and plant N/P demand data to create spatially explicit nutrient dynamics maps.
- Useful for policy and outreach visuals when comparing species-specific nutrient strategies and their environmental context.
