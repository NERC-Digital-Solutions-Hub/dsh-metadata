# Nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity of 97 nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing trees in Panama

- Purpose of the dataset: collects measurements on nitrogen fixation, phosphatase activity, plant nitrogen and phosphorus demand, and soil nitrogen and phosphorus availability for seven tree species (nitrogen-fixing and non-fixing) grown in an experimental plantation in Panama. Aims to test two hypotheses on plant nutrient investment: nutrient trading and nutrient balance.

- Provenance and context:
  - Collected by Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute and Princeton University; analyzed by University of Leeds.
  - Accompanies Batterman et al. 2018 Ecology Letters article; metadata file with the dataset key available.
  - Site: Agua Salud Native Species Plantation, El Giral, Panama (coordinates provided).

- Dataset structure and contents:
  - Format: one CSV file with 13 columns and 98 rows.
  - Each row represents a single tree; missing data indicated by NA.
  - Key data types include:
    - Phosphatase activity measured on 5 fine root samples per tree.
    - Nitrogen fixation metrics obtained via three approaches (nodules biomass, acetylene reduction assay, and 15N isotope analysis), expressed as nitrogen fixed per area of rooting zone.
    - Soil measurements at tree bases: nitrate, ammonium, Bray-extractable phosphorus.
    - Plant biomass conversions: basal diameter converted to tissue-specific biomass (leaves, branches, stem) using species- and site-specific allometric equations.
    - Nutrient demand: nitrogen and phosphorus contents for leaves and wood, sourced from literature to translate biomass growth into N and P demand.
  - Temporal and spatial scope:
    - Trees planted circa 2008 at ~3 m spacing; fertilized once with N-P-K; vegetation cleared annually to reduce competition.
    - Data collected August–September 2011 (wet season).
    - Growth and biomass estimates cover 2009–2011.

- Methods in brief:
  - Planting and management described; data collection includes root sampling, phosphatase assays, and soil nutrient analyses.
  - Nitrogen fixation procedures include nodules counting/biomass, acetylene reduction assays, and selective 15N labeling with isotope ratio mass spectrometry for subset validation.
  - Biomass and nutrient demand calculations rely on allometric equations and literature-derived tissue nutrient contents.
  - Data expressed as nodule biomass and nitrogen fixation rate per rooting zone, with conversion to total plant N and P demands.

- Data completeness and quality notes:
  - NA indicates missing values for certain measurements or measurements not performed for particular trees.
  - Metadata file provides a key to interpreting the dataset columns.

- Governance and usage guidance:
  - Intended for secondary analyses and cross-study comparisons, particularly in evaluating whether nitrogen fixation and phosphatase activity align with species differences rather than the nutrient trading/balance hypotheses.
  - When using the dataset, cite Batterman et al. (2018) and the dataset-specific citation provided in the accompanying metadata.
  - Recognize the dataset’s scope (seven species, 97 trees included in the analysis) and its linkage to the Ecology Letters publication for broader context, site characteristics, and methods.

- Funding and provenance:
  - Funded by multiple sources including ForestGEO, Heising-Simons Foundation, HSBC, Stanley Motta, Small World Institute Fund, various Smithsonian grants, NSF (EAR-1360391), National University of Singapore, Yale-NUS College, Princeton University initiatives, and related programs.
