- Key data points
  - LL: Little Langton
  - Hill House farm cottages, postal code DL7 0PZ
  - OV7: Overton farm, field 7
  - Location: Overton, York

- Data implications for analysis
  - Two distinct property units with short identifiers suitable for cataloguing
  - Potential for geocoding and spatial mapping once coordinates are available
  - Could be linked to land parcel or agricultural datasets if parcel IDs or boundaries are obtained

- Gaps and quality considerations
  - No latitude/longitude coordinates or explicit country/administrative boundaries
  - Addresses are brief and may require standardisation and verification
  - Ambiguity risk for “Overton” without additional disambiguation or contextual metadata

- Suggested analyses or uses for an Analyst
  - Geospatial linking: map to districts/parishes and compare with other land-use data
  - Data integration: join with property, tenancy, or agricultural records if available
  - Validation: cross-check against authoritative gazetteers or parcel registries

- Next steps for data quality and usability
  - Obtain precise coordinates for LL and OV7 locations
  - Add administrative levels (county, parish) and country
  - Standardise address format and document data provenance (source, collection date)
  - Create and upload metadata/dataset descriptors to improve discoverability
