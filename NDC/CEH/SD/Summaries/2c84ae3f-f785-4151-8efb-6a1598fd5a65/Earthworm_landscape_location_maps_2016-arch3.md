- Content details
  - LL entry: Little Langton, Hill House farm cottages, postal code DL7 0PZ
  - OV7 entry: Overton farm, field 7, Overton, York

- Observations relevant to monitoring frameworks
  - No environmental health metrics, indicators, or monitoring results present
  - Absence of metadata (coordinates, data sources, update frequency, ownership, dataset provenance)
  - No data governance or sharing information

- Implications for authors of monitoring frameworks
  - This document appears as a potential site inventory or base dataset lacking monitoring context
  - To be usable in monitoring frameworks, must attach metadata and identifiers

- Recommendations for improving for monitoring use
  - Define a data model: site entity with attributes (name, type, address, coordinates, parcel/field ID, owner)
  - Include metadata standards and provenance (source, date collected, validity, version)
  - State data quality checks, update cadence, and governance (access, sharing, privacy)
  - Enable linking to environmental health measures and other datasets (emissions, land use, health indicators)
  - Consider structures for dissemination (reports, dashboards) with clear data lineage
