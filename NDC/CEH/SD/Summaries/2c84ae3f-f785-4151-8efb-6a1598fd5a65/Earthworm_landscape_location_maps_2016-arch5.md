- Overview
  - The document lists two geographic entries identified by codes LL and OV7, including their corresponding addresses.

- Location records
  - LL: Little Langton; Hill House farm cottages, DL7 0PZ
  - OV7: Overton farm, field 7; Overton, York

- Data governance implications for Data Stewards
  - Use the provided codes (LL, OV7) as stable identifiers for spatial datasets.
  - Capture structured metadata: location name, address components, and postcode (e.g., DL7 0PZ).
  - Consider adding geocoordinates if available to improve discoverability and interoperability.
  - Document provenance (source of the location data) and capture/update dates.
  - Ensure consistency in formatting and validation of addresses to support accurate cataloguing.

- Recommendations for data management
  - Standardize address fields (e.g., address_line1, locality, postal_code, country).
  - Include explicit location type (e.g., farm, field, rural address) to aid filtering and discovery.
  - Establish update mechanisms to reflect any changes to names or addresses.
  - If sharing datasets, align with existing governance standards and schemas for location data.
