# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A UK-wide program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Volunteer-led, collecting annual population data for butterflies through site-based monitoring and random 1km square sampling.
- Data integrated from multiple components to support understanding of biodiversity status and policy questions.
- Core for map-based data products and spatial analyses, with wide geographic and temporal coverage since 1976.

## Data collection framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, 26 counts/year from April to September; ~2000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts—fewer, targeted surveys.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares; two parallel 1 km transects; 2–4 visits per year (incl. July/August); ~750 squares/year.
- All components feed into a unified UKBMS dataset for analysis of species abundance.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts, based on transect sections/sites.
- Collated indices created with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) plus weighting by proportion of flight period surveyed each year.
- All seasonal counts used to estimate yearly patterns; observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.
- Data supports long-term, short-term, and last-decade trend assessments by species (across Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS).

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag unusual counts or records outside known flight periods; regional transect coordinators review data.
- Further automated/manual validation queries address out-of-range records, first-time site records, extreme values, or atypical site-year patterns.
- Corrections implemented through queries and coordination with recorders.
