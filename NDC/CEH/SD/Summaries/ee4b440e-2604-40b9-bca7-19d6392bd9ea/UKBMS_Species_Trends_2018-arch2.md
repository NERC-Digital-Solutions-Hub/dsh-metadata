# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- An organized, funded collaboration between Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Relies on volunteers to collect annual data on butterfly population status across the UK.
- Combines site-based monitoring with sampling in randomly selected 1 km squares.
- Three sampling components: Pollard walks (transects), reduced effort surveys, and the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS).
- In operation since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Outputs support understanding of insect population changes and policy questions on biodiversity status and trends.

## How data are collected (framework)
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (typically 2–4 km); record all butterfly species within a ~5 m band weekly from April to September; ~26 counts per year; ~2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for particular species.
- WCBS: transect methodology applied to stratified-random 1 km squares; 2–4 visits per square (minimum two in July/August), ~750 squares annually.
- Data collection emphasizes consistent protocols and weather conditions suitable for butterfly activity.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) derived from counts along transects and sites.
- Collation of site indices into species-wide indices via the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- Seasonal pattern estimation from all counts (Pollard, reduced surveys, WCBS) to extrapolate gaps; observed data given more influence through weighting.
- Indices are designed to reflect population trends rather than absolute counts and are validated against more intensive methods (e.g., mark-release-recapture).

## Quality control
- Field data enter via UKBMS online system or Transect Walker; automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., out-of-season records, unusually high counts).
- Regional transect coordinators validate records and monitor data throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validations check for out-of-range distributions, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; corrections are made through data queries and edits to the main UKBMS dataset.

## Details of this data download
- Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data; delivered as a CSV file.
- Key columns include: COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS; F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDETAIL, F_FULL_R; and similarly for 20-year (T20) and 10-year (T10) trend metrics (B, SE, P, TRENDDETAIL, R).
- Includes explanatory fields describing trend direction (rapid decline, rapid increase, stable) based on slope and P-values.

## Licence and attribution
- Open Government Licence (OGL) for data use and reuse; citation with DOI required in publications using the data.
- Attribution statement to accompany data-derived outputs: UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.

## Collaboration and contact details
- UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation; potential for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications, conferences, or posters.

## Challenges and opportunities
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating UKBMS data with other relevant data sources (moving beyond single-use outputs).
- Facilitating broader access to underlying data used to generate outputs, enabling reuse and broader analyses.
