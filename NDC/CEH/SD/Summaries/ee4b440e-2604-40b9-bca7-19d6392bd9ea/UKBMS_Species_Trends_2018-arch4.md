# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, relying on volunteers.
  - Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to understand insect trends and inform biodiversity and policy questions.
  - History and scope: monitored since 1976 with over 2500 active sites each year; results combine across components to produce species-level trends.

- Data collection and design
  - Components
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, all species recorded weekly from April to September (about 26 counts/year), ~2000 sites.
    - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects with 2–4 visits/year (min 2 in July/Aug), started in 2009, ~750 squares/year.
  - Data sources and references for methodology are documented (Pollard & Yates, 1993).

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts).
  - Indices are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site- and year-weighting according to the proportion of the flight period surveyed, to account for gaps and emphasize observed data.
  - All component data (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) contribute to species-level trends.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; further automated/manual validation checks address distribution, timing, first-time site records, and unusual values.
  - Corrections are applied through queries and coordination with recorders as needed.
