# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN WATERFOWL 1968-2007' DATASET

- The dataset collects counts of 10 waterfowl species at Loch Leven from 1968–2007 as part of a long-term lake monitoring programme.
- Counts represent annual peak counts based on monthly counts from September of the indicated year through March of the following year.

## What the data contain

- 10 species: Coot, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Greylag Goose, Mallard, Mute Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Pochard, Teal, Tufted Duck.
- Counts are for the whole loch and are expressed as annual peak counts.

## Temporal coverage and collection regime

- Monthly autumn and winter counts (September–March) collected from land-based vantage points.
- 1967–1994: monthly counts conducted by SNH and predecessor bodies.
- 1995 onward: monthly counts using Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) methods (Austin et al., 2008).
- Since 2003: surveys conducted fortnightly.
- Since 2008: counts carried out by SNH in collaboration with RSPB Loch Leven.
- Some gaps exist where monthly counts were not completed.
- Pink-footed Goose peak counts are dawn roost counts rather than standard WeBS counts.

## Data structure

## Reuse considerations for monitoring

- Designed for long-term monitoring and trend analysis across multiple species.
- Data are suitable for standardised environmental health assessments and policy performance over time.
- Be mindful of gaps in monthly counts and the change in survey methods over the period when analyzing trends.
