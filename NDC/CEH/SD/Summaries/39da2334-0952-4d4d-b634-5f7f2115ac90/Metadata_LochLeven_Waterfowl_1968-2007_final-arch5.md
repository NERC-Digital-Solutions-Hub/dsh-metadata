METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN WATERFOWL 1968-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset of waterfowl counts at Loch Leven, 1968–2007
- Collected by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and predecessor bodies as part of ongoing lake monitoring
- Provides annual peak counts derived from monthly counts (September to March)

## Scope and species
- Counts cover 10 waterfowl species:
  - Coot, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Greylag Goose, Mallard, Mute Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Pochard, Teal, Tufted Duck
- Counts represent annual peak numbers for the loch

## Data quality and governance
- Quality controlled by Neil Mitchell (and SNH Reserve Wardens prior to him)
- Metadata indicates ongoing quality assurance, with responsibility for quality control anchored in SNH practices and personnel

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Monthly counts conducted during autumn and winter (September–March) from land-based vantage points
- 1967–1994: monthly counts by SNH
- 1995–present: monthly counts using Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) methods
- Since 2003: surveys conducted fortnightly
- Since 2008: counts performed in collaboration with RSPB Loch Leven
- Notable gaps: some months lacked counts
- Peak Pink-footed Goose counts are dawn roost counts rather than standard WeBS counts

## Data structure and units
- Data structure includes columns: year, species, count, units
- Units are counts (numbers of individuals)

## Notes for data stewardship
- Documentation should continue to capture data provenance, collection methods changes (WeBS adoption, fortnightly surveys, collaboration with RSPB), and gaps in data
- Clearly separate counts by year, species, and the defined counting method to maintain interoperability with WeBS-based datasets and other long-term datasets
- Ensure up-to-date contact information and any updated data-sharing restrictions are reflected for future reuse
