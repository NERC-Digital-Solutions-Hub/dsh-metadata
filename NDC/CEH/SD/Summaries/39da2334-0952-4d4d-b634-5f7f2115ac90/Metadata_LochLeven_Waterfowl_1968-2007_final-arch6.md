# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN WATERFOWL 1968-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset of counts for 10 waterfowl species at Loch Leven from 1968 to 2007.
- Counts represent annual peak counts derived from monthly counts collected from September of the indicated year through to March of the following year.

## Content and scope
- Species included: Coot, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Greylag Goose, Mallard, Mute Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Pochard, Teal, Tufted Duck.
- Counts pertain to the whole loch and reflect a single annual peak per year.

## Data quality and provenance
- Quality controlled by Neil Mitchell (Loch Leven staff since 2009) and predecessors (SNH Reserve Wardens).
- Collected by SNH and predecessor bodies as part of a long-term monitoring programme; later aligned with Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) methods.
- Since 2003 surveys conducted fortnightly; since 2008, SNH collaborates with RSPB Loch Leven.
- Some gaps exist where monthly counts were not completed.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Monthly autumn and winter counts (September–March) conducted from land-based vantage points.
- 1967–1994: monthly counts by SNH; 1995 onward: monthly counts following WeBS methods (Austin et al., 2008).
- Pink-footed Goose peak counts are dawn roost counts rather than standard WeBS counts.
- From 2003 onward, surveys were fortnightly; from 2008 onward, counts carried out by SNH in collaboration with RSPB Loch Leven.

## Limitations and gaps
- Occasional missing monthly counts create gaps in the time series.
- Dawn roost method for Pink-footed Goose may differ from standard WeBS counts, affecting comparability across years.

## Potential uses for data support
- Build time-series dashboards by year and species to enable self-serve exploration.
- Conduct inter-species and inter-annual trend analysis; identify significant fluctuations.
- Support data cleaning/transformation needs (handling gaps, harmonizing methods before 1995 vs. after, addressing dawn roost counts). 
- Inform conservation and management decisions for Loch Leven through long-term historical patterns.
