# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN WATERFOWL 1968-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term dataset of counts for 10 waterfowl species at Loch Leven, collected 1968–2007 as part of SNH and predecessor monitoring.
- Counts represent annual peak counts derived from monthly counts spanning September to March of the following year.

## Geographic and Temporal Scope
- Location: Loch Leven, Kinross, Scotland.
- Timeframe: 1968–2007.

## Data Content and Structure
- Species covered: 10 species (Coot, Cormorant, Great Crested Grebe, Greylag Goose, Mallard, Mute Swan, Pink-footed Goose, Pochard, Teal, Tufted Duck).
- Data columns: year, species, count, units.
- Units: counts (numbers of birds). The dataset includes an explicit units column.

## Sampling Regime and Collection Methods
- Data collected monthly during autumn and winter (September–March) from land-based vantage points.
- 1967–1994: monthly counts conducted by SNH; 1995 onward: monthly counts using Wetland Bird Survey (WeBS) methods.
- Since 2003: surveys conducted fortnightly; from 2008 onward, SNH collaborates with RSPB Loch Leven for counting.
- Some gaps where monthly counts were not completed.
- Peak counts for Pink-footed Goose are dawn roost counts, not standard WeBS counts.

## Quality Control and Provenance
- Quality controlled by Neil Mitchell (and predecessors at SNH).
- Formal reference: Austin, Collier & Rehfisch (2008) WeBS methodology; BTO Research Report No. 501.

## GIS Relevance and Considerations
- Suitable for time-series visualization and trend analysis of population counts by species at Loch Leven.
- Loch-level aggregated data (not site-specific), which limits fine-scale spatial mapping but is valuable for basin-wide habitat monitoring over multiple decades.
- Method changes and data gaps should be accounted for in analyses (e.g., WeBS method adoption, fortnightly surveys from 2003, 2008 collaboration, and dawn roost counts for Pink-footed Goose).
