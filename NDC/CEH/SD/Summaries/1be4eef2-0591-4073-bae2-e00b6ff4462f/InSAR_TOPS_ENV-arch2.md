# Survey Overview

- Part of the NERC InSAR ToPS project, Environmental Monitoring conducted at two Flow Country sites in Caithness and Sutherland from September 2017 to November 2018.
- Sites: Knockfin Heights (upland blanket peatland) and Munsary (lowland blanket peatland). Both are peatland-rich areas within the Flow Country, with Knockfin Heights part of the RSPB Forsinard Estate and Munsary part of the Plantlife Munsary Nature Reserve.
- Monitoring focused on surface motion characteristics to identify study focus areas, using a range of sensors to capture environmental variables.

## Aim and Context

- Objective: Use environmental data in a consistent format to assess peatland condition and inform interpretation of climate impacts over time.
- Approach: Collect, verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data from established sources; analyse with standardized methods; present outputs as reports, maps, and charts; store datasets and upload to appropriate portals.

## Survey Area

- Locations: RSPB Forsinard, Knockfin Heights (NC94958), Sutherland; Plantlife Munsary (ND21677 46186), Caithness.
- Knockfin Heights: >300 m above sea level, diverse erosive features (peat hags, pools, lochans); mixture of Sphagnum, sedge, heather, grasses; multiple landowners; part of Forsinard estate.
- Munsary: lowland area (~100 m), near Dubh Lochans with high water tables and rare plants (e.g., orchids); margins shrub-rich; historic grazing and peat extraction with recent restoration (drain blocking); considered near natural condition.
- Site layout: Figure illustrates permanent and floating benchmarks; equipment locations indicated.

## Equipment and Data Collection

- Sensor network at sub-sites and a central site for precipitation; PAR measurements included at Munsary.
- Equipment: HOBO data loggers (Weather/Energy, water level, soil moisture sensors EC-5), HOBO U20L-04, HOBOnet PAR/Rainfall sensors, plus a Tempcon logger.
- Placement: Numerous sub-sites (e.g., Munsary A–G; Knockfin A–D; E/F) with precise OSGB36 coordinates; each site supported by multiple sensors.
- Data cadence and calibration: Measurements every 30 minutes; water level calibrated quarterly to account for peat growth; PAR measurements started later due to equipment delays.
- Data handling: Data downloaded roughly every six months and processed with HOBOWARE software.
- Data management conventions: File naming includes site code, data type, sub-site, and measurement type; common fields include Date, Time, Date_Time, Temp_Soil, Pressure_mbar, Water_Content, Precipitation_mm, PAR_uE, Temp_Water, Water_level_meters.
- Instrument status: Some sensors were lost to deer damage or equipment failure; PAR data collection began later due to equipment delays.

## Data Quality, Management, and Accessibility

- Data integrity pursued through standard installation, calibration, and processing procedures as per manufacturer guidelines.
- Regular quality assurance through verification, cleaning, and transformation of data from established sources.
- Outputs designed as standardised formats (reports, maps, charts) to enable cross-time environmental health assessments.
- Data handling included storage and uploading to appropriate portals, with documentation of file naming and variable definitions to support reuse.

## Challenges and Limitations

- Sensor losses due to wildlife damage or equipment failure.
- Delays in PAR data collection caused by late equipment delivery.
- Calibration and peat growth effects on water level measurements requiring quarterly recalibration.
