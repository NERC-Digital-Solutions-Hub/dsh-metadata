# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling strategy behind the Countryside Survey field work and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify samples.
  - Connects current methodology (up to 2007) with thirty years of prior work, highlighting the importance of historical classifications for trend detection and national estimates.

- Core concepts for data support
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework to ensure representative sampling of Great Britain.
  - Use of 1 km square sampling units (with initial focus on centre squares of 15 × 15 km grids and inclusion of surrounding squares) to capture environmental variability.
  - Stratified, random sampling to minimize bias and improve the precision of national and regional estimates.

- Timeline of methodology development
  - 1978 (Initial survey)
    - Created 32 land classes from environmental attributes using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1228 centre squares; included surrounding four squares per centre.
    - Sampled 8 squares per class (total 256) to estimate habitat areas, using class proportions to scale national estimates.
  - 1984 (Second survey)
    - 12 squares per land class (total 384); continued using the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third survey)
    - Revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates recalculated from the updated framework.
  - 1998 (Revised classification; fourth survey)
    - Increased to 40 land classes; allowed separate Scottish reporting; total 569 squares surveyed.
    - Introduced the approach for country-based reporting and data aggregation to support policy needs.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Expanded to provide separate country estimates for England & Wales and Scotland; subdivided classes into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata).
    - Added 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes, plus 11 additional squares to balance England and Wales sampling.
    - Special upland habitat module discussed for England and Wales to improve accuracy in upland estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Welsh-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh class subdivisions (creating five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded 45 strata.
    - Additional 43 squares surveyed in Wales; England adjustments kept to maintain precision in English classes.
    - Uplands module retained and expanded; overall sample allocations adjusted to support Wales-focused analysis.

- Country units and sampling adjustments
  - Rationale: devolution and policy needs required Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting.
  - Adjustments included class sub-division by country unit, class aggregation where counts were small, and targeted addition of squares to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Isle of Man contributions removed from country estimates and replaced with new English squares.

- Uplands module
  - An extra module added to CS2000/CS2007 to improve Habitat estimates in uplands by adding 30 squares in relevant ITE Land Classes.
  - Increases data reliability for upland habitat status and change.

- Data products and outputs
  - Land Class maps and updated classification frameworks for England with Wales, and Scotland (Figures 4–6).
  - Summary tables showing the number of squares surveyed by year, class, country unit, and sampling rate (Tables 2–4; Figure 5 maps).
  - Outputs enabling national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates and trend analyses.

- Important considerations and notes
  - Creation of national estimates is sensitive to the Land Classification used; 1990 vs. 2007 classifications can yield different estimates.
  - Table 4 illustrates how sample sizes per class change across surveys when using the Original (1990) Land Classification versus the newer classifications, underscoring cross-survey comparability considerations.
  - The methodology emphasizes representativeness, data quality, and transparent documentation of changes to the sampling framework.

- Enduring implications for data support
  - The Sampling Strategy provides a structured, traceable approach to ecological data collection and classification across GB, enabling self-consistent, country-specific environmental reporting.
  - Ongoing risk areas include shifts in classification affecting comparability, and ensuring adequate sample sizes for less-represented classes, particularly when moving to country-unit estimates.
  - The framework supports the development of data products (maps, tables, and reports) that stakeholders can use for policy, planning, and monitoring of countryside habitats over time.
