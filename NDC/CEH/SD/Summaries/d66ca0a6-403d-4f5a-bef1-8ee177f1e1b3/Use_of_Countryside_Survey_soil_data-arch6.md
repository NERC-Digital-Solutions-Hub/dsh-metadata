# Sampling design

- Study and timing
  - Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled soils from all 591 CS squares, with some measurements not made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots, with five x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Plots can be relocated or removed over time (e.g., due to land use changes or access issues); each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to a square and repeat plot.
  - Samples with the same repeat identifier come from the same location, though exact sampling positions shift ~2–3 m around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling method
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled (8 cm for the invertebrate sample) in 1998 and 2007 using a soil core; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - In some soils, full cores could not be obtained due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and data collection
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements; the specific measurements vary by core (Table 1 not fully shown here).
  - Data recorded include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density (not via ISO core method), core dimensions, photos, depth of organic layer, texture (hand texture), soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, among others.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples; some measurements for CS2007 are reported for all 591 squares, while others are limited to the original 256 squares.
  - A note indicates that certain data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

- Data analysis and interpretation guidance
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while including them yields national estimates of stock and change when appropriately weighted.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to reflect multiple x-plots within each square.
  - Design-based (dispersed) sampling is preferred for regional estimates to improve precision and coverage; only one core per location was typically taken.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review existing CS publications and outputs available on the CS website for context and interpretation.
