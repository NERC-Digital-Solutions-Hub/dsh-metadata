# A1.1. Soil core sampling protocol

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardized procedure to collect soil core samples across X-plots in 120 squares, enabling consistent environmental monitoring data and enabling later analysis and data integration.
  - Emphasizes recording anomalies, quality control, and proper storage/dispatch to maintain data integrity.

- Equipment (essential items)
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool by charging from vehicle lighter socket)
  - Mains charger for accommodation
  - 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel
  - Notebook and pen, parcel tape
  - Spare cores
  - Pack for the appropriate square containing:
    - X-plot packs with cores, end caps, and labelled bags
    - Stamped and addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

- Sampling plan (per square)
  - Five soil sampling locations per X-plot:
    - Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
      - Location: 15 cm south of the corner of the centre quadrat
      - Instructions: bevelled end on soil surface; bag and seal
    - Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
      - Location: 15 cm east of the black core; ensure litter layer intact
      - Instructions: caps placed on ends; bag and seal
    - Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
      - Location: 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner)
      - Instructions: caps on ends; bag and seal
    - Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
      - Location: 15 cm west of the black core
      - Orientation: right way up with bevelled end on soil surface; caps on ends; bag and seal
  - Composite soil sample (SQID sample)
    - Location: along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat
    - Collect 8–10 sub-samples with the long thin trowel to 15 cm depth, evenly around the sides
    - Place into a single bag, filling to the top of the top white panel
    - If insufficient depth, move sampling point and repeat; if obstacles (vegetation, cow pats, boulders) present, record and relocate to obtain a homogeneous sample
    - After filling, bag, seal, and place inside the larger composite bag as required

- Handling and storage (per square)
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its bag; group all black cores for the square; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long white/grey cores; store in the cool box
  - Post-collection: place all five core samples in the mailbag labeled for the appropriate CEH lab location and post promptly
  - Overall soil sample bag: place in the cool box immediately; then post in the mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster

- Dispatch and posting (logistics)
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post Thursday is not feasible, place in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If local post boxes cannot accommodate the package, use a convenient Post Office
  - Use OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices

- Data quality and notes
  - If sampling problems occur or special observations are needed (e.g., unusual vegetation, roots, cow pat, boulder), record notes in the envelope
  - Move sampling points as needed to achieve representative, homogeneous samples
  - Ensure correct core alignment and labeling to maintain traceability and data integrity for downstream analysis and data portals

- Data management implications for analysts
  - The procedure provides standardized, repeatable data collection across plots, supporting time-series environmental assessments
  - Clear documentation and labeling facilitate quality assurance, traceability, and sharing of underlying data
  - The structured storage and posting workflow aids in assembling a centralized dataset for monitoring and policy performance evaluation
