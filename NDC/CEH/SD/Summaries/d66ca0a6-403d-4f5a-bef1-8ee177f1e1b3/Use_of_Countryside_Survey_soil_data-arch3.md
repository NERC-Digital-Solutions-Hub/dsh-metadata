# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Describes the soil sampling framework of the Countryside Survey (CS) across three years (1978, 1998, 2007) to detect changes and support national assessments.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to all 591 CS squares, with some measurements not performed on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change.

- Sampling design and plot structure
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots, with five x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates because they can differ in land use and soil type.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1), linking samples over time; locations within a square are about 2–3 meters apart as the 2m × 2m plot is surveyed around its corners.

- Sample locations and relocation
  - x-plots can be relocated if a plot is destroyed, access is denied, or relocation is otherwise uncertain.
  - Although relocated, each location retains its repeat identifier to enable longitudinal comparison.

- Sampling depth and collection method
  - Samples are taken from the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm depth for invertebrate samples).
  - In 1998/2007, cores were hammered in and then removed; in 1978, a soil pit was dug for sampling the top 15 cm.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow depth.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were recorded for some cores.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot with varying measurements; no chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
  - A full description and implications of methods are documented (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Data structure and measurements
  - Measurements are component-specific per core; many measurements were taken across all 591 squares or the original 256 squares, with some measurements limited to subsets (e.g., 2 of the 5 x-plots for certain variables).
  - Table 1 (referenced) lists diverse measurements such as pH, LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, texture, moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and invertebrate data.
  - Some measurements were released publicly only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land class can bias results toward stock and change rather than national estimates.
  - Weighting by land classes can yield national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - Use of mixed models is advised (e.g., with square as a random factor) to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - CS design emphasizes dispersed sampling for regional estimates rather than focusing on a single core per location; broader sampling improves precision and coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH and existing CS publications when analyzing CS soils data.

- Data sharing and governance notes
  - Some detailed measurements and data were released only after the 2009 Soils Report, indicating phased data dissemination and documentation.
