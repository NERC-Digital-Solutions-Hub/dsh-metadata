# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Aims to describe how Countryside Survey field samples have been selected and updated over time.
- Core approach: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework to ensure samples represent the diversity of Great Britain’s countryside.
- Key goals for analysts: enable robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitats and land cover; support trend analysis across survey rounds (1978–2007).

## Overview of the ITE Land Classification and Stratification

- The ITE Land Classification provides a hierarchical set of land classes derived from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to stratify the landscape.
- Stratification minimizes bias that could arise from purely random sampling and ensures representation of different ecological and land-use types.
- The classification originated from work in the Lake District (1970s) using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group areas by environmental attributes, then expanded to national scale (GB) with a 1 km square sampling unit.
- Early sampling approach used a center square from a 15 × 15 km grid; results in GB-wide classifications informed subsequent sampling frames and national estimates.

## Evolution of the Countryside Survey Sampling Framework

- 1978 CS (Initial Field Survey)
  - Used the original ITE Land Classification with 32 classes.
  - Sampled eight squares per class, totaling 256 squares nationwide.
  - National habitat estimates were derived by combining per-class means with each class’s GB area.

- 1984 CS (Second Field Survey)
  - Maintained the 32-class framework but expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384 squares).
  - Focus shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.

- 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Extended classification to cover all GB squares, incorporating urban and sea corrections.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; linked with first Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1998 Revisions (Fourth Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting and increased the number of land classes to 40.
  - National estimates were still calculated using the 1990 framework for consistency, but the updated classification created representational changes in some classes.

- 2000 CS (Fifth Field Survey)
  - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland) to reflect policy and regional needs.
  - Sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions; created 40 strata.
  - Added 19 additional squares to improve representation of new classes and 11 more to balance England and Wales sampling.
  - A uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- 2007 CS (Sixth Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven adjustments to sampling.
  - Created country-unit versions of select classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); number of strata expanded to 45.
  - Added 43 additional Welsh squares (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes retained at lower sample counts due to acceptable precision.
  - Wales-focused sampling enhanced the reliability of Wales-only environmental reporting; revised maps reflect England with Wales and Scotland frameworks.

## Country-Specific Estimation and Wales/Uplands Enhancements

- Separate country estimates introduced in CS2000 to deliver England with Wales and Scotland-specific results.
- Class sub-division and aggregation:
  - Land Classes subdivided to country units (England & Wales vs Scotland) to improve country-specific accuracy.
  - In some cases, sparse country representations were aggregated with similar classes to maintain robust estimates.
- Additional sampling:
  - Wales received a substantial increase in sample squares to ensure adequate representation of Welsh classes.
  - England saw targeted adjustments to compensate for Welsh additions; some English classes have smaller per-class sample counts but accepted precision.
- Wales uplands focus:
  - An uplands module added to CS2000 enhanced statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Outputs, Data Handling, and Consistency

- The sampling framework yields per-class estimates that are combined with the corresponding land-class areas to produce national, regional, and country-level habitat estimates.
- National consistency notes:
  - Changing the underlying land-class framework affects comparability of national stock estimates; CS1990 vs CS2000 vs CS2007 classifications can produce different baselines.
  - It is preferable to use the latest classification for country-specific estimates while acknowledging cross-survey comparability when using earlier classifications.
- Outputs and references:
  - Key reports include Countryside Survey 1990 (main report), Countryside Survey UK Results from 2007, and related methodological papers documenting the land-class framework and sampling decisions.

## Key Concepts for Data Analysts

- Stratified random sampling using the ITE Land Classification is central to representativeness and statistical precision.
- The sampling design evolves to meet policy needs (country-specific reporting for England, Wales, and Scotland) and to improve estimates in under-sampled areas (notably Wales and uplands).
- National estimates rely on two linked components: (1) the average habitat area per square within each land class, and (2) the total area of each land class across GB.
- Cross-survey comparability requires attention to changes in land classification schemes and country-unit subdivisions.
