# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Summary purpose
  - Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
  - Links methodology to the ability to produce time-series, spatially explicit estimates of habitats and land use for the UK.

- Core concept: stratified sampling via the ITE Land Classification
  - To avoid bias and ensure representativeness, sampling is stratified into land classes (strata) derived from environmental attributes.
  - Initial approach used centre squares of a 15x15 km grid classified into 32 Land Classes; surrounding squares added for each class.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate classification underpin the grouping of areas by ecological/environmental similarity.
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level areas with the mean habitat area observed within each class.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its application
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification; 1st Field Survey)
    - 8 squares per Land Class, total 256 squares surveyed.
    - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in a class × total area of that class.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per Land Class, total 384; continued use of the 32-class framework.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Expanded to include data from all GB 1 km squares; refined to include urban/sea corrections.
    - 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
    - Classification adjusted to permit Scotland-only reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Addressed policy needs for separate England & Wales vs Scotland estimates.
    - Sub-division of Land Classes by country units; creation of 40 strata; additional squares allocated to ensure representation; upland habitat sampling module added.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Further adjustments for Wales-only reporting after devolution.
    - Wales-specific sub-divisions created (5 new Welsh classes), increasing strata to 45.
    - Additional Welsh squares added; English classes adjusted to maintain adequate precision.
    - Wales upland emphasis maintained with dedicated sampling in upland/marginal uplands.

- Sampling framework and field surveys by era
  - 1978: 256 field squares across 32 land classes.
  - 1984: 384 field squares (12 per class), still within the 32-class system.
  - 1990: 508 field squares; all GB squares classified; introduced all-squares approach with updates.
  - 2000: Expanded framework to 40 strata; country-unit sub-division and targeted upland sampling.
  - 2007: 45 strata; Wales-focused sub-divisions; Wales-specific minimums (6 squares per new Welsh class).

- National and country-level estimates
  - Estimates are derived from class-level area data and the observed mean habitat area per class.
  - Internationally, the approach allows England & Wales and Scotland to be reported separately, with Wales-specific adjustments for 2007.
  - Outputs include main reports and country-specific results (England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only reporting).

- Data governance, metadata and comparability considerations
  - Changing classifications across surveys affects the consistency of national estimates.
  - Preference for using the latest country-specific classification for consistency within a survey, while older classifications offer cross-survey comparability.
  - Re-classification can shift class representation and require adjustments in sampling and estimation.

- Outputs, acknowledgments, and further reading
  - Key publications detailing methodology and results:

  - Acknowledgements note contributions from DETR, CEH, ITE, and statistical guidance.
  - The document includes an extensive historical Appendix outlining the development timeline and references for deeper study.

- Practical implications for data leaders
  - The importance of a robust, evolution-ready data framework that supports time-series analysis while accommodating policy-driven country-specific reporting.
  - Necessity of clear metadata and documentation when classifications change to maintain data comparability.
  - Balancing representativeness (strata coverage) with precision needs at national and sub-national levels (England, Wales, Scotland).
  - Incorporating modules (e.g., upland surveys) to improve precision for under-sampled areas and to meet targeted reporting requirements.
