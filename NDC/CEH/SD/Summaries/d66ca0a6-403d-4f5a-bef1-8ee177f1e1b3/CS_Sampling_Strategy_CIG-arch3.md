# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Long-running framework to monitor environmental change and support policy decisions.
  - Uses a stratified, random sampling approach to produce representative, policy-relevant estimates of habitat and land-use features.
  - Grounded in the ITE Land Classification to ensure samples cover the range of GB land types and ecological conditions.

- The ITE Land Classification: the backbone of sampling
  - Originated in the 1970s to stratify GB land into discrete environmental classes.
  - Initial system: 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) using a centre-square sampling design (1 km squares, from a 15 x 15 km grid).
  - Stratification rationale: reduces bias and improves precision in national estimates by ensuring all land types are represented.
  - Early implementation: classification of a subset of squares (6039 classified; 256 ultimately surveyed in CS1978).

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey

  - CS1978 (Initial GB survey)
    - 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class).
    - National estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the area of each Land Class.

  - CS1984 (Second GB survey)
    - 384 squares surveyed (12 per Land Class).
    - National estimates calculated using the 1978 Land Classification.

  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats recorded; land-cover mapping linked.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

  - Developments leading to CS2000 (Fourth survey)
    - Need to support separate reporting for Scotland, England, and Wales; adapt classification to allow country-specific estimates.
    - New Land Classification expanded to better represent regional variation; distribution of squares across classes adjusted as classes changed.
    - Separate country estimates introduced: land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; aggregation used where needed to ensure adequate representation.
    - Sampling framework expanded to 40 strata; additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat modules introduced.

  - CS2007 (Fifth survey; Wales-focused adjustments)
    - Wales-specific reporting intensified: Welsh Land Classes further subdivided into Welsh country units (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Additional Welsh squares: 43 added to ensure adequate representation in Wales (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
    - English classes adjusted due to Welsh additions (some classes in England maintained fewer squares).
    - Wales upland modules and country-specific habitat estimates strengthened further; revised land-class maps for England-with-Wales and Scotland implemented.
    - Wales-focused maps and distribution of Welsh and English squares documented; Wales received higher sampling intensity to support Wales-only reporting.

- Country-specific reporting and upland focus
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England & Wales vs Scotland results, responding to devolved policy needs.
  - Wales-specific adjustments included subdivision of land classes and targeted sampling to improve Wales-only estimates.
  - An uplands module added in CS2000/CS2007 to improve habitat estimates in upland regions, with an additional set of squares placed in upland classes.

- Data outputs, estimates and comparability
  - Outputs across surveys include:
    - Summary tables of the number of squares by Land Class and by country unit.
    - Maps showing the distribution of Land Classes and sampling squares.
    - National estimates of habitat areas calculated from square-level data within each Land Class.
  - Comparability and consistency
    - Changing Land Class definitions over time affects national consistency.
    - The 2006 scoping study recommended users choose the latest classification for within-survey estimates, while cross-survey consistency may favor the original 1990 Land Classification.
    - The Countryside Survey reports document these classification changes and their impact on national estimates.

- Key figures and summaries
  - CS1978: 256 squares surveyed; 8 per class; 6039 classified squares underpinning landscape classification.
  - CS1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares reclassified; land-cover mapping linked.
  - CS2000: expanded to enable England & Wales vs Scotland reporting; broader strata (around 40); upland module added; additional squares to cover new classes.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused enhancements; 45 strata; substantial Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting; uplands module continued; revised country maps and sampling distributions.
