# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007. The same 256 squares were sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design and location
- Soils are sampled from CS x-plots, with five x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to potential differences in land use and soil type across plots.
- Some plots are relocated across years due to destruction, access issues, or other uncertainties; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Locations are within a square, typically ca. 2–3 m apart, sampled on a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot at each location.

## Sampling method
- Soils are collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample); in 1998/2007 this uses a soil core hammered into the soil and pulled out. In 1978 a soil pit was dug.
- Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 for two of the four cores sampled.

## Measurements
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- In CS1990, some soil mapping was carried out.
- In 1998 and 2007, multiple cores were taken per x-plot, with different cores having different measurements; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density was measured in 2007 (not using the ISO bulk density method, which would require a whole core).
- A full description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).
- Table 1 lists measurements on the different soil cores; measurements include LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
- Coverage notes:
  - Measurements span all 591 squares for many variables.
  - Some measurements are limited to the original 256 squares (e.g., pH, LOI, %C, %N, Olsen P, metals).
  - Metals and some other measurements were available only for subsets (e.g., 2 of the 5 x-plots in each of the original 256 squares for metals; Mineralisable N measured on 3 of the 5 x-plots in each original square; invertebrates on 3 of the 5 x-plots).
- Data marked with an asterisk (*) were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Analyses should account for statistical structure, including land class effects; failing to do so yields stock and change estimates not adjusted for land classes.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; when designing analyses, consider weighting by land class to obtain national estimates of stock and change.
- A mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square (up to five).
- For CS-style design-based analyses, spatial structure is not typically of interest; a dispersed set of observations can improve regional precision and coverage.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications that exploit the data, which are listed on the CS website.

## Data availability and notes
- Some measurements and data are available for all squares, while others are limited to specific subsets or original squares.
- The CS website provides references and publications relevant to the soils data (e.g., Emmett et al. 2008).
