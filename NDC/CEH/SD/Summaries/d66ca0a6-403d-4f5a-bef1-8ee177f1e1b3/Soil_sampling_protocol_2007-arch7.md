# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box, kept cool by charging whenever the vehicle is driven (connected to the vehicle lighter socket). An electrical mains charger is provided for use in accommodation.
- 2 knives
- 2 plastic plates
- Hammer
- 2 pairs of pliers
- Mallet
- Regular trowel
- Notebook & pen
- Long thin trowel
- Parcel tape
- Spare cores
- 1 pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores will be taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square.
- If problems occur taking any samples or a specific comment is needed, place a note in the envelope (e.g., large tree roots, 1st core taken 1 m E of centre quadrat). If unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder, etc., move a minimum distance to obtain a more homogeneous sensible location and record the problem.
- General approach: for each core, use the labelled bag for the X-plot, ensure the correct core is used in the correct position, and prepare for storage as described below.
- If the ground is very stony or depth is insufficient, move the sampling point and record accordingly.

Core details

- Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
  - Locate 15 cm south of the corner of the centre quadrat (use the black core as a distance guide).
  - Place into plastic bag and seal.

- Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Leave the litter layer intact.
  - Located 15 cm to the east of the black core.
  - After sampling, push caps over both ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag, and return to the plastic bag.

- Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Core 4 is located 15 cm to the south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat).
  - After sampling, push caps over both ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag, and return to the plastic bag.

- Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
  - Located 15 cm to the west of the black core.
  - Ensure the core is right way up, with the bevelled end on the soil surface.
  - After sampling, push caps over both ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag, and return to the plastic bag.

- These samples are to be taken in 120 squares only. A labelled sealable bag and mail bag will be provided in the pack for X-plots where these samples are to be collected.
- Composite soil sample: one composite sample filling the plastic bag up to the top of the top white panel, consisting of 8–10 sub-samples taken with the long thin trowel to a depth of 15 cm along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, with 2+ sub-samples on each side.

- If problems occur taking any samples or a specific comment is needed, place a note in the envelope. If unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder, etc., move a minimum distance to obtain a more homogeneous sensible location and record the problem.
- Sampling procedure for SQID samples:
  - Move vegetation as required to access the soil surface.
  - Insert the long thin trowel four times up to the end of the trowel blade (15 cm) to form a square the width of the trowel.
  - Lever the soil out of the ground and place into the labelled bag.
  - If the ground is very stony, move the sampling point and record as above.
  - If there is not enough depth of soil, move the sampling point and start again; record as above.
  - Repeat 8–10 times with at least 2 on each side of the quadrat, placing soil into the same bag.
  - The soil should fill the bag to the top of the top white panel. If not, take more samples until the level is reached.
  - When the bag is full, seal and enclose in another bag and seal it.

A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C: BLACK
  - Store this core in its sample bag. Once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag. Store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep as cool as possible and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator.

- Core F: SHORT WHITE
  - Place this sample in its sample bag in a larger plastic bag, together with other short white cores from this square, and store in the cool box immediately.
  - When all 5 samples are taken, place them in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal, and post as soon as possible.

- Core P: GREY
  - Place this sample in its sample bag in a larger plastic bag, together with other long grey cores from this square, and store in the cool box immediately.
  - When all 5 samples are taken, place them in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal, and post as soon as possible.

- Core N: WHITE
  - Place this sample in its sample bag in a larger plastic bag, together with other long grey cores from this square, and store in the cool box immediately.
  - When all 5 samples are taken, place them in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor, seal, and post as soon as possible.

- Soil Sample Bag
  - Place this sample in the cool box immediately. As soon as possible, place in mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal and post.

- Posting
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If samples cannot be posted by the last post on Thursday, place them in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday. Do not post any samples on a Friday.
  - If the nearest post boxes will not take these packages, use a convenient Post Office. Check the OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices.
