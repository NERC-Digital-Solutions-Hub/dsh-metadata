# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Context and aim
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- All other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners involved
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and obtaining access permissions.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (level of precision)
- Access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (country, county, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Very exceptional cases allow six-digit grid references if external analysis cannot be performed by CEH and the requesting entity demonstrates IP confidentiality needs equal to or higher than CS data; such releases are highly restricted.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify a square and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or outputs may be given to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan or conduct visits to CS squares or to verify landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to prove project management standards at least equal to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms but are not required to meet the higher IP confidentiality standard of six-digit releases.
- A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or to claim such derivations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with clauses reflecting policy.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; support for other requests is case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be suitable though not guaranteed, and collaboration or payment terms will be negotiated case-by-case.
