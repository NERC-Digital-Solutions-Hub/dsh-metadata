# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- Documents the development of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field work from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasises the importance of stratified, random sampling to obtain representative national, regional, and country-level estimates of habitat and land-use features.
- Describes how data collected in the field are linked to map-based classifications to enable spatial understanding and change detection.

## The ITE Land Classification: core concept
- Stratification system that groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling across Britain.
- Originated from field-based vegetation classification scaled up to land areas (1 km squares) using environmental surrogates.
- Early version produced 32 classes; ongoing refinements expanded coverage and enabled country-specific reporting.

## Field sampling framework across CS surveys

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (& 1st Field Survey)
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid; classified surrounding squares as well (total 6039 km²).
  - Sampled 8 squares per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas by class averages times class area.

- 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
  - Used the 1978 land classification; increased sample size to 12 squares per class (384 total, 8 previously visited per class).
  - Provided change statistics between 1978 and 1984; national estimates still tied to the 1978 framework.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (All Squares) & 3rd Field Survey
  - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - Surveyed 508 squares; repeated features recorded from 1984 plus 1978 quadrats.
  - Publication: Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (& 4th Field Survey)
  - Updated classification to support separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; results published with new national framework.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) & 5th Field Survey
  - Focused on policy-relevant national estimates with adjustments for Scotland, England, and Wales.
  - Delivered a revised land classification and addressed representation issues across countries.
  - Separate country estimates introduced; 40 strata (expanded from 32) with additional squares to ensure adequate representation.
  - Additional uplands module planned to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting required; Wales received the most intensive sampling.
  - Implemented country-unit land classes (creating several Welsh- and English-specific sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; two Welsh classes (5e, 15e) in England retained at 4 squares per class due to precision considerations.
  - Revised England–Wales–Scotland maps and sampling framework accordingly.
  - Summary table (CS2007) outlines the number of squares by class and country.

## Country-specific estimates and Wales upland module
- CS1990–CS2000 introduced country units (England & Wales, Scotland) for estimates rather than GB-wide reporting alone.
- Adjustments included class sub-division by country unit, aggregation where necessary, and additional squares to ensure representation in each country unit.
- An upland-focused sampling module was added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

## Outputs and representation
- Each CS cycle produced:
  - A Land Classification map and updated sampling framework for the respective year.
  - Tables detailing the number of squares surveyed per land class and per country unit.
  - National, and where applicable, country-specific estimates of habitat areas and landscape features.
- The strategy highlights the balance between maintaining continuity with earlier time-series data and updating classifications to reflect policy and regional reporting needs.

## Implications for GIS and data products
- The evolving Land Classification serves as a spatial framework for map-based data products and change detection across time.
- The shift from GB-wide to country-specific estimates enhances policy relevance and enables Wales- and Scotland-focused GIS analyses.
- The addition of upland modules and Wales-specific sub-classes improves the accuracy of habitat status assessments in targeted regions.
- Users should be aware of classification changes over time when linking CS datasets across years, as class definitions and boundaries may differ between surveys.
