# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998 and 2007; 256 squares sampled in 1978/1998, 591 squares in 2007.
  - Power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
  - Not all measurements were performed on all samples; relevant details are provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Sampling design and units
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots per CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (vary by land use, soil type, etc.).
  - Some plots relocated due to destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1, square 2, repeat plot 1).
  - Locations within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot are ca. 2–3 m apart, sampled at four corners per location.

- Sample location and plotting
  - Within each CS square, sampling focuses on predefined x-plots; not all locations are true replicates due to heterogeneity in land use and soil type.

- Sampling methods
  - Top 15 cm of soil sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm deep for invertebrate samples).
  - 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm; core methods differed by year.
  - Core collection sometimes incomplete due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were recorded for select cores.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990s: some soil mapping; multiple cores per x-plot in 1998 and 2007; different cores have different measurements.
  - Horizons: no chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurement.
  - 2007: bulk density measured (not using ISO whole-core method); other measurements include pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, texture (hand texture), soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
  - Data coverage varies by year and core; a full table of measurements (Table 1) details which measurements were made on which samples.
  - Some data are explicitly marked as released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes may bias results toward stock and change estimates rather than national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed-model approach is recommended (square as a random factor) to reflect multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - CS uses dispersion-based designs; broad, widely distributed observations can improve regional precision/coverage.
  - Users are advised to contact CEH before analysis and to review published CS work that utilises these data.

- Data structure, governance, and availability
  - Data include multiple cores per x-plot across years, with varying measurements per core.
  - Documentation notes that some measurements are only available after the 2009 Soils Report release.
  - Unique repeat identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1) are essential for traceability across years.
  - The methods and protocols are documented to support data reuse, comparability across years, and proper interpretation of results.
