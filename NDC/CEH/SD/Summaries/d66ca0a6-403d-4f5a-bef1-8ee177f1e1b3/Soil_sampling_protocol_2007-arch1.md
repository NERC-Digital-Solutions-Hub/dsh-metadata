# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose
  - Field procedure for collecting and handling soil core samples in X-plots, ensuring correct core placement, sample integrity, and traceable logistics for subsequent data analysis.

- Equipment list (highlights)
  - Electrical: Electric Cold Box (kept cool by vehicle charging), electrical mains charger for accommodation
  - Tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel
  - Documentation and packing: Notebook & pen, parcel tape, spare cores
  - Sample packaging: 1 pack per square containing X-plot cores, end caps, labelled bags; stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots
  - Storage/transport: Cool box, cardboard boxes, plastic bags, mailbags

- Field organization
  - Pack includes labelled sealable bags and mail bags for X-plots requiring sampling
  - Clear labeling and immediate sealing of samples essential

- Core geometry reference
  - Cores are identified by color/size and are positioned relative to the centre quadrat in each X-plot (as detailed in A1.1.2)

- Data/quality considerations
  - If problems arise (e.g., vegetation, roots, obstacles), note in the envelope with a precise description
  - Record any deviations or issues to support later data interpretation and quality assurance

- Post-sampling handling
  - Ensure cores are returned to the vehicle promptly and stored cool until dispatch
  - Maintain chain-of-custody through labeled bags and mailbags

- Posting timing
  - Post as soon as possible; avoid Friday postings; if last post Thursday is needed, keep samples in the cool box over the weekend and post Monday
  - Use OS map data/Road Atlas to locate appropriate Post Offices if needed

## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Core locations and types
  - Core C (BLACK): 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat; 15 cm long, 5 cm diameter; marked as the distance reference
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): 15 cm east of the BLACK core; 8 cm long, 4 cm diameter; keep litter layer intact
  - Core N (LONG WHITE): 15 cm south of the BLACK core (30 cm from the south corner of centre quadrat); 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter
  - Core P (LONG GREY): 15 cm west of the BLACK core; 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter; orientation important with bevelled end on soil surface

- Composite soil sample (SQID)
  - A composite sample is created from 8–10 sub-samples to fill the plastic bag up to the top of the top white panel
  - Sub-samples collected with the long thin trowel to a depth of 15 cm
  - Sub-samples gathered around the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, evenly spaced, with 2 on each side of the quadrat
  - If depth is insufficient, move sampling point and continue until the bag is filled
  - All sub-samples placed into the same bag, then bag sealed and placed in a secondary bag if needed

- Field procedures and checks
  - For each core: clear surface vegetation, start at specified point, cut around bottom edge with knife, insert pipe upright, use grey plastic plate, hammer to level with soil surface
  - If core breaks or deforms, substitute with a spare pipe
  - Extract cores carefully to avoid losing soil, especially at ends
  - Remove exterior soil lumps, and cap ends with end caps after sample collection
  - Move sampling point if the ground is too stony or depth insufficient, and record the reason

- Handling unusual conditions
  - If there is unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder, etc., move a minimum distance to achieve a homogeneous sample and record the problem

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C: BLACK
  - Store in its own bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, place together in a spare plastic bag
  - Keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional co-ordinator

- Core F: SHORT WHITE
  - Place in its bag, then in a larger bag with other short white cores from the square
  - Store in the cool box immediately
  - After all 5 samples, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP

- Core P: GREY
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square
  - Store in the cool box immediately
  - After all 5 samples, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP

- Core N: WHITE
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores
  - Store in the cool box immediately
  - After all 5 samples, place in the CEH Bangor mailbag, seal, and post ASAP

- Soil Sample Bag
  - Place in the cool box immediately
  - Post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag as soon as possible

- Posting guidance
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post is Thursday, leave in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Fridays
  - If the nearest post box cannot accept the package, locate a suitable Post Office
  - Use the OS map data or Road Atlas to identify Post Offices

- Metadata and traceability
  - Use clearly labeled bags and mailbags to maintain a traceable chain of custody
  - Ensure correct routing to CEH Lancaster or CEH Bangor as specified for each core with accompanying notes for potential data reconciliation Later
