# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (via CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
  - Confidentiality supports the public interest in robust environmental policy.

- Circumstances for release and precision levels
  - Data access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, external release under licence may be considered if IP/confidentiality criteria are met.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can identify square locations and are treated with the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.
  - Four-digit releases have looser IP requirements than six-digit releases.
  - Licences specify that data must not be used to plan visits, identify individual landowners, or derive precise square locations; licensees must avoid attempting to locate squares from the data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for broader organizational use.
  - Upon licence expiry, confirmation of data destruction is required.
  - No third-party sharing that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits or assess landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
  - Licensing terms for four-digit references are less stringent than for six-digit references; a clause prevents attempts to identify precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences (four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) signed by an authorised senior official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH may perform pre-processing analysis to support internal CS partner use within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data to define requirements or facilitate appropriate use; CEH involvement (collaboration or payment) is negotiated case-by-case.
