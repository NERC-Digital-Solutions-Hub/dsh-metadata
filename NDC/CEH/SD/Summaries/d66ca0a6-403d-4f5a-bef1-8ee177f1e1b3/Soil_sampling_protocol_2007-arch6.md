# A1.1.1. Equipment

## Overview
- Documents field equipment and procedures for soil core sampling in X-plots, including handling, labeling, storage, and dispatch of cores.

## Equipment and supplies
- Electric Cold Box (kept cool by being charged while the vehicle is driven; connected to vehicle lighter socket)
- Electrical mains charger for accommodation
- 2 knives
- 2 plastic plates
- Hammer
- 2 pairs of pliers
- Mallet
- Regular trowel
- Notebook & pen
- Long thin trowel
- Parcel tape
- Spare cores
- 1 pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

## Procedural notes
- Follow sampling procedures for core collection and ensure proper labeling and packaging for transport.
- Record problems or unusual conditions (e.g., large tree roots) in the envelope.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

## Core locations and quantity
- Cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot.
- Five soil sampling locations per square.
- If problems/obstacles arise, note in envelope and adjust sampling location for a homogeneous sample.

## Core identification and placement
- Core C: Black, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
- Core F: Short White, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
- Core N: Long White, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the black core.
- Core P: Long Grey, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm west of the black core; orientation critical with bevelled end on soil surface.
- For each core, place end caps on both ends after sampling and seal in its bag.

## Sampling guidance
- Use the correct labelled bag for the X-plot; ensure cores are collected in the specified order and location.
- If the ground is very stony or soil depth is insufficient, move sampling point and record the change.

## Composite (SQID) sampling
- 120 squares only.
- A composite soil sample is collected to fill the top of the top white panel in a single sealed bag.
- Collect 8–10 sub-samples with the long thin trowel to a depth of 15 cm along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, spaced evenly.
- Combine sub-samples into the composite bag.
- If the bag is not full, add more sub-samples until full.
- If needed, seal the bag inside another bag.

## General sampling steps
- Move vegetation as required to access soil.
- Create a square footprint with the long thin trowel (four insertions to 15 cm depth).
- Leverage soil from the ground and place into the labelled bag.
- If sampling point depth is insufficient, move and retry; record any issues.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

## Storage by core type
- Core C (Black): Store in its sample bag; when all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag; keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator.
- Core F (Short White): Place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post promptly.
- Core P (Grey): Place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post promptly.
- Core N (White): Place in its bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the mailbag labeled for CEH Bangor and post promptly.
- Soil Sample Bag (Composite): Place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible, place in mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster and post.

## Posting guidelines
- Post samples as soon as possible.
- If last post on Thursday cannot be met, place samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday.
- Do not post on Fridays.
- If nearest post boxes cannot take these packages, use a convenient Post Office.
- Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Office locations.

## Data-quality and logistics notes (relevant to Data Support)
- Emphasizes precise labeling, consistent sample handling, and chain-of-custody through dedicated bags and mailbags.
- Requires recording any sampling anomalies and maintaining orientation of cores (especially Core P).
- Specifies storage conditions (cool, away from sunlight) to maintain sample integrity for downstream data use.
- Includes clear dispatch routing to CEH Lancaster and CEH Bangor to ensure traceability of samples and data.
