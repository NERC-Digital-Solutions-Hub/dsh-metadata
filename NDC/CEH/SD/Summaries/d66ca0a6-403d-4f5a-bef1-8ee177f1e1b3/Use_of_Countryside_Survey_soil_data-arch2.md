# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Describes the sampling design, location, methods, measurements, and statistical analysis for CS soils in 2007, with reference to prior years (1978, 1998).
- Aims to enable detection of significant change over time and to support national estimates of soil properties.

## Sampling design and locations
- Years and scope:
  - 1978 and 1998: the same 256 CS squares were sampled.
  - 2007: expanded to all 591 CS squares; not all measurements were made on all samples.
- Plot structure:
  - Each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomized within the square.
  - x-plots are not replicates due to land-use and soil variability; they may be relocated when plots are destroyed or access is restricted.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating the square and repeat plot; samples from the same identifier come from the same location but may be 2–3 m apart within a 2 m × 2 m plot.
- Power analysis:
  - Emmett et al. (2008) conducted power analyses to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change.

## Sampling methods
- Depth and technique:
  - Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998 and 2007: soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out.
  - 1978: soil pit dug with samples from the top 15 cm of the profile.
  - Some soils could not provide a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.
- Special notes:
  - In 1998/2007 multiple cores were collected per x-plot; some cores have different measurements (see Table 1 in the full report).
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not via ISO core method due to practical constraints).

## Measurements and data collected
- 1978 measurements: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with various measurements; not all cores measured for every parameter.
- Parameters recorded (examples from 2007, Table 1):
  - LOI; pH (in water and CaCl2); %C; %N; bulk density; core dimensions; photographs.
  - Depth of organic layer; hand texture; soil moisture; Olsen P; metals.
  - Measurements also included: mineralisable N (for some cores) and other core-specific measurements.
- Sample coverage:
  - Some measurements were taken across all 591 squares; others only across the original 256 squares.
  - Certain measurements were limited to a subset of x-plots within the original squares (e.g., 2 of 5 x-plots for metals, or specific cores for mineralisable N).
- Data release:
  - Some data are released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Handling land class structure:
  - If land class structure is ignored, results reflect stock and change of the population; including land classes yields weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping:
  - Not always used in analyses of CS soils data.
- Model structure:
  - Recommend a mixed-model approach with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each square.
- Design implications:
  - CS is not primarily spatially structured; a dispersed set of observations increases regional precision and coverage.
  - For regional estimates, broad, widely distributed sampling is advantageous.
- Guidance for users:
  - Consult CEH before analysis and interpretation.
  - Review existing CS publications accessible via the CS website for previously exploited data.

## Practical implications for environmental monitoring
- Standardised framework across years enables monitoring of soil health trends and policy performance.
- Expanded sampling in 2007 improves national representativeness, but requires careful statistical handling due to varying sample coverage by measurement.
- Emphasises data quality, consistent methodologies, and documentation to support reproducibility and data reuse.
