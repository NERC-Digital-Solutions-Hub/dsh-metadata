# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box, to be kept cool by charging whenever the vehicle is driven (connected to the vehicle lighter socket); an electrical mains charger is provided for use in accommodation
- 2 knives
- 2 plastic plates
- Hammer
- 2 pairs of pliers
- Mallet
- Regular trowel
- Long thin trowel
- Notebook & pen
- Parcel tape
- Spare cores
- Pack for the appropriate square containing:
  - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
  - stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Cores are taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square
- If problems arise or a specific comment is needed, record in the envelope (e.g. "large tree roots - 1st soil core taken 1 m E of centre quadrat")
- If unusual vegetation, cow pat, boulder, etc., move the sampling point a minimum distance and record the problem to achieve a more homogeneous sample

- Taking the cores
  - Use the correct labelled bag for the X-plot; locate the 4 cores and 4 sample bags
  - Clear surface vegetation and fresh plant material
  - Hold the pipe upright with the bevelled end on the soil surface; cut vertically down into the soil through roots if necessary
  - Push pipe firmly into the ground until it stands upright
  - Place a grey plastic plate on top and hammer into the soil until the core is level with the soil surface
  - If there is insufficient depth, move the sampling point and start again; record the change
  - If the pipe breaks or distorts, use a spare pipe
  - Use pliers to twist/pull the pipe free carefully to avoid soil loss from either end
  - Use the trowel to stop soil from falling from the bottom; scrape off any lumps from the exterior of the pipe
  - If needed, cut the bottom end of the core to level with the pipe end
  - Repeat for each centre quadrat in each X-plot (total five soil sampling locations in each square)

- Core specifications
  - Core C: BLACK 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter
    - Locate 15 cm south of the corner of the centre quadrat
    - Place into a plastic bag and seal
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter
    - Leave the litter layer intact
    - Located 15 cm east of the black core
    - Cap ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag
  - Core N: LONG WHITE 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
    - Located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner)
    - Cap ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag
  - Core P: LONG GREY 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter
    - Located 15 cm west of the black core
    - Must be oriented correctly (right way up, bevelled end on the soil surface)
    - Cap ends of the pipe, seal the sample in its bag

- Composite soil sample
  - Taken for 120 squares only
  - A single composite sample fills the plastic bag up to the top of the top white panel
  - 8–10 soil sub-samples are collected using the long thin trowel along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, spaced evenly around the sides
  - Sub-samples are placed into the same bag
  - If depth is insufficient, collect additional sub-samples until the bag is full
  - Seal the bag and enclose it within another bag if needed
  - Record any problems in the envelope as above

- Storage and transport of samples
  - Move all four cores back to the vehicle and store by core type in their respective bags
  - Each core type has specific storage instructions (cool box, etc.) and may be posted in designated mailbags
  - A labelled sealable bag and mail bag will be provided for X-plots where samples are collected

- 120-square sampling note
  - These sampling procedures apply to 120 squares only

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C: BLACK
  - Store in its sample bag; after all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag
  - Store in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep as cool as possible and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator

- Core F: SHORT WHITE
  - Place in its sample bag inside a larger plastic bag together with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately
  - When all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post as soon as possible

- Core P: GREY
  - Place in its sample bag inside a larger plastic bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately
  - When all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post as soon as possible

- Core N: WHITE
  - Place in its sample bag inside a larger plastic bag with other long grey cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately
  - When all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor; seal and post as soon as possible

- Soil Sample Bag
  - Place this sample in the cool box immediately
  - As soon as possible place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post

- Posting
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If samples cannot be posted by the last post on Thursday, place them in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post any samples on a Friday
  - If the nearest post boxes will not take these packages, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices and square-specific posting options
