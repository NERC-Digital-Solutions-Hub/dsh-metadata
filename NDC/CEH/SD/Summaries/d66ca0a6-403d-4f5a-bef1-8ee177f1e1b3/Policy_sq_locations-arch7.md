# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- This policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Current Countryside Survey partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Maintains sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access to land for surveying.
- Confidentiality supports capacity to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square a survey square falls in.
- Six-digit grid references are only released in very exceptional circumstances; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid needing to release locations externally.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- If precise location data are required, the requesting organisation must demonstrate through legal terms that their data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are granted for finite periods for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; CEH should be consulted if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
- Four-digit releases have IP-related terms less stringent than six-digit releases; license terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences containing the policy terms, signed by an authorised senior signatory.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH will provide the CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe, subject to moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may occur as collaboration or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
