# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
  - Public interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When and how locations may be released:
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square a CS square lies in.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release; external access requires demonstration that related IP data is equally or more confidential.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

- Licensing and use conditions:
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at project end.
  - No data releases to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
  - If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
  - Four-digit releases have similar, but less stringent IP safeguards than six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or to claim such derivations.

- Roles and governance:
  - CEH acts on behalf of NERC and the CS partners to approve exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate confidentiality clauses; signatories must be authorised on behalf of the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant legal procedures and regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes for CS partners; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may vary by collaborative or paid arrangements.
