# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Overview
  - A historical account of how the Sampling Strategy and the ITE Land Classification have evolved across Countryside Survey UK up to 2007.
  - Emphasises the link between sampling design, land classification, and the ability to produce national and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - Highlights methodological decisions, data representation, and implications for consistent long-term time series.

- Core concepts and context
  - ITE Land Classification: a stratification system created to ensure representative ecological sampling across Great Britain.
  - Stratified random sampling: used to prevent bias and capture variation across land types.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): statistical method used to group quadrats into vegetation/land classes.
  - Purpose: enable national and sub-national estimates of habitat features while allowing temporal comparisons.

- Timeline and key developments
  - Early development (1970s–1978)
    - ISA-based development of 32 land classes from environmental attributes.
    - Sampling unit: 1 km squares; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified centre squares (plus surrounding squares) for a total of 6039 squares classified.
    - Field survey: eight samples per land class (total 256 squares) to derive national habitat estimates.
  - 1984 field survey
    - Framework reused, but total sample increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - 1990 Countryside Survey (CS1990)
    - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
    - Field survey: 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - Developments leading to CS1990 era refinements
    - Realization that a GB-wide, high-detail classification was impractical for every square; surrogates used for many squares.
    - Comparison between original 1228-square classification and new attempts showed about 62% direct correspondence, with most non-matching squares falling into neighboring classes.
  - Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
    - Addressed representation issues and policy needs (England, Scotland, Wales reporting; upland habitat estimates).
    - Separate country estimates introduced: land classes subdivided into country-specific versions; aggregation where needed to maintain representation; added 19 squares overall and 11 extra to balance between England and Wales.
    - Uplands module added to improve precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirement prompted Wales-specific sampling adjustments.
    - Wales gains five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Additional Welsh squares: 43, ensuring minimum representation of new Welsh classes; England adjustments balanced to maintain overall precision.
    - Wales remains heavily sampled relative to its land area, with England and Scotland distribution adjusted to preserve comparability.

- Data design and outputs
  - Country-specific and GB-wide estimation framework
    - CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 stages introduced country-unit classifications to enable England with Wales, and Scotland-specific reporting.
    - Tables and maps illustrate class distributions, sample square allocations, and country allocations.
  - Sample size and coverage (highlights)
    - CS2000: totals and distribution across Land Classes for England & Wales and Scotland are detailed, including class subdivisions, additional squares, and sampling rates.
    - CS2007: further refinements to accommodate Wales-only reporting; additional Welsh squares and sub-classes; total strata increased.
    - Overall dataset scale shown in tables and figures (e.g., total GB squares and samples across survey iterations).
  - Data lineage and consistency notes
    - Acknowledges that changing land classifications affects national estimates; prefers using the latest classification for GB estimates to maintain internal consistency, while older classifications offer cross-survey comparability.
    - Provides historical context and cross-walk considerations between 1990, 2000, and 2007 classifications.

- Practical implications for data governance (Data Stewards perspective)
  - Documentation and versioning
    - Maintain explicit metadata on land classification versions (1990, 2000, 2007), with crosswalks describing how squares map between versions.
    - Record the sampling design at each survey (strata definitions, number of squares per class, country-unit allocation, uplands module).
  - Data lineage and reproducibility
    - Capture the evolution of the sampling frame, class definitions, and country-specific aggregation so past estimates can be reproduced or traced.
  - Interoperability and sharing
    - Ensure maps, class maps, and sample-square coordinates are standardized and shareable across England, Wales, Scotland, and other stakeholders.
    - Provide access to country-unit estimates and the GB-wide results with clear notes on which land-class version was used.
  - Metadata and discoverability
    - Include detailed methods for class derivation (ISA, environmental attributes used), sampling rules, and how changes in classification impact estimates.
  - Data quality and comparability
    - Highlight implications of changing classifications on time-series analyses; offer guidance on harmonizing historical data when using updated classifications.
  - Stewardship of ancillary outputs
    - Preserve supporting materials (figures, tables, maps) that document class distributions, sampling allocations, and the rationale behind Welsh/English border adjustments.

- Endnotes and references (for context)
  - The document provides extensive historical references and acknowledgments detailing the development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to successive Countryside Survey iterations.
