# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Scope: Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (via CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.
- Purpose: Balance public-interest utility of CS spatial data with protecting future surveys and anonymity of site locations to preserve scientific integrity and landowner goodwill.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality helps maintain representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Protects future surveying, environment, and permission to survey land, supporting reliable environmental policy.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When releases are allowed and precision levels
- Approximate locations: Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show which grid square contains a CS square.
- Precise locations: Six-digit grid references require exceptional circumstances; any such release must be approved under licence and may require CEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid direct release.
- Spatial data within squares: Maps and features could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit coordinates.
- Very exceptional access: Requires legal demonstration that accompanying data or models have equal or higher confidentiality protections than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- License terms: Confidentiality must be preserved; data stored securely; access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need for the project.
- License duration: Finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of license: Written confirmation of data destruction and continued confidentiality.
- Prohibitions: No third-party distribution that could compromise locations; data not to be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- IP and governance: May require evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases: Similar terms, but less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases; still prohibits attempts to derive precise locations.
- Compliance checks: If in doubt, consult CEH.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decision-maker: CEH acts on behalf of NERC to approve exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Documentation: Written approvals, sign-off by authorized senior representatives; annual reporting to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- Operational support: CEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes for internal CS partnership needs; others assessed case-by-case.
- Consultation: Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH support may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Governance and risk: Enforce confidentiality, licensing, and data-use restrictions; manage approvals and record-keeping.
- Metadata and provenance: Document licensing status, release scope (four-digit vs six-digit), and any pre-processing performed by CEH.
- Access controls: Implement secure storage and restricted access for licensed location data; track licence expiries and destruction confirmations.
- Compliance monitoring: Ensure licensees adhere to prohibitions on identification of precise locations, visits, and landowner compliance checks.
- Collaboration: Coordinate with CEH on exceptional releases and maintain regular reporting to CS partners.
- Public-interest alignment: Balance data utility with safeguarding sampling integrity and landowner goodwill for ongoing survey viability.
