# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides the field equipment andProcedures needed for soil core sampling in X-plots, including how to collect, store, and dispatch samples.

- Equipment list (highlights)
  - Vehicle and charging: Electric Cold Box (kept cool via vehicle power), mains charger for accommodation.
  - Tools and materials: knives, plastic plates, hammer, pliers (2 pairs), mallet, trowels (regular and long thin), notebook and pen, parcel tape, spare cores, labelled bags, mailbags, X-plot packs (cores, end caps, labelled bags), stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots.

- Sampling procedures (core collection overview)
  - Cores are located and collected at defined positions within each X-plot (5 sampling locations per square).
  - Core types and positions:
    - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
    - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of Core C; preserve litter layer.
    - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm x 4 cm; located 15 cm south of Core C (30 cm from south corner).
    - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm x 4 cm; located 15 cm west of Core C; oriented with bevelled end on soil surface.
  - For each core:
    - Clear vegetation and debris; insert pipe upright; cut bottom edge; hammer to level with soil surface.
    - If depth is insufficient or stones present, adjust position and record the issue.
    - Extract core with pliers, avoiding soil loss; rub off lumps; cap ends; seal in bag.
  - Composite soil sample (for 120 squares):
    - 8–10 sub-samples along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, to a depth of 15 cm.
    - Mix and fill the bag to the top white panel; if full, add more sub-samples until level reached.
    - Place composite sample in its own bag, then into a larger bag for transport.

- Sample labeling and handling
  - Use correctly labelled bags for each core type; ensure the right core is used for each position.
  - Keep track of issues (notes in envelope if problems like unusual vegetation, cow pats, boulders, etc.).

- Storage and dispatch (A1.1.4)
  - Core C (BLACK): bagged; stored with other black cores; kept cool in a cardboard box in the vehicle until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): bagged with other whites; stored in cool box; post with CEH Lancaster after all five samples are collected.
  - Core P (GREY): bagged with other grey cores; stored in cool box; post to CEH Lancaster after five samples.
  - Core N (WHITE): bagged with long grey cores; stored in cool box; post to CEH Bangor after five samples.
  - Soil Sample Bag: placed in cool box; mailed to CEH Lancaster.
  - Posting rules: post as soon as possible; if last post is Thursday, keep in cool box over weekend and post Monday; do not post on Friday; use Post Office if needed; consult OS map or Road Atlas for post offices.

- Data quality and traceability considerations
  - Record any sampling problems or deviations; maintain clear documentation to ensure data quality and reproducibility.
  - Maintain orientation and correct sequencing of cores to support data integrity and downstream analysis.
