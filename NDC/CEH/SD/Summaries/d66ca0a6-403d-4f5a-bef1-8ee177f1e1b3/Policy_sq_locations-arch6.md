# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations; applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for survey integrity, environment protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Protects ability to inform environmental policy in the future.
- Requests for information handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## When and how locations may be released
- Allowed at four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) under licence for identifying whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- If precise six-digit locations are essential, CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations; only very exceptional cases allow external release under licence.
- Spatial data from within squares (maps of habitats, features) could reveal square locations and thus follow same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- Four-digit releases do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases, but still under licence and with use restrictions.

## Licence terms and use restrictions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could identify square locations; no use to plan visits or check individual landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show evidence of project management standards (at least equivalent to JCOP).
- Four-digit licence terms are similar to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality criteria; users should not attempt to derive precise locations or claim having done so.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by senior authorised representatives of the licensee organisations.
- If access is denied, CEH will follow Act and Regulation procedures in supporting the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH will endeavour to provide pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations and potential CS location data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as a scientific lead and determine requirements; collaboration or payment terms are negotiated case-by-case.
