# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Field protocol for collecting and handling soil core samples across X-plots in 120 squares, with composite sampling and subsequent storage/shipping.
- Data and metadata relevance for stewards:
  - Each core has defined type, size, and exact location relative to centre quadrat (e.g., Core C: Black 15 cm, 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of centre quadrat corner).
  - Composite sample: 8-10 sub-samples taken along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat; bagged and labeled for a single soil package.
  - Core labeling and bagging scheme (C, F, N, P) and associated transport path (cool box, mailbags, regional destinations CEH Lancaster/Bangor).
  - Instructions to record anomalies or problems (e.g., roots, logistically difficult points) in notes within the envelope.
- Required equipment (to enable standardized data collection and later provenance):
  - Electrical equipment: Electric Cold Box (charged while driving), mains charger for accommodation.
  - Sampling tools and disposables: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs pliers, mallet, regular long and short trowels, parcel tape, spare cores, notebook and pen.
  - Core-specific supplies: labelled bags for X-plots, end caps and bags for X-plots, stamped/addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Clear, consistent core identification and orientation to ensure data traceability and reproducibility.
  - Detailed, recoverable notes for any sampling issue to support data quality assessment and metadata completeness.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Core types and positions:
  - Core C: Black, 15 cm long, 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
  - Core F: Short White, 8 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
  - Core N: Long White, 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from south corner).
  - Core P: Long Grey, 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter; 15 cm west of the black core; oriented bevelled end on soil surface.
- Procedure highlights:
  - Use the correct core in the correct position; clear vegetation; cut and extract with care to avoid losing soil.
  - If the ground is rocky or depth is insufficient, relocate and record the issue.
  - For difficult soils, use spare pipes; avoid losing soil from ends.
  - Ensure right orientation and prevent contamination/litter influence.
- Composite sampling (SQID):
  - Build a composite sample by extracting 8-10 sub-samples along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat with a long trowel; combine into a single bag to the level of the top white panel.
  - If depth or homogeneity is an issue, relocate and resample; record problems.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Per-square handling:
  - Core C (Black): store in its bag; group all black cores for a square in a spare bag; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional coordinator.
  - Core F (Short White): bag together with other short white cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in CEH Lancaster mailbag and post promptly.
  - Core P (Grey): bag with other long grey cores; store in cool box; after five samples, post in CEH Lancaster mailbag.
  - Core N (White) and associated long grey cores: store together; post in CEH Bangor mailbag after all samples for that square are collected.
- General handling:
  - Place the soil sample bag in the cool box immediately; then place in the appropriate mailbag (Lancaster or Bangor) and post as soon as possible.
  - Do not post on Fridays; if last post on Thursday is missed, box remains cool over weekend and posted Monday. Use the nearest Post Office if needed; refer to OS map data for post office locations.
- Documentation and governance:
  - Maintain a clear chain of custody through consistent labeling, packaging, and timely posting.
  - Record any issues or deviations to support metadata completeness and data quality assessments.

# Data Stewardship takeaways

- Data captured includes precise core types, locations, and sampling order, enabling reproducibility and traceability across 120 squares.
- Standardized metadata and labeling are critical for data discovery, quality assurance, and interoperability across regional coordinators (Lancaster/Bangor).
- Clear protocols for issues, storage, and dispatch support data quality, provenance, and timely data sharing.
- Operational controls (cool-box storage, avoidance of Friday posting, post-office guidance) help maintain sample integrity and downstream data reliability.
