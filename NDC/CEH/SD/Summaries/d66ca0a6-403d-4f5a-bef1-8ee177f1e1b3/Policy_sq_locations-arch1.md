# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim
- Maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest view; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision levels)
- 4-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Very exceptional circumstances may permit six-digit grid references under licence, with CEH-preprocessing preferred to avoid release; external release requires demonstration that related IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality protection.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could indirectly reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional conditions as six-digit releases.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to squares or to check landowner compliance.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to approved individuals for defined projects.
- Licences granted for finite periods; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Four-digit releases have IP/confidentiality terms less stringent than six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such capability.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the outlined principles.
- CEH issues hard-copy licences containing clauses reflecting these terms; signatories must have authority to bind the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe (subject to moderate demand).
- Requests from other organisations handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for a fee, negotiated case-by-case.
