## Data usage and purpose
- Data are structured to enable standardized monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Aims to categorize environmental variables (litter carbon stock) against standards and support time-series analysis.
- Data should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with monitoring responsibilities. 

## Special notes for analysts
- Values include explicit units and data types to facilitate integration with other datasets.
- Project and program context (ESPA, P4GES) supports traceability and potential data merging with related environmental datasets.
- Proper acknowledgment required for outputs derived from these data.
