# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Aim of the document: Describe the carbon stock survey design, field methods, laboratory analyses, data handling, and data publication processes used in the CAZ (Ankeniheny Zahamena) corridor, Madagascar, as part of the Can paying for global Ecosystem Services reduce poverty? project.

## Context and objectives

- Overall goal: Influence the development and implementation of payments for ecosystem services (PES) at international scale to alleviate poverty.
- Focus: Carbon stock assessment across land uses in CAZ, evaluating five IPCC pools with emphasis on Aboveground Biomass (AGB), Litter, Dead Wood (DW), and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) (BGB also considered).
- Outputs: Baseline carbon stock data to inform policy and PES-related decisions; data archived for long-term storage and valorization ( Environmental Information Data Centre - EIDC).

## Sampling design and zones of interest (ZOI)

- Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) chosen to capture representativeness of the CAZ:
  - ZOI1 Lakato
  - ZOI2 Andasibe
  - ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra
  - ZOI4 Didy
- ZOIs selected based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, bioclimate, soils, dry season), deforestation history, and access.
- In each ZOI, aim to survey 16 plots (4 land uses × 4 replicates) to capture LU variability; additional plots were surveyed within each ZOI to capture carbon stock variability, leading to totals of:
  - ZOI1: 28 sites
  - ZOI2: 48 sites
  - ZOI3: 28 sites
  - ZOI4: 28 sites
- Remote sensing identified site locations; field reconnaissance validated suitability and land-use type.

## Site identification and land uses

- Land uses (LU) considered for WP4:
  - Closed canopy
  - Tree fallow
  - Shrub fallow
  - Tany maty or Degraded land
  - Reforestation (identified via NGO/community interviews)
- Site criteria beyond LU type:
  - Slope < 45°
  - Each site ≥ 120 m × 120 m
  - Near patch centers to minimize edge effects; avoid unusual disturbances (e.g., mining)
  - Transects not crossing or following streams
  - Distance between sites ≥ 500 m
- Field surveys included site coordinates, slope, and deforestation history.

## Field methods and data collection

- Field reconnaissance to confirm remote-sensed sites meet criteria; assess indicator species and land-use history; verify accessibility.
- Minimal area test to determine representative sampling area:
  - Quadrat-based inventory starting at 1 m × 1 m, doubling the area until new species ceased appearing.
  - Result: 16 m² identified as the minimal area needed for C stock quantification.
- Field forms and materials:
  - Data collection sheets: site characteristics, forest inventory, Braun-Blanquet cover, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profile
  - Materials: compass, vertex, flags, cylinders, soil augers, quadrats
  - Samples bags with labeling and precision scales (0.01 g)
- Plot-level design (5 m radius) for biomass and soil carbon across LU types; identical design for soil carbon assessment in all LU types.

## Detailed field design by LU type

- Closed canopy and fallows
  - Forest inventory with four subplots within a circular plot
  - Saplings: 2 m radius area (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m); 5 randomly chosen species weighed and sampled
  - Trees: 5 m radius for DBH 5–10 cm, DBH 10–20 cm, and >20 cm; measure DBH and height; record local names
  - Standing dead wood: diameter at 1.3 m and top; classify wood density (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten)
  - Lying dead wood: 100 m transect; record diameter where transect rope intersects; record density class
  - Direct AGB: in 54 trees selected by species contribution; fell, separate into trunk/branch/leaves, weigh components; humidity samples collected
  - Understorey, litter, root mat: 25 cm × 25 cm quadrats; 1 m × 1 m quadrats for understorey; collect and lab-submit biomass
  - Root sampling: 1 m² soil pit for root description; classify roots into Medium (2–10 mm) and Coarse (>10 mm); describe distribution with depth
  - Percent cover (indicator species): Braun-Blanquet scale within 5 m radius
- Degraded land (Tany maty)
  - No sizable trees; biomass sampling, root description, litter and understorey sampling follow the same design as above
  - Data: understorey carbon stock, litter, root mat, soil carbon stock, root description, Braun-Blanquet data
- Soil sampling
  - Conducted at same subplots as understorey sampling
  - Auger sampling for soil carbon content: 0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments
  - Cylinder sampling for bulk density: depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm
  - Soil pits for profile description in subplot 1 (depth up to 1.30 m)

## Data handling and storage

- Data entry and archiving:
  - Field forms scanned and stored in project numeric archive
  - Data entered in Excel
  - Photos renamed and stored in Bangor University data center
  - Data organized into series and sent to EIDC (WP4 data) for long-term storage
- Sample management:
  - Field samples sent to LRI laboratory; stored at room temperature; lab numbering linked to field provenance
  - Lab worksheets coordinated with field identifiers

## Laboratory analyses

- Biomass analysis
  - Dry biomass determined by air- and oven-drying (75°C) until stabilization; typical ~48 hours
  - Subsamples collected for laboratory moisture analysis
  - Wood Specific Gravity (WSG) measured as part of separate analyses
- Soil analysis
  - Sample preparation: air dry (≥3 days), sieve to ≤2 mm, recombine; coarse fraction separated
  - Moisture content determined by drying at 105°C for 48 hours
  - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon (SOC) baseline
  - Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for rapid SOC prediction calibrated against Walkley-Black
  - δ13C stable isotope analysis on selected soils (soil profile samples) at LBMP Montpellier for carbon dynamics and land-use discrimination
  - Detailed soil analyses referenced in Manual n°3

## Data processing and carbon stock calculations

- Aboveground biomass (AGB)
  - Use allometric equations (from Chave et al. and others) to estimate biomass per tree from measured dendrometric variables
  - Sum per-plot biomass and scale to per-hectare (Mg ha⁻¹); convert biomass to carbon stock using a 0.5 conversion factor
  - Include floristic analyses (richness, diversity) and spatial structure
- Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mat
  - Dry weights converted to plot-level biomass and then to carbon using 0.5 factor
- Dead wood
  - Lying dead wood: volume from geometric calculations, density category (S/I/R), apply appropriate biomass equations to obtain biomass and carbon stock per plot
  - Standing dead wood: biomass from volume × density
- Soil organic carbon (SOC)
  - SOC per layer calculated as SOC = Σ(BD_i × C_i × (1 − CF) × t_i × 0.1)
  - SOC calculated for depths 0–30 cm (SOC30) and 0–100 cm (SOC100)
  - Consider equivalent mass method to account for density differences among LU types
- Data products
  - Data prepared for publication and integration into GIS-ready formats; ongoing data publication as per project outputs

## Data publication and references

- Publication plan includes maps and datasets supported by a set of peer-reviewed papers and project outputs (e.g., soil carbon mapping in Madagascar, carbon stock changes with land-use change)
- Key references cited cover carbon measurement methodologies, IPCC guidelines, and regional soil carbon studies

## Key takeaways for GIS specialists

- The project delivers a georeferenced, multi-LU carbon stock dataset across four representative zones in the CAZ, with detailed field inventories, soil profiles, and biomass measurements that feed into spatial carbon stock mapping and change analyses.
- The data framework integrates remote sensing-identified sites, field validation, and standardized measurement protocols, enabling robust GIS-based visualization of carbon pools (AGB, BGB, litter, DW, SOC) at plot, LU, and ZOI scales.
- All data and samples are archived with traceable identifiers (field → lab → archive) in centralized data centers (EIDC, LRI, Bangor), supporting reproducibility and future data reuse.
