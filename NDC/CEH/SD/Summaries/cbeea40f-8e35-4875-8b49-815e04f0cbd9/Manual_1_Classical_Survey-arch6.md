# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Context and aim
  - The p4ges project in Madagascar seeks to influence international payment for ecosystem services by quantifying carbon stocks as part of a broader poverty-reduction objective.
  - Focuses on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) across five IPCC pools, with emphasis on aboveground biomass (AGB), litter, dead wood, soil organic carbon (SOC), and belowground biomass (BGB).
  - This manual (WP4) establishes the first step for carbon quantification and archiving of generated datasets.

- Design, scope, and sampling strategy
  - Zone of Interest (ZOI) and site selection
    - Four ZOIs chosen to capture CAZ representativeness based on biophysical criteria, deforestation history, and access: Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy.
    - Biophysical criteria included altitude, slope, bioclimate, and soil type; zones designed to encompass major habitat conditions.
  - Land-use classification and site criteria
    - Land uses defined for sampling: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land, plus reforestation identified via NGO/local input.
    - Site criteria beyond LU type: slope less than 45°, transects near habitat center to avoid edge effects, minimum 120 m x 120 m sites, avoidance of unusual disturbances (e.g., mining), streams not crossed by transects, and at least 500 m between sites.
  - Plot design and sampling density
    - Each ZOI targeted 16 plots (4 land-use types x 4 replicates).
    - WP4 required additional plots to capture carbon stock variability, yielding: 28 sites in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, and 28 in ZOI4.
    - Sites identified by remote sensing; field reconnaissance confirmed suitability and data collection readiness.

- Field methods and data collected
  - Preliminary and administrative steps
    - Field reconnaissance to validate site suitability, indicator species, land-use history, and accessibility.
    - Administrative setup: permits, mission orders, insurances; field data sheets; field materials; labeling and sample bags.
  - Minimal area testing and field readiness
    - Minimal representative sampling unit determined via species inventories in progressively larger subareas, establishing 16 m² as minimal area for C stock quantification.
  - Plot-level design and measurements
    - Plot structure: generally a circular sampling area with nested subplots (up to 20 m radius) for different measurements.
    - Closed canopy and fallows: comprehensive forest inventory across four concentric circular areas (2 m radius for saplings DBH<5 cm, 5 m for trees 5–10 cm DBH, 10 m for 10–20 cm DBH, and 20 m for >20 cm DBH) including live and standing dead wood; lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect.
    - Aboveground biomass (AGB) by direct measurement: 54 trees across four species felled and weighed to obtain component biomass (trunk, branches, leaves) with lab moisture analyses for drying corrections.
    - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mats: sampled with 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats (litter/root mat) and 1 m x 1 m quadrats (understorey) with biomass weighed and samples taken for lab work.
    - Root sampling: 1 m² pit per subplot to describe and weight fine and coarse roots, with diameter-based classification (MR: 2–10 mm; CR: >10 mm) and depth distribution recorded.
    - Percent cover: indicator species percent cover estimated within a 5 m radius using Braun-Blanquet scale.
  - Degraded land (tany maty)
    - No tree inventory; biomass sampling, root description, litter/root mat, and soil data collected following the same sampling design as other land uses.
  - Soil sampling and soil profile
    - Soil sampling at four subplots per plot:
      - Bulk density: cylinders (8.1 cm diameter, 10 cm height) at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm.
      - SOC and carbon content: auger sampling at 0–100 cm in 10 cm increments (0–10 to 90–100 cm).
      - Soil profile description in a central 1.3 m soil pit (horizons, color, texture, structure, root depth, porosity).
      - Additional site data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.
  - Data handling in the field
    - Field forms (site characteristics, inventory, Braun-Blanquet coverage, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profile) collected and later scanned/archived.
    - Field data entered into Excel; photos renamed and stored; data series archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Laboratory analyses and sample management
  - Biomass analyses
    - Drying: biomass samples air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C to constant weight; moisture analyses performed in the lab.
    - Wood density (WG/S): wood specific gravity measured as part of biomass assessments.
  - Soil analyses
    - Sample preparation: air-dried, sieved to 2 mm, coarse fractions separated; ground to 200 microns for analyses.
    - Moisture content determination via oven-drying at 105°C.
    - Walkley-Black titration for soil organic carbon as calibration; Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction based on reference Walkley-Black data.
    - Stable isotopes: δ13C analysis for selected samples from various land uses and depths (Montpellier LBMP) to inform carbon dynamics and land-use classification.
  - Sample and data management
    - Samples tracked with lab numbers and field numbers; lab and field worksheets linked; data uploaded to EIDC; samples stored at LRI lab (Antananarivo) with temperature-controlled management.

- Data processing and carbon stock calculations
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB)
    - Tree-level biomass estimated using allometric equations (primarily derived from literature such as Chave et al. and Brown 2002) based on DBH, height, and wood density; biomass per plot scaled to per-hectare values.
    - Carbon stock per pool calculated by applying standard carbon conversion factors to biomass.
  - Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mats
    - Dry weights from field samples scaled to per-hectare biomass and converted to carbon stocks using standard factors.
  - Dead wood
    - Lying dead wood: biomass estimated from volume and density using diameter measurements along the transect and a volume formula.
    - Standing dead wood: biomass estimated from volume and density using a height-based volume equation.
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC)
    - SOC stock calculated per soil layer (0–30 cm or 0–100 cm) using bulk density, carbon content, coarse fraction correction, and layer thickness, following a specified formula (SOC = Σ(BD_i × C_i × (1 − CFi) × t_i × 0.1)).
    - Both SOC30 and SOC100 stocks computed to reflect depth-dependent carbon storage; equivalent mass method used to account for density differences across land uses.
  - Data quality and traceability
    - All data and samples linked to field and lab identifiers; datasets archived at EIDC for long-term storage and accessibility; publications and reports reference the resulting carbon stock datasets.

- Data publication and references
  - Data and findings have been published or are in process, with multiple peer-reviewed papers and conference outputs cited (e.g., soil organic carbon mapping in Madagascar, land-use change impacts on carbon stocks, and related methodological work).
  - References include IPCC guidelines (2003, 2006), Brown 2002, Braun-Blanquet scale (1964), and other methodological sources for biomass and SOC estimation.

- Summary of outputs and data products
  - A comprehensive, field-tested dataset for carbon stocks across CAZ land uses and depths, including AGB, litter, root mats, dead wood, and SOC stocks (SOC30, SOC100).
  - Data are organized by zone, land use, and plot, with associated GIS-referenced site data, vegetation inventories, soil profiles, and laboratory measurements.
  - Data are archived in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and linked to lab records (LRI) and isotopic analyses (Montpellier) for reuse in national-scale carbon mapping and broader ecosystem services assessments.
  - The manual provides a replicable workflow for data collection, processing, QA, and publication to support transparency, comparability, and reuse by other researchers and policy stakeholders.
