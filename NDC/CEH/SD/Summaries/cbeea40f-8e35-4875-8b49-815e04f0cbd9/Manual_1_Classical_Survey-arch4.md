# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Context and aim
  - Part of the p4ges project in Madagascar: influence payment for global ecosystem services and poverty alleviation.
  - Focuses on carbon stock assessment within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) across five IPCC-defined pools: Aboveground biomass (AGB), Belowground biomass (BGB), litter, dead wood (DW), and soil organic carbon (SOC).
  - Manual establishes the first step framework for carbon quantification and archiving of generated datasets (EIDC).

- Study design and scope
  - Zones of Interest (ZOI): four representative zones in CAZ (Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy) chosen to capture variation in biophysical conditions, deforestation history, and access.
  - Land uses (LU): Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty or degraded land; reforestation identified through NGO/local input and included among WP4 sites.
  - Site selection criteria: slope <45 degrees; transects near habitat center to minimize edge effects; plot size ≥120 m × 120 m; avoid disturbances (e.g., mining); transects avoid streams; sites ≥500 m apart.
  - Sampling intensity: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU × 4 replicates); extra plots for WP4 to better capture C stock variability ( totals: 28 sites in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, 28 in ZOI4).

- Field reconnaissance and sampling framework
  - Field reconnaissance to validate remote-sensed site suitability, assess indicator species, collect land-use history, and verify accessibility.
  - Minimal area test conducted (July 2014) to determine representative sampling area; testing showed 16 m² as the minimal area for carbon stock quantification.

- Administrative, data collection, and field logistics
  - Administrative prep: permits, mission orders, insurances.
  - Field forms: five types covering site characteristics, tree inventory and regeneration, cover estimates (Braun-Blanquet), and sampling of saplings, litter, roots, and soil profiles.
  - Equipment and sample handling: mapping and field tools (compass, vertex, decameter, flags); sampling cylinders and augers; labeled sample bags; precise mass scales; photos and data stored in project/Y datacenters and archived at EIDC.

- Plot-level sampling design
  - General plot design: a central 5 m radius plot for all C pools; degraded land uses follow the same approach.
  - Closed canopy and fallows: four nested circular subplots around a center to sample progressively larger-diameter classes and biomass components:
    - 2 m radius: saplings (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.3 m), 5 random sapling species weighed and sampled.
    - 5 m radius: DBH and height for trees 5–10 cm DBH.
    - 10 m radius: DBH and height for trees 10–20 cm DBH.
    - 20 m radius: DBH, height, and local names for trees >20 cm DBH; standing dead wood measured with additional depth data; lying dead wood sampled along a 100 m transect.
  - Direct aboveground biomass: in closed canopy, 54 trees across four species selected and felled to measure trunk, branch, and leaf biomass; samples for lab moisture analysis collected.
  - Understorey, litter, and root mat: sampling with nested quadrats (25 cm × 25 cm for litter/root mat; 1 m × 1 m for understorey vegetation); biomass weighed and lab-sub-samples prepared.
  - Root description: 1 m² soil pits at plot center to classify roots by diameter (<2 mm; 2–10 mm; >10 mm) and document root depth/distribution.
  - Percent cover: indicator species percent cover estimated within a 5 m radius using Braun-Blanquet scale.

- Degraded land sampling
  - On tany maty/degraded land, no trees beyond 5 cm DBH; biomass, root description, litter, understorey, and soil data collected following the same design framework.

- Soil sampling and profiling
  - Soil sampling in the same subplots as understorey sampling; two methods:
    - Auger sampling for SOC content across 0–100 cm at 10 cm increments.
    - Cylinder sampling for bulk density at depths: 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm.
  - Soil profile description to 1.3 m in central subplot (color, texture, structures, root depth, porosity).
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, and deforestation history.

- Data handling, storage, and archiving
  - Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel; photos renamed and stored in Bangor University data center.
  - All field and lab data organized into data series and submitted to Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) as ESPA WP4 data for long-term storage and valorization.

- Laboratory analyses
  - Biomass analysis: air-dried samples oven-dried at 75°C; weights recorded until stabilization; wood specific gravity determined (as per related manuals).
  - Soil analyses: sample preparation (air-drying, sieving to ≤2 mm, grinding to ~200 μm); moisture via 105°C drying; Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon; Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction; stable carbon isotopes (δ13C) for selected samples analyzed at Montpellier LBMP; all data archived at EIDC.

- Data processing and carbon stock calculations
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB): tree-level biomass estimated with allometry using equations from Chave et al. (2005, 2014), Vielledent et al. (2012), etc.; plot-level biomass per hectare derived from summing tree biomass and scaling to 1 ha; converts biomass to carbon stock using a 0.5 conversion factor; includes understorey and floristic data where applicable.
  - Litter, understorey, and root mats: biomass densities converted to per-hectare values; carbon stock calculated using the same 0.5 factor.
  - Dead wood: lying dead wood biomass calculated from volume and density; standing dead wood biomass calculated per standard allometric/volume-density equations; results aggregated to plot-level carbon stock.
  - Soil carbon stocks: SOC stocks computed per soil layer using bulk density, carbon content, layer thickness, and coarse fraction adjustments; SOC30 and SOC100 calculated to 30 cm and 100 cm depths; optional equivalent-mass method applied to account for density differences across land uses.
  - Data governance: all outputs prepared for publication and integration with WP4 and broader data sharing practices.

- Data publication and references
  - Data and findings published in multiple scientific papers (e.g., on national-scale soil organic carbon mapping and effects of land-use change on carbon stocks in Madagascar) and shared through project outlets, with formal references listed in the manual.

- Key considerations and scope for data leadership
  - Emphasizes end-to-end data stewardship: design-driven data collection, standardized forms, rigorous field-to-lab workflows, and long-term archiving (EIDC).
  - Ensures metadata, data provenance, and traceability across biomass, litter, root, soil, and isotopic datasets.
  - Encourages harmonization across zones, land-use types, and pools to enable robust carbon stock assessments and comparability with other sites or projects.
