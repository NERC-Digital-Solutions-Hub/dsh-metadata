# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Total_above_ground_carbon_stock.csv

## Overview
- Datasets summarize carbon stocks on each site and subplot for the total above-ground biomass pool.
- Included pools: trees (>5 cm diameter), saplings (>1.3 m height, <5 cm DBH), standing dead wood, lying dead wood, understorey, and litter.

## Data structure and variables
- Site_ID: P4GES site code; Information = Text String; Unit = (not specified here)
- subplot: Categorical; Information = subplot where the sample was collected; Unit = S1 / S2 / S3 / S4
- tree_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of trees >5 cm diameter; Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)
- saplings_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of saplings (>1.3 m height, <5 cm DBH); Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)
- standing_dead_wood_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of standing dead wood; Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)
- lying_dead_wood_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of lying dead wood; Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)
- understorey_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of herbaceous biomass and small trees <1.3 m; Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)
- litter_carbon_stock: Carbon stock of litter (leaf litter and root mat); Variable type = Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1)

## Data quality, metadata, and notes
- Notes: "means no data available" (missing data indicator)
- Metadata completeness and unit definitions are provided; however, data quality considerations include potential gaps across sites/subplots and the need for metadata verification when integrating with other datasets.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Indicator basis: above-ground carbon stocks by pool across sites and subplots
- Data needs for implementation: consistent site coding, subplot notation, and unit standardization; ensure data provenance and governance (public sharing where appropriate) and complete metadata
- Use in reporting: supports dashboards and reports on carbon storage and changes across spatial units; informs policy decisions on land carbon management and environmental health monitoring

## Governance and dissemination considerations
- Data sharing and openness should align with metadata standards; ensure originator data is properly cited and acknowledged
- Maintain data quality processes (cleaning, transformation, analysis) and transparent metadata to support reproducibility and policy use
