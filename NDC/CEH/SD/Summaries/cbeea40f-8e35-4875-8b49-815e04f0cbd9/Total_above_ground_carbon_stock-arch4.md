# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Total_above_ground_carbon_stock.csv

- Overview
  - Describes carbon stocks on each site and subplot for the total above-ground biomass pool.
  - Carbon pools included: trees, saplings, understorey, standing dead wood, lying dead wood, and litter.
  - Provides a DOI for citation and acknowledges ESPA and P4GES origins.

- Data provenance and attribution
  - Programme: ESPA; Project: P4GES.
  - DOI: https://doi.org/10.5285/cbeea40f-8e35-4875-8b49-815e04f0cbd9
  - Acknowledgement required for products derived from these data: Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo.

- Data structure and identifiers
  - Site_ID: P4GES site code; Information = text string.
  - Site_ID, Unit: .
  - subplot: Information = subplot where the sample was collected; Variable type = Categorical; Unit = S1/S2/S3/S4.

- Variables and units
  - tree_carbon_stock: carbon stock of trees > 5 cm diameter; Numeric; Unit = milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1).
  - saplings_carbon_stock: carbon stock of trees >1.3 m and diameter < 5 cm; Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.
  - standing_dead_wood_carbon_stock: carbon stock of standing dead wood; Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.
  - lying_dead_wood_carbon_stock: carbon stock of lying dead wood; Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.
  - understorey_carbon_stock: carbon stock of herbaceous biomass and small trees < 1.3 m; Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.
  - litter_carbon_stock: carbon stock of litter leaf litter and root mat; Numeric; Unit = Mg.ha-1.

- Data quality and availability
  - Notes indicate “means no data available” for unspecified cases.
  - Emphasizes need for clear metadata, data quality checks, and handling of missing values.

- Implications for data governance and use (aligned with Data Leaders’ aims)
  - Clear, component-level breakdown supports end-to-end data system thinking and user-oriented products.
  - Rich provenance, explicit attribution, and standardized variable definitions aid discoverability and reuse.
  - Metadata includes sample geography (sites and subplots), enabling targeted data gathering, quality assessment, and prioritization.
  - Opportunities for collaboration and community data practices through cross-site carbon stock data and associated documentation.
