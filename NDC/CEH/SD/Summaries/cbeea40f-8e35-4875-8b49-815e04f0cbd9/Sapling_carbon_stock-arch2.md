# DATA HEADER information for Sapling_carbon_stock.csv

## Overview
- The dataset records the carbon stock of regenerating tree clusters (saplings).
- Associated with ESPA Programme and the P4GES project; includes DOIs and project websites.
- Acknowledgement from Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo is required for products derived from these data.

## Dataset Scope and Structure
- Data header describes the variables collected for sapling carbon stock within regenerating tree clusters.
- Measurements focus on saplings within a 2 m radius circle around each site.
- Data are intended to support standardized environmental monitoring and policy performance assessment.

## Key Variables and Measurements
- site_ID: P4GES site code (Text)
- Number_saplings: count of saplings with diameter < 5 cm and height > 1.3 m within 2 m radius (Numeric)
- Number_collected_saplings: number of saplings collected among the population within 2 m radius (Numeric)
- Fresh_weight_total: total fresh weight of collected saplings (grams)
- Fresh_weight_sample: weight of field-collected sample(s) (grams)
- Dry_weight_sample: oven-dried weight of subsample(s) (grams)
- Dry_weight_collected_saplings: oven-dried weight of all collected saplings (grams)
- Biomass: biomass stock of saplings (units: mg ha^-1)
- Stock_C: carbon stock of saplings (units: mg ha^-1)

Note: The Unit column sometimes shows "."; missing data indicators may appear in the dataset as "Notes - means no data."
