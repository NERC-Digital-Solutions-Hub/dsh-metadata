# DATA HEADER information for Understorey_carbon_stock.csv

## Overview
- Records the carbon stock of the herbaceous plants understorey.
- Part of the ESPA Programme and the P4GES project.
- Acknowledgement required for products derived from these data: Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo.
- Data header defines the structure, fields, and units used in the dataset.

## Data provenance and scope
- Programme: ESPA; Project: P4GES.
- Dataset origin includes field sampling designed to quantify understorey carbon stock.
- Information about data originators and project context is provided to support data traceability.

## Variables and measurements
- site_ID: P4GES site code; Type: Text; Information: site identifier.
- Subplot: Location within the site where the sample was collected; Type: Categorical; Information: Subplot (S1, S2, S3, S4).
- Area: Size of the sampled area; Type: Numeric; Information: 1 m x 1 m quadrat area; Unit: square metre (m^2).
- Species: Species observed in the sample; Type: Text/String; Information: Species observed.
- freshweight: Total fresh weight of understorey in the sample; Type: Numeric; Information: Fresh weight; Unit: grams.
- freshweight_sample: Fresh weight of the subsample taken from the total understorey; Type: Numeric; Information: Subsample fresh weight; Unit: grams.
- dry_weight_sample: Dry weight of the subsample after drying; Type: Numeric; Information: Subsample dry weight; Unit: grams.
- Biomasse: Biomass stock of the understorey; Type: Numeric; Information: Biomass stock; Unit: milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1).
- Stock_C: Carbon stock of the understorey; Type: Numeric; Information: Carbon stock; Unit: milligrams per hectare (Mg.ha-1).

## Sampling design and area
- Sampling uses a 1 m x 1 m quadrat per subplot, enabling standardized comparisons across sites.
- Subplots S1–S4 provide spatial replication within each sampling unit.

## Data quality, metadata and governance
- Notes indicate that missing data are represented by -, NA, or blank cells.
- Emphasizes the need for metadata to verify data suitability and consistency.
- Metadata completeness and data provenance support usability in monitoring frameworks.
- Public sharing of datasets is encouraged, aligning with data governance and openness standards, though governance requirements may pose barriers.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Clear, standardized definitions and units are essential for comparability across sites and studies.
- Incorporating detailed metadata (including data origin and project provenance) enhances traceability.
- Design of monitoring frameworks should address potential barriers identified in the dataset context: access, data silos, and data sharing constraints; ensure data cleaning, transformation, and QA processes are defined at the source.
- Encourages explicit data sharing and acknowledgement requirements to support transparent policy evaluation and future decision-making.
