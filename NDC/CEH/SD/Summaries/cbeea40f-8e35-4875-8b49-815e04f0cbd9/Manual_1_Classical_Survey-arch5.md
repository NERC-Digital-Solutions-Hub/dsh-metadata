# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

## Overview
- Timeframe: April 2014 – June 2015; update in February 2017
- Context: p4ges project in Madagascar examining how paying for global ecosystem services could reduce poverty; carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) focusing on AGB, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon (SOC) across five IPCC-defined pools (with emphasis on AGB, litter, DW, SOC in this manual)

  - Unit consistency across measurements (e.g., DBH, height, biomass, soil depth; SOC in Mg C ha-1; area scales in hectares)
  - Dedicated glossary and abbreviations provided (e.g., IPCC terms, LU types, sampling schemes)
- Data storage, archiving, and long-term access
  - Field data and photos stored using project data centers; scanned field forms archived
  - Data entered into Excel; datasets and photos deposited to EIDC WP4 data repository for long-term storage and valorization
  - Links to published outputs and datasets maintained (data publication section)
- Data accessibility and publication
  - Publications and in-process outputs listed to document data usage and dissemination
  - Protocols designed to support discoverability and reuse by data users and other WPs

## Data Lifecycle, Design, and Workflows
- Zone of Interest (ZOI) and site selection
  - Four ZOIs chosen to capture CAZ representativeness (Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy)
  - Land-use categories used for site placement; criteria include biophysical factors, deforestation history, and access
- Site identification and criteria
  - Site criteria beyond land-use: slope < 45°, patch-centered to minimize edge effects, minimum area ≥ 120 m × 120 m, avoid disturbances (e.g., mining), avoid streams, distance between sites ≥ 500 m
  - Remote-sensing-based site location, with field reconnaissance to confirm suitability
- Sampling design and minimal area
  - Minimal representative sampling area established as 16 m² (based on iterative quadrat sampling to capture species diversity)
  - In each ZOI, 16 plots per ZOI (4 land-use types × 4 replicates); WP4 additional plots to capture carbon stock variability
- Field procedures and data collection
  - Administrative preparations (permits, mission orders, insurances) and field documents prepared
  - Data collection sheets cover site characteristics, inventory, coverage (Braun-Blanquet), sapling/litter/root/mat sampling, and soil profile description
  - Equipment and sample bags prepared; labeling and field data capture conducted
- Plot-level design and measurement
  - Plot structure involves nested subplots (e.g., 2 m sapling area, 5 m DBH/height plots, 10 m DBH, 20 m DBH, 20 m radius trees; arrangement for litter and understorey sampling)
  - Aboveground biomass measured directly for a subset of trees; diameters, heights, and wood density recorded
  - Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mat sampled via quadrats; weights recorded and samples sent to lab
  - Root description and sampling conducted in soil pits; roots categorized by diameter (<2–10 mm; >10 mm)
  - Percent cover estimated for indicator species using Braun-Blanquet scale
- Soil sampling and analysis
  - Soil samples collected by auger (0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments) for carbon content; bulk density samples collected by cylinders
  - Soil profile description recorded (horizons, color, texture, root depth)
  - Analytical approaches include Walkley-Black soil organic carbon method, Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction, and δ13C stable isotope analyses (subset)
- Data handling and sample management
  - Field forms scanned and archived; data entered into Excel; photographs organized and stored in project data centers
  - Field-to-lab sample tracking established with lab numbers and provenance records
  - Lab analyses conducted at LRI (Lab of Isotopes and Soil Carbon) in Antananarivo; samples stored at room temperature and air-dried; lab and field provenance linked

## Data Products and Analytical Approaches
- Biomass analysis
  - Direct biomass measurement for a subset of trees; components separated (trunk, branches, leaves) and weighed after drying
  - Allometry used to estimate biomass and carbon stock per tree and per plot; scaling to 1 ha using standard allometric relationships
  - Carbon stock derived from biomass using established conversion factors
- Litter, understorey, and root mat
  - Dry weights converted from field measurements; densities scaled to 1 ha for plot-level carbon stock
- Dead wood
  - Lying dead wood: volume estimation from intercepts along 100 m transects and diameters; biomass computed from volume × density
  - Standing dead wood: biomass estimated via volume × density; standard equations applied
- Soil organic carbon (SOC)
  - SOC stock calculated per depth layer using bulk density, carbon content, coarse fraction correction, layer thickness
  - SOC30 and SOC100 computed to represent carbon stocks to 30 cm and 100 cm depths, respectively
  - Equivalent mass method considered for cross-land-use density adjustments

## Data Management, Quality Assurance, and Challenges
- Data quality and traceability
  - Frequent cross-checks between field data, lab results, and sample IDs to ensure traceability
  - Multi-WP coordination to align sampling across carbon, hydrology, and biodiversity components
- Practical challenges highlighted
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and data discoverability issues
  - Timely data delivery from field to lab; standardization across diverse systems and formats
  - Handling large datasets and older databases; interoperability considerations
- Documentation and reproducibility
  - Detailed field protocols, data sheets, and lab procedures documented to enable reproducibility
  - Data are organized as data series and deposited in EIDC for long-term access and reuse
