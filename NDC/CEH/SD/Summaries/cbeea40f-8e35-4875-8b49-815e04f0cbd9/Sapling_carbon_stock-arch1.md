- Data notes and interpretation
  - Notes: "means no data" indicates missing entries for applicable fields.
  - Some units may require clarification (e.g., Biomass and Stock_C lists mg/ha with the Mg.ha-1 notation).
- Methodological context
  - Measurements are centered on saplings within a 2 m radius around each site, focusing on biomass and carbon stock calculations.
  - Field and sample weights are used to derive biomass; subsequent conversion yields biomass stock and carbon stock estimates.
- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Ensure correct interpretation of units (mg/ha vs. Mg/ha notation) when merging with other datasets.
  - Be mindful of missing data indicated by notes; plan imputation or exclusion accordingly.
  - Cross-check with related materials (Manual 1_Classical_Survey) for methodological details.
