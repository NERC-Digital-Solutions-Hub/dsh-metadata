# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Period and authors: April 2014 – June 2015; update February 2017; manual produced for carbon surveying under the p4ges project in Madagascar.

- Context and purpose:
  - Aims to influence international payment for ecosystem services by quantifying carbon stocks in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
  - Focuses on carbon stock assessment across five IPCC pools; this manual concentrates on Aboveground Biomass (AGB), litter, dead wood, and soils (SOC) as the basis for carbon quantification. Soil belowground biomass (BGB) and other pools are addressed in other components.
  - Outlines design sampling, sampling strategy, preliminary data handling, and sets the foundation for carbon quantification; datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Study design and data infrastructure:
  - Zones of Interest (ZOIs): four zones representing CAZ variability (Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy).
  - Land uses (LU) identified for sampling: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty or Degraded Land; reforestation also identified via NGOs and community input.
  - Sampling framework: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU types × 4 replicates); additional plots were added within ZOIs to capture variability in carbon stocks (total plots: 28 in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, 28 in ZOI4).
  - Site selection criteria: slope < 45 degrees; plots ≥ 120 m × 120 m; edge effects minimized; avoid disturbances and streams; minimum 500 m between sites.
  - Field reconnaissance and minimal area test (16 m²) used to validate site relevance and determine representative sampling area.

- Field sampling design at plot level:
  - Uniform plot design across pools: 5 m radius plots (also used for degraded land); four nested subplots for inventory and biomass measurements.
  - Closed canopy and fallows:
    - Four circular subplots with radii 2 m, 5 m, 10 m, and 20 m for saplings, small/medium/large trees, and total tree biomass.
    - Lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect; wood density categorized as Sound (S), Intermediate (I), Rotten (R).
    - Aboveground biomass by direct measurement: 54 trees across four species felled and weighed by component (trunk, branches, leaves); moisture analysis in lab.
    - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: 25 cm × 25 cm quadrats for litter/root mat; 1 m × 1 m quadrats for understorey; samples sent to lab.
    - Root sampling: 1 m² soil pit to classify roots by diameter (<2 mm, 2–10 mm, >10 mm) and describe distribution with depth.
    - Percent cover (Braun-Blanquet scale) estimated for indicator species within a 5 m radius around the central inventory area.
  - Degraded land (tany maty) specifics: no large trees (DBH > 5 cm); biomass sampling, root description, percent cover still conducted within the same sampling framework.

- Soil sampling and analysis:
  - Soil sampling points coincide with understorey sampling (points 1–4 in subplots).
  - Two parallel methods:
    - Auger sampling for soil carbon content at depths 0–100 cm (every 10 cm interval).
    - Cylinders for bulk density at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, and 80–90 cm.
  - Soil profile description to 1.30 m depth in subplot 1 to assess horizons, colors (Munsell), textures, structures, root depth, and porosity.
  - Additional soil data: GPS, slope, deforestation history.
  - Soil analyses:
    - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon (SOC) as calibration reference.
    - Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC prediction.
    - Stable isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples to study carbon dynamics across land uses (lab in Montpellier).

- Data handling, entry, archiving, and sample management:
  - Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel; photos stored in project data center.
  - Data organized into series and archived at EIDC; samples sent to LRI laboratory and tracked with field/lab numbers; lab samples stored and managed accordingly.

- Laboratory analyses and biomass processing:
  - Biomass: air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C until constant weight; moisture content determined; wood specific gravity determined (as per related manuals).
  - Soils: samples air-dried, sieved (2 mm), weighed; moisture content determined at 105°C; samples prepared for Walkley-Black, MIRS, and isotopic analyses per standard SOPs.

- Data handling and carbon stock calculations:
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB): tree-level biomass estimated with allometry equations (e.g., Chave et al.; various published models) using measured DBH, height, and wood density; plot-level AGB density scaled to per-hectare area; carbon stock derived using a conversion factor (e.g., 0.5).
  - Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mat: biomass density measured in field, dried, upscaled to 1 ha, and converted to carbon stock using the same 0.5 factor.
  - Lying dead wood: biomass estimated from volume-based calculations using diameter measurements along transects and wood density classes; carbon stock aggregated per plot.
  - Standing dead wood: biomass calculated from volume and density; aggregated to plot and per-hectare levels.
  - Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) stocks: calculated per soil layer using bulk density, carbon content, organic matter fraction, soil thickness, and coarse fraction adjustment; two depth considerations (SOC30 and SOC100) with equivalent mass method where relevant.
  - All data and equations reference standard sources (IPCC guidelines, Brown 2002, Parras-Alcántara et al. 2013, etc.) and are organized to enable cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses.

- Data publication and references:
  - Publication-ready outputs and related scientific papers prepared (examples include works on national soil organic carbon mapping, land-use impacts on carbon stocks, and soil carbon variability in Madagascar).
  - Key references include Braun-Blanquet (1964), Brown (2002), IPCC guidelines (2003, 2006), and method SOPs (Winrock/CI frameworks) among others.

- Overall outcome:
  - Establishes a standardized, field-tested methodology for quantifying carbon stocks across aboveground, litter, dead wood, and soil pools in CAZ.
  - Provides a replicable design for sampling, data handling, laboratory analyses, and carbon stock calculation to support ecosystem service payments and rural poverty reduction efforts.
