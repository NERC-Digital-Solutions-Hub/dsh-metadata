# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

## Overview
- Period: April 2014 – June 2015; updated February 2017.
- Objective: Influence the development and implementation of payments for ecosystem services at international scale by conducting a carbon stock survey in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ) forest corridor, eastern Madagascar.
- Scope: Quantify carbon stocks across five IPCC pools (Aboveground Biomass AGB, Belowground Biomass BGB, Litter, Dead Wood DW, Soil Organic Carbon SOC) within CAZ, focusing on AGB, litter, deadwood and soil survey as basis for carbon quantification; datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Sampling Design and Zones of Interest (ZOI)
- Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) to capture representative CAZ conditions:
  - ZOI1 Lakato
  - ZOI2 Andasibe
  - ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra
  - ZOI4 Didy
- ZOI selection considered biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, climate, soil), deforestation history, and access.
- Within each ZOI, field sampling targeted land-use patches to reflect variation.
- Minimal area test determined a representative sampling unit: 16 m² (16 m² corresponds to minimal area needed for consistent carbon stock quantification).
- Remote-sensing identified sites; one site per land-use type; total sites: 28 (ZOI1), 48 (ZOI2), 28 (ZOI3), 28 (ZOI4).

## Land Use Classification and Site Criteria
- Land uses (based on Styger et al., 2007): Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty/Degraded land; reforestation added after NGO/community input.
- Additional site criteria beyond LU type:
  - Slope < 45 degrees
  - Site size ≥ 120 m × 120 m
  - Near patch center to minimize edge effects; avoid disturbances (e.g., mining)
  - Transects not crossing streams; sites at least 500 m apart
- Site counts per ZOI: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU types × 4 replicates); extra plots added within each ZOI to capture C stock variability (WP4).

## Field Reconnaissance and Sampling Design
- Field reconnaissance by biophysical WPs to validate remotely identified sites and assess land-use history and indicator species; confirm accessibility.
- Plot-level sampling design:
  - Central circular plot with 5 m radius for biomass sampling (uniform across land uses; degraded land uses also use 5 m radius).
  - Four concentric subplots within the circle for stratified measurements:
    - 2 m radius: sapling inventory (DBH < 5 cm, H > 1.30 m), sample 5 species
    - 5 m radius: trees 5–10 cm DBH; record DBH, height, local names
    - 10 m radius: trees 10–20 cm DBH; record DBH, height, local names
    - 20 m radius: trees > 20 cm DBH; record DBH, height, local names; standing dead wood density categories (S/I/R)
  - Lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect through plot center; record intercept diameters and density categories.
  - Standing dead wood: DBH, height, density category; for some plots, root depth and distribution noted.
- Biomass sampling by land-use type:
  - Closed canopy: direct aboveground biomass measured via selecting 54 trees across four species, weighing trunk/branch/leaves after felling; sub-samples for moisture analysis.
  - Understorey, litter, and root mat: 25 cm × 25 cm litter/root mats; 1 m × 1 m for understorey biomass; lab samples collected.
  - Root descriptions: 1 m² pit per plot center to classify roots by diameter (<2 mm MR; >10 mm CR), wash, weigh, and describe root depth.
  - Percent cover: Braun-Blanquet scale within a 5 m radius around the tree inventory area.

## Soil and Other Data Collection
- Soil sampling within the four subplots (points 1–4) at depths 0–100 cm (0–10, 10–20, ..., 90–100 cm) via auger for carbon content; bulk density via 8.1 cm diameter cylinders (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm); moisture samples collected.
- Soil profile description in the central subplot pit (1.30 m depth): horizons, color (Munsell), texture, structure, root abundance, and porosity.
- Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history (collected via interviews).

## Field to Laboratory Data Handling
- Field forms: five types (site characteristics, inventory, coverage, sapling/litter/root sampling, soil profile).
- Materials: compass, vertex, flags, cylinders, auger; sample bags with precise labeling.
- Data entry: field forms scanned and stored; data entered in Excel; photos stored in project data center; data series archived at EIDC.
- Sample management: field–lab linkage via field and lab numbers; samples sent to LRI lab in Antananarivo; stored at room temperature and air-dried; lab numbering aligned to soil provenance.

## Laboratory Analyses and Biomass/Soil Methods
- Biomass: air-dried then oven-dried at 75°C; dry weight measured; moisture corrections performed; wood specific gravity (WSG) determined as part of additional analyses (Manual n°4).
- Soil analyses:
  - Walkley–Black method for preliminary soil organic carbon (SOC) content, calibration reference to MIRS predictions.
  - Mid Infra-Red Spectroscopy (MIRS) for rapid soil carbon content estimation, using Walkley–Black as calibration reference.
  - Stable carbon isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples across land-use types and soil depths; performed at LBMP, Montpellier; data archived at EIDC.
- All analyses and data are designed to support SOC stock calculations across depths and land uses.

## Data Handling and Carbon Stock Calculations
- Data handling aims to compute carbon stocks in all pools for all sites.
- Aboveground biomass (AGB):
  - Use allometry equations (direct measurements and literature-based) to estimate biomass per tree (kg tree−1) and per plot (Mg ha−1).
  - Convert biomass to carbon stock using a conversion factor (commonly 0.5; Brown 2002).
  - Include floristic structure and spatial patterns (from Braun-Blanquet and diversity measures).
- Litter, understorey vegetation and root mats:
  - Dry weights converted to plot-level stocks and scaled to 1 ha; use same 0.5 conversion to C stock.
- Dead wood:
  - Lying dead wood: volume-based biomass using measured diameters along transect and density by category (S/I/R); formulae to estimate biomass per piece and per plot.
  - Standing dead wood: biomass from volume and density; aggregate for plot-level stocks.
- Soil carbon (SOC):
  - SOC stock per depth layer calculated using SOC concentration, bulk density, layer thickness, and coarse fraction adjustment.
  - SOC30 (0–30 cm) and SOC100 (0–100 cm) depths calculated; equivalent mass approach used to account for differing soil densities across land uses.
- Overall, carbon stocks are aggregated across pools to yield total carbon per plot and per hectare.
