## Overview
- Documents a mass mortality event of saiga antelope in May 2015, with approximately 200,000 deaths and a peracute haemorrhagic septicaemia cause attributed to Pasteurella multocida serotype B.
- The dataset captures field necropsy findings from 33 saiga carcasses (adults and calves) collected at two sites, Tengiz and Turgai, during May 2015.
- Research and data work were collaborative across multiple institutions: field teams, Royal Veterinary College (UK), RIBSP (Kazakhstan), and Wake Forest School of Medicine (USA). Data deposited to the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## What is included in the dataset
- Metabase of field-pathology findings for 33 saiga carcasses.
- Comprehensive data structure covering:
  - Core identifiers: Animal_ID, Country, Site, lat/lon coordinates, Date, Time_Death, Time_Necropsy, Maturity, Age, Sex.
  - Condition and status: Carcass_Cond, Body_Cond, various post-mortem and environmental indicators (Rigor_Mortis, Recumbency, Diarrhoea, Nasal_Fluid, Lung conditions, etc.).
  - Clinical/anatomical observations: Numerous binary indicators (1/0) for signs such as diarrhoea, nasal congestion, lung oedema/froth, heart and liver findings, intestinal and gast
