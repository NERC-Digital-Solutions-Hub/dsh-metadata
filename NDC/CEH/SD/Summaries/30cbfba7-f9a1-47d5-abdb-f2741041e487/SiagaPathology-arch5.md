# Pathological findings in the mass mortality event of saiga antelope, May 2015

## Overview
- Reports a Metabase dataset of field-pathological findings for 33 saiga carcasses from two die-off sites (Tengiz and Turgai) during May 2015, following a mass mortality event that killed ~200,000 saiga and threatened the species.
- Purpose of the data: document necropsy results, disease etiology (peracute haemorrhagic septicaemia due to Pasteurella multocida serotype B), and supporting pathology to complement prior reports.
- Data are deposited and accessible via the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with a DOI, and are associated with a peer-reviewed article (Sanchez-Monge & Kock, 2018).
