# Pathological findings in the mass mortality event of saiga antelope, May 2015

- Overview
  - In May 2015, around 200,000 saiga antelopes died within a month, causing a two-thirds drop in the global population and threatening the Betpak-Dala population with extinction; calving season context and mass aggregations were relevant to the die-off.
  - The mortality event was attributed to peracute haemorrhagic septicaemia due to opportunistic Pasteurella multocida serotype B, supported by the first full pathology report for this event.
  - The study presents a Metabase of field-pathology findings for 33 carcasses (adults and newborns) from two monitored sites, Tengiz and Turgai, in May 2015.
  - Data and supporting documentation are deposited with the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Pathological methodology
  - Field necropsies: 16 saiga in Tengiz (13 adults, 3 calves) and 18 in Turgai (12 adults, 6 calves).
  - Processing: samples fixed in formal saline; sent to the Royal Veterinary College (RVC), UK; Tengiz samples processed at RIBSP (Kazakhstan) and re-processed at RVC; some samples reviewed by NC Forest School of Medicine (Wake Forest collaboration).
  - Histopathology and veterinary review: routine processing at RVC; external review by Wake Forest School of Medicine.
  - Data notes: some processing artefacts noted due to reprocessing; potential misinterpretation risk with a separate PPR infection case in a goat.

- Mineral analysis methodology
  - Three Tengiz saiga sampled for tissue mineral analysis using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for iron, copper, zinc, cobalt, and molybdenum in liver tissue.

- Other considerations
  - Re-processing artefacts and potential diagnostic artefacts noted; Wake Forest review in parallel with a goat PPR case; no supportive evidence for PPR or other infections in the saiga samples.

- Data structure and variables
  - The dataset includes structured fields such as:
    - Animal_ID, Country, Site, LAT/LON, Date, Time_Death, Time_Necropsy, Maturity (Adult/Calf), Age, Sex, Carcass_Cond (Very Good/Good/Poor), Body_Cond, Warm, Rigor_Mortis, Recumbency, Diarrhoea, Blood Diarrhoea (BS_Diarrhoea), Nasal_Fluid, Nasal_Cong, Frothy_Saliva, Dyspnoea, Sign_Struggle, Ecchymoses, Ascites, various organ-specific observations (e.g., Lung_Cong, Lung_Oedem, Lung_Froth, Lung_Emph, Heart_Clot, etc.), and numerous lymph node, stomach, intestine, kidney, adrenal, and reproductive observations.
  - Extensive histopathology records by organ (spleen, liver, lung, heart, kidney, trachea, rumen, adrenal glands, intestine, lymph nodes, bladder, stomach, oesophagus, thyroid, pancreas, gonads) with analyses performed at RVC and Wake Forest (WF) and notes on the presence/absence of pathology.
  - Mineral analyses: Iron, Copper, Zinc, Cobalt, Molybdenum, and Copper/Molybdenum ratio, with notes.
  - Additional fields: Necropsy notes, Histo_Samples, Notes_Histo, and a comprehensive list of histopathology results by organ and lab.

- Data availability and provenance
  - Data prepared and deposited to the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) by Fiorella Sánchez-Monge and Dr. Richard Kock.
  - Field necropsy conducted by Kock and collaborators; logistics supported by ACBD; samples processed and reviewed across multiple institutions (RVC, RIBSP, Wake Forest).
  - Supporting documentation available for the cited 2018 publication; data intended for long-term environmental health and policy monitoring.
