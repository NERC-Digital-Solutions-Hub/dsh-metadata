## Overview
- Context: In May 2015, ~200,000 saiga antelopes died within a month, during calving season, leaving ~30,000 survivors and signaling extinction risk for this critically endangered species.
- Objective: Document field pathology findings and provide data to support understanding of disease-related mortalities and their causes; the work builds a full pathology report for the 2015 die-off.
- Key etiological finding (per the introduction): Cause of death identified as peracute haemorrhagic septicaemia due to Pasteurella multocida serotype B, with consideration given to potential misinterpretation of other infections (e.g., PPR) and artefacts.

## Dataset scope and structure
- Sites and sampling:
  - Two monitored die-off sites: Tengiz and Turgai.
  - Necropsies conducted on carcasses found at these sites during May 2015.
  - Reported counts: 16 carcasses from Tengiz and 18 from Turgai (totaling 34 in the text; the introduction notes field-pathology on 33 carcasses; note potential discrepancy).
- Data type:
  - Field-pathological findings (necropsy observations) and associated metadata.
  - Additional laboratory analyses: histopathology (RVC and Wake Forest), mineral analysis (ICP-MS on liver), and cross-lab reviews.
- Data deposit
