# Pathological findings in the mass mortality event of saiga antelope, May 2015

## Overview
- Reports the mass mortality event in May 2015 where ~200,000 saiga antelopes died within a month, leaving ~30,000 survivors in Betpak-Dala.
- Cause identified as peracute haemorrhagic septicaemia due to opportunistic Pasteurella multocida serotype B.
- Presents a Metabase with field pathology findings for 33 carcasses from two monitored sites (Tengiz and Turgai, Kazakhstan) and supporting documentation for the associated publication.

## Spatial and temporal scope
- Spatial coverage: two die-off sites in Kazakhstan (Tengiz Oblast and Turgai Oblast).
- Temporal scope: May 2015 (die-off period and subsequent necropsies).
- Data include geographic identifiers and coordinates for carcass locations, enabling spatial analysis and mapping of mortality patterns.
