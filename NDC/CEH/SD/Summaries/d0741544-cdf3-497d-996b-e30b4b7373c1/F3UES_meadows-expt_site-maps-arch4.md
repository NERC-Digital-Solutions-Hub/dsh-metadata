# Supplementary supporting document for dataset: Biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity in perennial meadow plantings in two urban areas in the UK

## Overview
- Provides maps of field sites and plot layout for the experimental meadow biodiversity study in two urban areas in the UK.
- Primary documentation for the experiment and the data files is in F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf.

## Site layouts and plot-to-treatment mappings
- Bedford-Chiltern Avenue
  - Plots: 1–10
  - Treatments: 1 = F, 2 = C, 3 = B, 4 = I, 5 = CONTROL, 6 = A, 7 = H, 8 = G, 9 = E, 10 = D
- Bedford-Brickhill Heights (additional plots at Robin Hill)
  - Plots: 1–10
  - Treatments: 1 = CONTROL, 2 = A, 3 = G, 4 = I, 5 = H, 6 = C, 7 = @Robin Hill, 8 = @Robin Hill, 9 = @Robin Hill, 10 = @Robin Hill
- Bedford-Robin Hill (additional plots at Brickhill Heights)
  - Plots: 1–10
  - Treatments: 1 = @Brickhill Heights, 2 = @Brickhill Heights, 3 = @Brickhill Heights, 4 = @Brickhill Heights, 5 = @Brickhill Heights, 6 = F, 7 = E, 8 = B, 9 = D, 10 = (unspecified)
- Bedford-Goldington Green
  - Plots: 1–7 noted
  - Treatments: 1 = I, 2 = D, 3 = F, 4 = C, 5 = A, 6 = CONTROL, 7 = G

  - Treatments: 1 = G, 2 = D, 3 = H, 4 = I, 5 = C, 6 = E, 7 = A, 8 = B, 9 = CONTROL, 10 = F
- Luton-Bramingham Road
  - Plots: 1–10
  - Treatments: 1 = F, 2 = G, 3 = B, 4 = E, 5 = D, 6 = A, 7 = H, 8 = Control, 9 = I, 10 = C

## Data governance and usability notes
- This document is supplementary to the main dataset; ensure linkage to the primary dataset and documentation.
- Some site entries include qualifiers (e.g., @Robin Hill, @Brickhill Heights) that should be captured in metadata to avoid ambiguity.
- Several mappings show incomplete treatment values for certain plots; verify complete mappings against the primary documentation (RTF file).
