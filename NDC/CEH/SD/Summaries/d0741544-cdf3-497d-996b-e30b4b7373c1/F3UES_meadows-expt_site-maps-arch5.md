# Supplementary supporting document for dataset: Biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity in perennial meadow plantings in two urban areas in the UK.

## Overview
- Provides maps of field sites and plot layouts for the experiment.
- Primary documentation for the experiment and the data files is in a separate file: F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf.

## Site and plot organization
- Bedford – Chiltern Avenue
  - Plots: 1 through 10
  - Treatments: 1 = F, 2 = C, 3 = B, 4 = I, 5 = CONTROL, 6 = A, 7 = H, 8 = G, 9 = E, 10 = D
- Bedford – Brickhill Heights (additional plots at Robin Hill)
  - Plots: 1 through 10
  - Treatments: 1 = CONTROL, 2 = A, 3 = G, 4 = I, 5 = H, 6 = C, 7 = @Robin Hill, 8 = @Robin Hill, 9 = @Robin Hill, 10 = @Robin Hill
- Bedford – Robin Hill (additional plots at Brickhill Heights)
  - Treatments are listed by plot with mappings such as @Brickhill Heights for several plots, plus 6 = F, 7 = E, 8 = B, 9 = D, 10 = (unspecified)
- Bedford – Goldington Green
  - Plots: 1 through 7
  - Treatments: 1 = I, 2 = D, 3 = F, 4 = C, 5 = A, 6 = CONTROL, 7 = G
- Bedford – Jubilee Park
  - Plots: 1 through 10
  - Treatments: 1 = G, 2 = D, 3 = H, 4 = I, 5 = C, 6 = E, 7 = A, 8 = B, 9 = CONTROL, 10 = F
- Luton – Bramingham Road
  - Plots: 1 through 10
  - Treatments: 1 = F, 2 = G, 3 = B, 4 = E, 5 = D, 6 = A, 7 = H, 8 = Control, 9 = I, 10 = C

## Data governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure consistent metadata, including site name, plot IDs, and treatment codes across all sites.
- Validate that plot-to-treatment mappings align with the referenced maps and supplementary material.
- Maintain linkage to the primary documentation (F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf) for experimental design details and data collection protocols.
- Manage updates to maps and plots if additional plots or site adjustments occur (noted as “additional plots” at some sites).
- Address data accessibility and discoverability by cataloguing the dataset with clear site, plot, and treatment identifiers.
