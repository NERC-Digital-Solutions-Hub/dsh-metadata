# Supplementary supporting document for dataset: Biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity in perennial meadow plantings in two urban areas in the UK

## Overview
- Supplementary maps and plot layout for field experimental sites examining biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity in perennial meadow plantings across two UK urban areas.
- Primary documentation and data files are described as being available in F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf.

## What is included
- Maps of field sites and the plot layout used in the experiment.
- Site nomenclature and locations:
  - Bedford – Chiltern Avenue
  - Bedford – Brickhill Heights (plus additional plots at Robin Hill)
  - Bedford – Robin Hill (plus additional plots at Brickhill Heights)
  - Bedford – Goldington Green
  - Bedford – Jubilee Park
  - Luton – Bramingham Rd
- For each site, plots are numbered 1–10 with corresponding Treatment assignments. Treatments are denoted by codes (e.g., F, C, B, I, A, H, G, E, D, etc.) and include explicit references to CONTROL at several sites.
- Some sites include “@Robin Hill” or “@Brickhill Heights” annotations indicating additional plots at adjacent locations.

## Data references and access
- The supplementary document points to the primary experiment documentation and data files located in F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf.
- The layout information provides the necessary link between biodiversity observations and the defined vegetation-height/diversity treatments.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, site-specific plot-to-treatment mappings essential for monitoring biodiversity responses to vegetation structure in urban meadow plantings.
- Facilitates cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses when integrated with core environmental datasets.

## Data use and reuse considerations
- The explicit plot and treatment mappings enable secondary analyses and data integration with other environmental data sources.
- Access to the underlying data is intended to be supported by the accompanying primary documentation and data files referenced in the supplementary document.
