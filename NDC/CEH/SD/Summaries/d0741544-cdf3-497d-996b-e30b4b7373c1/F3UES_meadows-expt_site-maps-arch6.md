# Supplementary supporting document for dataset: Biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity in perennial meadow plantings in two urban areas in the UK

## Overview
- Provides maps of field sites and plot layouts for the biodiversity meadow experiment conducted in two urban UK areas.
- Serves as supplementary to the main dataset; primary experimental documentation and data files are located in F3UES_meadows-expt_supporting-document-for-data.rtf.
- Helps link plot-level data to specific treatments and site contexts for analysis of biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity.

## What this document contains
- Maps of field sites showing plot layouts for each site.
- A site-by-site mapping of plot numbers to treatment codes, enabling alignment of observed data with experimental design.

## Sites and plot-to-treatment mappings
- Bedford - Chiltern Avenue
  - Plots 1–10 are listed; treatments assigned to each plot include a mix of letter/label codes (e.g., F, I, A, H, G, E, D) and a CONTROL.
  - Some entries reference non-standard labels or placeholders (e.g., @Robin Hill) in treatments for certain plots.

- Bedford - Brickhill Heights (additional plots at Robin Hill)
  - Plots and treatments mapped with a mix of labeled codes (e.g., CONTROL, A, G, I, H, C) and several plots at @Robin Hill.

- Bedford - Robin Hill (additional plots at Brickhill Heights)
  - Plots mapped to treatments using a combination of conventional labels (e.g., F, E, B, D) and references to @Brickhill Heights.

- Bedford - Goldington Green
  - Plots mapped to treatments including I, D, F, C, A, and a CONTROL, followed by G.

- Bedford - Jubilee Park
  - Plots 1–10 with treatment assignments including G, D, H, I, C, E, A, B, CONTROL, and F.

- Luton - Bramingham Rd
  - Plots 1–10 with treatment assignments including F, G, B, E, D, A, H, CONTROL, I, and C.

## How to use this supplement (Data Support perspective)
- Data linking:
  - Use the plot-to-treatment mappings to attach treatment context to every field observation (e.g., biodiversity metrics, vegetation height, diversity measures) collected per plot.
  - Ensure that each site’s plot IDs align with the corresponding treatment codes when merging with the main dataset.
- Data quality and QA:
  - Check for consistency across sites where placeholders (e.g., @Robin Hill) appear; determine whether these refer to renamed or embedded site identifiers and standardize before analyses.
  - Validate that all plots 1–10 are represented for each site and that treatment codes used in the data files match those in this map.
- Analysis readiness:
  - Treat treatment codes as categorical variables; preserve site and plot identifiers to enable site-level and cross-site comparisons.
  - Use the maps to recreate or confirm the experimental design structure when exploring biodiversity responses to vegetation height and diversity.

## Notes and considerations
- The document emphasizes maps and plot layouts as the primary content, with the primary experimental documentation located in the referenced RTF file.
- Some treatment entries include non-standard labels or place-based references (e.g., “@Robin Hill”), indicating a potential need for data cleaning/standardization during integration.
- This supplement supports data exploration and self-serve analysis by clarifying how plots correspond to specific treatments across multiple sites.
