# Soil carbon data in the Conwy catchment in North Wales (2013 and 2014) as detailed in the table Turf2Surf_Soil_data.csv

## Overview
- Supplement to the Turf2Surf WP2 supporting documentation.
- Details the data structure for the soil carbon dataset in the Conwy catchment (2013 and 2014), as described in Turf2Surf_Soil_data.csv.
- Also notes that several datasets share a common first set of columns, enabling cross-dataset comparisons and joins.

## Datasets sharing the first 9 columns
- Plant structural measurements in North Wales and Northwest England (2013 and 2014)
- Plant aboveground and belowground standing biomass measurements in the Conwy catchment in North Wales (2013 and 2014)
- Soil physical, chemical and biological measurements in the Conwy catchment in North Wales (2013 and 2014)
- Plant physiological measurements in North Wales and Northwest England (2013, 2014 and 2016)
- Plant aboveground and belowground standing biomass measurements in the Conwy catchment in North Wales (2013 and 2014)

## Column definitions (A–I)
- A: Unique Site number (as introduced in Table 1 of the supplementary documentation)
- B: Habitat
- C: Detailed Habitat description
- D: Site name
- E: Ecosystem Component (Plant, Soil, or Roots)
- F: If Component is Plant, the plant species; otherwise NA
- G: Plot number (1–4)
- H: Replicate number
- I: Soil depth interval (for Soil and Roots)

## Data characteristics
- Missing values are indicated as NA (e.g., restricted soil depths, limited replicates, or outliers)
- The dataset described has 48 additional columns beyond the first 9 and consists of 644 rows
