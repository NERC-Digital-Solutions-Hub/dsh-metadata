# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2021 to 2022

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset for Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
  - Fortnightly sampling from January 2021 to end of 2022.
  - Variables cover surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Water samples integrated from 0 to 5 meters.
  - Measurements taken from a boat at the deepest part of the lake, from a marked buoy location.
  - If the buoy could not be reached, samples were taken from the shore (and surface temperature and oxygen recorded); water samples were not integrated in these cases (Flag 2).

- Data content and units
  - Temperature (TEMP): degrees Celsius
  - Surface oxygen (OXYG): % air-saturation
  - Secchi depth (SECC): metres
  - Alkalinity (ALKA): µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: unitless
  - Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per litre
  - Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per litre
  - Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per litre
  - Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per litre
  - Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg per litre
  - Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre

- Data structure and format
  - Data provided as comma-separated values (CSV) with columns including Date, Variable, Value, Sign(if<LOD), and Flag.
  - Flags: Flag 1 = sample taken at buoy; Flag 2 = sample taken from shore.

- Quality control and data status
  - Raw data have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.

- Data limitations and considerations
  - Missing data due to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

- Temporal coverage
  - Data span from January 2021 through the end of 2022.

- Funding and governance
  - Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme (National Capability).
  - Data validation supported by NERC (NE/Y006208/1) as part of the ACCESS-UK programme (National Capability).
