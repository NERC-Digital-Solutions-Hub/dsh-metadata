# Details of Data Structure

- The dataset comprises 17 .dat files from electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys conducted in the MAKUTAPORA basin, Tanzania, between 28/06/2019 and 16/07/2019.
- Data format: ASCII-delimited text readable by the res2dinv program; separators include comma, blank space, or line feed/carriage return.
- Purpose and compatibility: Structured to be read by res2dinv, with explicit line definitions to support standard inversion workflows.
- Line definitions (summary):
  - Line 1: Survey line name
  - Line 2: Electrode spacing
  - Line 3: Array type (1=Wenner, 2=Pole-pole, 3=Dipole-dipole, 6=Pole-dipole, 7=Schlumberger, 8=Equatorial dipole-dipole, 11=Non-conventional/general)
  - Line 4: Sub-Array type (0=none, 1=general)
  - Line 5: Inversion header choice (whether to invert apparent resistivity or direct resistance)
  - Line 6: Flag for resistance values (1 to indicate resistance)
  - Line 7: Number of data points
  - Line 8: Type of x-location (0=no topography; 1/2=topography present; in this dataset, topography is present)
  - Line 9: IP data flag (0=none, 1=present)
- Data points: Each subsequent line corresponds to one electrode arrangement with 10 columns, including 4 electrode positions (C1, C2, P1, P2), x/z locations, and the measured resistance value (column 10).
- Units: Resistance values are in ohm-meters (Ωm) and correspond to electrical resistivity of the subsurface.
- Data scope per file: Contains a survey number (e.g., Survey_01) and a location-specific suffix (e.g., _NZ01), indicating the location and survey index.
- Data origin and processing: .dat files were generated by converting raw .stg files from an AGI SuperSting R8 resistivity meter using a bespoke Python script; the script also added topographic data to the .dat files.
- Metadata and related documentation:
  - SupportingDocumentation.txt: Detailed collection/generation methods and quality control methods used.
  - Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv: Survey numbers with suffixes, coordinates (start/end easting/northing), geometry (line length), and survey parameters (dipole size, max dipole, number of electrodes, electrode spacing).
  - A map of survey lines and a .kmz file of these lines are provided in the associated paper.
- Data availability and provenance: The dataset is accompanied by location-specific survey metadata and references to the associated paper for further methodological details.
