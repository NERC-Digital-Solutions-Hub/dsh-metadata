# Supporting Documentation

- Dataset scope and contents
  - Results of 17 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys.
  - Location: Makutapora Basin, central Tanzania.
  - Collection period: 28 June 2019 to 16 July 2019.
- Metadata and ancillary files
  - Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv contains coordinates, survey geometry, line name suffixes, locations, electrode spacings, and associated parameters.
- Data collection methods
  - Instrument: AGI SuperSting R8 (STING) resistivity meter.
  - Configuration: dipole-dipole.
  - Electrode spacings and parameters are detailed in Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv.
  - Raw data: .stg files converted to .dat with bespoke Python code (conversion scripts available on request from the corresponding author).
- Data quality control
  - Negative values removed.
  - Each apparent resistivity measurement captured in normal and reciprocal configurations.
  - The measurement used is the mean of the normal and reciprocal values.
  - Values where normal and reciprocal differ by more than 5% from the mean are removed.
- Purpose and scientific context
  - Aimed at delineating superficial geological structures to understand their role in mediating surface-groundwater interactions within the Makutapora wellfield and their influence on groundwater recharge.
  - Corresponding authors responsible for survey design and data collection oversight: E. Zarate and M. O. Cuthbert.
- Data products and reuse
  - Outputs are designed to support interpretation and potential self-service analysis (e.g., mapping, cross-sections) related to groundwater recharge and hydrological structure.
- Access to materials
  - Python conversion code and raw data can be provided by request through the corresponding author.
