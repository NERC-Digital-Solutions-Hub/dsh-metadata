# Electrical resistivity tomography surveys in the Makutapora Basin, central Tanzania

## Overview
- Dataset contains results of 17 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys conducted in the Makutapora Basin, central Tanzania, from 28/06/2019 to 16/07/2019.
- Includes coordinates and survey geometry in Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv, which also lists line name suffixes and locations.

## Collection and Generation Methods
- Data collected using an AGI SuperSting R8 resistivity meter in a dipole-dipole configuration.
- Electrode spacings and related parameters are included in Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv.
- Detailed methodology is described in the associated paper.
- Raw .stg files were converted to uploaded .dat dataset files using bespoke Python code; these .dat files can be provided on request by contacting the corresponding author.

## Quality Control
- Raw data filtered by: (1) removing negative values; (2) using the mean of normal and reciprocal configuration measurements as the value; (3) discarding values where normal and reciprocal measurements differ by more than 5% from the mean.
- Data collected to delineate superficial geological structures and assess their role in mediating surface–groundwater interactions within the Makutapora wellfield and their influence on groundwater recharge.
- Corresponding authors responsible for survey design and oversight: E. Zarate and M. O. Cuthbert.

## Purpose and Context
- Aimed at examining superficial geological structures to understand their control on surface–groundwater interactions and groundwater recharge in the Makutapora wellfield.

## Access and Responsibility
- Data were prepared to support analysis and are described in the associated paper; raw .stg files have been converted to .dat files.
- The converted .dat files (and raw .stg files) can be provided on request by contacting the corresponding author.
