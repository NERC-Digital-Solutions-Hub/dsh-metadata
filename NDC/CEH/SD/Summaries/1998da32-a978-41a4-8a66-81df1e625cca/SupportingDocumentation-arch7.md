- Dataset overview: 17 electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) surveys in the Makutapora Basin, central Tanzania, collected between 28 June 2019 and 16 July 2019.
- Data products and files: coordinates and survey geometry available in Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv (includes line name suffixes and locations); raw .stg files converted to uploaded .dat dataset files via bespoke Python code; these .dat files can be provided on request.
- Acquisition details: data collected with an AGI SuperSting R8 resistivity meter in a dipole-dipole configuration; electrode spacings and related parameters are listed in Supp_Table_for_Survey.csv; more detailed methodology available in the associated paper.
- Quality control: raw STING data filtered by removing negative values; measurements taken in normal and reciprocal configurations with the mean used as the value; any data where normal and reciprocal values differ by more than 5% from the mean were removed.
- Purpose and scope: results used to examine and delineate superficial geological structures to understand their role in mediating surface–groundwater interactions and controlling groundwater recharge in the Makutapora wellfield.
- Access and authorship: survey design and oversight conducted by E. Zarate and M.O. Cuthbert; raw data and methodological details available upon request through the corresponding authors.
