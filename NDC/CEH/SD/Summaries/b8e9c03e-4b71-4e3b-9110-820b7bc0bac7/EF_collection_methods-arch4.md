# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width augur to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Samples passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until ready for processing.

Bulk density

- Bulk density measured from two cores per site at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving, weighed, and bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

pH

- pH determined by mixing 5 g fresh soil with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio.
- Measurement performed with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

Volumetric moisture content

- 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
- Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) using an autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry weight.
- For mineralisation, another 5 g of soil incubated at 25 °C for 14 days; extracts analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m−2 day−1).

Microbial biomass

- 5 g fresh soil placed in desiccator with damp paper towels and a beaker of 50 ml chloroform; vacuum applied until chloroform boiled, then left for 24 hours to lyse cells.
- A second 5 g sample used as unfumigated control.
- After 24 hours, nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes; filtered and analysed by autoanalyser at 4:1 dilution for fumigated samples and 2:1 for unfumigated.
- Measured DIN and PO4; dissolved carbon analysed using TOC-L at the same dilutions.
- Values adjusted for water content; KE_C (0.35) or KE_N (0.54) used to correct for extraction efficiency.

Particle Size

- Particle size distribution determined by passing soil through sieves of >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.
