# Soil sampling and analysis protocol

- Soil sampling
  - Six soil samples per site collected using a 4 cm width auger to a depth of 10 cm as far as possible.
  - Samples passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
  - Stored at 5 °C until processing.

- Bulk density
  - Bulk density taken from two cores per site; depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm.
  - Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
  - Soil weighed; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

- pH
  - Soil (5 g) mixed with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio.
  - pH measured with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

- Volumetric moisture content
  - 5.00 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
  - Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl; shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
  - Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) using an autoanalyser.
  - Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × [water content of sample (l) + extract vol (l) × dilution factor] × 100) / dry weight of soil used.
  - A second 5 g soil sample placed in extraction bottles, covered with Parafilm, and incubated at 25 °C for 14 days; extracted and analyzed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days = mineralisation g m⁻² day⁻¹.

- Microbial biomass
  - 5 g fresh soil placed in glass beakers in a desiccator with damp paper towels and 50 ml chloroform; desiccator sealed and vacuum applied until chloroform boiled; left for 24 hours to lyse cells.
  - A further 5 g fresh soil weighed for an unfumigated comparison.
  - After 24 hours, nutrients extracted using 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes.
  - Solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 and analyzed on the autoanalyser at dilutions of 4:1 for fumigated and 2:1 for unfumated samples.
  - DIN and PO4 measured; dissolved carbon measured using TOC-L at the same dilutions as N.
  - Values adjusted for water content as above; KE_C or KE_N_E quotients used to adjust for extraction efficiency, 0.35 and 0.54 respectively.

- Particle Size
  - Particle size distribution measured by passing soil through sieves: >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.
