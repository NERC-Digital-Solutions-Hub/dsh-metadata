# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk.
- Test carbon and nutrient (nitrogen) cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the plant groups.
- Infer how functional traits of plant groups influence carbon storage, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health.

## Experimental design

- Timeframe
  - March 2013 to September 2016.

- Plant functional groups (FG) and traits
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; tall leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
    - Predicted outcome: high soil carbon storage; carbon moved deeper into soil.
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
    - Predicted outcome: limited carbon and nitrogen activity; smaller presence.
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; fast turnover.
    - Predicted outcome: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term carbon storage.
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Species pooling
  - Large, detailed lists of species assigned to FG1, FG2, and FG3 (extensive species inventories illustrated in the study).

- Plot layout and replication
  - Grid of plots: 7 across (width) by 6 down (height).
  - Each plot 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots.
  - All possible combinations of the three FGs represented across the grid (i.e., every plot contains a unique FG combination; multiple plots replicate each combination six times).
  - Top and bottom slope positions used to spatially replicate treatments.

- Treatment structure
  - Topo-slope arrangement to ensure replication of FG combinations.
  - Rain shelters introduced from 2015 onwards to study drought effects.

## Drought treatment

- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots.
- Shelters remained from early June to mid-July to imitate an extreme drought (approximately once every 100 years).

## Measurements and outcomes

- Primary focus
  - Carbon storage in soil and rates of carbon and nitrogen cycling.
  - Soil fertility and overall ecosystem health as influenced by FG composition.
- Comparative framework
  - Assess how different plant functional groups influence biogeochemical processes.
  - Evaluate drought effects on these processes using the shelter treatment.

## Timeline and scope

- 2013–2016: Main experimental period for establishing plant communities and measuring biogeochemical processes.
- 2015–2016: Introduction of drought treatment via rain shelters to examine resilience under water limitation.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates a structured, trait-based approach to monitoring environmental health indicators (carbon storage, nutrient cycling, soil fertility, ecosystem health).
- Emphasizes the importance of:
  - Clear experimental design with replication and spatial arrangement to reduce confounding factors.
  - Documentation of functional groups and species traits to interpret ecosystem processes.
  - Longitudinal data collection to observe temporal dynamics and responses to drought.
- Highlights data considerations relevant to monitoring work:
  - The need to define and standardize measures (e.g., soil carbon, nitrogen fluxes, microbial activity).
  - The value of incorporating drought scenarios to test system resilience.
  - The importance of metadata and robust recording of plant–soil relationships across treatments and time.
