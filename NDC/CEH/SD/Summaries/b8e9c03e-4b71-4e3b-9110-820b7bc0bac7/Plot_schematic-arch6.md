# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim: A long-term field study (March 2013 – September 2016) to test how plant communities, defined by functional effects traits, influence carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health on bare chalk. The three plant groups are expected to have measurably different effects on carbon and nutrient cycling.

- Plant functional groups (FG) and expectations:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; tall leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species. Predicted to promote substantial soil carbon storage via deep rooting.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited below-ground activity; expected minimal impact on soil carbon and nitrogen.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potentially lower long-term soil carbon storage due to fast turnover.

- Species: Specific representative species are listed for each FG (examples provided), illustrating the functional trait groupings.

- Experimental design and plot layout:
  - Grid: 7 plots across by 6 plots down (7 x 6 = 42 plots total).
  - Plot size: 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Treatments: Every plot represents a combination of FG1, FG2, and FG3, with all possible combinations included. Repeats: six replicates per row.
  - Plot labeling: Detailed mapping shows each plot’s FG composition (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3).

- Data collection focus and potential outputs:
  - Key measurements: carbon storage in soil, nitrogen cycling, microbial activity, and overall ecosystem health; plant community composition and trait expression.
  - Data products: dashboards or reports to enable end-users to self-serve analyses; outputs may be shared or prototyped early to refine data products and guidance.
  - Data considerations: handling multiple plant combinations and replicated plots facilitates comparative analyses across FG treatments and their effects on soil and carbon dynamics.

- Treatments and timeline:
  - Drought treatment: From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots.
  - Drought protocol: Shelters were deployed from June to mid-July each year to mimic an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

- End note:
  - The design supports robust cross-treatment comparisons of functional-group effects on carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, and ecosystem function under both normal and drought conditions, informing data-driven insight across chalk grassland ecosystems.
