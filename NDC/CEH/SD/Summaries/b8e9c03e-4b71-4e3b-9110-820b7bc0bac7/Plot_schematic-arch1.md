# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk and test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates.
- Compare these rates to the characteristics of plant groups (functional effects traits) to infer impacts on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
- Timeframe: March 2013 to September 2016.

## Plant functional groups (FG) and expectations
- FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves. Includes annuals, biennials, and some long-lived species.
  - Prediction: lots of carbon storage in soil; roots deliver carbon deeper, less accessible to microbes.
  - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, among others.
- FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited above-ground presence.
  - Prediction: minimal carbon and nitrogen cycling activity.
  - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, among others.
- FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast growth and long-lived.
  - Prediction: very rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduced soil carbon storage due to quick turnover.
  - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., among others.

## Experimental design and plot layout
- Created a grid of plots: 7 across by 6 down.
- Each plot is 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots.
- All combinations of the three FG groups were included across the grid, replicated six times.
- Plot labeling referenced FG combinations and position on slope (top to bottom).

## Timeline and drought treatment
- Rain shelters added from 2015 onwards to study drought effects.
- Shelters operated from early June to mid-July to simulate an extreme drought (once in 100 years).

## Data collection and outcomes (focus for analysis)
- Primary measurements: carbon storage in soil, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, soil microbial activity, and overall ecosystem health.
- Comparative analysis across FG groups to determine how plant functional traits influence soil carbon dynamics and nutrient processes.
- Data collection spanned the study period (2013–2016), with drought treatments incorporated from 2015 onward.
