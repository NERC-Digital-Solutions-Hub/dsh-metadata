# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples per site were collected with a 4 cm width auger, reaching 10 cm depth as far as possible; samples were sieved through a 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots and stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density

- Bulk density (BD) was measured from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; samples were dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- BD calculated as mass divided by volume.

## pH

- pH determined by mixing 5 g fresh soil with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and measuring with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

## Volumetric moisture content

- 5 ± 0.001 g fresh soil per sample was dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; post-drying weight used to calculate moisture content as a proportion of the wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation

- 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour; solution filtered through Whatman No. 1 paper.
- Filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) using an autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using the formula: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry weight.
- Another 5 g of soil incubated for 14 days at 25 °C; extracted and analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3+NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days = mineralisation in g m⁻² day⁻¹.

## Microbial biomass

- 5 g fresh soil placed in a desiccator with damp paper towels and a beaker of 50 ml chloroform; sealed and vacuum applied until chloroform boiled, left 24 hours to lyse cells.
- A second 5 g sample served as unfumigated control.
- After 24 hours, nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes; solution filtered and analyzed by autoanalyser at dilutions of 4:1 for fumigated and 2:1 for unfumigated.
- DIN and extractable PO4 measured; dissolved carbon analyzed using TOC-L at the same dilutions.
- Values adjusted for water content using the previous moisture correction; extraction efficiency corrected with KE_C = 0.35 and KE_N = 0.54.

## Particle Size

- Particle size distribution determined by sieving through >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm fractions.
