# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Objective and scope
- Test carbon and nutrient cycling rates in relation to plant community composition on bare chalk.
- Compare measured cycling rates to characteristics of plant groups defined by functional effects traits.
- Run period: March 2013 to September 2016.

## Plant functional groups (FG)
- Plants were categorized into three functional groups based on traits that influence environmental interactions.
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; long-lived species; predicted to promote substantial soil carbon storage by depositing carbon deeper in soil.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited, modest carbon and nitrogen cycling.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential lower long-term carbon storage.

- Examples provided for each FG (selected species spanning groups).

## Experimental design and layout
- Grid layout: 7 plots across (width) by 6 plots down (length), replicated six times.
- Plot size: 8 m × 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
- Each plot contains a unique combination of the three FG groups, ensuring all FG combinations are included.
- Top-of-slope to bottom-of-slope labeling used to map plots and FG combinations across the gradient.

## Data collection and outputs
- Primary aims: quantify carbon storage in soil, and carbon and nitrogen cycling rates; examine how these outputs vary with FG composition.
- Outputs intended in standard environmental monitoring formats (e.g., reports, maps, charts) for clear interpretation and policy relevance.

## Drought treatment (rain shelters)
- From 2015 onwards, rain shelters were added to plots.
- Purpose: assess the effect of drought on plant–soil carbon and nutrient dynamics.
- Shelter period: June to mid-July, simulating an extreme drought (once in 100 years).

## Data management and monitoring relevance
- Emphasizes use of established data streams and standardized methods to enable comparison across plots and treatments.
- Data generated could be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with monitoring practices.
- Addresses challenges of maximizing dataset value and enabling access to underlying data for broader use.
