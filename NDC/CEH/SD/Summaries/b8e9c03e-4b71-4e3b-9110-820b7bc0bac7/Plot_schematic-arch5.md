# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- To create different plant communities on bare chalk using seeds and plug plants and test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates.
- To compare observed ecosystem responses to the characteristics of the plant groups (functional effects traits) across the experiment duration (March 2013 to September 2016).

## Experimental design and plant groups
- Plants were organized into three functional effect trait groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) based on root structure, leaf traits, and anticipated effects on carbon storage and soil processes.
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes a mix of annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon/nitrogen impact.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity.
- Examples by group (selected species):
  - FG1: Achillea millefolium, Agrimonia eupatoria, Dactylis glomerata, Daucus carota, Sanguisorba minor, etc.
  - FG2: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, Trifolium pratense, Ranunculus species, etc.
  - FG3: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., and other diverse species.
- A grid approach was used to create all non-empty combinations of the three groups (7 combinations in total):
  - Single groups: FG1, FG2, FG3
  - Pairs: FG1&FG2, FG1&FG3, FG2&FG3
  - All three: FG1&FG2&FG3

## Plot layout, replication, and treatments
- Plot grid: 7 combinations across the top, 6 rows down, resulting in 42 plots in total.
- Plot size and spacing: each plot 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots.
- Replication: each combination replicated six times across the grid.
- Plot labeling and arrangement: plots arranged along the slope with designated positions (top of slope to bottom), ensuring each combination appears in multiple rows for replication.
- Drought treatment: from 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to simulate drought conditions. Shelters were in place from early June to mid-July, representing an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

## Data and measurements (scope)
- Primary outcomes focused on carbon storage, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health, assessed via measures of carbon and nitrogen cycling rates.
- Data collection linked to plot identity, FG combination, and replication, with drought treatment status recorded for applicable years.

## Timeline
- Field experiment conducted from March 2013 to September 2016.
- Drought-simulation using rain shelters introduced in 2015.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- Organization by plot, FG combination, replication, and year/drought status to support discoverability and reuse.
- Documentation should capture species composition per FG, the exact FG combinations assigned to each plot, plot coordinates or identifiers, and the timing/duration of drought treatments.
- Metadata should include experimental design details (full factorial non-empty combinations, replication scheme), measurement protocols for carbon and nitrogen cycling, and data versioning to support reproducibility and data sharing.
