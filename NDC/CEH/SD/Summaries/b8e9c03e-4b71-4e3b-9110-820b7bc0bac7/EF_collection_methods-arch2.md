# Soil sampling

- Purpose: Collect and process soil samples to generate standardized measurements of soil properties for environmental monitoring.

## Sampling and sample handling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width auger, to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Soil sieved with 2 mm aperture to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density measured from two cores per site.
- Cores divided into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Samples dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving.
- Bulk density calculated as mass divided by volume.

## pH
- Measured by mixing 5 g fresh soil with an equal volume of Milli-Q water (1:1) and reading with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 ± 0.001 g fresh soil per sample dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- Post-drying weight used to calculate moisture content as a proportion of wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtered.
- Filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) via autoanalyser.
- Moisture-adjustment: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume) × dilution factor) ÷ dry soil weight.
- Mineralisation: another 5 g soil incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation expressed as (NO3− + NH4+) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹).

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g fresh soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator to lyse microbes (24 h).
- A second unfumigated 5 g sample used for comparison.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken, filtered, and analysed by autoanalyser at dilutions of 4:1 (fumigated) and 2:1 (unfumigated) for DIN and PO4.
- Dissolved carbon analysed by TOC-L at the same dilutions.
- Data adjusted for water content; extraction efficiency applied using KE_C (0.35) or KE_EN (0.54) factors.

## Particle size
- Particle-size distribution determined by sieving through >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm fractions.
