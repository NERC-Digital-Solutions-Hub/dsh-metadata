# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Aim
- To create different plant communities on bare chalk using seeds and plug plants.
- To test how these communities affect carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and overall ecosystem health, by comparing outcomes across plant groups defined by functional effects traits.
- Timeframe: March 2013 to September 2016.

## Experimental design and plant functional groups
- Plants were categorized into three functional groups (FG) based on traits that influence their surrounding environment:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots with simple root structure and large leaves (long-lived and including some annuals/biennials).
    - Predicted outcome: substantial soil carbon storage due to deep rooting.
    - Example species included: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots (less below-ground carbon contribution observed).
    - Predicted outcome: limited carbon and nitrogen cycling impact due to small plant presence.
    - Example species included: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves (long-lived; rapid turnover).
    - Predicted outcome: fast carbon and nitrogen cycling, high microbial activity; potential reduced carbon storage as carbon is rapidly processed.
    - Example species included: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
- An extensive inventory of plant species was assigned to each FG group.

## Plot layout and replication
- A field grid was created: 7 plots across and 6 plots down, totaling 42 plots.
- Each 8m x 8m plot had a 2m gap between plots.
- Each plot represented a unique combination of the three FG groups, ensuring all combinations were included.
- The layout was replicated six times to support statistical analysis.
- Plot labeling and placement were described in relation to slope position (top of slope, middle, bottom), with explicit plot numbering and FG composition per plot.

## Treatments and timeline
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to study drought effects.
- Drought treatment details: shelters were deployed from the beginning of June and remained until mid-July each year, simulating an extreme (once in 100 years) drought scenario.

## Data collection and outcomes
- Primary data collected were intended to capture:
  - Carbon storage in soil and patterns of carbon cycling.
  - Nitrogen cycling rates and broader soil fertility indicators.
  - Ecosystem health metrics influenced by plant functional groups.
- The comparative analysis aimed to link observed carbon and nutrient dynamics to the functional characteristics of the plant communities.
- The drought treatment was designed to reveal how drought stress interacts with plant functional group composition to affect carbon and nutrient processes.

## Data management considerations (relevant to Data Leaders)
- Data assets implied by the study:
  - A 42-plot field dataset detailing FG compositions, plot locations, and slope position.
  - Time-series measurements of carbon storage and nutrient cycling collected over the 2013–2016 period.
  - Species inventories categorized by FG for each plot.
  - Drought treatment metadata (presence/absence of rain shelters, timing of exposure).
- Key data management needs:
  - Clear metadata schema for plots (plot ID, FG composition, coordinates, slope position, replication number, treatment status and timing).
  - Standardized definitions for carbon storage metrics and nutrient cycling measurements.
  - Consistent taxonomy for plant species to maintain alignment with FG assignments.
  - Robust documentation of the drought treatment period and shelter configurations.
- Considerations for data quality and accessibility:
  - Ensure complete capture of all FG combinations across the grid with precise plot labeling.
  - Maintain traceability across time points to analyze temporal trends (2013–2016) and drought years (2015+).
  - Prepare for integration of multi-source data (plant inventory, soil chemistry, carbon/nitrogen fluxes) and potential data gaps or inconsistencies in the historical record.
