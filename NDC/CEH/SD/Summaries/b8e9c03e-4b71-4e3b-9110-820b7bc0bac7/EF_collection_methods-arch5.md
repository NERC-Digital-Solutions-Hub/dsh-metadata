# Soil sampling

- Six soil samples were taken per site using a 4 cm width augur, to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Samples were sieved to remove stones/roots (2 mm aperture) and stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Measurements and methods

- Bulk density
  - From two cores per site at depths 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm.
  - Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

- pH
  - 5 g fresh soil mixed with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio.
  - pH measured with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

- Volumetric moisture content
  - 5 ± 0.001 g fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
  - Post-drying weight recorded; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g fresh soil shaken with 25 ml of 1 M KCl at 150 rpm for 1 hour.
  - Solution filtered (Whatman No. 1); filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) via autoanalyser.
  - A second 5 g sample incubated with extraction and analysis as above for 14 days at 25 °C to assess mineralisation.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² d⁻¹).
  - DIN values are adjusted for soil moisture using a specified calculation.

- Microbial biomass
  - 5 g fresh soil subjected to chloroform fumigation in a desiccator for 24 hours to lyse cells; a parallel unfumigated sample is prepared for comparison.
  - Post-fumigation, nutrients extracted with 25 ml of 0.5 M K₂SO₄; shaken at 150 rpm for 30 minutes; filtered.
  - Solutions analysed at 4:1 dilution for fumigated and 2:1 for unfumigated; measured DIN and PO₄.
  - Dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L at the same dilutions.
  - Values adjusted for water content; extraction efficiency corrected using KE constants (KEc = 0.35; KEN = 0.54).

- Particle size
  - Particle size distribution determined by sequential sieving: >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.

## Data handling, provenance, and metadata

- Documentation of sample identifiers, site information, and collection dates to ensure traceability.
- Recording of processing steps, instrument models, and calibration details (e.g., pH meter model, autoanalyser).
- Clear units and calculation methods retained (e.g., bulk density, DIN adjustments for soil moisture, mineralisation formulae, KE correction factors).
- Storage condition (5 °C) maintained until processing to preserve sample integrity.
- Explicit recording of any incubation times, temperatures, and dilution schemes used in analyses.

## Calculations and normalization

- Bulk density: mass/volume for each core pair.
- DIN correction for soil moisture using the specified moisture-based formula.
- Mineralisation: (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ days.
- Microbial biomass adjustments include fumigated vs unfumigated comparisons and KE corrections.
- Dissolved carbon quantified with TOC-L and adjusted for moisture where applicable.

## Data stewardship considerations

- Ensure consistency across sites by following identical sampling, storage, and analytical protocols.
- Capture comprehensive metadata (dates, locations, sample IDs, depths, instrument details, QA steps) to enable reproducibility and discovery.
- Document any data limitations or deviations from standard procedures (e.g., transport delays, equipment calibration intervals).
