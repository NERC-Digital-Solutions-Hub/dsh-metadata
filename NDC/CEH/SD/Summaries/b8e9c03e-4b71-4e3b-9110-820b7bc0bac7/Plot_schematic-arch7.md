# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Overview
- A field study (March 2013 – September 2016) to create different plant communities on bare chalk and measure resulting carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Uses plant functional groups to predict distinct ecosystem effects and compare outcomes across treatments.

## Experimental design and plant groups
- Plant communities built from seeds and plug plants organized into three functional groups (FG) based on root structure and expected ecological effects:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; long-lived; high potential for soil carbon storage.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited impact on soil carbon and nitrogen cycling.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots; fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for rapid turnover.
- Each FG group is represented by multiple species (examples provided for each group).

## Plot layout and replication
- Layout: a grid of plots 7 across by 6 down, totaling 42 plots.
- Each plot measures 8 m × 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
- Treatments: every possible combination of FG1, FG2, and FG3 is included within the grid, with six replicates across the layout.
- Plot labeling indicates position along the slope and the FG combination(s) present (including single FG and mixed FG plots such as FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3).

## Rain shelters and drought treatment
- From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to plots to investigate drought effects.
- Shelters were deployed from the beginning of June to mid-July each year, simulating an extreme drought (approximately once in 100 years).

## Species lists and data considerations
- A detailed enumeration of species by functional group is provided, illustrating representative examples within FG1, FG2, and FG3.
- For GIS and data purposes, the study provides:
  - Spatial layout (plot coordinates and arrangement on a slope)
  - FG composition per plot (and combinations)
  - Temporal elements (2013–2016 fieldwork, drought treatment from 2015)
  - Species-level information linked to functional groups and plot treatments

## Timeline and purpose
- Initiation and data collection spanned 2013–2016.
- Primary aim: compare carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health across plant functional groups and their combinations, under both ambient and drought conditions.
