# Modelled average percentage yield loss due to ozone damage for four global staple crops (20102012)

## Overview
- Quantifies average yield loss due to ozone for four global staples (maize, rice, soybean, wheat) during 2010–2012.
- Outputs are four GIS shapefiles (one per crop) on a 1° by 1° global grid, with yield loss expressed as a percentage.
- Method combines a global ozone dose mechanism (POD3IAM) with crop-specific sensitivity to convert ozone exposure into yield loss.

## Data collection and inputs
- Global grid: 1° by 1° cells; only grid cells with more than 500 tonnes of crop production included in maps.
- Production data: FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset (production data at 0.0833° resolution; year 2000), separated into irrigated and non-irrigated production.
- Climate and geography: Each cell classified by hemisphere (Northern/Southern) and climate zone using the ES­DAC GIS climate zone layer (JRC).
- Growing periods: For each hemisphere/climate zone combination, a 90-day growing period defined per crop using USDA/FAO-derived seasonal windows (Table S1).
- Crop-specific inputs: 1° grid cells assigned irrigated vs non-irrigated status; for wheat, POD3IAM values generated by the EMEP MSC-W model; for other crops, ozone exposure data derived from M7-based response functions.

## Modelling methodology
- Ozone dose metric: Daily ozone flux (POD3IAM) from the EMEP MSC-W chemical transport model (v4.16) for the 2010–2012 period; outputs include irrigated and rain-limited (non-irrigated) POD3IAM values.
- Baseline and dose-response: Subtract a reference POD3IAM of 0.1 mmol/m2 (pre-industrial/neutral ozone level) and apply a slope of 0.64 to obtain percent yield loss:
  - Percent Yield Loss = (POD3IAM − 0.1) × 0.64
- Cross-crop scaling: Since crop-specific flux–yield relationships are available mainly for wheat, compute wheat-based yield loss from POD3IAM, then scale to maize, rice, and soybean by a relative sensitivity factor:
  - Relative sensitivity = slope of the crop’s M7 (7-hour mean ozone) response function divided by the wheat slope.
  - Final yield loss per crop per cell = wheat-based loss × relative sensitivity.
- Outputs: For each grid cell, compute and assign the final estimated percentage yield loss per crop and save as GIS shapefiles.

## Outputs and data formats
- Four yield-loss GIS shapefiles (one per crop: maize, rice, soybean, wheat).
- Each shapefile consists of 1° by 1° grid cells with five attribute fields:
  - ID: Unique grid cell identifier
  - Zone: Climate zone for the cell
  - Long_Lat: Center coordinates of the cell
  - Hemisphere: Northern, Southern, or Far South (where applicable)
  - Yield loss: Average percentage yield loss due to ozone for 2010–2012

## Quality assurance and limitations
- Validation and performance:
  - Model validation against Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) ozone observations shows good spatial-temporal representation; modelled vs observed daily maximum ozone (Dmax) and M7 (90-day 7-hour mean) show r2 values between 0.88 and 0.93 with limited scatter.
  - AET/PET proxy comparison for growing-season stomatal conductance yields a strong correlation (r2 = 0.63) with model estimates of ozone uptake.
- Caveats and uncertainties:
  - No crop-specific flux–response data for maize, rice, and soybean; dependence on wheat-based flux relationships introduces uncertainty.
  - Maize yield-loss estimates are more uncertain due to limited crop-variety data (only three older varieties available for M7-based scaling).
  - Only the most important growing period per climate was used; regions with multiple growing seasons (e.g., India) are represented by a single period.
  - Differences in ozone uptake due to environmental conditions are partially captured by using M7 as a basis, but species-specific flux differences remain a potential source of error.
- Data interpretation: Results are designed for broad, standardized monitoring of ozone impacts on staple crops; users should account for noted uncertainties when applying the data to policy or risk assessments.
