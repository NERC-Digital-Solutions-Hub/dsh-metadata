# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose and scope
  - Documentation of soil cores dated with radiocarbon from permafrost in subarctic Canada.
  - Data include site codes, sampling details, and radiocarbon results intended for map-based data products.

- Site codes and their meanings
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt: An unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB - FireFox Burnt: A black spruce forest burnt in 1998
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: A peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW - Teslin Wetland: A thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: An unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: A burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau: A peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM - White Truck Moss: A recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge: A recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland: A potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau)

- Sampling and sample description
  - Sample depth chosen based on criteria described in the column 'Explanation'.
  - Bulk soil sample collected from the identified depth.
  - Plant macrofossils identified (when possible) using microscopy and selected for analysis (column 'Description_of_sample').

- Laboratory analysis and data handling
  - Samples were sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride, UK for analysis.
  - Each sample was assigned a publication code (column 'Publication_code') after analysis.

- Radiocarbon measurements and dating conventions
  - Radiocarbon enrichment values expressed as percent modern carbon.
  - Ages reported as conventional radiocarbon age in years BP (before present; present = AD 1950).

- Data use for GIS and mapping
  - Provides site-level radiocarbon ages and sample descriptions that can be mapped to illustrate spatial patterns of soil aging and permafrost dynamics in subarctic Canada.
  - Useful for linking vegetation type, peatland status, and permafrost features to radiocarbon ages.

- References and provenance
  - Analysis conducted at the NERC Radiocarbon Facility, East Kilbride, UK.
  - Publication codes associated with results facilitate data traceability and integration into GIS datasets.
