# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Report of soil core samples dated with radiocarbon from permafrost regions of subarctic Canada.
- Outputs include radiocarbon enrichment values (percent modern carbon) and conventional radiocarbon ages in years BP (present = AD 1950).

## Sites and sampling approach
- Site codes and brief descriptions:
  - FFU — FireFox Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB — FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
  - TPP — Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW — Teslin Wetland: thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU — Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB — Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP — White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM — White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss
  - WTS — White Truck Sedge: recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
  - WTW — White Truck Wetland: potentially older thawed peatland/collapse feature
- Sampling depth chosen based on criteria described in the Explanation column.
- Bulk samples collected; plant macrofossils identified (Description_of_sample) when possible using microscopy and selected for analysis.

## Laboratory analysis and outputs
- Samples analyzed at the NERC Radiocarbon Facility, East Kilbride (UK).
- Analysis results linked to a Publication_code (provided in the Publication_code column).
- Radiocarbon enrichment expressed as percent modern carbon.
- Ages reported as conventional radiocarbon age in years BP.

## Data structure and provenance
- Key data columns referenced: Explanation (depth criteria), Description_of_sample (plant macrofossil identification), Publication_code (lab/publication identifier).
- All samples are associated with site codes and processed through a single radiocarbon facility, ensuring standardized analysis and traceable provenance.

## Data quality and governance considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Metadata sufficiency: depth criteria, sample description, and publication code are essential for traceability.
- Data interoperability: consistent units (percent modern carbon; years BP) and uniform age definitions (BP) needed for integration with other environmental datasets.
- Data accessibility: public sharing of underlying data may be constrained by publication codes; consider clear data sharing policies and metadata to enable reuse.
- Data processing transparency: documentation of sample selection, laboratory methods, and any transformations to prepare data for dissemination.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides historical radiocarbon baselines for permafrost soil profiles, aiding interpretation of thaw events and carbon release potential.
- Site-specific contexts (burnt vs. unburnt, peatland vs. forest) enable comparative monitoring of permafrost carbon dynamics across environmental settings.

## Recommendations for monitoring framework authors
- Capture complete metadata for each sample (Explanation, Description_of_sample, Publication_code) to support reproducibility.
- Ensure consistent units (percent modern carbon; BP ages) and explicit age definitions across datasets.
- Clarify data access and sharing rights associated with Publication_code to facilitate open use while preserving provenance.
- Document sampling strategies and depth criteria to enable cross-site comparability.
- Integrate radiocarbon data with other environmental indicators (e.g., thaw depth, temperature) to strengthen monitoring insights.
