# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Document reports radiocarbon dating results from soil cores in permafrost regions of subarctic Canada.
- Each dated site is identified by a site code (e.g., FFU, FFB, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW).
- Depth selection for sampling followed predefined criteria; bulk soil samples were taken and, when possible, plant macrofossils were identified for analysis.

## Site codes and descriptions
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest.
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998.
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin.
- TW - Teslin Wetland: thawed peatland plateau.
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest.
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest.
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife.
- WTM - White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau with moss.
- WTS - White Truck Sedge: recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss.
- WTW - White Truck Wetland: potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau).

## Sampling and analysis workflow
- Depths were selected per criteria described in the dataset’s "Explanation" column.
- Bulk samples were collected from the identified depth; plant macrofossils were, when possible, identified using a microscope and selected for analysis (as per "Description_of_sample").
- Samples were sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride, UK for analysis.
- Each sample was assigned a publication code (in the "Publication_code" column).

## Data fields and measurement details
- Radiocarbon enrichment values expressed as percent modern carbon.
- Ages reported as conventional radiocarbon ages in years BP (before present; present defined as AD 1950).
- Key metadata include: site code, site description, depth criteria (Explanation), description of the sample (Description_of_sample), publication code (Publication_code).

## Data provenance and publication
- Source analysis conducted at the NERC Radiocarbon Facility (East Kilbride, UK).
- Publication codes link each dated sample to its published record or dataset entry.

## Data quality and considerations for use
- Data include both burnt and unburnt forest sites and various peatland plateau environments, offering a diverse context for permafrost studies.
- Consistency depends on clear depth criteria, accurate macrofossil identification when possible, and standardized reporting of radiocarbon results (percent modern carbon and BP ages).
- Users should note the definitional reference for "present" (AD 1950) when interpreting BP ages.

## Relevance to data strategy and practice
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field sampling, laboratory analysis, and publication tagging.
- Highlights the importance of metadata (depth criteria, sample description, publication code) for discoverability and reuse.
- Supports cross-site comparisons in subarctic permafrost studies and can inform data governance around radiocarbon dating records and associated metadata.
