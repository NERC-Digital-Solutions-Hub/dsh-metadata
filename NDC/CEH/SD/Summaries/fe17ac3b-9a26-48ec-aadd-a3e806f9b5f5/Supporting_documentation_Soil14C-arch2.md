# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Radiocarbon dating of soil core samples from permafrost in subarctic Canada to establish age contexts of soil profiles.
- Site codes for dated samples: FFU, FFB, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW.
- Radiocarbon enrichment values expressed as percent modern carbon; conventional radiocarbon ages reported in years BP (present defined as AD 1950).
- Analyses conducted at the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride (UK); outputs linked to publication codes.

## Data and site details
- FFU — FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest.
- FFB — FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998.
- TPP — Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin.
- TW — Teslin Wetland: thawed peatland plateau.
- MCU — Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest.
- MCB — Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest.
- WTP — White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife.
- WTM — White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau with moss.
- WTS — White Truck Sedge: recently thawed plateau with sedge and moss.
- WTW — White Truck Wetland: potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau).

## Methods and workflow
- Sample depth chosen based on criteria in the column 'Explanation'; bulk soil sample collected at identified depth.
- Plant macrofossils identified (when possible) using microscopy and selected for analysis (column 'Description_of_sample').
- Samples sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility for analysis; results assigned a publication code (column 'Publication_code').

## Outputs and data handling
- Radiocarbon enrichment values (percent modern carbon) and conventional radiocarbon ages (years BP) reported for each date.
- Data organized with standardized fields (e.g., Explanation, Description_of_sample, Publication_code) to support consistent reporting and downstream use.

## Quality, provenance, and sharing
- Data derived from established radiocarbon dating processes with quality assurance through a centralized facility.
- Outputs are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals, enhancing accessibility of underlying data for monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized chronology of soil carbon in permafrost regions, aiding interpretation of permafrost thaw, peatland dynamics, and environmental health trends over time.
- Facilitates cross-site comparisons and integration with broader environmental datasets for monitoring and policy performance.
