# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- The study dates soils in permafrost regions of subarctic Canada using radiocarbon analysis.
- Sites are coded and described, including burnt vs unburnt conditions and various peatland and forest landscapes.

## Sites and sample types

- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: a black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: a peatland plateau near Teslin
- TW - Teslin Wetland: a thawed peatland plateau
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: a burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: a peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- WTM - White Truck Moss: a recently thawed peatland plateau dominated by moss
- WTS - White Truck Sedge: a recently thawed peatland plateau with sedge and moss
- WTW - White Truck Wetland: a potentially older collapse feature (thawed peatland plateau)

## Sampling and preparation

- Sample depth for each core chosen according to criteria described in the column "Explanation."
- Bulk soil sample collected from the identified depth.
- Where possible, plant macrofossils recovered and identified via microscopy, then selected for radiocarbon analysis.

## Radiocarbon analysis and data handling

- All samples sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride (UK) for analysis.
- Radiocarbon enrichment values are expressed as percent modern carbon.
- Ages are reported as conventional radiocarbon ages with years BP (before present; present defined as AD 1950).
- Each analyzed sample is assigned a publication code (Publication_code) for reference.

## Data use and interpretation (for analysts)

- Enables comparison of radiocarbon ages across burnt vs unburnt sites and across forest, peatland, and thawed peatland landscapes.
- Supports understanding of permafrost thaw history and soil carbon dynamics in subarctic Canada.
- Provides a structured dataset linking depth, sample type, site interpretation, and radiocarbon results for modeling and reporting.
