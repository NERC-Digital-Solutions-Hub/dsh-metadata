# Soil dates using radiocarbon in profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- This document describes radiocarbon dating of soil cores from permafrost in subarctic Canada, listing the site codes and how samples were collected and analyzed.
- Site codes include: FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TW (Teslin Wetland), MCU (Mosquito Creek Unburnt), MCB (Mosquito Creek Burnt), WTP (White Truck Plateau), WTM (White Truck Moss), WTS (White Truck Sedge), WTW (White Truck Wetland).

- Data content and structure
  - For each core, sample depth was selected according to criteria described in the column 'Explanation'.
  - Bulk soil samples were collected from the identified depth; plant macrofossils were identified when possible (column 'Description_of_sample') using microscopy and selected for analysis.
  - Samples were sent to the NERC Radiocarbon Facility in East Kilbride (UK) and assigned a publication code (column 'Publication_code').
  - Radiocarbon enrichment values are given in percent modern carbon.
  - Ages are reported as conventional radiocarbon age with years BP (present = AD 1950).

- Data provenance and processing
  - Data originate from soil cores in subarctic permafrost regions.
  - Field collection includes depth-based sampling with macrofossil identification where feasible.
  - Laboratory analysis conducted at the NERC Radiocarbon Facility, resulting in publication codes for traceability.

- Measurements and formats
  - Radiocarbon enrichment: percent modern carbon.
  - Ages: conventional radiocarbon age, years BP.
  - Metadata fields include site code, sample depth (guided by Explanation), Description_of_sample (plant macrofossil details), and Publication_code.

- How to use and potential data products
  - Create a consolidated dataset linking site codes, sample depths, macrofossil presence, radiocarbon results, and publication codes.
  - Build visualizations and dashboards to compare ages across sites (FFU, FFB, TPP, TW, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW) and to identify spatial or vegetation-type patterns.
  - Develop data products for end users to explore radiocarbon ages by depth, sample type, and site.
  - Link results to publications using Publication_code for deeper interpretation.

- Limitations and considerations
  - Depth selection depends on the criteria in Explanation, which may lead to variability in representativeness across cores.
  - Plant macrofossil identification is contingent on sample preservation and may be incomplete.
  - Radiocarbon ages depend on laboratory methods and calibration used in the cited publication codes.

- How this supports data use
  - Facilitates cross-site data synthesis by providing standardized fields (site codes, sample description, depth criteria, radiocarbon values, and age in BP).
  - Enables creation of self-serve data products (tables, charts, and maps) to explore radiocarbon dating results in subarctic permafrost soils.
  - Supports data sharing and reproducibility through explicit provenance (Publication_code) and clear sample-processing workflow.
