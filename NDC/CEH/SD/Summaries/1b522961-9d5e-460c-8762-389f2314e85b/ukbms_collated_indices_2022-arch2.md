# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with gratitude to volunteers.
- It provides annual population-status data for butterflies from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program.
- Since 1976, UKBMS has monitored butterfly abundance across the UK, now with over 3,000 actively recorded sites each year.
- Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to produce standardized outputs used for biodiversity status and policy questions.
- The scheme relies on volunteers and a structured sampling framework to deliver consistent, policy-relevant data.

## Data collection and sampling framework

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, recording all butterflies in a fixed 5 m wide belt, weekly from April to September (up to 26 counts/year). Typically 45 minutes to 2 hours per walk; >2,000 sites monitored annually since 2022.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–3 visits/year (minimum two visits in July/August; spring visits encouraged); about 800 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: Single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, or other methods focused on specific species.
- Data from all methods are integrated for analysis.

## Data and analysis

- Outputs are abundance indices (relative, not absolute) derived from counts on transects/sites.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population; detectability varies by species.
- Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting that accounts for the proportion of the species’ flight period sampled each year at each site.
- The method uses seasonal counts to estimate the yearly pattern and extrapolate to account for recording gaps, giving more weight to observed data than extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic and manual validation checks detect data-entry errors, out-of-range records, and out-of-season records.
- Regional transect coordinators perform ongoing checks; data are further validated for distribution ranges, flight periods, first-time site records, and anomalies.
- Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders, with updates applied to the main UKBMS dataset.

## Data download details

- The data download provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2022.
- Data are delivered as a comma-separated value (.csv) file.
- Key columns include: SPECIES_CODE, SPECIES, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, N_SITES, COLLATED_INDEX (log10, scaled so the average equals 2), YEAR_RANK, TIME_PERIOD, COUNTRY, plus references for taxonomic checklists.

## Licence and attribution

- The dataset is provided under the Open Government Licence (OGL), permitting free use with few conditions.
- Citations and DOIs must be included in reports/publications that describe research using the data.
- Attribution statement: contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

## Collaboration and contact

- UKBMS Partners offer guidance on dataset details and interpretation; co-authorship and intellectual input for scientific outputs are welcome.
- Contacts: Marc Botham (ukbms@ceh.ac.uk) and Butterfly Conservation Transect Co-ordinator (transect@butterfly-conservation.org).

## Opportunities and challenges for data use

- Challenge: Increase the value of monitoring datasets by integrating UKBMS data with other relevant datasets (moving beyond single-use applications).
- Challenge: Improve accessibility of underlying data to users beyond the immediate outputs.
- The UKBMS addresses these by providing open access data under OGL, clear metadata, and active collaboration to support analysis, interpretation, and broader data linkage.
