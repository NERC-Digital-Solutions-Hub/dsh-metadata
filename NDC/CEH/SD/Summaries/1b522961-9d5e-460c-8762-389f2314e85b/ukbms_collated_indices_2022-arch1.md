# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-running, volunteer-based, site-based monitoring of butterfly populations in the UK.
  - Core partners: Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Since 1976, with over 3000 active sites annually, providing data to understand biodiversity status and inform policy.

- Data collection methods (sampling framework)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 5 m wide band; weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September; weather-conditional activity.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares; two parallel 1-km transects subdivided into 10 sections; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August; spring visits encouraged); ~800 squares sampled annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, single-species or alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on particular species.

- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative indices) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a consistent proportion of the population; some species are more detectable than others.
  - Collated indices produced with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) methodology (2016) plus weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
  - All seasonal counts are used to estimate patterns; gaps are extrapolated with greater weight given to observed data.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS data entry system or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies; regional transect coordinators review data throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks for: records outside known range, out-of-flight-period records, first-time site records, extreme or atypical abundances.
  - Data edits implemented after queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders.

- Data download: scope and format
  - Annual collated indices for species with sufficient data from 1976–2022 (latest year with sufficient data).
  - Delivered as a CSV file.
  - Key columns:
    - SPECIES_CODE, SPECIES, COMMON_NAME
    - YEAR, N_SITES
    - COLLATED_INDEX (log10; scaled so the species’ average index over the series equals 2)
    - YEAR_RANK, TIME_PERIOD, COUNTRY
  - Species taxonomy references noted in metadata.
