# The WATCH Forcing Data 1958-2001: a meteorological forcing dataset for land surface- and hydrological-models

- Purpose and scope
  - Sub-daily, diurnally resolved meteorological forcing dataset for land surface models (LSMs) and general hydrological models (GHMs) across the twentieth century.
  - Enables assessment of evaporation, soil moisture, and runoff by providing driving variables with diurnal relationships and cross-variable consistency.
  - Used for global and regional hydrological studies within the WATCH project; primary applicability to 1958–2001 with an extended pre-1958 period.

- Data content and resolution
  - Grid: half-degree latitude-longitude, land-only (CRU land-sea mask); Antarctica excluded.
  - Variables: wind speed at 10 m, temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, specific humidity at 2 m, downward longwave radiation, downward shortwave radiation, rainfall rate, snowfall rate.
  - Temporal resolution: 3-hourly for radiation-related variables; 6-hourly for other variables; full diurnal cycle preserved.
  - Format and access: NetCDF format using the ALMA convention; documentation and validation in accompanying reports (e.g., WATCH Technical Report 22).

- Time periods and construction approach
  - 1958–2001: Primary forcing dataset created from ERA-40 reanalysis with extensive bias corrections and adjustments.
  - 1901–1957: Data generated by re-ordering ERA-40 years to preserve diurnal-to-seasonal statistics and interannual behavior, ensuring spatial coherence of precipitation events.

- Corrections, bias corrections, and quality control
  - Temperature, pressure, humidity, and downward longwave radiation
    - Elevation corrections applied after grid interpolation; ERA-40 temperatures bias-corrected against CRU monthly means; CRU diurnal ranges used to adjust diurnal cycles.
    - Relative humidity inferred from corrected temperature, pressure and specific humidity; monthly checks with CRU vapor pressure data.
    - Downward longwave corrections largely indirect, with aerosol/cloud effects addressed via other variables.
  - Downward shortwave radiation
    - Monthly corrections for cloud cover changes and aerosol loading (HadGEM2-A-based Aerosol Optical Depths for 20th century); validation against independent data (e.g., FLUXNET).
  - Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall)
    - Six-step process: interpolation, rain/snow total combination, adjustment of wet-day counts to CRU, adjustment to GPCCv4 totals, reallocation to rain/snow using ERA-40 proportions, gauge-based catch corrections.
    - Wet-day corrections ensure spatial coherence of precipitation events; adjustments made carefully to avoid unrealistic daily changes where data are sparse.
  - Pre-1958 adjustments
    - Year-end discontinuities removed with ramping in January; rainfall/snowfall adjustments cautious to avoid spurious daily shifts.
    - Bias corrections similar in approach to 1958–2001 where feasible, with caveats due to sparse early observations.

- Estimation of reference evapotranspiration (PET)
  - PET_rc (reference-crop evapotranspiration)
    - Calculated with Penman–Monteith equation using rs = 70 s/m and ra = 208/u2 (u2 = 2 m wind speed).
    - Uses six of eight forcing variables; central role for net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, wind, and temperature.
    - PET_rc reported in W/m2 and converted to depth for model comparisons.
  - PET_PT
    - Priestley–Taylor formulation (radiation-based) as an alternative, particularly in humid regions; used to compare with PET_rc.
  - Implications
    - PET_rc and PET_PT can diverge substantially (often regionally), highlighting different evaporative controls (energy-limited vs. humidity-limited) and influencing model intercomparisons.

- Global and regional results; basin-level perspectives
  - Global and regional patterns
    - PET_rc trends show notable regional variability; some basins exhibit increases or decreases driven by shifts in radiation, VPD, wind, and temperature.
    - Precipitation trends are regionally variable; some basins experience moisture balance changes that interact with PET_rc.
  - Basin examples (illustrative values from the provided text)
    - Orange River Basin
      - PET_rc: 1901–1957 average ≈ 1586 mm/yr; 1958–2001 average ≈ 1604 mm/yr; 1979–2001 average ≈ 1623 mm/yr; positive slopes across periods.
      - PET_PT: 1901–1957 average ≈ 1115 mm/yr; 1958–2001 average ≈ 1123 mm/yr; 1979–2001 average ≈ 1131 mm/yr; increasing trend.
      - Net radiation: around 96–97 W/m2 across periods.
      - VPD: average around 1.45–1.49 kPa, with increases in later periods.
      - Wind: around 2.2 m/s; rainfall ~346–501 mm/yr depending on period; generally variable with modest increases in some periods.
    - Lena River Basin
      - PET_rc: 1901–1957 average ≈ 363 mm/yr; 1958–2001 average ≈ 367 mm/yr; 1979–2001 average ≈ 366 mm/yr; small overall increases then stability.
      - PET_PT: around 312–345 mm/yr across periods (1901–1957 ≈ 312.82; 1958–2001 ≈ 340–345).
      - Net radiation: ~29–88 W/m2 (varies by period and metric); VPD ~0.24–0.27 kPa; Wind ~1.7–2.0 m/s.
      - Rainfall: ~259–309 mm/yr (1958–2001; 1979–2001 ranges show increasing/decreasing patterns in sub-periods).
    - Murray-Darling River Basin
      - PET_rc and PET_PT values show substantial basin-scale patterns with 1901–1957, 1958–2001, and 1979–2001 comparisons indicating shifts in evaporative demand consistent with driver changes; precipitation typically around 300–450 mm/yr depending on period; snowfall minimal in this region.
    - Ganges-Brahmaputra River Basin
      - PET_rc: 1901–1957 average ≈ 889 mm/yr; 1958–2001 ≈ 870 mm/yr; 1979–2001 ≈ 844 mm/yr; PET_pt similarly high but slightly lower (≈ 798–767 mm/yr in later periods).
      - Rainfall: ≈ 1400–1430 mm/yr across periods; Net radiation around 65–79 W/m2; VPD ~0.95–1.0 kPa; Wind around 1.1–2.0 m/s depending on sub-period.
  - Validation and limitations
    - Validation with FluxNET demonstrates significant correlations for temperature, wind, longwave/shortwave radiation, and reasonable biases at monthly to daily scales.
    - Precipitation remains the most challenging variable to reproduce at short timescales; spatial coherence of events is maintained to support multi-grid hydrological modeling.
    - Limitations are greater pre-1958 due to sparse observations and ERA-40 biases affecting early-period PET_rc and VPD estimates.
    - Regional reliability varies with basin observational density and data quality.

- Practical considerations for data users (Data Support perspective)
  - Usability
    - Provides a bias-corrected, diurnally resolved forcing dataset suitable for driving LSMs/GHMs across the twentieth century.
    - The 1958–2001 period is the primary, well-validated period; 1901–1957 provides statistical continuity but is not intended to reproduce exact events.
  - Usage caveats
    - Treat pre-1958 results with caution for decadal variability and regional trends.
    - PET_rc vs PET_PT choices should align with climate regime and modeling needs; PET_PT may be better in humid regions; PET_rc offers a physically grounded reference for many models.
  - Data access and formats
    - NetCDF at half-degree resolution; comprehensive documentation available (e.g., WATCH Technical Reports; Appendix detailing ERA-40 basis-year ordering).
    - Users should consider grid-scale vs. tower-scale comparisons when validating local performance.

- Conclusions
  - The WATCH Forcing Data (WFD) 1958–2001 provides a robust, diurnally resolved meteorological forcing dataset for land-surface and hydrological modeling across the twentieth century, with careful bias corrections and event coherence across grid boxes.
  - The 1901–1957 extension preserves statistical properties but carries greater uncertainty for decadal interpretation due to data sparsity and ERA-40 biases.
  - PET_rc and PET_PT capture regionally variable evaporative controls, underscoring the importance of PET selection in model intercomparisons.
  - Validation against FluxNET supports reliable performance for many variables at daily to monthly scales, while acknowledging ongoing challenges for precipitation at short timescales.
