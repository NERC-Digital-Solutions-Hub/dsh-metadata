# Creation of the WATCHForcing Data and its use to assess global and regional reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century

## Overview
- Presents the WATCH Forcing Data (WFD), a bias-corrected, high-resolution meteorological forcing dataset designed to drive land surface and hydrological models across the 20th century.
- Provides diurnal- to sub-daily variability at half-degree resolution to study external drivers of evaporation globally and regionally.
- Compares two PET estimates—PET_rc (reference crop Penman–Monteith) and PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor)—to illustrate how PET formulation shapes evaporation assessments.

## WATCH Forcing Data and data sources
- WFD variables: wind speed at 10 m, temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, specific humidity at 2 m, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, rainfall, snowfall.
- Spatial/temporal resolution: 0.5° grid; three-hourly radiative/precipitation, six-hourly other variables; global land points excluding Antarctica.
- Basis data: ERA-40 (1958–2001); re-ordered ERA-40 data to construct 1901–1957 WFD to preserve historical sub-daily/seasonal characteristics.

## Data processing and corrections
- Interpolation and adjustments:
  - Bilinear interpolation from ERA-40 to the CRU land–sea mask; elevation corrections for temperature, surface pressure, humidity, and downward LW radiation.
  - Bias corrections using CRU observations (monthly) and CRU TS2.1 when needed.
  - Downward LW bias-correction applied indirectly; no global ERA-40 LW bias against NASA SRB; shortwave tilted for aerosol effects using HadGEM2-A data.
- Cloud and aerosol corrections:
  - Shortwave adjustments using CRU cloud cover and aerosol loads; aerosol/cloud effects modeled for clear and cloudy skies via HadGEM2-A data.
- Precipitation processing (six steps):
  - ERA-40 precipitation bilinear interpolation; combine rainfall and snowfall, adjust wet days to CRU counts, totals to GPCCv4, reassign rain/snow per ERA-40 ratios, apply gauge-catch corrections.
  - In tropics, reduce excessive wet days to CRU counts to preserve large-scale event coherence.
- Validation:
  - Fluxnet sites used for validation; temperature and radiation show good agreement; precipitation validation more challenging due to small-scale variability and model limitations.
  - Differences linked to elevation, land cover, and microclimate representation within grid boxes.

## Corrections to rainfall and snowfall
- Wet-day adjustments align ERA-40 precipitation with observations while preserving spatial coherence of events.
- Tropical regions corrected to CRU counts; extreme corrected rates capped in a few cases to avoid unrealistic peaks.
- Post-correction totals align with GPCCv4 and CRU; rain/snow partitions reflect ERA-40 proportions rather than simple temperature thresholds.

## Corrections and validation (flux tower comparison)
- Validation against Fluxnet shows strong correlations for temperature, downward longwave/shortwave radiation, and wind; some biases for wind and precipitation due to land-cover mismatches and scale.
- Precipitation correlations weaker at sub-daily scales; better agreement at daily/monthly scales.

## WATCH Forcing Data (1901–1957)
- To cover the full century, 1901–1957 data are generated by re-ordering ERA-40 year-by-year to preserve the diurnal–monthly statistics of 1958–2001.
- Limitations: event timing is not site-specific; sparse early-period station coverage may bias trends/variability for pre-1950s.
- Adjustments similar to 1958–2001 are applied where feasible to maintain inter-period consistency.

## Estimation of reference crop evaporation (PET_rc and PET_PT)
- PET_rc (Penman–Monteith with fixed reference crop):
  - Uses aerodynamic resistance, surface resistance, slope of saturation vapor pressure, psychrometric constant, and available energy.
  - Computed in W/m^2 and converted to depth of evaporated water.
- PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor):
  - Uses α ≈ 1.26 and Δ/(Δ+γ) with available energy approximated by net radiation for humid conditions.
- Key takeaway: PET_rc and PET_PT can differ substantially regionally, underscoring the need to justify PET choice for policy-relevant modeling.

## Global reference crop evaporation (1958–2001) and regional basins
- Global patterns:
  - PET_rc exhibits substantial interannual variability; global mean PET_rc trends are significantly negative for 1958–2001.
  - PET_rc shows no significant trend from 1901–1957.
  - PET_PT shows larger local differences from PET_rc, contributing to divergent model intercomparisons.
- Regional basins (examples):
  - Niger and Murray–Darling show notable regional PET_rc trends.
  - Congo and Amazon basins display regionally variable patterns; some areas show increasing VPD or shifts in net radiation/wind affecting PET_rc.
  - In humid regions, PET_rc tends to be lower than PET_PT in Amazon/Congo; in arid basins (e.g., Murray–Darling) PET_rc can exceed PET_PT due to moisture limitation.
- Precipitation:
  - Global land-mean precipitation shows no strong trend (1958–2001), but regional basins exhibit shifts that influence hydrology and water-resource planning.

## Global and regional precipitation (1901–2001 context)
- Pre-1958 data are less reliable due to sparse gauge coverage; post-1958 analyses are more robust but still exhibit regional differences.
- Overall, global precipitation changes are modest in the latter part of the century, with more pronounced regional shifts in key basins.

## Conclusions
- WATCH Forcing Data provides a robust, bias-corrected forcing dataset at 0.5° resolution for driving LSMs/GHMs through the 20th century.
- The 1958–2001 WFD is well-supported by observations and captures diurnal/sub-daily variability, enabling meaningful global and regional evaporation analyses.
- The 1901–1957 WFD is constructed to retain statistical characteristics but may not reflect site-specific historical events due to data limitations and the re-ordering approach.
- PET_rc and PET_PT yield substantially different estimates in parts of the globe, and global trends depend on the PET formulation and period examined.
- Precipitation shows no global trend over 1958–2001 but exhibits regional changes in major basins, with implications for hydrology and water-resource assessments.
- Acknowledges data limitations, including gaps in inland coverage during early decades, reanalysis biases (e.g., surface pressure, VPD), and the ongoing need for bias-correction improvements.

## Implications for monitoring framework authors
- Emphasize consistent, bias-corrected data streams with rich metadata to support policy evaluation and environmental health monitoring.
- Implement transparent data governance, explicit correction procedures, and clear documentation of uncertainties (e.g., reanalysis biases, station coverage) to aid reproducibility and stakeholder trust.
- Recognize that PET formulation choices can drive divergent model outcomes; document and justify the PET method selected for policy analysis.
- Prioritize validation against independent observations (e.g., flux towers, ground stations) and report spatially explicit performance metrics and limitations.
- Maintain openness about data availability, versioning, and potential biases due to historical data gaps when informing policy decisions.
