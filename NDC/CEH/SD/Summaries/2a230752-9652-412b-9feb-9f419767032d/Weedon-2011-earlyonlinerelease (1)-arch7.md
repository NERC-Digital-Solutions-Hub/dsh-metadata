# The WATCH Forcing Data 1958-2001: a meteorological forcing dataset for land surface- and hydrological-models

- Purpose and scope
  - Half-degree global grid of sub-daily meteorological forcing to drive land surface models (LSMs) and general hydrological models (GHMs) across the 20th century.
  - Based on ERA-40 reanalysis for 1958-2001; re-ordered ERA-40 data extended to 1901-1957 to preserve diurnal/seasonal statistics.
  - Variables: wind speed at 10 m, temperature at 2 m, surface pressure, specific humidity at 2 m, downward longwave and shortwave radiation, rainfall rate, snowfall rate.
  - Data stored in netCDF (ALMA convention) on CRU land-sea mask; global land points excluding Antarctica.

- Data structure and formats
  - Spatial resolution: 0.5° latitude–longitude grid; ~67,420 land grid points.
  - Temporal resolution: most variables at 3-hourly; some radiation variables interpolated from native time steps; some data stored at 6-hourly for efficiency with 3-hourly interpolation as needed.
  - Format: netCDF (ALMA convention) with CRU land-sea mask.

- Temporal coverage and data processing
  - Primary dataset: WATCH Forcing Data 1958-2001 (WFD 1958-2001).
  - Supplemental dataset: WATCH Forcing Data 1901-1957 (WFD 1901-1957) created by randomized ERA-40 years to preserve statistics; bias corrections limited for some variables.
  - Basis-year sequencing (ERA-40) documented in Appendix; order used to generate pre-1958 data.

- Forcing variables and corrections
  - Temperature and related variables
    - Elevation corrections after bilinear interpolation; bias-corrected ERA-40 temperatures using CRU observations; diurnal temperature range adjustments; ensured consistency with pressure and humidity to avoid supersaturation.
  - Shortwave and longwave radiation
    - Downward longwave: bias-corrected against satellite products; aerosol corrections (tropospheric and stratospheric) included; cloud-influenced components represented.
    - Downward shortwave: corrected for cloud cover and aerosol loading; includes aerosol and cloud-derived effects on both clear and cloudy skies.
  - Precipitation (rainfall and snowfall)
    - Six-step procedure: ERA-40 rainfall/snowfall interpolation; merge with ERA-40 ratios; adjust wet-day counts to CRU TS2.1; reassign rain/snow using ERA-40 diagnosed ratio; gauge-catch corrections applied.
    - Wet-day corrections emphasize preserving spatial coherence of significant precipitation events; tropical regions often require careful handling; some outliers capped to maintain physical realism.
  - Pre-1958 adjustments
    - For 1901-1957, data generated by randomized ERA-40 years; limitations acknowledged due to sparse observations and partial bias corrections.

- PET and evapotranspiration metrics
  - PETrc (reference crop evapotranspiration) computed with Penman–Monteith using fixed canopy resistances.
  - PETPT (Priestley-Taylor) computed for comparison.
  - Global and regional patterns examined to assess potential evapotranspiration changes over the century; PETrc shows global decreasing tendency with strong regional variability; PETPT can diverge from PETrc in some regions.

- Global and regional findings (highlights)
  - Global (1958-2001)
    - PETrc declines modestly on average; increases in vapor pressure deficit (VPD) and decreases in net radiation and wind speed; 2 m air temperature rises.
    - No universal global trend in PETrc over 1979-2001 due to counteracting factors.
  - Regional basins (selected examples)
    - Amazon and Congo basins: limited or no robust PETrc trend 1958-2001; rainfall dynamics dominate hydrological responses.
    - Niger basin: notable wind-speed trend with PETrc variability tied to arid-season dynamics.
    - Murray–Darling basin: notable PETrc decrease 1958-2001, linked to decreases in VPD and aridity shifts.
  - Precipitation trends
    - Global precipitation shows no significant change 1958-2001; regional variability present (some basins drier, others wetter).

- Validation and data quality
  - Validation against FLUXNET sites shows reasonable agreement for temperature and radiation and good diurnal/seasonal behavior at daily to monthly scales.
  - Precipitation validation is more challenging due to convective rainfall representation and scale differences between towers and 0.5° grids; wind, humidity, and some radiation components show mixed performance across sites.

- GIS usage and considerations
  - Designed for GIS-based hydrological and land-surface modeling workflows.
  - Key considerations:
    - Spatial resolution: 0.5° grid; suitable for global analyses, coarser than point measurements.
    - Temporal resolution: sub-daily forcing (3-hourly) for most variables; some variables at 6-hourly with 3-hourly interpolation as needed.
    - Bias-correction history: robust corrections for temperature, radiation, and precipitation; pre-1958 data carry higher uncertainty.
    - Forcing variables: 8 core meteorological fields; aerosols and clouds embedded in radiation terms; precipitation corrected for wet days and rain/snow partitioned.
  - Forcing data are inputs for models, not forecasts; appropriate for historical hydrological and land-surface analyses, climate trend studies, and long-term simulations.
  
- Accessibility and references
  - Distributed under the EU WATCH program; technical details and access via WATCH Technical Report 22.
  - Methodology and data documentation in Weedon et al. (2010) and related ERA-40, CRU, GPCC, SRB, HadGEM2-AOD, and FluxNet validation literature.

- Caveats and uncertainties
  - 1901-1957 data rely on randomized ERA-40 years with partial bias correction; results emphasize statistical properties rather than site-specific events.
  - Tropical and high-latitude precipitation remains challenging; corrections reduce biases but do not eliminate uncertainties.
  - Regional trends may be offset by global-scale compensations; interpret within hydrological regimes and model feedbacks.

- Appendix and basin-level context
  - Appendix tables present basin-specific trends for PETrc, PETPT, Net Rad, VPD, Wind, Rainfall, Snowfall, and Precipitation across intervals (1901-1957, 1958-2001, 1979-2001) with averages, slopes, uncertainties, and significance indicators, including basins such as Orange River, Murray-Darling, Lena, Ganges-Brahmaputra, and Lena, among others.
  - Appendix also documents the ERA-40 basis-year ordering used to construct the pre-1958 data.
