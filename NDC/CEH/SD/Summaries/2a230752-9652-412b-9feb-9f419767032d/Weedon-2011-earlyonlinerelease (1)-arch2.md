# Creation of the WATCH Forcing Data and its use to assess global and regional = reference crop evaporation over land during the twentieth century.

## Overview
- Presents long-term, bias-corrected meteorological forcing data (WATCH Forcing Data, WFD) for land surfaces to drive climate, hydrology, and evapotranspiration analyses across the 20th century.
- Includes standardized variables at half-degree resolution with 3-hourly radiation-related data and 6-hourly/ daily for other fields; designed to support consistent PET_rc and PET_PT calculations and model benchmarking.
- Data are organized into time slices (1901–1957, 1958–2001, and sub-periods like 1979–2001) and across major basins to enable regional monitoring of environmental drivers (radiation, temperature, humidity, wind, rainfall, snowfall) and their effects on evapotranspiration and hydrology.
- Key outputs include PET_rc (Penman–Monteith reference evapotranspiration) and PET_PT (Priestley–Taylor PET) estimates, along with ancillary variables (net radiation, VPD, wind, rainfall, snowfall).

## Data quality and monitoring use
- WATCH data are designed for transparency and reproducibility to enable monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Methodological steps (bias corrections, aerosol and cloud adjustments, wet-day corrections) are documented; caveats include early-century data sparsity and potential timing limitations for pre-1950 events.
- The data are intended to be stored, accessible, and reusable by modelers and decision-makers, supporting benchmarking, regional analyses, and basin-scale monitoring.

## Implications for monitoring and model use
- PET_rc vs PET_PT: Differences can be large (sometimes >1000 mm/yr locally), affecting water-balance interpretations and climate-change impact assessments. Choice of PET metric should reflect climate regime and model requirements.
- Long-term trends are basin- and period-dependent; global signals may be masked by regional variability and data limitations (especially 1901–1957 era in some basins).
- The framework enables examination of how external drivers (radiation, wind, temperature, humidity) have evolved and affected terrestrial water cycles, aiding water resource planning and policy evaluation.

## Appendix notes
- Appendix Table 1 documents the order of ERA-40 basis years used to construct the WATCH Forcing Data 1901–1957, including the cycling between ERA-40 and WFD years to preserve diurnal-to-seasonal structure and inter-variable relationships.
