# Climate hydrology and ecology research support system potential evapotranspiration dataset (1961-2012) [CHESS-PE]

- Purpose: Provides two daily potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates on a 1 km grid over Great Britain for 1961–2012, derived from CHESS-met meteorological variables and CEH-GEAR precipitation.
- Two PET variables:
  - PET: Penman-Monteith PET for a well-watered grass surface (mm/day).
  - PETI: PET with interception correction (mm/day); accounts for rainfall interception, canopy storage, and subsequent drying, combining interception and transpiration components.
- Data sources:
  - CHESS-met meteorological variables: air temperature (Ta), specific humidity (qa), downward longwave and shortwave radiation (Ld, Sd), surface air pressure (p*).
  - CEH-GEAR precipitation: used to scale rainfall input for PETI.
- Calculation basis:
  - PET (E_P): Penman-Monteith equation with surface characteristics for grass; assumes stomatal resistance of 70 s m−1; constants include latent heat of vaporization, psychrometric constant, air density, and specific heat capacity.
  - PETI (E_PI): same EP as PET plus rainfall interception dynamics; uses interception store S0 and total interception capacity Stot with an exponential dry-down formulation for interception.
- File format and structure:
  - NetCDF (CF-compliant) files following CEH gridded dataset conventions.
  - Monthly files for each variable; filenames chess_<var>_wwg_<year><month>.nc.
  - Variables: pet (PET) and peti (PETI); both cover the same time span and 1 km GB grid.
- Temporal and spatial coverage:
  - Time: 1961–2012.
  - Space: Great Britain on a 1 km grid.
- Usage guidance:
  - PET provides the atmospheric demand for evaporation; PETI is useful when modelling canopy interception effects after rainfall.
  - Suitable for hydrological and ecological modelling, climate impact studies, and water resource assessments.
