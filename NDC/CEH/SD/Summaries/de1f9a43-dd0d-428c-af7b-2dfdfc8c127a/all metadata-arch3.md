# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal across wild populations, experimental trials, and herbarium specimens.
- Represented 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
- In wild populations, individuals were spaced 100 metres apart; each population represented by 1–50 individuals depending on availability.
- Herbarium samples obtained with permission; sampling occurred from July 2007 to July 2009; each population sampled once.

# Collection / Generation / Transformation Methods

- Tissue samples: fresh leaf or stem dried on silica gel; herbarium leaves desiccated on silica gel.
- Geographic data: latitude, longitude, and altitude recorded for each population.
- Fieldwork team and herbarium access: quantities collected by named researchers; RBGE permission for herbarium specimens.

# Analytical Methods

- Target organelle: chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) maternally inherited and slowly evolving, suitable for historical gene flow and colonisation studies.
- cpDNA regions: trnH-psbA spacer (DraI-digested) and universal cpSSR primers ccmp5 and ccmp10 after preliminary screening.
- cpDNA haplotyping approaches:
  - trnH-psbA: PCR amplification and DraI digestion; RFLP-based haplotyping.
  - cpSSRs: two loci amplified and scored as haplotypes (36 cpSSR haplotypes across loci).
- PCR specifics: detailed reaction mixes and thermocycling protocols provided for reproducibility.

# Fieldwork and / or Laboratory Instrumentation

- Tissue processing: ~1 cm² dried tissue ground to powder using Retsch Tissuelyser.
- DNA extraction: QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kit; quality and concentration checked via 1% agarose gel.
- Storage: DNA stored at -20 °C.

# Nature and Units of Recorded Values

- DNA/amplification quality checked against 1 kb DNA ladder; 1 kb–700 bp standard used for sizing on Li-Cor imager.
- Data types:
  - cpSSR data: locus sizes (in base pairs) for ccmp5 and ccmp10, with haplotype designations; 36 haplotypes described.
  - RFLP data: trnH-psbA haplotypes described by restriction patterns (6 haplotypes).

# Format of Stored Data

- Data stored in Excel and submitted to EIDC as CSV files, in two datasets:
  - cpSSR DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv)
  - RFLP DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv)
- cpSSR file structure (8 columns): Sample number; Country of origin; Population/provenance; Latitude; Longitude; Locus1 (ccmp5); Locus2 (ccmp10); Haplotype number.
- RFLP file structure (6 columns): Sample number; Country of origin; Population/provenance; Latitude; Longitude; trnH-psbA haplotype.

# Quality Control

- Field samples sourced from well-documented origins.
- DNA ladder markers used to ensure accurate bp quantification.
- Band sizes and genotypes referenced against standard markers (IRD 800).
- Replication: samples run at least twice to verify PCR reproducibility.
