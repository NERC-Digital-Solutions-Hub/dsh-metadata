# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- Overview
  - 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal across wild populations, experimental trials, and herbarium specimens.
  - Represented 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
  - Sampling strategy: in wild populations, individuals separated by 100 meters; each population represented by at least one, up to 50 individuals; herbarium samples collected July 2007–July 2009; each population sampled once.
  - Permissions: RBGE for herbarium specimens; fieldwork conducted by named researchers.

- Sampling and Collection Details
  - Tissue types: fresh leaf or stem tissue dried on silica gel; herbarium leaves desiccated on silica gel.
  - Geographic data: latitude, longitude, and altitude recorded for each population.
  - Personnel: field collection by David Odee, Stephen Cavers, Julia Wilson, and Annika Telford; herbarium specimens collected by Alan Gray.

- Data Types and Markers
  - Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) markers:
    - cpDNA regions screened: trnH-psbA spacer (restricted with DraI) and universal cpSSR primer pairs ccmp5 and ccmp10.
    - cpSSR loci: two loci (ccmp5, ccmp10) used to define 36 haplotypes.
    - RFLP marker: trnH-psbA haplotypes (6 haplotypes) scored after restriction patterns.
  - Rationale: cpDNA is maternally inherited in angiosperms and evolves slowly, suitable for studying historical gene flow, colonization, and migration.

- Laboratory Methods (High-Level)
  - DNA extraction: QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kits; tissue ground with Retsch Tissuelyser; quality checked by 1% agarose gel.
  - PCR and analysis:
    - cpDNA: amplification of trnH-psbA region, digestion with DraI, and visualization of restriction patterns.
    - cpSSR: amplification of cpSSR loci; products quantified by fragment size; electrophoresis used to determine band sizes.
  - Quality control: included DNA ladder markers; all samples run with standards; replicates performed to ensure reproducibility.

- Data Processing and Formats
  - Data recorded as base pair (bp) fragment sizes; haplotypes assigned for cpSSR and RFLP markers.
  - Stored formats:
    - Excel spreadsheet files, submitted to EIDC as CSV.
    - Two CSV files:
      - Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv
      - Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv
  - Data schemas:
    - cpSSR file: 8 columns – Sample number, Country, Population, Latitude, Longitude, Locus1 (ccmp5), Locus2 (ccmp10), Haplotype number.
    - RFLP file: 6 columns – Sample number, Country, Population, Latitude, Longitude, Haplotype (trnH-psbA RFLP).

- Quality Control and Verification
  - Field samples sourced from well-documented sources; DNA ladder markers used for bp quantification.
  - Gel-based size determination referenced against standard size markers (IRD 800, 50–350 bp and 50–700 bp).
  - Reproducibility checked by running samples at least twice.

- Purpose and Applications for Data Support
  - Data enable assessment of genetic diversity and population structure across wide geographic ranges.
  - Facilitates historical inferences about colonization, migration, and gene flow in Acacia senegal.
  - Provides standardized, machine-readable datasets (CSV) for reuse in meta-analyses, policy-relevant studies, or cross-organisation data initiatives.
