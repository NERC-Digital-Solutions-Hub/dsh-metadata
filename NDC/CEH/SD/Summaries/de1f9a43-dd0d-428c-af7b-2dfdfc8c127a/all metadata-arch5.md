# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal across wild populations, experimental trials, and herbarium specimens.
- Represented 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
- In wild populations, individuals spaced ~100 metres apart; each population represented by 1–50 individuals.
- Herbarium specimens sourced with permission from RBGE; sampling occurred July 2007–July 2009; each population sampled once.

## Collection / Generation / Transformation Methods

- Fresh tissues (leaf or stem) dried on silica gel; herbarium leaves desiccated on silica gel.
- Geographic data recorded for each population (latitude, longitude, altitude).
- Field collection team: David Odee, Stephen Cavers, Julia Wilson, Annika Telford; herbarium samples collected by Alan Gray (RBGE permission).
  
## Analytical Methods

- cpDNA maternally inherited in angiosperms; slow evolution relative to nrDNA; suitable for historical gene flow, colonisation, migration analysis.
- Three chloroplast regions screened: trnH-psbA spacer (Dra I-digested) and two cpSSR loci (ccmp5, ccmp10); primer sets and PCR protocols described.
- PCR products digested and fragment patterns visualised; cpSSR loci amplified and scored for haplotypes.
- RFLP and cpSSR data used to define haplotypes: 6 haplotypes via RFLP; 36 haplotypes via cpSSR combinations.

## Fieldwork and / or Laboratory Instrumentation

- Tissue ground to fine powder (~1 cm² per sample) using Retsch Tissuelyser.
- DNA extraction with QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kits; quality assessed on 1% agarose gel; stored at -20 °C.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values

- DNA quality and amplification products assessed; products quantified in base pairs (bp).
- cpSSR data (ccmp5, ccmp10) reported as haplotype combinations; RFLP data reported as cpDNA haplotypes.
- All samples assigned sample numbers; geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) recorded; country/provenance noted.

## Format of Stored Data

- Data stored in Excel and submitted to EIDC as CSV files:
  - cpSSR DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv)
  - RFLP DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv)
- cpSSR file consists of 8 columns: Sample number, Country, Population/provenance, Latitude, Longitude, Locus1 (ccmp5), Locus2 (ccmp10), Haplotype number.
- RFLP file consists of 6 columns: Sample number, Country, Population/provenance, Latitude, Longitude, trnHpsbA haplotype.

## Quality Control

- Field samples sourced from documented sources; DNA ladder markers used to ensure accurate bp quantification.
- Genotypes and fragment sizes verified against standard IRD 800 molecular marker; PCR runs conducted in duplicates to confirm reproducibility.
