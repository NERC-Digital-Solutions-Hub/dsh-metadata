# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- Purpose: 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal to study historical patterns of gene flow, colonisation, and migration via chloroplast DNA.
- Geographic scope: 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
- Sampling in wild populations: individuals at least 100 metres apart; 1–50 individuals per population depending on availability; each population sampled once.
- Sample timing: July 2007 to July 2009.
- Sample types: fresh leaf or stem tissue (dried on silica gel); herbarium leaf material desiccated on silica gel.

## Collection / Generation / Transformation Methods

- Geographic data: latitude, longitude, and altitude recorded for each population.
- Field personnel: David Odee, Stephen Cavers, Julia Wilson, Annika Telford; herbarium samples collected by Alan Gray with RBGE permission.

## Analytical Methods

- Rationale: cpDNA is maternally inherited with slower evolution, suitable for historical gene flow and colonisation studies.
- Regions and markers:
  - cpDNA region: trnH-psbA spacer (Shaw et al., 2005), digested with DraI.
  - cpSSR loci: two loci, ccmp5 and ccmp10 (Weising and Gardner, 1999), amplified and analyzed to describe 36 haplotypes.
- PCR details (overview):
  - trnH-psbA: 25 μL reactions; specific mix and cycling protocol; amplicons digested with DraI and visualised as per Cavers et al. (2003).
  - cpSSR: 25 μL reactions; specific mix and cycling; products electrophoresed; band sizes determined to define haplotypes.
- Outcome: 6 haplotypes described for trnH-psbA (RFLP) and 36 cpSSR haplotypes.

## Fieldwork and / or Laboratory Instrumentation

- Tissue processing: ~1 cm² dried tissue ground to powder using Retsch Tissuelyser.
- DNA extraction: QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kits; quality/concentration checked on 1% agarose gel; stored at -20 °C.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values

- DNA quality and amplification products checked using 1 kb ladder; band sizes quantified in base pairs (bp).
- cpSSR data: 2 loci (ccmp5, ccmp10) yielding 36 haplotypes.
- trnH-psbA data: RFLP haplotypes described as 6 haplotypes.

## Format of Stored Data

- Data stored as Excel spreadsheets and submitted to EIDC in CSV format.
- Two files:
  - cpSSR DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv)
  - RFLP DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv)

- cpSSR CSV structure (8 columns):
  1. Sample number
  2. Country of origin
  3. Population or provenance
  4. Latitude
  5. Longitude
  6. Locus1 (ccmp5)
  7. Locus2 (ccmp10)
  8. Haplotype number

- RFLP CSV structure (6 columns):
  1. Sample number
  2. Country of origin
  3. Population or provenance
  4. Latitude
  5. Longitude
  6. trnH-psbA haplotype

## Quality Control

- Field samples sourced from well-documented origins.
- DNA ladder markers used for accurate bp quantification.
- Sequencing/scoring referenced against IRD 800 marker (50–350 bp and 50–700 bp).
- PCR amplification samples run at least twice to verify reproducibility.

## GIS Relevance and Potential Data Products

- Geolocated genetic data: 297 samples across 66 sites enable spatial mapping of cpDNA haplotypes and cpSSR diversity.
- Potential outputs:
  - maps of haplotype distributions and diversity hotspots.
  - phylogeographic patterns over sub-Saharan Africa, Arabian Peninsula, and parts of Asia.
  - integration with environmental layers to explore correlates of haplotype distribution.
- Data can support tracking historical gene flow, colonisation routes, and population structure for Acacia senegal.
