# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- Scope and sampling
  - 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal across wild populations, experimental trials, and herbarium specimens.
  - Represented 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
  - Wild populations: individuals at least 100 metres apart; 1–50 individuals per population depending on availability.
  - Herbarium specimens obtained with permission from RBGE; sampling conducted July 2007 – July 2009; each population sampled once.

- Collection and transformation methods
  - Fresh leaf or stem tissue dried on silica gel; herbarium leaf material desiccated on silica gel.
  - Geographic information recorded: latitude, longitude, altitude.
  - Field collection led by David Odee, Stephen Cavers, Julia Wilson, and Annika Telford; herbarium specimens collected by Alan Gray (RBGE).

- Molecular analyses overview
  - Chloroplast DNA (cpDNA) is maternally inherited in angiosperms; slow evolution, suitable for historical gene flow and colonisation studies.
  - Three chloroplast regions screened after preliminary subset: trnH-psbA spacer (DraI restricted) and two cpDNA SSR loci (ccmp5, ccmp10).
  - trnH-psbA amplified in 25 μL reactions; cpSSR loci amplified in 25 μL reactions; products digested or sized for haplotype assignment.

- PCR and genotyping details
  - trnH-psbA: reaction components include ~20 ng DNA, buffer, dNTPs, primers, Taq, BSA; PCR protocol: 94°C 3 min; 35 cycles (94°C 30 s, 45°C 30 s, 72°C 1 min); final extension 72°C 10 min; DraI digestion and visualisation per prior work.
  - cpSSR (ccmp5, ccmp10): components include ~20 ng DNA, buffer, dNTPs, primers, Taq, BSA; products electrophoresed and haplotypes assigned by fragment sizes.
  - Amplicons quantified as base pairs (bp); 36 cpSSR haplotypes identified; 6 cpDNA haplotypes from RFLP data.

- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
  - Tissue ground to fine powder (~1 cm² dried tissue) using a Retsch Tissuelyser.
  - DNA extracted with QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kits; quality/quantity checked on 1% agarose gel; stored at -20°C.

- Data collection and coding
  - DNA quality and amplification products validated with a 1 kb DNA ladder; gel/capillary sizing referenced to standard markers (IRD 800).
  - cpSSR data: haplotype assignments across two loci; cpDNA RFLP haplotypes described across regions.

- Data storage formats and submission
  - Data stored in Excel; submitted to EIDC as CSV files.
  - Two data files:
    - Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv (8 columns: Sample number, Country, Population, Latitude, Longitude, Locus1 [ccmp5], Locus2 [ccmp10], Haplotype number).
    - Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv (6 columns: Sample number, Country, Population, Latitude, Longitude, trnH-psbA haplotype).

- Quality control
  - Field samples sourced from well-documented origins; appropriate DNA ladder markers used for accurate bp quantification.
  - Replicate runs on the sequencing platform to ensure reproducibility of PCR amplification products.
