# Experimental Design / Sampling Regime

- 297 samples from mature Acacia senegal across wild populations, experimental trials, and herbarium specimens.
- Represented 66 sites across sub-Saharan Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, Pakistan, and India.
- Wild population sampling: individuals spaced 100 meters apart; each population represented by at least 1 and up to 50 individuals.
- Sampling period: July 2007 to July 2009; herbarium samples obtained with permission from RBGE; each population sampled once.

## Collection / Generation / Transformation Methods

- Tissue collection: fresh leaf or stem tissue dried on silica gel; herbarium materials desiccated on silica gel.
- Geographic data recorded for each population (latitude, longitude, altitude).
- Field/Lab personnel: David Odee, Stephen Cavers, Julia Wilson, Annika Telford; herbarium samples by Alan Gray (RBGE).

## Analytical Methods

- cpDNA is maternally inherited in angiosperms; slow evolution makes it suitable for studying historical gene flow and colonization.
- Three chloroplast regions screened: trnH-psbA spacer (Shaw et al., 2005), Dra I restriction, and universal microsatellite primers ccmp5 and ccmp10 (Weising & Gardner, 1999), selected after initial subset screening.
- trnH-psbA amplification: 25 μL reactions with specified reagents; PCR protocol: 94 °C 3 min; 35 cycles (94 °C 30 s, 45 °C 30 s, 72 °C 1 min); final extension 72 °C 10 min; amplicons digested with Dra I and visualised per Cavers et al. (2003).
- cpSSR loci: 25 μL reactions with specified reagents; electrophoresed with band sizes determined; haplotypes described using cpSSR data.
- RFLP: PCR-RFLP of trnH-psbA region used to describe haplotypes.
- Data yielded: 36 cpSSR haplotypes from two loci; 6 cpDNA haplotypes from RFLP.

## Fieldwork and / or Laboratory Instrumentation

- Tissue processed by grinding ~1 cm² dried tissue to powder using a Retsch Tissuelyser.
- DNA extraction: QIAGEN DNeasy 96 Plant kit; quality/concentration checked on 1% agarose gel; stored at -20 °C.

## Nature and Units of Recorded Values

- DNA quality and amplification products checked against 1 kb DNA ladder; base pairs (bp) used for quantification.
- cpSSR data (loci ccmp5 and ccmp10) recorded as haplotypes; cpDNA haplotypes described via RFLP patterns.
- PCR controls: special PCR water as a blank; replicates used to verify reproducibility.

## Format of Stored Data

- Data stored in Excel and submitted to EIDC as CSVs.
- Two data files:
  - cpSSR DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_cpSSR Marker.csv): 8 columns
    1) Sample number
    2) Country of origin
    3) Population/provenance
    4) Latitude
    5) Longitude
    6) Locus1 (ccmp5)
    7) Locus2 (ccmp10)
    8) Haplotype number
  - RFLP DNA marker samples (Chloroplast DNA_RFLP Marker.csv): 6 columns
    1) Sample number
    2) Country of origin
    3) Population/provenance
    4) Latitude
    5) Longitude
    6) trn Hpsb A haplotype

## Quality Control

- Field samples from well-known, documented sources.
- DNA ladder markers used to ensure accurate bp quantification.
- Band sizes and genotypes determined against IRD 800 standard on sequencer; PCR amplification run at least twice to confirm reproducibility.
