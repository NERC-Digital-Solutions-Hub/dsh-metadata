# Chloroplast DNA primer pair metadata

## Content summary
- Chloroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) primer pairs
  - Primer: ccmp5; locus: locus1
  - Primer: ccmp10; locus: locus2
- Chloroplast DNA marker primer pair (PCR-RFLP)
  - Primer: trnH-psbA; locus: locus3
- Incomplete/ placeholder fields
  - Some entries with Primer = . and/or locus = .
  - Other information entries with missing primer and locus
- Source/affiliation
  - RBGE = Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh
- Not determined indicators
  - nd = not determined

## Data quality and metadata gaps
- Several fields are missing or unspecified (Primer = ., locus = .; “Other information” entries)
- Inconsistencies in naming (e.g., "Chlroplast" vs. "Chloroplast")
- Some entries include only partial metadata (e.g., primer or locus present, the other missing)

## Provenance and responsible parties
- Data associated with RBGE (Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh)
- Nd indicators denote data not determined

## Recommendations for data stewardship
- Fill in missing primer and locus details where known; confirm placeholders are truly unknown
- Standardize terminology and correct typographical inconsistencies (e.g., Chlroplast → Chloroplast)
- Document provenance for each entry and establish consistent metadata fields (Primer, locus, marker type, source)
- Implement data validation to prevent incomplete records from being shared; ensure disclosures or embargoes are reflected if applicable
- Align with data governance practices to ensure datasets are searchable and usable by others, including clear attribution to RBGE and any other data owners
