# Chlroplast microsatellite (cpSSR) primer pairs, Primer = ccmp5.

## Overview
- A record listing chloroplast DNA marker primers for cpSSR analysis, including primer names (ccmp5, ccmp10) and associated loci (locus1, locus2).
- Includes an additional chloroplast DNA marker primer pair for PCR-RFLP (primer trnH-psbA) with locus3.
- Some entries show missing information or unspecified fields.

## Data fields and structure
- Primer identifiers: ccmp5, ccmp10, trnH-psbA.
- Loci: locus1, locus2, locus3.
- Other information fields present but often blank.
- Notation for missing data: "nd" = not determined; "." used for unspecified fields.
- Source attribution line references RBGE (Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh).

## Metadata and data quality considerations
- Multiple fields contain missing or undetermined values, hindering data completeness and reuse.
- Presence of placeholder values (e.g., Primer = ., locus = .) indicates metadata gaps.
- Lack of explicit metadata standards or provenance details beyond organization name.

## Provenance and data sources
- Indicates RBGE (Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh) as a source or repository for some data.
- Fragmented metadata suggests the dataset may be an incomplete extract or a form with unfilled fields.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Illustrates typical data governance challenges for environmental genetic monitoring datasets:
  - Need for complete metadata to enable reproducibility and data sharing.
  - Importance of standardized fields (primer, locus, information) for consistent monitoring workflows.
  - Challenges posed by data silos and incomplete records in institutional data collection.

## Key limitations and gaps
- Missing primer and locus details beyond some entries.
- Some data fields simply not determined or not provided.
- Limited contextual information about data quality controls or data management practices.
- Requires data completion, standardization, and governance measures to be fit for monitoring and decision-making.
