# Pontbren Database Catalogue

## Overview
- Describes instrumentation and borehole data logs used to generate environmental datasets for the Pontbren repository.
- Includes N-probe manipulation plots and multiple boreholes (NP20–NP23) with detailed borehole logs and soil descriptions.
- Contains supplementary material (e.g., Streamflow gauging data in Appendix D) to support data discovery, reuse, and governance.

## Borehole Logs NP20–NP23 and N-probe manipulation
- Sites and location:
  - N-probe manipulation plot 3.1 (Site S3 easternmost), 3.2 (Site S3 central), 3.3 (Site S3 westernmost); grid references provided (e.g., SJ 07360 06833; SJ 07341 06821; SJ 07323 06807; SJ 07426 06920).
  - Associated with Centre for Ecology and Hydrology projects at Llanfair Caereinion, Coed Cwm-y-llwynog, and adjacent areas.
- Borehole/N-probe details:
  - NP20 (Site S3 easternmost), NP21 (Site S3 central), NP22 (Site S3 westernmost), NP23 (COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG, Tree edge of wood).
  - Logs include: date (14/05/06), depth intervals (e.g., 0.25 mBGL to ~1.60 mBGL), ground level and datum level, and detailed soil descriptions.
  - Soil profiles described as silty/clayey soils with mottling, moist clays, gravels, and silty clays; various lithologies documented (e.g., weathered sandstone/mudstone gravels; brown humic soils with roots).
  - Completions described as 16 gauge aluminum access tubing (diameter ~44.5 mm); sample intervals noted (e.g., 0.80–1.60 m, 1.20–1.55 m).
- Methods and instrumentation:
  - Hand auger with AQ drill rod/guide tube, pneumatic hammer, Atlas Copco RAB and Leopard air-flush rotary drills.
  - Logs produced by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd for CEH.
  - Documentation includes borehole description sheets, thickness/depth data, and completion details.
- Data attributes:
  - Data embedded in structured “BOREHOLE LOG” sheets with repeated blocks for each borehole.
  - Entries include “Water Not struck” notes, site-specific details, and calibration/ground level references.
  - Each NP borehole has a corresponding log sheet with depth, description, and sample intervals.

## Streamflow Gauging Data (Appendix D)
- Contains site-specific flow metered spot measurements for various gauging sites.
- Measurements include:
  - Start time and Finish time (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm) and Flow metered estimate (volume per time unit).
  - Numerous records across multiple sites (Site 4, Site 7, Site 8, Site 9, Site 10, Site 13, Site 3, Site 6, etc.).
  - Examples of data points: flows ranging from tens to thousands of ls-1, with several time-stamped observations in 2005–2009 period.
- Purpose:
  - Supports hydrological characterization of streams within the Pontbren study area and provides provenance for streamflow conditions corresponding to borehole and soil moisture measurements.

## Metadata, Provenance, and Data Formats
- Provenance:
  - Data produced and logged for the Pontbren project; borehole work conducted by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd; documentation attributed to CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology).
- Documentation format:
  - Borehole logs presented as “BOREHOLE LOG” blocks with Sheet references (Sheet 1 of 1) and site quadrants.
  - Metadata includes grid references, datum levels, dates, depths (mBGL), soil descriptions, and completion details.
  - Streamflow data provided in Appendix D with timestamped flow measurements.
- Data compatibility:
  - Data appear as plain text blocks with standardized headings, suitable for inclusion in the Pontbren database and integration with other datasets in the repository.

## Quality Assurance and Governance
- The Pontbren Catalogue builds on a QA framework described in related materials, including:
  - QA coding and data quality assessment for diverse datasets and logging practices.
  - Documentation supports traceability, instrument locations, soil interpretations, and calibration parameters.
- Governance considerations:
  - Documentation emphasizes data discoverability, provenance, and support for data sharing, embargoes, and updates.
  - Site instrumentation and borehole data are linked to site figures and appendices to support reuse and governance.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Ensure consistent linking of borehole logs NP20–NP23 to their respective sites and N-probe plots for clear lineage.
- Maintain detailed soil descriptions, depths, and completion details to enable reuse in hydrological and soil-mortic analyses.
- Preserve metadata such as grid references, datum levels, dates, and equipment used to support reproducibility.
- Integrate Appendix D streamflow measurements with borehole/sensor datasets to enable holistic hydrological analyses.
- Use standardized data formats (e.g., “BOREHOLE LOG” sheets) and maintain Sheet 1 references for consistency.
- Monitor documentation for completeness (e.g., water-strike notes, sample intervals) to minimize data gaps.
- Ensure data are discoverable through catalog references (often tied to CEH and specific site IDs) and include provenance details for future updates.

## Key Takeaways
- The Pontbren Database Catalogue provides richly described borehole records (NP20–NP23) with detailed lithology, depths, and sampling intervals, plus associated site metadata and provenance.
- Appendix D adds a comprehensive set of streamflow measurements, enabling integrated hydrological analyses across multiple sites.
- Strong emphasis on provenance, site documentation, and standardized logging supports data discoverability, reuse, and governance, aligning with the data steward role to ensure data quality, interoperability, and up-to-date shared datasets.
