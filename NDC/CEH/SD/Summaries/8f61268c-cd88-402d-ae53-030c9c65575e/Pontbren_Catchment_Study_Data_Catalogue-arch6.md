# Introduction to the Database Catalogue

## Overview
- Describes the Pontbren Database, including instrumentation, data organization, and quality assurance to support data discovery and use.
- Documents data files and folder structure across multiple study sites and measurement types (e.g., bowl site, hillslope, Llyn Hir, manipulation plots, groundwater boreholes).
- Data are stored mainly as .txt files organized in six-month blocks; filenames indicate date ranges.
- Quality assurance codes are applied where data exist; appendices provide QA codes and guidance to aid interpretation.

## Database structure and content
- Presents a hierarchical folder structure showing how data are grouped and linked.
- Main data domains include: AWS (Automatic Weather Station), bowl runoff and soil water tension data, groundwater monitoring, hillslope runoff and soil water tension data, Llyn Hir soil water tension data, land-use manipulation plots, neutron probe soil moisture data, rain gauge data, field diaries, and streamflow.
- A dedicated Quality Assurance section explains coding and interpretation of data quality across datasets.
- Visuals (figures and tables) illustrate instrumentation locations and data collection layouts.

## Quality assurance and data quality codes
- Appendices provide a comprehensive QA coding system for multiple instruments and datasets (tensiometers, rain gauges, tipping-bucket systems, groundwater, streamflow, etc.).
- Codes indicate good quality, potential issues, calibration problems, deployment issues, data gaps, and site/instrument problems (e.g., rodent damage, sensor calibration, logger failures).

## Data categories and instrumentation
- AWS: continuous, minute-sampled data at bowl site; includes incident radiation, wind, temperatures, humidity, net radiation, etc., with some sensors added for redundancy.
- Bowl study site: runoff (bowl weir boxes, tipping bucket) and tensiometer data at multiple depths.
- Groundwater: boreholes with Diver transducers, barometric correction, contextual borehole logs and sampling notes.
- Hillslope study: runoff and soil water tension data, high-time-resolution runoff, some data flagged for quality issues.
- Llyn Hir: tensiometer arrays at various depths with adaptive sampling frequency.
- Land-use manipulation plots: four plots with treatments (Grazed, Ungrazed, Trees) and replicates; tensiometer and overland flow data.
- Neutron probe: multi-site soil moisture profiles (10–120 cm), with site-specific calibration.
- Rain gauges: multiple gauges with tipping-bucket and storage measurements.
- Field diaries: field notes documenting monitoring locations and instrumentation.
- Streamflow: sites 1–13 using Starflow acoustic Doppler or alternative methods; includes stage, velocity, cross-sectional area, flow, temperature, battery status, and calibration relationships.

## Access, usage, and notes
- Emphasizes understanding measurement framework, data collection frequency, and calibration methods before use.
- QA codes and site-specific notes are critical for interpreting patchy or compromised data (e.g., rodent damage, sensor recalibration, logger issues).
- Catalog includes calibration parameters for streamflow sites and QA appendices to guide data quality assessment and potential cleaning.

## Appendices and metadata
- Appendix A: Quality assurance coding system across tensiometers, rain gauges, tipping buckets, groundwater, starflow, weirs, and datasets.
- Appendix B: Groundwater monitoring borehole logs (equipment, methods, location, logs, water levels, borehole construction).
- Appendix C: Neutron probe access tube logs (location, depth, calibration notes).
- Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites with calibration and metered flow data (spot measurements).

## Calibration and site-specific notes
- Starflow streamflow calibrations are site-specific, with parameters (e.g., alpha, beta) and associated uncertainties.
- Neutron probe moisture calculations rely on site-calibrated linear relationships; variations (e.g., peat layers) noted.
- Low-flow or floating data may be excluded from calibration due to measurement limitations.

## Purpose and use
- The database catalogue provides a comprehensive, instrumented, multi-site resource for hydrological, soil moisture, and land-use studies at Pontbren.
- Designed to support self-service analysis and development of data products (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) while clearly documenting data quality, provenance, and site context through appendices and notes.
