# Equipment & Methods

## Overview
- Provides detailed description of field equipment, drilling methods, borehole logging, and N-probe installations used in the Pontbren monitoring programme.
- Documents N-probes NP20–NP23 across multiple plots/sites near Llanfair Caereinion (PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN; Cwm-y-llwynog; Tyn y Fron area) and manipulation plots (Site S3) for cross-site data reuse and analysis.
- Key provenance: Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd, carried out for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH); data collection date around 14/05/06.

## Data types and installations
- N-probes and access points:
  - NP20 (Site S3 easternmost), NP21 (Site S3 central), NP22 (Site S3 westernmost), NP23 (COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG, Llanfair Caereinion N-probe at Tyn y Fron Trees edge of wood).
  - Locations referenced by grid coordinates (e.g., SJ 07360 06833; SJ 07341 06821; SJ 07426 06920).
- Manipulation plots:
  - Plot 3.1 (Site S3 easternmost), Plot 3.2 (Site S3 central), Plot 3.3 (Site S3 westernmost).
- Site and layout references:
  - PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN, LLANFAIR CAEREINION, with specific N-probe log sheets and multiple borehole logs.

## Drilling methods and equipment
- Drilling tools:
  - Hand auger with AQ drill rod/guide tube.
  - Pneumatic hammer.
  - Atlas Copco RAB hand-held air flush rotary drill.
  - Atlas Copco Leopard rotary/percussive air flush drill (for some holes).
- Completion and casing:
  - 16 gauge, 44.5 mm diameter aluminium access tubing used for completion.
  - Samples collected at designated depths (example ranges: 0.80–1.60 m; 0.25–1.50 m; 1.20–1.55 m depending on hole).
- Documentation of borehole runs:
  - Multiple borehole logs per site sheet, with sequential depths and descriptions.

## Borehole logs and metadata
- Logs include:
  - Grid reference and datum level, date of borehole work.
  - Depth (mBGL) and thickness for each soil/rock layer.
  - Layer descriptions: soil colour and type (e.g., dark yellow/brown silty clay; brown humic soil; olive brown gravelly clay), mottling details, moisture, and structural notes (e.g., presence of roots, leaf litter, gravel), and occasional water observations.
  - Completion details and sample depths.
- Layer details:
  - Examples include silty/clay soils with varying textures, shallow to deeper horizons; gravelliness increasing with depth in some logs.
  - Some entries note significant features (e.g., hard/soft transitions, gravels, sandstone/mudstone aggregates).
- Data presentation:
  - Borehole logs labeled as BOREHOLE LOG with Sheet 1 of 1 for each hole (NP20–NP23).
  - Repeated entries emphasize consistent formatting across holes and sites.

## Data provenance and collaboration
- Data produced for CEH and Pontbren project; fieldwork conducted by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd.
- Documentation is consistent with CEH’s multi-site environmental monitoring approach and supports long-term data reuse, interpretation, and cross-site analyses.

## Additional data and references
- Appendix-style references within the document include extensive streamflow gauging data:
  - Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites with flow metered spot measurements, including start/finish times and flow estimates (litres per second) across numerous sites and dates.
- These supplementary measurements aid calibration and cross-checking of groundwater and surface water interactions in the Pontbren dataset.

## Implications for data leadership and data strategy
- Emphasizes the importance of:
  - Standardized borehole logging templates and metadata (site, grid refs, datum, depths, layer descriptions, calibration notes).
  - Clear documentation of installation details (drill methods, tubing specifications, sample depths).
  - Consistent data formats to enable cross-site comparability and integration with streamflow data.
  - Provenance traceability, from contractors to CEH and end-users, to support governance and long-term data stewardship.
  - Linking soil and groundwater measurements with surface water observations for holistic watershed understanding.
