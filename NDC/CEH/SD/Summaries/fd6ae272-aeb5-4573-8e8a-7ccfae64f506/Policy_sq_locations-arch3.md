# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
  - The policy is framed as being in the public interest; requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances and precision of location release
  - Approximate release: four-digit grid references can be released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
  - Precise release: six-digit grid references are only allowed in very exceptional circumstances; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations externally.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry confidentiality risks and are released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
  - In all cases, external requests must justify needs for location information and respect confidentiality constraints.

- Specific conditions of release (license terms)
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
  - Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must be destroyed and written confirmation provided at licence end.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise CS square locations; no use to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
  - For six-digit releases, licensees must meet evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases carry similar licence terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
  - A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the released data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH, acting for NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues licences; licences must be signed by authorised representatives.
  - If approval is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under statutory processes.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications and decision grounds.
  - Reasonable pre-processing support from UKCEH to CS partner internal uses is encouraged; case-by-case consideration for external requests and potential collaboration or payment.

- Implementation and consultation
  - Partners and potential data users are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data.
  - UKCEH involvement in proposed work may vary; collaboration or support depends on project needs and may involve payment.
  - The policy accommodates internal CS partnership needs for timely pre-processing analyses, subject to moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.

- Funding and partners
  - The 2019 CS rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE National Capability.
  - 2007 CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.
