# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and purpose
  - Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
  - All other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
  - Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.
  - Partners include CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH (historical list from 2007).

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.

- Release circumstances and data precision
  - Location data can be released to show whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate location suffices.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing analysis by UKCEH to avoid release; only in very exceptional circumstances may direct external release under licence.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

- Licensing terms and usage restrictions
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the licence period.
  - No data may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may be required to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms to six-digit releases but require a lower level of IP confidentiality; a clause prevents users from attempting to derive precise square locations from the data.
  - UKCEH acts as the data owner for decisions on exceptional release; licences are issued in the name of the licensee and signed by authorised senior personnel.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional release and issues hardcopy licences.
  - If release is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under the relevant Act and Regulations.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - Practical pre-processing support from UKCEH may be available for CS partnership internal use; requests from other organisations are evaluated case-by-case.
  - Data users are encouraged to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Process and recommendations for data leaders
  - Requests are subject to FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
  - For internal use, there is an expectation that UKCEH can perform necessary pre-processing within a reasonable timeframe.
  - Potential users should consult UKCEH early to define requirements and ensure compliant use of data.

- Practical takeaway for data strategy
  - Strong governance around sensitive spatial data with clear access controls, licensing, and ongoing oversight.
  - Balance between maximizing public data utility and safeguarding survey integrity, landowner trust, and future research viability.
  - Established process for escalating requests, exceptional releases, and accountability through annual reporting.
