# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Relevant to data governance and access decisions on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to protect the representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for maintaining scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how release may occur (precision and licensing)
- General access allows determination if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing the CS square.
- Six-digit grid references are allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be justified legally that the external data involved carries equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and require the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- Four-digit releases have a lighter IP/confidentiality threshold than six-digit releases, with specific licensing conditions.

## Conditions of release and use
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or conduct visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit grid reference licenses follow similar but less stringent IP confidentiality terms than six-digit releases; there are explicit clauses preventing attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate confidentiality clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorized senior representative of the licensee.
- If an approval is denied, UKCEH follows statutory processes under the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications and decision rationales.
- Internal CS partnership needs: UKCEH pre-processing support should be reasonably timely; case-by-case consideration for requests from other organisations.
- Proactive guidance: partners and potential data users are advised to consult with UKCEH before using policy-covered data; collaboration or payment terms are negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data stewardship
- Data stewards must manage access controls, licensing terms, and confidentiality safeguards for sensitive location data.
- Ensure clear documentation of allowed uses, license durations, and destruction requirements.
- Coordinate with UKCEH and NERC for approvals, reporting, and potential pre-processing analyses.
- Promote responsible data use among researchers and partners to protect sampling integrity and landowner goodwill.
