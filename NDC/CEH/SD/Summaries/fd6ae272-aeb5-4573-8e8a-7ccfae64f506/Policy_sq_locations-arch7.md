# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Context and governance
  - 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE programme.
  - 2007 CS partners include UK science and government bodies (e.g., NERC, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
  - Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release circumstances and precision
  - Location data may be released to show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
  - Six-digit precise locations require pre-processing analysis by UKCEH to avoid release; very exceptional cases may permit external release under licence.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under exceptional terms similar to six-digit releases.

- Licencing and usage restrictions
  - Licences require confidentiality, secure storage, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite in duration, tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed at the end of the period.
  - No release of data that could compromise square locations to third parties; not for planning visits or auditing landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have lower IP/confidentiality thresholds than six-digit releases; explicit prohibition on deriving precise square locations from provided data.

- Responsibilities and processes
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - If a request is denied, procedures under the Act and Regulations are followed.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - UKCEH may provide pre-processing support within CS partnership timelines; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH may provide scientific guidance or support as part of collaboration or paid arrangements.

- Practical guidance for GIS specialists
  - Use four-digit grid references for generalized location within a license; avoid exposing precise square locations.
  - Seek UKCEH involvement for pre-processing analysis when possible to determine necessity of location release.
  - Plan data workflows to maintain confidentiality: secure storage, restricted access, and defined license periods.
  - If handling spatial data within squares, apply the same exceptional-release constraints as for precise location data.
  - Consider alternative analyses that do not require precise locations when possible to maintain compliance and data usefulness.
