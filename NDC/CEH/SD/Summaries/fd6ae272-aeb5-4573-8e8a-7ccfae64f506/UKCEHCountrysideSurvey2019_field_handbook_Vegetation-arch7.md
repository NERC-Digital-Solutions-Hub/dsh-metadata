# UK-SCAPE Field Survey Field Handbook 2019

## Overview
- Field handbook for recording vegetation plots within UK-SCAPE, focusing on repeatable, map-based data collection.
- Data capture via ESRI Collector and Survey123; balance between paper plots/maps and digital forms.
- Purpose: quantify vegetation presence, abundance, and changes over time with precise plot relocation.

## Data Collection Workflow (GIS-focused)
- Use Collector to navigate to plot locations; open Survey123 forms to enter plot data.
- Work offline when needed; submit online when connected. Auto-save mitigates data loss.
- Plot data include header, plot-specific information, and vegetation data (nested plots and species lists).
- Photos and sketch maps accompany plots to aid relocation in future surveys.

## Plot Structure and Layout
- Two main plot sizes per square:
  - Areal 200 m2 X plots (14.14 m x 14.14 m)
  - Soil/Square 2x2 m nested subplots (within the X plot) and 4 m2 X plots in some contexts
- Five predetermined random X plot positions per 1 km square; relocation rules apply when plots are revisited.
- Provisions for relocating plots if previously inaccessible or conditions have changed (e.g., new housing, land access).

## Plot Identification and Relocation
- Plot identification details: Square, Plot Type (X = 200 m2, XX = 2x2 m), Plot Number, Plot ID (auto-generated).
- Plot Relocation status options: Found, Not Found, New Plot (Replacement), New Plot (New feature/Land cover), Not appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous.
- GPS coordinates captured (preferably at plot corner) with options for full-screen map interaction and location averaging to improve accuracy.
- If relocation is unsatisfactory, mark as Not Found and create a new plot; document disturbance and rationale in Notes.

## Plot Documentation Protocols
- Plot Relocation Notes: specify habitat context and potential relocation error (e.g., 10–20 m tolerance in homogeneous vegetation).
- Plot Photos: 2–3 photos per plot, showing plot in relation to a stable nearby feature; include plot number and type on photos; attach weatherwriter/backing for identification.
- Plot Sketch Maps: precise hand-drawn or tablet-drawn maps showing GPS reference point, distances, and bearings; north arrow required; photos of maps if redrawn/edited.

## Plot Header and Site Information
- Page 1 (Plot header): site name, recorders, slope, aspect, location, photos; plot type and number pre-entered if editing.
- Plot relocation context: interpretation of Found/Not Found decisions and related notes.
- Location panel: switch to full-screen map for precise coordinates; alternative basemaps available; Home and Navigation modes described.

## Plot Description and Vegetation Height
- Plot description fields: slope, aspect, shade, whether plot map was drawn or edited, and free-text notes.
- Vegetation height estimates for three levels (canopy, shrub, ground) with predefined categories.
- Photos: correlate with plot location and vegetation context.

## Plot Data Recording (Nest-based Vegetation Data)
- Nested quadrats within X plots:
  - Nest 0: inner 1x1 m of the 2x2 m nest within the 14.14 m square for 200 m2 plots; record presence and percent cover for vascular plants and additional categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes).
  - Nest 1 to Nest 5: progressively larger nest areas up to the full 200 m2; species added per nest, with notes for species not present in earlier nests.
- 4 m2 X plots (soil squares) follow similar nested recording with total cover across species and categories.
- Species entry: use drop-down lists with auto-type; “Other” option available for unidentified species with later replacement when identified.
- Aggregations/Combinations: record difficult-to-separate taxa as approved combinations to maintain consistency with past surveys; avoid uprooting invasive species; photos recommended for unidentified specimens.

## Bryophytes and Lichens
- Recording restricted to listed bryophytes and lichens; emphasis on vascular plants for accuracy and data quality.
- Sphagnum moss categories recorded with guidance on green/fat vs. red/thin forms; specific species identifications optional but aggregations preferred.

## Plot Types and Placement Rules
- Areal plots must fit wholly within the 1 km square; adjustments to avoid edge effects in arable fields.
- Five-sector stratification guides new X plot locations when land is available within sectors; caution in agricultural contexts (tramlines, crop damage).
- If plots cross linear features, adjust placement to keep habitat representation accurate and minimize disturbance.

## Completing and Submitting Data
- Validation checks prompt for missing fields before submission.
- Online submission via Send Now; offline options include Drafts and Outbox; resubmission via Copy to new survey if edits are needed.
- Automatic save protects against data loss from device failures.

## Plot Types, Specific Layouts, and Nest Details
- 3.1 X Plots (X1–X5): five random positions; VEGETATION SQUARES (200 m2) and SOIL SQUARES (4 m2 nests).
- 3.1.1 Locating X plots: reference maps, random points, proximity rules to linear features, and relic plates for repeat plots (south-most corner).
- 3.1.2 4 m2 X plot layout: step-by-step tape measurement and orientation; arable field adjustments explained.
- 3.1.3.1 200 m2 X plot (VEGETATION): nest-based species recording from nest 0 outward; cumulative species lists with nest-specific recording and cover estimates.
- 3.1.3.2 4 m2 X plot (SOIL): similar nest-based approach focused on soil quadrats and total cover.

## Appendices and Tools
- Appendix 1: COLLECTOR & SURVEY123 setup and generic usage guides (installing apps, map interactions, GPS guidance, validation tips).
- Appendix 2: Random numbers between 0 and 1 (example datasets for randomization in plot placement).

## Practical GIS Considerations
- Data integration: multiple data sources, resolutions, and formats (hardware GPS, offline maps, digital forms) require careful QA and consistent data standards.
- Documentation: comprehensive metadata (plot IDs, relocation statuses, habitat context) essential for reproducibility and future GIS analyses.
- Quality assurance: explicit instructions for data cleaning, avoidance of disturbance to plots, and accurate species identification workflows to support reliable change detection over time.
