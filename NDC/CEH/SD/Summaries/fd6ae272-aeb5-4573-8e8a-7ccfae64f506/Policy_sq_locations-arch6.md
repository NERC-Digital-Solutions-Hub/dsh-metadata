# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC; partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveying.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision)
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for generic location identification.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only allowed in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; the applicant must show, in legal terms, that their IP data carries equal/higher confidentiality than CS data and cannot be released to UKCEH for processing with CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.) are treated equivalently to location data and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
- Confidential data must be kept secure and accessible only to authorised individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties after the licence period ends.
- Written confirmation of data destruction upon licence termination.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Licences for four-digit releases are similar but do not require the strict IP-confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from released data.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, representing NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hard-copy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If access is denied, UKCEH follows FOI/Regulatory procedures supporting the decision.
- UKCEH provides an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical implementation, UKCEH aims to perform necessary pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; case-by-case decisions apply for other organisations.
- Partner organisations and potential CS data users are strongly encouraged to consult with UKCEH before committing to data use; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated case-by-case.
