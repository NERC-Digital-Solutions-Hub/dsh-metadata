# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the Countryside Survey field sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify sampling across Great Britain.
- Emphasises the long-running, time-series approach to detect ecological and habitat change, linking past and present methodologies to understand current strategy.

## Core concepts
- Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage of land types and to reduce bias from purely random sampling.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attribute–based classification used to partition land into discrete strata (classes) for sampling.
- Use of 1 km squares as the sampling unit, with classification guiding where samples are taken.
- Random selection within each class (stratum) to obtain representative samples and robust national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

## Timeline of developments

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification (& 1st Field Survey)
- ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data of 1228 centre 1 km squares.
- For each class, eight 1 km squares were sampled (total 256) to estimate national habitat areas.
- Classified landscape framework established to derive national estimates (mean habitat area per square in a class × total area of that class).

### 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
- Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
- Framework still based on the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- Additional squares were allocated to enhance coverage; focus shifted toward land use and habitat mapping.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (& 3rd Field Survey)
- Land Classification extended to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
- 508 squares surveyed; repeat of the 1978 quadrats recorded.
- Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB derived from satellite imagery.
- National estimates calculated using the revised, all-squares classification.

### 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification (& 4th Field Survey)
- Recognition that all GB squares needed classification; new surrogates (climatic, geological, physiographic factors) used to classify remaining squares.
- Comparison between original 1228-square classification and new approach showed ~62% exact correspondence; most non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes with preserved overall characteristics.
- Results led to imbalances in class representation; CS2000 introduced separate country estimates and expanded the classification to better support England, Scotland, and Wales reporting.

### 2007 – Revised Land Classification (& 5th Field Survey)
- Devolution-driven need for Wales-only reporting prompted adjustments:
  - Welsh-specific country-unit classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Overall framework expanded to 45 strata (from 40).
  - Additional squares: 43 in Wales to ensure adequate representation; England did not receive a similar increase.
  - England classes 5e and 15e left with fewer samples but deemed acceptable for precision.
- Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit; revised maps for England with Wales and Scotland provided.
- CS2007 survey results documented the updated sampling framework and class distribution.

## Wales, uplands, and country-unit considerations
- Wales-only reporting requirements led to subclassifying land classes by country units and increasing Welsh sampling to support robust Wales-specific estimates.
- An uplands module added to CS2000/CS2007 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales, enhancing statistical reliability for those regions.

## National estimates and data consistency
- National estimates are derived from mean habitat per square within each Land Class × land area of that class.
- Changes in the Land Classification across surveys affect the consistency of national estimates; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest classification for internal consistency while noting cross-survey comparability challenges.
- Table/figure references (not reproduced here) illustrate the evolving numbers of squares, strata, and sampling rates per survey, highlighting how representation and weighting changed over time.

## Data governance and implications for data leaders
- The document underscores the importance of a transparent, documented stratification framework and classification scheme for long-term data comparability.
- Highlights the need to account for classification changes when aggregating time-series data and to maintain country-unit reporting capabilities for policy and governance needs.
- Demonstrates how data strategy must adapt to policy contexts (e.g., devolution) while preserving methodological rigor for robust, actionable environmental indicators.
