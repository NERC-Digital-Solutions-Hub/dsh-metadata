# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Purpose and Context
- Describes the sampling framework and land classification basis for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Aimed at providing representative ecological sampling across Great Britain to support national and country-level environmental policy and decision-making.
- Emphasises the link between long-running time-series data and a consistent methodology for detecting change.

## Background: ITE Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- Core idea: stratify land into discrete classes (strata) to ensure samples cover the range of ecological variation and avoid bias from purely random sampling.
- Rooted in the development of the ITE Land Classification, which groups land by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) rather than by simple land-use mixes.
- Early work began in the 1970s with Quadrat-level classification (Indicator Species Analysis) scaled up to 1 km squares for national coverage.
- Initial sampling unit: 1 km square; classification produced 32 Land Classes, plus surrounding squares coded to reflect local context.
- National estimates were derived by applying the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class to the total area represented by that class.

## Chronology of Countryside Survey Sampling and Land Classification

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey
  - ISA used to classify 1 km squares into 32 Land Classes from environmental data.
  - Sampling: eight squares per class, drawn from the classified set (total of 256 squares).
  - Output: national habitat area estimates based on class proportions and per-square means.
- 1984 – 2nd Field Survey
  - Employed the same framework with an expanded sample: 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Resulted in change considerations for policy-relevant estimates.
- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and All Squares Land Classification
  - Land Classification updated to cover every GB square; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - Field survey expanded to 508 squares.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite data).
- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and 4th Field Survey
  - Land Classification extended to 40 classes to support more detailed regional reporting (including Scotland).
  - CS1990 results reinterpreted under the revised framework.
- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) and Separate Country Estimates
  - Addressed policy needs for country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided to create country-unit versions; aggregation used where class representation was sparse within a country (creating 40 strata from 32).
  - Additional samples allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland module introduced for England and Wales to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused Reporting and Wales-specific Adjustments
  - Wales required more dedicated reporting; Welsh sub-classes introduced (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Wales squares added to ensure representation; some English classes had reduced sampling (two classes with 4 squares each) deemed acceptable based on scoping studies.
  - England, Wales, and Scotland maps updated to reflect revised land classes and sampling framework.
- Summary of CS2007 sampling
  - England and Wales: multiple classes with varying numbers of sample squares; overall total sample squares for England, Wales, and Scotland reported in the CS2007 tables.
  - The framework supports country-specific estimates while maintaining comparability through consistent stratification strategies.

## Survey Design and Estimation Approach
- Stratified random sampling by ITE Land Classes to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across GB.
- National estimates
  - Computed as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area represented by that class.
  - Results reflect the distribution of land classes and their characteristic habitat occurrences.
- Country-specific estimates
  - Implemented by subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions and aggregating within each country (England with Wales, and Scotland).
  - Modifications to sampling (sub-division, aggregation, and added squares) ensured adequate representation for each country unit and new classes.
- Upland habitat module (CS2000)
  - Added to improve precision of upland habitat estimates for England and Wales, supporting country-based reporting needs.

## National Consistency and Cross-Survey Considerations
- Creation and modification of the Land Classification impact the consistency of national estimates across surveys.
- Preference noted for using the latest country-unit classification within a single survey for consistency, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability may be affected.
- Documentation (Notes and Tables) provides guidance on how original vs. revised classifications affect counts and estimates.

## Practical Aspects and Data Considerations
- The strategy integrates data collection, metadata, and classification updates to support robust, policy-relevant reporting.
- Adjustments over time address policy needs (e.g., country-specific reporting, uplands) while striving to maintain a coherent, interpretable time series.
