# UK-SCAPE Field Survey Field Handbook 2019

## Purpose and scope
- Provides standardized methods for recording vegetation plots to quantify changes in the countryside.
- Aims to support environmental health monitoring, policy scrutiny, and informing future decisions.
- Targets repeatable, long-term datasets with clear provenance and metadata.

## Monitoring design and data products
- Hierarchical, nested plot design:
  - Areal plots (200 m2; 14.14 x 14.14 m) with nested vegetation/nest sampling.
  - Subplots including 4 m2 X plots and 2x2 m soil plots.
  - Five nested nests per 200 m2 plot (Nest 0 to Nest 5) to capture increasing spatial scales.
- Randomized and sector-based placement:
  - X plots located at predetermined random positions within 1 km squares; five-sector stratification to guide new placements.
  - Areal 200 m2 plots designed to be wholly inside square boundaries; arches of nesting ensure consistent sampling across years.
- Repeated plots since 1978:
  - Emphasis on relocating exact positions using GPS, plot maps, sketch maps, and photos to enable long-term comparability.
- Data capture goals:
  - Track presence/abundance of plant species, with emphasis on vascular plants and key bryophyte groups.
  - Quantify vegetation change by habitat type and landscape location.

## Data collection workflow and tools
- Field data capture via ESRI Collector and Survey123:
  - Online and offline data entry modes; central database submission when online.
  - Separate forms for header information, plot-specific headers, and vegetation data.
- Plot relocation and recording:
  - Protocols for locating repeated plots using GPS, plot maps, and photographs.
  - Options for “Found,” “Not Found,” “New Plot (Replacement),” “New Plot (New feature),” or “Not appropriate/Access Denied/Too Dangerous.”
  - Relocation accuracy judged by surveyor; some relocation error acceptable in homogeneous habitats.
- Plot markers and relocation aids:
  - Physical markers (aluminium plates or stakes) and metal detectors; guidance on burying markers to avoid confusion with debris.
  - If markers cannot be located after time, use available maps/photos to reposition; clearly mark as replaced or not found.
- Plot description and habitat metadata:
  - Site name, recorder, slope, aspect, shade, and plot maps; notes on disturbances or changes.
  - Broad habitat and Priority Habitat classifications at plot and wider polygon levels.
- Vegetation and species recording:
  - Nest-based recording with nested quadrats for ground flora (including abundance/percent cover; total cover approximations).
  - Aggregations/Combinations (4.1) for difficult separations; avoid uprooting invasive species; prioritize photographic evidence when identification is uncertain.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded using a defined moss list and restricted lichens; emphasis on “Total bryophyte” and key Sphagnum categories.
- Data entry specifics:
  - Auto-type species lists with an “Other” option for unidentified taxa; photos for later identification; avoidance of duplicates.
  - Subtotals and summaries shown to assist QA, though the interface may not display full lists in real time.
- Submission and data management:
  - Submissions can be sent immediately when online; offline work stored as Drafts/Outbox and resubmitted later.
  - Auto-save features; ability to copy to a new survey for editing; notes to indicate version corrections.

## Plot types and sampling details
- Plot types per square:
  - VEGETATION SQUARES (200 m2) and SOIL SQUARES (2x2 m nest within the 200 m2 plot).
- X plots (VEGETATION):
  - Five predetermined random positions within the square; areal 200 m2 plots with labeled nests.
  - 4 m2 X plots for soil/ground flora (nested within 200 m2 plots).
- Nest structure and data collection:
  - Nest 0 to Nest 5 correspond to progressively larger areas; species lists for each nest accumulate from inner to outer.
  - Nest 0: presence/absence and cover for all vascular plants plus six extra categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes).
  - Nest 1–Nest 5: record additional species present beyond nests 0; total coverage tracked per nest.
- Areal and 4 m2 layouts:
  - 200 m2 X plots oriented NS/EW; marked with diagonals and colored nets to differentiate nested plots.
  - 4 m2 X plots oriented NS/EW with defined corner measurements to ensure repeatability.
- Habitat and plant identification:
  - Emphasis on accurate identification where feasible; use of aggregations for difficult taxa; avoidance of invasive species uprooting.
  - Comprehensive guidelines for mosses/bryophytes with a prioritized focus on total bryophyte cover.

## Metadata, data quality, and governance
- Metadata requirements:
  - Plot header information, plot type/number, location, slope/aspect, and accompanying photos and sketch maps.
  - GPS geopoints captured (with guidance on offline versus online capture and accuracy checks).
- Data quality and QA:
  - Nested plot design and multiple nests support robust detection of vegetation change.
  - Warnings about potential data issues (blank/duplicate entries; need for QA checks).
- Governance and data sharing:
  - Outputs intended for clear communication to stakeholders (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Emphasis on keeping underlying data accessible through proper data management and provenance; formal data-sharing barriers acknowledged (e.g., metadata gaps or sensitive locations), with guidelines to document and share where possible.
- Challenges acknowledged:
  - Difficulties in data access and distinct organizational silos; ensuring up-to-date data; managing metadata quality; requirement to publicly share datasets may be a barrier in some contexts.
  - Protocols to address missing plots, “not found” cases, and land-use changes that preclude recording.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Provides a rigorous, repeatable framework for long-term environmental health monitoring.
- Demonstrates the importance of:
  - Clear plot relocation protocols and robust metadata to ensure comparability over decades.
  - Nested sampling designs to capture multi-scale vegetation change.
  - Integration of digital tools (Collector, Survey123) with offline capabilities and QA mechanisms.
  - Governance basics around data provenance, sharing, and stakeholder-facing outputs.
- Highlights practical barriers to data sharing and metadata completeness, informing governance and policy strategies to improve data accessibility and quality in monitoring programs.
