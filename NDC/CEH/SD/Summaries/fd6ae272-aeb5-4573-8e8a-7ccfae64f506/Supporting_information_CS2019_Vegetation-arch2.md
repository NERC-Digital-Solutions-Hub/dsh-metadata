# Countryside Survey

- Background and aim
  - A long-running UK study auditing natural resources to detect gradual changes over time since 1978.
  - Uses a multi-m metric, ecosystem-based approach to combine soil, vegetation, streams, habitats, and landscape features.
  - The 2019 shift to a rolling monitoring program (UKCEH-CS) enables year-to-year monitoring and long-term trend detection.

- Rolling program and design
  - Rolling program repeats every five years or after 500 squares are surveyed.
  - First rolling cycle started in 2019; aims to maximize site coverage while controlling climate-related variability.
  - Sample comprises 500 x 1km squares, stratified by the Land Classification of Great Britain (LC07).
  - 100 squares are visited annually; the design includes 256 historic squares from 1978 retained for longest time-series data.
  - Exclusions: any square with >75% urban land or >90% sea is excluded.

- Sample selection and coverage
  - The 1km squares provide national and sub-national indicators across GB and constituent countries.
  - Longest time-series preserved by prioritising the 1978 squares, with additional squares added from earlier surveys (e.g., 1990) to extend the series.

- Data collection, methods, and quality assurance
  - Data collected by trained field surveyors following standardized protocols (Smart et al., 2019).
  - Intensive pre-survey training ensures consistency in method, effort, identification, and recording.
  - Supervisory oversight during surveys; 10% of plots re-surveyed for quality assurance.
  - QA surveys and analyses conducted by the same assessor since 1990, enabling consistent validation of plot locations and habitat classification.

- Outputs and data products
  - Vegetation dataset for 2019: two CSV files
    - UKCEHCS_VEGETATION_PLOTS_2019.csv: plot-level information (YEAR, SQUARE_ID, PLOT_ID, PLOT_TYPE, habitat classifications, location data, land class, environmental zone, etc.).
    - UKCEHCS_VEGETATION_PLOT_SPECIES_2019.csv: species list per plot, with species identifiers, names (nomenclature per Stace 1997), nest level data, and cover percentages.
  - Data include: BAP Broad Habitat and Priority classifications, environmental zoning, county, and land classification codes (LC07/LC07_NUM).

- Data interpretation and scope
  - Designed to answer questions about the size, location, causes, and consequences of change in soils, vegetation, headwater streams, habitats, and landscape features.
  - Facilitates detection of spatial variation and temporal trends across GB.

- Data storage, portals, and accessibility
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; accompanying field handbook and methodology provide context for replication and validation.

- Challenges and strategic priorities
  - Increasing the value of datasets by linking Countryside Survey data with other relevant datasets (“single use” avoidance).
  - Enabling access to underlying data used to produce final outputs to promote transparency and reuse.

- References and context
  - Methodologies and context drawn from standard sources such as Smart et al. (2019) field handbook, Scott (2008) statistical reports, Bunce et al. on land classification, and various foundational reports on habitat classifications and biodiversity planning.
