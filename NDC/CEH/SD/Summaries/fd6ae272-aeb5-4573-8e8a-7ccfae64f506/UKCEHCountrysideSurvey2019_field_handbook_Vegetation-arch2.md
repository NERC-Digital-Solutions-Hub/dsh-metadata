# UK-SCAPE Field Survey Field Handbook 2019

## Overview
- Provides standardized methods for recording vegetation presence, abundance, and habitat change across UK landscapes.
- Aims to generate comparable, time-series data on environmental health and habitat condition for monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Data are collected from established sources, quality assured, transformed as needed, and stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Data collection framework
- Use established data sources and standardized methods to create outputs (habitat health, standards, time-series analysis).
- Emphasizes verification, QA, cleaning, and clear presentation (reports, maps, charts).
- Focus on maintaining and updating datasets and ensuring accessibility for others.

## Field methods and plots
- Two plot sizes: 200 m2 X plots (areal vegetation) and 2x2 m soil/ground flora plots nested within X plots.
- Each plot requires header information, plot-specific headers, and a vegetation recording section with nested quadrats (Nest 0 to Nest 5 for vegetation; soils plots use a 4 m2 nest).
- Plots are positioned and relocated with GPS, sketch maps, and photos to enable repeated surveys and accurate change detection.
- Digital data entry via ESRI Collector and Survey123; paper maps/backups retained.

## Plot relocation and location protocols
- Plot markers (aluminium plates or wooden stakes) aid relocation; metal detectors may be used, though markers may be buried or moved.
- If a plot cannot be relocated within acceptable accuracy, mark as Not Found and create a New Plot (Replacement or New feature) as appropriate.
- Location accuracy and relocation decisions (Found vs Not Found vs Not Appropriate) require judgment by the surveyor, considering habitat type and potential relocation error.
- Five-sector stratification guides new X-plot placement when land is scarce; ensure field disturbance is minimized (e.g., avoid crop damage).

## Plot description and header information
- Header fields include site name, recorders, slope, aspect, location, and photos.
- Plot relocation status and geopoint data are captured; maps can be edited/redrawn if needed, with clear annotations.
- Plot description includes slope, aspect, shade, map status, and notes (e.g., reasons for plot loss or disturbance).
- Plot photos are taken to aid relocation and illustrate vegetation changes; photos must clearly display plot number/type.

## Plot recording in Veg Plots
- Three recording pages per plot: 
  - Page 1: Plot header information
  - Page 2: Plot-specific headers
  - Page 3: Vegetation data (nested nests for X plots; 2x2 m plots for soils)
- For X plots, vegetation is recorded across nested 1 m2 to 14.14 m2 areas up to the full 200 m2; soil plots record presence/absence in a 2x2 m nest.
- Prioritize recording major bryophytes, but full lists are supplementary; ensure data for all plots, including inaccessible ones, are captured.

## Plot types and layouts
- X Plots (X1–X5): 200 m2 vegetation plots with five predetermined random positions.
- VEGETATION SQUARES (200 m2 X plots) and SOIL SQUARES (4 m2 X plots) nesting patterns.
- 4 m2 X plots are oriented N–S or E–W; 200 m2 plots use diagonal layout with nested 1 m2 increments.
- New plots in arable fields are placed to minimize edge effects and disturbance; plant lists focus on what can be observed in the crop.

## Nest structure and species recording
- 200 m2 X plots: Nest 0 at the innermost 1 m2 area; subsequent nests extend outward to Nest 5; species are cumulatively recorded, with new species added per nest.
- 4 m2 X plots: Species presence/absence recorded similarly within the smaller nest; total cover estimates are compiled for all components (vascular plants, bryophytes, litter, etc.).
- Nest recording requires careful, iterative searching to capture all species within each nested area.

## Data entry and submission workflow
- Data entry via Survey123; can operate offline with autosave features.
- Submission options:
  - Online: Send Now to central database.
  - Offline: Save as Drafts or Outbox and submit later; resubmitting creates a new survey copy.
- Data integrity checks prompt users to complete missing fields before submission.
- Survey contents are modular; forms may vary by plot type but core submission and data management flows remain consistent.

## Taxa and aggregation guidance
- Species-level recording is preferred; when identification is uncertain, use aggregations/combinations (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to maintain consistency with previous surveys.
- Do not uproot invasive species; photos are preferred to preserve integrity and allow later confirmation.
- For bryophytes and lichens, record only listed taxa; prioritize total bryophyte and Sphagnum categories over exhaustive species lists when time is limited.
- Sphagnum mosses are categorized into green/fat or red/thin groups; exact species can be recorded if feasible.

## Bryophytes, lichens, and moss list
- Focus on Mosses (listed in Vegplots) and Lichens/Liverworts per Vegplots guidance.
- A predefined Moss list is provided to guide recording, with emphasis on overall bryophyte cover and Sphagnum categories.

## Appendices and tools
- Appendix 1: COLLECTOR & SURVEY123 user guidance (installing apps, map navigation, data collection workflows, map galleries, and offline basemaps).
- My Surveys, Download Surveys, Drafts/Outbox/Sent workflows, and the concept of Favourite answers for reusing set responses.
- Settings and advanced options (e.g., database reinitialization, fixing data paths after app updates, map cache management).
- Appendix 2: Random numbers between 0 and 1 (examples for sampling or placement logic).
- Appendix 5.1: Collector & Survey123 reference guides; Appendix 5.2: sample random numbers.

## Data access, QA, and stewardship
- Emphasis on standardised QA, data cleaning, and transparent relocation decisions to ensure long-term utility of the dataset.
- Plots and nested sampling designed to maximise comparability across survey rounds and maintain the integrity of the time-series dataset.
- Data storage and portal submission protocols are described to support data sharing while preserving provenance.
