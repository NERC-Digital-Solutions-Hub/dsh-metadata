# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - CS partners include NERC and a consortium of government bodies and agencies (e.g., CEH, Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH); the 2019 rolling program is funded by NERC.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill, which are essential for ongoing surveys, environmental protection, and obtaining permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest stance is implemented through UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- When and how locations may be released
  - Approximate location: four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence if valuable to users.
  - Precise location: six-digit grid references require UKCEH processing to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, external release may be permitted if the requesting party demonstrates that their own data/IP protections are equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
  - End of licensing: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No sharing with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; never use data to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations or claim they have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative.
  - If a release is denied, decisions are supported under the Act and Regulations.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - Pre-processing support by UKCEH is available within reasonable capacity; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult UKCEH before committing to data use; collaboration or paid support may be negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - Evaluate whether your project requires four-digit, six-digit, or spatial data releases.
  - Consider arranging pre-processing analysis through UKCEH to avoid location release when possible.
  - Plan for secure data handling, defined license periods, and eventual data destruction.
  - Be aware of FOI/EIR processes for data requests and ensure compliance with confidentiality and licensing terms.
