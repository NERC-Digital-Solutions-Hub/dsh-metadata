# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification, which provides a stratified framework for sampling GB countryside.
  - Emphasises linkage to time-series data and the importance of understanding prior developments to interpret current results.

- Core concept: stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - Strata are defined by environmental/land attributes (land classes) to ensure representative sampling across varied landscapes.
  - Sampling units are 1 km squares; centre squares are classified, and surrounding squares are allocated to the same or neighboring classes to build a robust stratified sample.
  - Early implementation used a fixed number of samples per class to control statistical error and ensure broad coverage.

- Development timeline and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and first field survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis used to produce 32 land classes from environmental variables for 1228 centre 1 km squares; 4 surrounding squares per centre were also classified (total ~6039 km squares).
    - 8 squares per land class were surveyed (256 total); national habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class’s land area.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sampling widened to 12 squares per land class (384 total); 1984 estimates used the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & third field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; national estimates based on the updated classification.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & fourth field survey)
    - Land Classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - Introduced regional considerations for England, Scotland, and Wales in national estimates.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification & fifth field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting needs led to further adjustments; Welsh sampling increased, and new country-unit classes created (England & Wales, Scotland).
    - Introduced 45 strata; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares.
    - Wales-specific sub-divisions for several classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to improve Wales estimates.
    - England adjustments did not include additional squares beyond compensating Welsh reductions.

- Country-specific reporting and upland emphasis
  - Separate country estimates implemented to provide England with Wales and Scotland-specific results.
  - Land Classification sub-divided by country units; reduced or aggregated classes to maintain representation within each country.
  - Additional upland module added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales with 30 extra squares.

- Outputs and data characteristics
  - Tables and maps track the distribution of land classes, sample squares, and sampling rates (1:x) across years and regions.
  - Figures illustrate revised land class maps for England with Wales and Scotland, and the spatial distribution of sample squares.
  - Outputs inform national and country-level estimates of habitat areas and land-use features, derived from class-level means and class-area proportions.

- Data quality, limitations, and notes
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects the comparability of national estimates over time; hence, the report discusses consistency considerations and preferred approaches for a given survey.
  - The approach balances computational feasibility with representative coverage, accommodating devolved administrations and policy needs.
