# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 through 2007.
  - Emphasizes that the current methodology is built on decades of development and remains linked to its predecessors.

- Core concept: ITE Land Classification (environmental stratification)
  - Stratifies Great Britain into land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ensure samples represent the range of land types.
  - Early approach used a 1 km square sampling unit, with a 15 x 15 km grid to manage computing limits, centering on 1 km squares for detailed classification.
  - Classes are designed to capture ecological and land-use variation; initial work produced 32 classes, later expanded to better reflect regional differences and policy needs.

- Why stratified sampling matters for GIS
  - Stratification reduces sampling bias and improves the representativeness of national and regional habitat estimates.
  - Enables map-based visualization of habitat types, land-use categories, and their change over time.
  - Provides a framework to generate national estimates from class-level statistics (e.g., mean habitat area per square multiplied by class area).

- Timeline of developments and sampling frameworks
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification & first field survey)
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to derive 32 land classes from environmental data of 1,228 centre squares (plus surrounding squares classified).
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total 256 squares nationwide.
    - National estimates calculated from class-level means multiplied by class area.
  - 1984 (Second GB survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384).
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification (retrospective use of earlier framework).
  - 1990 (CS1990 All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Revised to classify every GB square with an All Squares approach; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Includes repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978 and adds land-cover mapping linked to a Land Cover Map.
    - National estimates presented using the new All Squares framework but with some continuity from earlier data.
  - 1998 (CS2000; revised Land Classification)
    - Land Classification extended to enable separate reporting for Scotland and England/Wales; number of classes increased to 40.
    - 40 strata used to produce country-unit estimates; additional squares allocated to improve representation in larger classes and to address policy needs.
    - Wales and Scotland reporting considerations drove changes to sampling density and class subdivisions.
    - An uplands module was introduced (CS2000 uplands survey) to improve estimates for upland habitats.
  - 2007 (CS2007; further refinements)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to explicit Wales country-unit subdivisions within Land Classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total of 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation; some English classes retained a smaller sample due to precision considerations.
    - England/Wales/Scotland sampling maps updated to reflect revised classifications and country-specific sampling.

- Details on country-specific adjustments and sampling counts
  - Separate country estimates (CS2000)
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (England with Wales; Scotland).
    - Some classes aggregated in countries with very few squares to maintain representation.
    - Additional squares allocated to assure minimum representation across new classes (minimum 6 squares per new class in Wales; some English classes also adjusted).
  - Wales-focused adjustments (CS2007)
    - Introduction of country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to improve Wales-specific reporting.
    - Wales received more Welsh-class squares than England or Scotland to achieve adequate precision for Wales-only estimates.
  - Uplands module (CS2000)
    - Extra 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats under separate country reporting.

- Practical outputs and representations
  - Maps and figures illustrating revised Land Class frameworks and sample square distributions (e.g., Figures 4–7 in the document).
  - Tables documenting numbers of squares by class and country unit for each survey iteration (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).

- Methodological notes and considerations
  - Creation of national estimates can depend on using the latest classification versus the original 1990 Land Classification; consistency considerations have been highlighted for cross-survey comparability.
  - When classifications change, most non-matching squares fall into neighbouring classes, preserving overall class characteristics and allowing continued use of the stratification approach.
  - For Wales and other country-specific reporting, sub-dividing classes and rebalancing samples helps meet policy and regulatory needs while attempting to minimize precision loss.

- Enduring purpose for GIS practitioners
  - The sampling strategy provides a robust, map-ready framework to visualize ecological and habitat distributions across GB, track changes over time, and support policy-relevant analyses.
  - The evolving Land Classification enables country-specific mapping (England, Wales, Scotland) and targeted upland habitat visualizations, facilitating focused GIS analyses and decision support.
