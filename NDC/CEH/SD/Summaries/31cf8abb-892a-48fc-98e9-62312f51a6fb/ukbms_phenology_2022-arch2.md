# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - A national monitoring program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Aims to provide annual data on butterfly population status to inform policy questions on biodiversity status and trends.
  - Since 1976, the scheme has tracked butterfly abundance across the UK with over 3,000 active sites annually.
  - Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to produce integrated outputs.

- Data collection and sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) where all butterflies are recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) across habitat units.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 visits in July/August; spring visits encouraged).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species.
  - WCBS started in 2009 to improve sampling of common habitats like farmland; WCBS coverage ~800 squares/year.
  - By 2022, more than 2000 standard transect sites were monitored annually.

- Phenology data and metrics
  - Phenology refers to timing of adult butterfly flight periods recorded on UKBMS transects.
  - Since WCBS involves reduced effort, phenology metrics are primarily derived from standard transects with weekly data.
  - Metrics include: first/last recording dates per site/year, peak date and count, flight period length (days between first and last observation).
  - Alternative metrics used to mitigate sampling limitations: mean flight date (weighted mean of counts) and flight period standard deviation (SD).
  - Generational complexity considered: most multivoltine species can have separate first/second flight periods; uni-voltine species Brimstone and Peacock have two distinct flight periods (early after overwintering and summer offspring).
  - For some species where generations overlap, phenology measures are provided for the entire flight period; for several species, first and second flight periods are provided where separable.

- Data quality control and validation
  - Field data collected on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker software; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag data issues (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside flight periods); ongoing validation by regional transect coordinators.
  - Additional automated/manual validation checks for distribution range, first-time site records, atypical abundances, and site-specific anomalies.
  - Data corrections and edits follow discussions with transect coordinators when needed.

- Details of this data download (phenology data)
  - Provides phenology data for all species in the UK at all sites/years with sufficient data.
  - Data delivered as a CSV file.
  - For 13 species, data are available for the entire flight period and, where possible, for two distinct flight periods; for other species, data cover the entire flight season only.
  - Key columns explained: SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
