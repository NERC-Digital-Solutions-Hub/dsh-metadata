# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). It aggregates data from volunteers to monitor butterfly populations.
- It provides annual population status data and supports policy questions on biodiversity status and trends; active since 1976 with data from over 3,000 sites annually.

- Purpose for monitoring authors of frameworks:
  - Establishes a comprehensive, site-based, long-term data source for insect population trends.
  - Demonstrates a multi-method sampling framework to inform data quality, coverage, and comparability.

- Sampling framework (data collection methods):
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year), 5 m wide band, April–September, weather-dependent; >2,000 sites monitored by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August), sampling common habitats like farmland; ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.

- Nature of the data and phenology:
  - Phenology measures timing of adult butterfly flight periods (imago) derived from standard transects; other survey types yield limited phenology data due to reduced effort.
  - Metrics include first/last observation dates, peak date/count, and duration of flight period.
  - Alternative metrics (mean flight date and SD) used to handle incomplete weekly sampling and seasonal constraints.
  - For multivoltine species, data can be split into first and second flight periods; for uni-voltine species (e.g., Brimstone, Peacock), two distinct flight periods may be reported (post-overwintering emergence and summer offspring), where possible.

- Data quality control and governance:
  - Field recording on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS system or Transect Walker; automated checks flag anomalies.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing seasonal validation; automated/manual procedures flag records outside known distribution, flight periods, or with unusual abundances.
  - Corrections are made via queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders.

- Data download details (phenology dataset):
  - Provides phenology data for all species, sites, and years with sufficient data.
  - Delivered as CSV; includes 13 species with full-flight-period data (and separate first/second flights where possible); others include entire flight season only.
  - Key columns include SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
