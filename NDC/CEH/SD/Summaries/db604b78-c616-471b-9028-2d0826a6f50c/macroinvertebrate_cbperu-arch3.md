Declining glacier cover drives changes in the biodiversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru

## Purpose and scope
- Study aims to understand how aquatic biodiversity responds to glacial retreat.
- Focuses on 10 rivers in the Cordillera Blanca, Ancash, Peru, across a gradient of glacier coverage (GCC).
- Data support analysis of macroinvertebrate community responses to changing glacial influence.

## Data files and content
- Two seasonal abundance datasets: Macro_CBPeru_Wet.csv (wet season) and Macro_CBPeru_Dry.csv (dry season).
- Contains macroinvertebrate abundance data for 41 taxa across sampling sites.
- Structure: first column = site; first row = taxa; second column = replication number (1–6; P01 had 5 in dry season).
- Sampling per river: 6 subsamples (5 for P01 in dry season).

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Sampling conducted October 2019 and October 2020.
- At each site, 15-meter section; 6 subsamples from riffles, pools, and bankside habitats; 5 subsamples compiled per site.
- Substrate collected with a 250 μm mesh net; preserved in 96% ethanol.
- In the lab, macroinvertebrates identified to the lowest practical taxonomic level; genus-level for Trichoptera, Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera.
- Most Chironomidae identified to subfamily/morphotype; counts include larvae, nymphs, pupae (and adults for Coleoptera).

## Site-level geographic and environmental metadata
- Ten sites (P01–P10) with detailed geographic variables:
  - Geographical coordinates (UTM 18S), valley name, basin area, glacier area, glacier coverage (% GCC).
  - Distance from glacier, slope, and altitude (m above sea level).
- GCC ranges from 0.00% to 61.61%; data capture a glacier influence gradient.

## Data quality control and validation
- A single collector processed all substrate samples at each site; processing completed within 48 hours.
- Taxonomic identifications corroborated by a subject expert; records verified by two professionals.
- Data structure and labeling standardized across seasons to ensure comparability.

## Data structure details
- Taxa list comprises 41 entries; some genus-level identifications noted (italics).
- Tables include descriptive notes for taxonomy (Sp1–Sp41) and corresponding family/subfamily and order.
- Taxonomic references provided to support identifications (Domínguez & Fernández, 2009; Prat et al., 2011).

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates integration of biodiversity indicators with an environmental gradient (glacial influence) for policy-relevant monitoring.
- Highlights practical data governance needs: metadata richness, data provenance, quality assurance, and transparent sharing.
- Provides a concrete example of preparing open, usable datasets for environmental health assessment and decision-making.

## Limitations and considerations
- Taxonomic resolution varies (some taxa identified only to subfamily or morphotype).
- Sampling effort varied slightly (5 vs 6 subsamples in some cases) requiring consideration in analyses.
- Regional focus; extrapolation to other glacial regions should be done with caution.
