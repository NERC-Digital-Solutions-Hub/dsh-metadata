# Collection, generation methods and quality control

- Area of interest and sampling design
  - Iron Tongue Hill on Swineshaw Moor, area ~0.45 km².
  - Seven erosion plots (~5 × 5 m) established on 26/07/2018 to monitor erosion and vegetation recovery.
  - Context provided by Figure 1 location map.

- Data collection
  - Orthophoto mosaic created from 786 images captured by a DJI Mavic 2 Pro Drone (CAA Operator ID OP-FNVFWNM) on 29 July 2019.

- Data processing and georeferencing
  - Dense SfM point cloud generated in Agisoft Metashape.
  - Ground Control Point coordinates used to scale and georeference the point clouds using field dGPS coordinates.
  - Cleaned DEM dense point cloud and orthomosaic exported as .tif files.

- GIS processing and outputs
  - Tif files imported into ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.5).
  - Orthomosaic projected to OSGB coordinates and resampled to a 5 × 5 cm ground resolution.
  - Final outputs saved as .tif files.

- Purpose and context
  - The image represents a snapshot of surface conditions in late July 2019.
  - Provides spatial context for the seven erosion plots (Figure 1).

- Figure and attribution
  - Figure 1 location map prepared by Jeff Warburton using EDINA Digimap Ordnance Survey Collection, 2021.
