# Collection, generation methods and quality control

- Area and purpose
  - Orthophoto mosaic covering Iron Tongue Hill on Swineshaw Moor; area of interest ~0.45 km².
  - Includes seven erosion plots (~5 x 5 m) set up on 26/07/2018 to capture burnt moorland surface state, erosion, and vegetation recovery.

- Data collection
  - 786 images captured with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro Drone (CAA Operator ID OP-FNVFWNM) on 29 July 2019.

- Data processing and quality control
  - Dense SfM point cloud generated in Agisoft Metashape.
  - Ground Control Points used to scale and georeference based on field dGPS coordinates.
  - Cleaned DEM dense point cloud and orthomosaic exported as .tif files.

- GIS integration and outputs
  - .tif files imported into ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.5).
  - Orthomosaic projected to OSGB coordinates and resampled to 5 x 5 cm ground resolution; saved as final .tif.

- Data provenance and visualization
  - The image provides a snapshot of surface conditions in late July 2019, offering spatial context for the seven erosion plots (Figure 1).
