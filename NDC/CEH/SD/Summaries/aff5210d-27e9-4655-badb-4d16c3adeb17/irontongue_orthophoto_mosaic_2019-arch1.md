# Collection, generation methods and quality control

- Area and scope: Iron Tongue Hill on Swineshaw Moor; area of interest ~0.45 km²; seven erosion plots (~5 × 5 m) set up on 26/07/2018 to monitor burnt moorland surface, erosion, and vegetation recovery.
- Imagery collected: a single orthophoto mosaic created from 786 images captured with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone (CAA Operator ID OP-FNVFWNM) on 29 July 2019.
- 3D data generation: dense SfM point cloud produced in Agisoft Metashape; Ground Control Point coordinates used to scale and georeference the point clouds based on field dGPS coordinates.
- Outputs produced: cleaned DEM dense point cloud and orthomosaic exported as TIFF files.
- GIS processing: TIFFs imported into ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.5); orthomosaic projected to OSGB coordinates and resampled to a 5 × 5 cm ground resolution; final results saved as TIFF.
- Snapshot context: the orthophoto mosaic provides a snapshot of surface conditions in late July 2019 and supplies spatial context for the seven erosion plots (Figure 1).
