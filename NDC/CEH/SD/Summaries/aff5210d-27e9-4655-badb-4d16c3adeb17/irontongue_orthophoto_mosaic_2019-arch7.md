# Collection, generation methods and quality control

## Overview
- Area: Iron Tongue Hill on Swineshaw Moor, ≈0.45 km².
- Area of interest includes seven erosion plots (~5 × 5 m) set up on 26/07/2018 to monitor erosion and vegetation recovery.
- Output: a single orthophoto mosaic representing surface conditions in late July 2019, providing spatial context for the seven erosion plots (Figure 1).

## Data collection
- Imagery: 786 separate images captured with a DJI Mavic 2 Pro drone (CAA Operator ID OP-FNVFWNM) on 29 July 2019.
- Purpose: capture surface state for erosion and vegetation monitoring.

## Processing workflow
- 3D generation: dense SfM point cloud created in Agisoft Metashape.
- Georeferencing: Ground Control Point coordinates used to scale and georeference point clouds based on field dGPS coordinates.
- Outputs: cleaned dense DEM point cloud and orthomosaic exported as TIFF files.

## Spatial processing and projection
- Software: TIFFs imported into ArcGIS (ArcMap 10.5).
- Projection and resampling: orthomosaic projected to OSGB coordinates and resampled to a 5 × 5 cm ground resolution.
- Final product: orthomosaic saved as a TIFF.

## Data scope and context
- The image serves as a snapshot of surface conditions in late July 2019.
- Provides spatial context for the seven erosion plots shown in Figure 1.
