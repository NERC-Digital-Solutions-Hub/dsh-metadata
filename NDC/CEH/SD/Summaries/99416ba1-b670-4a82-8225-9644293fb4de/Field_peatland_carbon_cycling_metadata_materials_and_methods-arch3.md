# Dataset title, 1 = Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK.

## Overview
- Field-based investigation of spatio-temporal variability in abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
- Conducted at Black Law Wind Farm, Scotland, within blanket bog habitat.
- Aims to support understanding of peatland carbon dynamics, including carbon pools, fluxes, and microbial processes.

## Study Design and Site
- Location: Black Law Wind Farm (55°46′01″N, 03°44′20″W), blanket bog with components of grassland and plantation forestry.
- Size and layout: 18.6 km2 area; four sites (A–D) along a SW–NE transect; within each site, four blocks dominated by one plant functional type (PFT), total n = 48 plots.
- Plot and sampling setup: Wooden sampling platforms to minimize disturbance; within each plot a 400 cm2 quadrat for peat, litter, and vegetation sampling; litter depth measured repeatedly; 12 plots per site, 48 total.

## Measured Variables and Data Types
- Plant–soil properties: total carbon (C) content, total nitrogen (N) content, C:N ratio for vegetation, litter, and peat; C and N stocks for litter and surface 15 cm of peat; bulk density; soil moisture; pH; soil microbial community composition (via PLFAs).
- Peatland carbon cycling: litter decomposition (% initial mass remaining); dissolved organic carbon concentration ([DOC]); methane fluxes; net ecosystem exchange (NEE); photosynthesis (Pcal); ecosystem respiration.
- Physical environment: belowground temperature (5 cm depth); soil moisture content.
- Microbial community indicators: PLFA-based markers for bacteria (Gram+ and Gram−), fungi; F:B (fungal to bacterial) ratio; Gram+ to Gram− ratio.

## Methods and Laboratory Analyses
- Plant–soil sampling: peat, litter, and vegetation collected from each 400 cm2 quadrat; litter depth and composition recorded; peat cores (5 cm diameter, 15 cm depth) extracted.
- Chemical analyses: total C and N via LECO CN Analyser; calibration with EDTA standards; peat pH measured with a 1:2.5 peat-to-water ratio using a pH meter; bulk density derived from peat cores.
- Microbial analyses: 192 peat cores for microbial community composition; PLFA extraction and quantification via GC; standards and internal controls employed to quantify PLFAs and assign microbial groups.
- Litter decomposition experiments: 144 litter bags (0.50 g air-dried litter per bag) representing each PFT; mesh 1 mm to permit decomposer access; bags buried under litter layer and retrieved after 386 days; mass loss calculated as percentage of initial dry mass.

## Gas Fluxes, Pore Water, and Related Measurements
- Annual field campaign (May 2011–May 2012) to monitor GHG fluxes and pore water [DOC] at all 48 plots.
- Gas measurements: CO2 and CH4 fluxes using static chambers; CH4 analyzed via laboratory GC; flux calculations per established methods; photosynthesis estimated as Pcal = NEE − Respiration; extreme CH4 fluxes (ebullition) filtered using thresholds (2–11.5 mg m−2 hr CH4) to focus on non-ebullition fluxes.
- Pore water: samples from 0–15 cm depth collected via dip wells, stored at 4°C, filtered to 0.7 μm, analyzed for [DOC] with Thermalox Total C analyzer; calibration with standard solutions.
- Temperature and moisture monitoring: peat temperature logged every 30 minutes from four sites (April 2011–June 2012) at 5 cm depth; soil moisture logged every 30 minutes at multiple blocks/sites using Campbell loggers and CS sensors.

## Data Quality and Standards
- Use of established protocols and literature references for all measurements (CN analyses, PLFA methods, litter decomposition, GHG flux calculations, and pore-water analyses).
- Calibration and quality control procedures described (e.g., external standards for PLFA quantification; routine instrument calibration against standards).
- Clear documentation of sampling design to capture spatial and temporal variability and to enable reproducibility.
