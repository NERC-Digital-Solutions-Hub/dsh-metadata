# Dataset title, 1 = Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK..

## Overview
- Field-based investigation of spatio-temporal variability in abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
- Location: Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland; blanket bog peatland with grassland and plantation forestry.
- Timeframe: Data collected February 2011 to April 2013.
- Scope: 48 plots across four sites (A–D) along a SW–NE transect; vegetation dominated by Sphagnum spp., Calluna vulgaris, and Eriophorum vaginatum; replication and site-level variability captured through multiple plant functional types (PFTs) and blocks.
- Data types span plant–soil properties, microbial community structure, decomposition, greenhouse gas fluxes, and physical soil parameters.

## Study design and scope
- Four sites along a transect, with multiple blocks and PFT-dominated plots to capture spatial variability.
- 48 plots in total (12 per site; across 4 sites).
- Within-plot sampling included litter, vegetation, and peat cores for comprehensive carbon and nutrient assessments.
- Litter bags deployed to assess decomposition over approximately a one-year period.

## Data types and indicators
- Plant–soil properties:
  - Total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) contents; C:N ratios for vegetation, litter, and peat.
  - C and N stocks for litter and surface peat (0–15 cm); bulk density; soil moisture; pH.
  - Peat microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs).
- Peatland carbon cycling indicators:
  - Litter decomposition (percent initial mass remaining).
  - Dissolved organic carbon [DOC] in pore water.
  - Methane (CH4) fluxes; net ecosystem exchange (NEE); photosynthesis (Pcal); ecosystem respiration.
  - Belowground temperature (to 5 cm depth) and soil moisture data.
- Data captured across abiotic and biotic controls to link environmental conditions with carbon cycling.

## Methods and instruments
- Site and sampling:
  - Four sites (A–D) with 12 plots per site; 400 cm2 quadrats for litter and vegetation sampling; peat cores (5 cm diameter, 15 cm depth).
  - Litter and vegetation sampled for C, N, and moisture; decomposition studied via litter bags (0.50 g air-dried litter per bag; 5 mm bags; 1 mm mesh).
- Laboratory analyses:
  - Carbon and nitrogen: LECO Truspec CN Analyzer; EDTA standards for calibration.
  - pH: Hanna 211 pH meter; deionised water extraction (1:2.5 ratio).
  - Bulk density: peat cores dried at 105°C; used with C and N contents to compute g m-2.
- Microbial community:
  - Microbial biomarkers: phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) from 0.5 g peat sub-samples; extraction following established Bligh–Dyer-based methods.
  - PLFA quantification via GC-FID with external and internal standards; identification aided by GC–MS and retention times.
  - Group inferences: gram-positive vs. gram-negative bacteria; saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal fungi; fungi-to-bacteria (F:B) ratios.
- Decomposition experiments:
  - Litter from each PFT collected in Oct 2012; air-dried; moisture content and dry mass determined.
  - Litter bags deployed Mar 2012; retrieved Apr 2013; mass loss calculated as percent of initial dry mass.
- Greenhouse gas and pore-water measurements:
  - CH4 and CO2 fluxes measured with static chambers; collars installed 6 weeks prior.
  - CH4 analyzed by GC; CO2 and CH4 fluxes expressed as mg CO2-C or CH4-C m-2 h-1.
  - Pore-water DOC analyzed with Thermalox Total C analyzer; samples filtered and measured with calibration standards.
- Temperature and moisture monitoring:
  - Temperature loggers for peat at 5 cm depth; data from Apr 2011–Jun 2012.
  - Soil moisture monitored at multiple blocks/sites from May 2011–Apr 2013 using Campbell loggers and soil moisture probes.

## Sampling framework and timeline
- Plot and sampling design designed to capture spatial and temporal variability:
  - 48 plots across four sites; diverse PFT dominance within and among sites.
  - Repeated measurements across a year-long field campaign for GHG fluxes and pore-water DOC.
  - Additional 192 peat cores collected in 2011 to profile seasonal and spatial microbial community variation (PLFAs).
- Physical and chemical parameters sampled repeatedly for temporal context (temperature, moisture, pH, bulk density).

## Data processing and outputs
- Derived metrics include:
  - Stock calculations: surface peat (0–15 cm) C and N stocks; litter C and N stocks.
  - Decomposition: percent mass remaining for each litter type (PFT-based).
  - Microbial indicators: PLFA-based bacterial and fungal abundance and community structure; F:B and gram-positive to gram-negative ratios.
  - GHG fluxes: ecosystem respiration, NEE, and CH4 fluxes (non-ebullition fluxes applied with thresholds to exclude ebullition and measurement error).
  - Pore-water DOC concentrations over time.
- Quality and calibration:
  - Calibrations against EDTA standards; external standards for PLFA analysis; instrument-specific calibration checks (e.g., retention-time alignment, drift corrections).
  - Reference methodologies cited for data processing, including well-established procedures for litter decay and CH4 flux adjustments.

## Access, use and stewardship
- Data collected under standardized monitoring protocols suitable for time-series analysis.
- Outputs described in a format compatible with integration into monitoring portals and data portals used by environmental agencies and research institutions.
- Emphasis on producing data that can be reused, cross-referenced, and combined with other peatland datasets for enhanced environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides a comprehensive, multi-parameter dataset on peatland carbon cycling under a wind-farm–peatland context.
- Enables assessment of how abiotic (temperature, moisture, pH) and biotic (plant functional types, microbial communities) factors drive carbon fluxes, storage, and ecosystem processes over time.
- Supports standardised, transparent reporting and potential integration with broader environmental health indicators to evaluate policy performance and ecosystem health over temporal scales.
