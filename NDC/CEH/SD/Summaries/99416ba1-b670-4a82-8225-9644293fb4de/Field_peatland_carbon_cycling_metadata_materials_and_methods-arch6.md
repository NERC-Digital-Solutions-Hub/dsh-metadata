# Dataset title, 1 = Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK..

## Overview
- A field-based investigation into the spatio-temporal variability of abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling at Black Law Wind Farm, Scotland.
- Timeframe: data collected between Feb 2011 and Apr 2013; includes a year-long campaign (May 2011–May 2012) for GHG fluxes and pore water DOC, plus extended measurements for litter decomposition and microbial analyses.
- Location: blanket bog peatland within Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland (55°46′01″N, 03°44′20″W; altitude 250–320 m).
- Data scope: plant–soil properties, peat carbon cycling metrics, physical parameters, microbial community structure, litter decomposition, GHG fluxes, and pore-water DOC across 48 plots (4 sites A–D; 12 plots per site; 4 plant functional types).

## Study design and sampling framework
- Sites and plots:
  - Four sites (A–D) along a SW–NE transect spanning the 18.6 km2 wind farm.
  - 48 plots in total (12 plots per site), within which four blocks per site are dominated by one of three plant functional types (PFTs) to capture variability.
  - Dominant PFTs: Sphagnum spp. (moss), Calluna vulgaris (shrubs), Eriophorum vaginatum (sedges).
- Within-plot sampling:
  - Within each 400 cm2 quadrat: litter collection (for litter quality and decomposition), vegetation samples, and a peat core (5 cm diameter, 15 cm depth).
  - Litter and peat samples processed for total C and N contents; bulk density; moisture; pH; and other soil properties.
- Temporal scope:
  - GHG fluxes measured over a year across all 48 plots using static chambers.
  - Peat temperature (5 cm depth) and soil moisture logged at blocks/sites throughout the study period.
  - Litter decomposition experiment conducted from March 2012 with litter bags deployed under the litter layer and retrieved after ~386 days (April 2013).

## Data collected and key variables
- Plant–soil properties (per plot/layer):
  - Total carbon (C) content (%), total nitrogen (N) content (%), C:N of vegetation, litter, and peat.
  - C stock and N stock for litter and peat (g C or N m-2) to the litter surface or 15 cm depth.
  - Dry bulk density (g cm-3), soil moisture (%), pH.
  - Peat microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs; µg g-1 dry soil).
- Peatland carbon cycling metrics:
  - Litter decomposition (% initial mass remaining) from litter bags.
  - Dissolved organic carbon ([DOC], mg L-1) in pore water.
  - Methane (CH4) fluxes and net ecosystem exchange (NEE; mg CO2-C m-2 hr-1; CH4-C m-2 hr-1).
  - Ecosystem respiration (Reco) and photosynthesis (Pcal) derived from NEE and Reco.
- Physical parameters:
  - Belowground temperature (0–5 cm depth) and soil moisture content (profile across 0–15 cm) with near-continuous logging.
- Microbial community structure:
  - PLFA profiles identifying bacterial and fungal groups; Fungi:Bacteria (F:B) ratio; Gram-positive to Gram-negative bacterial PLFA ratio.
  - 23 identified PLFAs mapped to microbial groups; total PLFA concentration calculated from identified markers.
- Litter quality and decomposition:
  - Litter from each PFT (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum vaginatum, Sphagnum spp.) used to assess decomposition rates.
  - Litter bags prepared (0.50 g air-dried litter per bag; 5 mm × 5 mm bags; 1 mm mesh) to enable access by decomposers.
  - Mass loss converted to percentage of initial dry mass.
- Methods and instruments:
  - Chemical analyses: LECO Truspec CN Analyzer; Hanna pH meter; Total C analyzer.
  - Gas analyses: Agilent GC with FID for CH4; EGM-4 portable infrared gas analyzer for CO2 and respiration measurements.
  - Microbial/PLFA analyses: Bligh and Dyer lipid extraction; GC-FID; GC-MS for PLFA identification; internal standards and calibration discussed.
  - Temperature and moisture logging: Onset Hobo Pendant loggers; Campbell CR1000/CR200 with CS616/CS625s probes.
  - Pore-water processing: dip wells; filtration to 0.7 µm; triplicate DOC analyses with Thermalox Total C analyzer.
- Data processing notes:
  - Calibration against EDTA standards; daily internal standards to ensure instrument performance; ebullition events excluded from CH4 fluxes using predefined thresholds (to avoid measurement artifacts).

## Site metadata and sampling design details
- Spatial layout:
  - Four sites with similar blanket bog characteristics; clusters of plots arranged to capture microtopography and PFT variability.
- Sampling protocol:
  - Quadrats (~400 cm2) used for collecting litter, peat, and vegetation samples.
  - Peat cores collected for C and N stock calculations; dry bulk density derived from peat cores dried at 105°C.
  - A priori burial of 300 mm diameter collars to standardize GHG chamber measurements, with careful sealing to minimize edge leaks.
- Litter decomposition specifics:
  - Litter from each PFT deployed in litter bags under the litter layer; retrieval after approximately one year.
  - Litter quality considerations for Sphagnum decomposition addressed via selective stem section sampling beneath capitulum to represent freshly deposited litter.

## Data quality, normalization, and exclusions
- Quality control:
  - Regular instrument calibration with standards; use of internal and external standards for PLFA quantification.
  - Threshold-based exclusion of extreme CH4 fluxes to mitigate measurement error or ebullition artifacts.
- Data integration:
  - Units standardized (C, N contents, C and N stocks; mg L-1 DOC; mg CO2-C m-2 hr-1; mg CH4-C m-2 hr-1) to support cross-variable analyses.
  - Temporal alignment across measurements (2011–2013 for core variables; May 2011–May 2012 for GHG fluxes).

## Data outputs and potential applications
- Data products likely to include:
  - Time-series of GHG fluxes (CO2, CH4), NEE, respiration, and photosynthesis across plots and sites.
  - Spatial comparisons of C and N stocks in peat, litter, and vegetation, plus bulk density and moisture differences.
  - Microbial community structure indicators (F:B ratio, gram+ vs gram− proportions) correlated with carbon cycling metrics.
  - Litter decomposition rates by PFT and environmental context (temperature, moisture, microbial composition).
  - Pore-water DOC dynamics and their relation to GHG fluxes and decomposition.
- Potential uses for data support:
  - Creating self-serve dashboards or pivot-table based data products for stakeholders.
  - Supporting data-driven insights into drivers of peatland carbon cycling under wind farm land-use.
  - Facilitating data combining with other peatland or GHG datasets to model carbon budgets and microbial mediation of carbon dynamics.
