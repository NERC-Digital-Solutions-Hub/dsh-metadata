# Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK

## Overview
- Multi-year field study (Feb 2011 – Apr 2013) at Black Law Wind Farm, Scotland, to characterise spatio-temporal variability in peatland carbon cycling.
- Data collected across 48 plots (4 sites A–D; 12 blocks per site) representing three plant functional types (PFTs): mosses, sedges, and shrubs.
- Datasets cover: plant–soil properties, peat carbon and nitrogen stocks, microbial community composition, litter decomposition, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), methane fluxes, net ecosystem exchange (NEE), photosynthesis, ecosystem respiration, belowground temperature, and soil moisture.

## Study site and sampling design
- Location: blanket bog peatland within an 18.6 km² area at Black Law Wind Farm (Lanarkshire, Scotland; approximate coordinates around 55°46′01″N, 03°44′20″W; altitude 250–320 m).
- Four sites along a SW–NE transect (A–D); within each site, four blocks dominated by one of three PFTs; total plots = 48.
- Sampling within each plot: 400 cm² quadrat; collection of litter, vegetation, and a peat core (5 cm diameter, 15 cm depth).
- Litter bags: 0.50 g air-dried litter per bag; mesh 1 mm; deployed March 2012 and retrieved April 2013 (386 days).
- Litter and peat samples analyzed for total C and N, C and N stocks (g C or N m⁻²), bulk density, moisture, and pH.
- Additional 192 peat cores for seasonal microbial PLFA analysis (Feb, Apr, Jul, Oct 2011).

## Data types and key variables
- Plant–soil properties: total C and N; C:N of peat, litter, and vegetation; C and N stocks for surface 15 cm; bulk density; soil moisture; pH; microbial community composition (PLFAs).
- Microbial metrics: PLFA-based indicators for bacteria (gram-positive and gram-negative), fungi (saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal); total PLFA; fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) ratio; gram-positive to gram-negative bacteria ratio.
- Peatland carbon cycling: litter decomposition (% of initial mass remaining); DOC concentration (mg L⁻¹); CH₄ fluxes; net ecosystem exchange (NEE); photosynthesis (Cal); ecosystem respiration.
- Physical parameters: belowground temperature (5 cm depth) and soil moisture logged across blocks/sites (temperature data 2011–2012; soil moisture 2011–2013).

## Measurements, instruments, and methods
- Laboratory/in-field instruments: LECO Truspec CN Analyser; Hanna pH meter; Agilent 6890N GC with FID; EGM-4 portable IR gas analyser; Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL GC; Thermalox Total C analyser; Onset Hobo temperature loggers; Campbell loggers (CR1000/CR200) with soil moisture probes (CS616/CS625s).
- PLFA analysis: microbial community profiling from peat samples (Bligh and Dyer extraction; GC for PLFAs; identification aided by GC-MS and internal standards).
- Litter decomposition: 0.5 g air-dried litter per bag; 5 mm × 5 mm bags; 1 mm mesh; 386-day incubations; mass loss used to calculate % initial dry mass remaining.
- GHG fluxes: static chamber method; collars installed 6 weeks prior; CO₂ fluxes via infrared gas analyser; CH₄ via laboratory GC; fluxes expressed as mg CO₂-C or CH₄-C m⁻² h⁻¹; outlier ebullition events excluded using predefined thresholds.
- Pore-water DOC: collected from surface to 15 cm depth via dip wells; filtered to 0.7 µm; analyzed with Thermalox Total C analyser; calibration with potassium phthalate standards.
- Temporal coverage of measurements: temperature logged Apr 2011–Jun 2012; soil moisture May 2011–Apr 2013; GHG fluxes May 2011–May 2012 (year-long campaign).

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Temporal: 2011–2013 for most measurements; continuous sub-sampling and weekly-to-monthly measurements for some parameters (temperature, moisture, fluxes).
- Spatial: 4 sites, 48 plots across a blanket bog within Black Law Wind Farm; plots arranged to capture variation in peat depth, microtopography, and PFT dominance.

## Data quality, metadata, and documentation
- Detailed methodological descriptions for sampling, laboratory analyses, and data processing to support reproducibility.
- Use of standard reference methods (e.g., PLFA biomarkers; established litter decomposition protocols) with calibration standards and quality checks.
- Clear documentation of units, sample sizes, and replication (e.g., 48 plots, seasonal PLFA sampling, 386-day litter bag deployment) to aid data integration and interpretation.

## Implications and potential uses for data leaders
- Enables system-level assessment of peatland carbon dynamics, including carbon inputs (litter, C stocks) and outputs (NEE, CO₂, CH₄ fluxes) under a wind-farm peatland context.
- Supports cross-site comparisons of microbial community structure and its relationship to carbon cycling and decomposition rates.
- Provides rich, multi-dimensional metadata suitable for data governance, discoverability, and reuse in peatland and ecosystem carbon-budget studies.
- Demonstrates robust data management practices: standardized measurements, explicit units, replication, and transparent methodological references.

## Considerations for data governance and integration
- Rich in metadata and standardized protocols; suitable for integration with other peatland datasets to create regional or global C-cycle syntheses.
- Data granularity includes plot-level, PFT-level, and temporal sequences, facilitating scale-aware analyses and data products for policy and strategy discussions on land-use and ecosystem services.
