# Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK

- Overview
  - Field-based investigation of spatio-temporal variability in abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
  - Data collected 2011–2013 at Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland (blanket bog peatland).
  - Four sites (A–D) along a SW to NE transect, 12 plots per site (total 48 plots), with four blocks per site dominated by plant functional types (PFTs).
  - Comprehensive suite of measurements spanning plant–soil properties, peat carbon cycling, microbial community composition, litter decomposition, GHG fluxes, and physical site conditions.

- Data and variables
  - Plant–soil properties
    - Total carbon content (%), total nitrogen content (%), C:N ratio (of vegetation, litter, and peat)
    - Carbon stock and nitrogen stock for litter and peat (g C m-2 and g N m-2)
    - Dry bulk density (g m-3), soil moisture (%), pH
    - Soil microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) expressed as µg g-1 dry soil
    - PLFA-based microbial indicators (bacteria, fungi, and ratios such as F:B; Gram+ vs Gram−)
  - Peatland carbon cycling
    - Litter decomposition (% initial litter mass remaining)
    - Dissolved organic carbon concentration [DOC] (mg L−1)
    - Methane fluxes (CH4 flux; mg CH4-C m−2 h−1)
    - Net ecosystem exchange (NEE; CO2-C m−2 h−1) and ecosystem respiration (Reco)
    - Photosynthesis proxy (Pcal) derived from NEE and Reco
  - Physical and temporal parameters
    - Belowground temperature (5 cm depth; °C)
    - Soil moisture content (%, surface measurements)
    - Temporal coverage includes multi-site, multi-year (2011–2013) measurements and a year-long GHG campaign (May 2011–April 2012)
  - Litter decomposition experiment
    - Litter from each PFT placed in litter bags (0.50 g air-dried litter per bag; 1 mm mesh; 5 mm x 5 mm bags)
    - 386-day exposure (Mar 2012–Apr 2013); litter decomposition expressed as % initial dry mass remaining
  - Pore-water chemistry
    - Pore water DOC collected from 0–15 cm depth; analyzed within two months
    - Analysis by Thermalox Total C analyser; calibration with potassium phthalate standards
  - Sampling design data
    - Plot and site metadata (A–D sites, 48 plots total, blocks per site)
    - Dominant PFTs at each plot (Sphagnum spp., Eriophorum vaginatum, Calluna vulgaris)
    - Field sampling dates and depths (peat cores to 15 cm, 5 cm soil depth, quadrat area of 400 cm2)

- Methods and instruments
  - Chemical and soil analyses
    - Carbon and nitrogen: LECO Truspec CN Analyser; furnace temp ~950 °C; EDTA standards for calibration
    - pH: Hanna 211 pH meter; ratio 1:2.5 peat to deionised water
  - Gas and flux measurements
    - CH4 and CO2 fluxes via static chambers; CO2 measured with EGM-4 portable IR gas analyser; CH4 analysed in lab with Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL GC
    - Flux calculations following Levy et al. (2012); extreme CH4 fluxes excluded to remove ebullition or measurement artifacts
  - Microbial and PLFA analyses
    - PLFA extraction from peat samples (Bligh and Dyer method; modified as per Frostegård et al. procedures)
    - PLFA quantification by GC-FID; identification via GC-MS; internal standard used for calibration
    - Assignment of PLFAs to microbial groups (bacteria vs fungi; gram+ vs gram−)
  - Litter decomposition protocol
    - Litter bags prepared with 0.50 g air-dried litter; 1 mm mesh; placed under litter layer; retrieved after 386 days
    - Litter moisture and dry weight used to determine mass loss
  - Temperature and moisture monitoring
    - Peat temperature: 5 cm depth; loggers installed at blocks across sites; data loggers record every 30 min
    - Soil moisture: probes at multiple blocks/sites; data logging at 30-minute intervals
  - Site and sampling logistics
    - Four sites A–D; plots arranged in a transect; eight plots per site sampled in February 2011; a wooden sampling platform used to minimize disturbance
    - 400 cm2 quadrats per plot for peat, litter, and vegetation sampling; cores collected for C and N analyses

- Data management, quality assurance, and sharing
  - Documentation and provenance
    - Detailed methodological descriptions, calibration procedures, and standards referenced (e.g., EDTA standards for CN, internal PLFA standards, GC-MS validation)
    - Clear recording of site coordinates, altitude, and plot-level data to enable traceability
  - Quality assurance
    - Regular calibration against standards (e.g., EDTA standards every ~20 samples for CN)
    - PLFA identifications cross-validated with GC-MS; use of internal standards for quantification
    - CH4 flux screening to exclude ebullition events and measurement artifacts using predefined thresholds
  - Data structure and integration
    - Multiple data streams (plant–soil properties, PLFA/Microbial, litter decomposition, GHG fluxes, pore-water DOC, temperature, soil moisture)
    - Spatially explicit design (site, plot, block, PFT) with temporal coverage across months/years
  - Sharing considerations
    - Aimed at uploading to relevant portals and cataloguing in data holdings; requires comprehensive metadata (methods, units, dates, locations, QC procedures) for interoperability
    - No explicit embargo or access restrictions stated in the provided text; dataset is designed for discoverability and reuse by others

- Practical considerations for Data Stewards
  - Metadata to capture
    - Dataset title, description, study location (Black Law Wind Farm), coordinates, altitude
    - Study design (A–D sites, 12 plots per site; 48 plots total; PFT blocks)
    - Variables and units (C %, N %, C:N, C and N stocks m-2, bulk density, moisture %, pH, PLFA µg g-1, DOC mg L−1, CH4-CH4-C m−2 h−1, NEE CO2-C m−2 h−1, Reco, Pcal)
    - Sampling dates, durations, depths, core sizes, quadrat areas, litter bag specs, and mesh sizes
    - Instruments and methods with version or model details and calibration procedures
    - QA/QC steps (e.g., CN calibration, CH4 flux thresholds, PLFA standardization)
  - Data integration and interoperability
    - Ensure consistent plot and site identifiers across data streams
    - Standardize units and clearly document any deviations or data processing steps
  - User needs and governance
    - Recognize the dataset’s multi-disciplinary use (ecology, biogeochemistry, microbial ecology) and provide user-focused metadata (dataset-level and variable-level) to support discovery and reuse
    - Align with data governance practices for large environmental datasets, addressing data availability, update cycles, and any potential proprietary or access considerations

- Endnotes
  - The dataset comprises rich, multi-modal measurements from a replicated peatland field study, with extensive QA/QC and provenance documentation embedded in the methods and references. It is well-suited for integration into data portals with robust metadata to support discoverability, reuse, and cross-study synthesis.
