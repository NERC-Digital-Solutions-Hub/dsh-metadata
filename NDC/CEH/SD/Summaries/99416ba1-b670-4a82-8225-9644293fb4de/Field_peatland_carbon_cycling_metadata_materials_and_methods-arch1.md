# Field measurements of peatland carbon cycling at a wind farm hosting peatland in Scotland, UK.

## Overview
- Field-based investigation of the spatio-temporal variability of abiotic and biotic controls on peatland carbon cycling.
- Data collected 2011–2013 across a blanket bog peatland at Black Law Wind Farm, Scotland.
- Includes plant–soil properties, peat carbon and nitrogen stocks, microbial community composition, litter decomposition, GHG fluxes, dissolved organic carbon, temperature, and soil moisture.

## Study Site and Design
- Location: Black Law Wind Farm, Lanarkshire, Scotland (55°46′01″N, 03°44′20″W; altitude 250–320 m).
- Wind farm area: 18.6 km² including blanket bog, grassland, and forestry.
- Plot layout: Four sites (A–D) along a SW–NE transect; within each site four blocks dominated by one of three plant functional types (PFTs) – total n = 48 plots.
- Plot setup: Wooden sampling platforms to minimise disturbance; sampling within 400 cm² quadrats per plot.
- Dominant PFTs observed: Sphagnum spp. (moss), Eriophorum vaginatum (sedge), Calluna vulgaris (shrubs).

## Data Collected and Variables

### Plant–Soil Properties
- Total carbon (C) and total nitrogen (N) contents (%), and C:N ratios for vegetation, litter, and peat.
- C and N stocks for litter and peat (g C or N m⁻²) to 15 cm depth (surface peat layer) and litter depth measurements.
- Dry bulk density (g m⁻³), soil moisture content (%), and pH (peat).
- Microbial community composition via phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) expressed as µg g⁻¹ dry soil.

### Peatland Carbon Cycling Data
- Litter decomposition measured as % initial litter mass remaining (using litter bags).
- Dissolved organic carbon ([DOC]) in pore water (mg L⁻¹).
- Methane (CH₄) fluxes and net ecosystem exchange (NEE); photosynthesis (Pcal) and ecosystem respiration (Reco) derived from NEE (Pcal = NEE − Rexo).
- Flux units: CO₂-C and CH₄-C m⁻² h⁻¹; NEE sign convention described (positive = source to atmosphere for NEE).

### Physical Parameters
- Belowground temperature to 5 cm depth (Apr 2011–Jun 2012).
- Soil moisture content (May 2011–Apr 2013).
- Temperature loggers and moisture probes deployed across sites and blocks with 30-minute logging intervals.

### Microbial Community Data (PLFAs)
- 23 identified PLFAs used to assign microbial groups:
  - Bacteria: Gram-positive (gram+ve) and Gram-negative (gram−ve) markers (e.g., i15:0, a15:0, i16:0, i17:0, a17:0 for gram+; 16:1ω7t, cy17:0, 18:1ω7, cy19:0 for gram−).
  - Fungi: Saprotrophic and ectomycorrhizal (e.g., 18:1ω6, 18:2ω6,9).
- Metrics include total PLFA concentration, fungal-to-bacterial ratio (F:B), and Gram-positive to Gram-negative ratio.

### Litter Decomposition
- Litter bags (0.50 g air-dried litter per bag) placed beneath the litter layer in March 2012 (n = 144 bags across PFTs).
- Retrieval after 386 days (April 2013) with determination of mass loss to express decomposition (% initial dry mass).

### Greenhouse Gas Fluxes and Pore Water
- Year-long campaign (May 2011–April 2012) across 48 plots to monitor CO₂ and CH₄ fluxes using static chambers.
- 300 mm diameter collars installed at the litter–peat interface prior to measurements.
- Flux calculations converted to mg CO₂-C or CH₄-C m⁻² h⁻¹; extreme CH₄ fluxes (ebullition) excluded using established thresholds.
- Pore water samples (peat surface to 15 cm) collected from dip wells, stored at 4 °C, filtered to 0.7 μm, and analyzed for [DOC] within two months using a Thermalox Total C analyser with calibration standards.

## Instruments and Methods

- Gas and C/N analyses:
  - LECO Truspec CN Analyser; furnace at 950 °C for C and N.
  - pH measurements with Hanna 211 pH meter.
  - Gas analysis: Agilent 6890N GC with flame ionisation detector; Perkin Elmer Autosystem XL GC for CH₄; calibration against standards.
- PLFA analysis:
  - Extraction based on Bligh and Dyer method; GC-FID with external/internal standards; identification via GC-MS and retention-time comparison.
- Litter and soil sampling:
  - 5 cm diameter peat cores, 15 cm depth; quadrat sampling (400 cm²); litter and vegetation collected per PFT.
  - Litter bag preparation to allow decomposer access (1 mm mesh).
- Temperature and moisture:
  - Onset HOBO loggers for peat temperature at 5 cm depth.
  - Campbell CR1000/CR200 loggers with CS616/CS625 sensors for soil moisture.

## Temporal Coverage
- Field sampling: February 2011 to April 2013 (baseline soil/peat sampling, litter, litter bags, PLFA cores).
- GHG and pore water measurements: May 2011 to April 2012 (with ongoing temperature/moisture monitoring through June 2012 and April 2013 respectively for some variables).

## Data Quality and Processing Notes
- CH₄ fluxes filtered to remove extreme values attributed to measurement error or ebullition; non-ebullition CH₄ fluxes used for analyses.
- Consistent calibration standards and blanks used for PLFA and gas analyses; external standards employed for PLFA quantification.
- Data collection designed to capture spatial (A–D sites) and temporal (seasonal/year-long) variability across 48 plots and 12 blocks per site.

## References and Context
- Methods and analyses implemented follow established peatland and microbial ecology protocols (cited in the dataset description), enabling correlations between plant–soil properties, microbial community structure, litter decomposition, and C cycling fluxes.
