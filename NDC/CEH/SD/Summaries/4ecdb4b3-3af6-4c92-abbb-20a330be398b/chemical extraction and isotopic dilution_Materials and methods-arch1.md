# Soils

- Four UK soils were sampled at 0–20 cm depth: Kegworth, Chat Moss, Clough Wood, and a sewage processing farm.
- Each site has a documented metal contamination history (road traffic, 19th century urban waste, Pb/Zn mine spoil, digested sewage sludge).
- Samples were air-dried, sieved to <2 mm; pH measured in soil-water suspensions; loss on ignition used as an estimate of soil organic matter.

## Chemical extractions

- Measured metals: Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb (reported as MExt mg/kg).
- Extractants used: 0.43 M HNO3, 0.43 M CH3COOH, 1 M CaCl2, and 0.05 M Na2H2EDTA.
- Procedure: three replicates per soil in each extractant; suspensions centrifuged at 2200 g for 15 min; supernatants filtered to <0.22 µm; CaCl2 extracts acidified to 2% HNO3; samples stored at 4°C before analysis.
- Total soil metal concentration (MTotal) determined by agate ball-milling of <2 mm soil, digested with HNO3, HClO4, and HF.

## Isotopic dilution assay

- Enriched stable isotopes used: 62Ni, 65Cu, 70Zn, 108Cd, 204Pb with specified isotopic abundances.
- Prepared bespoke mixed-isotope spikes for each soil–extractant combination; spike volumes designed to raise spike isotope abundance by ~20%.
- Experimental design: six replicate soil samples (~1 g) suspended in 30 mL 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2, shaken for 72 h; three replicates spiked with mixed-isotope solution and shaken for an additional 72 h.
- Parallel preparations for each extractant (HNO3, CaCl2, CH3COOH, Na2H2EDTA) with identical spike protocol.
- After incubation, suspensions centrifuged and supernatants filtered; neutral salt solutions acidified to 2% HNO3 prior to isotopic abundance analysis by ICP-MS.

## Multi-element analysis and determination of isotopic abundances by ICP-MS

- Metal concentrations measured by quadrupole ICP-MS (X-Series II) with collision cell technology (CCT-KED) to reduce interferences.
- Internal standards: Sc, Ge, Rh, Ir; external calibration with multi-element standards.
- Isotope ratios measured: 62Ni/60Ni, 65Cu/63Cu, 70Zn/66Zn, 108Cd/111Cd, 204Pb/208Pb, 206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/208Pb.
- Interference management: CCT-KED mode; corrected for 35Cl-35Cl interference on 70Zn; 204Hg correction via 202Hg.
- Instrument mode adjustments as needed to keep detectors in optimal counting mode; mass discrimination corrections based on standards (NIST SRM-981 for Pb) run every ~20 samples.

## Calculation of E value and E Ext

- E value (exchangeable metal in soil, in 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2) and E Ext (exchangeable metal in each extractant) derived from isotopic abundances.
- Calculations use measured spike and reference isotopes from three solutions: spike, spiked soil–solution, and unspiked soil–solution.
- Key variables defined include soil mass (W), spike concentration (Cspike) and volume (Vspike), average atomic masses, and measured isotope abundances (IA) in different solutions.
- A detailed formula (Equation 1) is provided to compute E value and E Ext; the exact equation is not reproduced here.
- Values with no applicable result are marked as NA.
