# Soils

## Study context and sampling
- Four UK soils with contrasting metal contamination histories were sampled from 0–20 cm depth: Kegworth, Chat Moss, Clough Wood, and a sewage processing farm.
- Contamination histories summarized: road traffic emissions; 19th century urban waste from Manchester; Pb/Zn calcareous mine spoil; digested sewage sludge.
- Soils were air-dried and sieved to <2 mm; pH determined in soil-water suspensions (5 g:12.5 mL); loss on ignition used as an estimate of soil organic matter content.

## Chemical extractions and sample preparation
- Target metals: Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb; extractions with four extractants: 0.43 M HNO3, 0.43 M CH3COOH, 1 M CaCl2, 0.05 M Na2H2EDTA (reported as MExt mg/kg).
- Procedure: three replicate soil suspended in each extractant; centrifuged (2200 g, 15 min); supernatants filtered to <0.22 µm; CaCl2 extracts acidified to 2% HNO3; samples stored at 4°C prior to analysis.
- Total metal concentration: soil <2 mm digested with HNO3/HClO4/HF (two replicates per soil).
- Data handling: NA indicates not applicable for a given replicate.

## Isotopic dilution assay
- Isotopes used for spikes: 62Ni (IA 97.0%), 65Cu (IA 99.2%), 70Zn (IA 99.9%), 108Cd (IA 70.3%), 204Pb (IA 99.4%).
- Spikes prepared as mixed-isotope solutions; spikes designed to raise the spike isotope abundance by ~20% per soil-extractant combination.
- Experimental design: six replicate soils; three replicates spiked (0.4 mL) per soil-solution, with shake times; parallel spiking for each extractant (Ca(NO3)2, HNO3, CaCl2, CH3COOH, Na2H2EDTA).
- Post-spike handling: suspensions centrifuged and filtered; neutral salt solutions acidified to 2% HNO3 before ICP-MS analysis.

## ICP-MS multi-element analysis and isotopic abundances
- Instrumentation: quadrupole ICP-MS (X-Series II) with collision cell technology and kinetic energy discrimination.
- Internal standards: Sc, Ge, Rh, Ir to correct sensitivity drift; external multi-element standards for calibration.
- Isotopic measurements: 62Ni/60Ni, 65Cu/63Cu, 70Zn/66Zn, 108Cd/111Cd, 204Pb/208Pb, 206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/208Pb; CCT-KED mode used to minimize interferences (notably 35Cl35Cl with Zn).
- Interference corrections: 204Hg/204Pb correction applied; samples may be diluted to keep detector in pulse-counting mode.
- Mass-discrimination corrections: derived from standards and NIST SRM-981; drift corrections applied every ~20 samples.

## Calculation of E value and E Ext
- Objective: determine isotopically exchangeable metal concentrations.
- E Value: metal concentration in soil suspended in 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2; E Ext: metal concentration in each extractant.
- Calculation approach: use measured isotope ratios from spike solution, spiked soil-solution, and unspiked control to derive exchangeable metal fractions (details reference a specific equation, labeled as Equation 1 in the source).
- Key variables: AM (average atomic mass of metal in soil/spike), soil mass (W), spike concentration/volume, and measured isotope abundances.
- Outputs: quantitative estimates of exchangeable metals in soil and in each extractant, enabling assessment of metal mobility and bioavailability across the different soil types.
