# 1 Soils

- Objective: Sample and quantify metal contamination in four UK soils with contrasting contamination histories to derive exchangeable metal fractions and enable assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.

- Sites and sampling:
  - Kegworth (52°49'35"N, 1°16'19"W)
  - Chat Moss (53°28'34"N, 2°24'11"W)
  - Clough Wood (53°09'07"N, 1°36'52"W)
  - Sewage processing farm (52°57'33"N, 1°02'49"W)
  - Depth: 0–20 cm
  - Contamination histories: road traffic, 19th century urban waste from Manchester, Pb/Zn calcareous mine spoil, and digested sewage sludge, respectively
  - Procedures: soils air-dried, sieved to <2 mm; pH determined in soil-water suspensions; loss on ignition used as a proxy for soil organic matter

- Chemical extractions (MExt mg/kg; metals: Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb):
  - Extractants: 0.43 M HNO3, 0.43 M CH3COOH, 1 M CaCl2, 0.05 M Na2H2EDTA
  - Replicates: three per soil per extractant
  - Procedure: suspensions centrifuged (2200 g, 15 min); supernatants filtered (<0.22 µm); CaCl2 extracts acidified to 2% HNO3; stored at 4°C prior to analysis

- Total metal concentration (MTotal):
  - Sample preparation: <2 mm soil; agate ball-milled
  - Digestion: 2 mL HNO3, 1 mL HClO4, 2.5 mL HF

- Isotopic dilution assay:
  - Isotopes used: 62Ni, 65Cu, 70Zn, 108Cd, 204Pb
  - Isotopes prepared as mixed spikes in 5% TAG HNO3; spikes selected to increase ~20% in natural abundance
  - Experimental design: six replicate soil samples per metal; three replicates spiked with mixed-isotope solution; identical spikes applied to correspondingly prepared extractant suspensions
  - Post-spike processing: suspensions centrifuged and filtered as for extractions; solutions prepared for ICP-MS analysis

- Multi-element analysis and isotopic abundances (ICP-MS):
  - Instrument: quadrupole ICP-MS (X-Series II) with collision cell technology (CCT-KED)
  - Internal standards: Sc, Ge, Rh, Ir for sensitivity correction
  - Calibration: external multi-element standards
  - Isotope ratios measured: 62Ni/60Ni, 65Cu/63Cu, 70Zn/66Zn, 108Cd/111Cd, 204Pb/208Pb, 206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/208Pb
  - Interference management: CCT-KED to minimize polyatomic interferences; 35Cl35Cl affecting 70Zn mitigated; 204Hg correction via 202Hg
  - Detector mode: dilution to keep within electron multiplier pulse-counting range when needed
  - Mass discrimination corrections: derived from calibration standards and NIST SRM-981 (Pb)

- Calculation of exchangeable metal fractions (E value and EExt):
  - Concept: determine isotopically exchangeable metal concentrations in Ca(NO3)2 suspensions (EValue) or in extractants (EExt) using spike, spiked-soil, and control measurements
  - Approach: use isotope abundance data from spike and reference isotopes to compute exchangeable fractions (Equation 1 provided in original text)
  - Output: E-values representing the fraction of metals readily exchangeable/bioavailable under the tested conditions

- Data quality and outputs:
  - Replication and spike-based methods support robust quantification of both total and exchangeable metal pools
  - Standardized procedures align with monitoring frameworks, enabling temporal comparisons and cross-site assessments

- Relevance for environmental monitoring:
  - Provides standardized, auditable datasets on total and exchangeable metal fractions across diverse soils
  - Facilitates integration with other datasets and data-sharing by documenting detailed methods and measurement standards
  - Supports evaluation of metal mobility and potential ecological risk through explicit exchangeable-fraction measurements
