# Isotopic dilution assay and multi-element analysis of metals in soils

## Study aims and scope
- Describes a methodological framework to quantify metal contamination histories and exchangeable metal pools in soils to inform environmental policy and monitoring decisions.
- Focuses on establishing robust protocols for sampling, extraction, isotopic dilution measurements, and data interpretation that can support decision-making and future monitoring.

## Sampling sites and soil characteristics
- Four UK soils selected for contrasting metal contamination histories and concentrations: Kegworth, Chat Moss, Clough Wood, and a sewage processing farm.
- Sampling depth: 0–20 cm.
- Contamination histories summarized from Atkinson et al. (2011): road traffic, 19th-century urban waste from Manchester, Pb/Zn calcareous mine spoil, and digested sewage sludge.
- Soils were air-dried and sieved to <2 mm.
- Basic soil properties measured: pH in soil–water suspensions and loss on ignition (as an estimate of soil organic matter).

## Chemical extractions
- Measured concentrations of Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb in four soils using four extractants: 0.43 M HNO3, 0.43 M CH3COOH, 1 M CaCl2, and 0.05 M Na2H2EDTA (MExt mg/kg).
- Procedure: three replicate soil samples per extractant, suspended in extractants, centrifuged, and supernatants filtered to <0.22 µm; CaCl2 extracts acidified to 2% HNO3; samples stored at 4°C prior to analysis.
- Data notes: 'NA' indicates not applicable for a given replicate.

## Isotopic dilution assay
- Used enriched stable isotopes (62Ni, 65Cu, 70Zn, 108Cd, 204Pb) to create mixed-isotope spikes for each soil–extractant combination.
- Spike introduction designed to increase the natural abundance of spike isotopes by ~20% in soil suspensions.
- Experimental design included six replicate soil samples per metal, with three spiked and six unspiked suspensions across different extractants.
- Spiking and incubation steps followed by centrifugation and filtration prior to isotopic analysis.

## Multi-element analysis and isotopic abundance measurements
- Metal concentrations in extracts measured by quadrupole ICP-MS (X-Series II) with collision cell technology (CCT-KED) to reduce interferences.
- Internal standards used: Sc, Ge, Rh, and Ir; external calibration with multi-element standards.
- Isotopic ratios measured: 62Ni/60Ni, 65Cu/63Cu, 70Zn/66Zn, 108Cd/111Cd, 204Pb/208Pb, 206Pb/208Pb, 207Pb/208Pb; CCT-KED employed to minimize interferences such as 35Cl-35Cl on 70Zn.
- Corrections: mass discrimination corrections based on standards and NIST SRM-981 for Pb; adjustments for isobaric interferences (e.g., 204Hg on 204Pb) where needed.
- Data handling: samples sometimes diluted to ensure counts fall within detector dynamic range; measurements performed in pulse-counting mode when necessary.

## Calculation of exchangeable metal values (E value and E Ext)
- Quantifies isotopically exchangeable metal concentrations:
  - E Value: exchangeable metal concentration in soil suspended in 0.01 M Ca(NO3)2.
  - E Ext: exchangeable metal concentration in the given extractants.
- Calculation derives from isotopic abundances of spike and reference isotopes measured in three solutions: spike solution, spiked soil–solution, and unspiked soil–solution.
- Uses a mass-balance approach that combines soil mass, spike concentration and volume, measured isotope abundances, and average metal masses to determine exchangeable metal fractions.
- The resulting E values provide a metric for the readily mobilisable metal pool, enabling comparisons across sites and over time.

## Data interpretation and potential policy relevance
- The methodology yields quantitative measures of exchangeable metal pools, aiding assessment of contaminant mobility and potential bioavailability.
- Can inform remediation prioritization, risk assessment, and monitoring design by distinguishing readily available metal fractions from total soil burden.
- Data generated include metal concentrations by extractant and isotope-based exchangeable fractions, enabling temporal and spatial monitoring comparisons.

## Data governance and monitoring framework considerations
- Relevance to monitoring frameworks includes the need for:
  - Standardized protocols across sites and time for comparability.
  - Comprehensive metadata describing sampling, extraction, isotope spike preparation, and analytical settings.
  - Transparent data sharing to support stakeholder scrutiny, reproducibility, and policy use.
- Anticipated challenges align with common monitoring framework barriers:
  - Ensuring data quality and completeness (QA/QC) and consistent reporting.
  - Managing data silos and facilitating cross-organisation data access.
  - Providing adequate metadata and documentation to evaluate data suitability for policy decisions.
  - Balancing openness of underlying data with privacy or proprietary considerations.
