# Vegetation map of Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve, 1962

- Overview
  - ESRI Shapefile containing polygons that represent vegetation areas within Roudsea Wood National Nature Reserve (Cumbria), digitized from the original 1962 field map.
  - Original field map created by R. Donelly and N. English in 1962 at the Nature Conservancy's Merlewood Research Station.
  - Map covers the western side of the reserve (woodland).
  - Digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology in 2019 using ESRI GIS software.
  - Species nomenclature follows Flora of the British Isles (Clapham, Tutin & Warburg, 1962).

- Data content and structure
  - Shapefile fields include: TREE_COV, DESC_TC, TREE_COV2, DESC_TC2, STOCKING, DESC_ST, STOCKING2, DESC_ST2, GVEG_MAJ, DESC_MAJ, GVEG_MAJ2, DESC_MAJ2, GVEG_MIN, DESC_MIN, GVEG_MIN2, DESC_MIN2, OTHER, GLOBALID, POLY_AREA.
  - TREE_COV and related fields describe tree cover codes and their descriptions (e.g., birch, oak, conifer plantations, no tree cover, etc.).
  - STOCKING and related fields describe stocking codes and their descriptions (e.g., no tree cover with young conifers, scattered trees, high forest, coppice, etc.).
  - GVEG_MAJ / GVEG_MIN and their descriptions capture major and minor ground vegetation communities (e.g., Deschampsia flexuosa associations, Molinia caerulea, Brachypodium sylvaticum, various community groupings I–VIII, and minor communities m1–m7).
  - POLY_AREA provides polygon area in square meters; GLOBALID serves as a unique identifier.
  - Coordinate system: British National Grid; Projection: OSGB1936; SHAPE geometry.

- Provenance and methods
  - Vegetation mapped in the field after the reserve’s designation (1955) as parcels by tree cover type, stocking, and ground flora communities.
  - Original map digitized in 2019 by CEH from the 1962 field map.
  - Nomenclature and coding aligned with standard references of the period (Flora of the British Isles, 1962).

- Data quality and standards
  - No formal quality documentation on record.
  - Data entry values have been range checked and cross-checked against the original map.

- Classification schemes
  - Tree cover codes with descriptive text (e.g., Birch, Oak, Yew, Lime, Willow; conifer plantations; No tree cover; Other/ride/not known).
  - Stocking codes and descriptions (e.g., No tree cover with conifers, Scattered trees, High forest, Coppice, etc.).
  - Ground vegetation major communities (I, Ia, Ib, II, III, IV, IVa, IVb, V, VI, VIa, VII, VIII) with descriptive phrases for each community.
  - Ground vegetation minor communities (m1, m2, m3, m5, m6, m7) with specific taxa or communities.

- Technical details
  - Extent: Great Britain (in the context of the dataset’s spatial extent).
  - Projection and coordinate system summarized above (British National Grid / OSGB1936).
