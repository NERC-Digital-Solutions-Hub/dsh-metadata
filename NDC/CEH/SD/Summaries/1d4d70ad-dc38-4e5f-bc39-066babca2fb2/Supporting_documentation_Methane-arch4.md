# Methane fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Purpose and scope
- Study of methane flux measurements in peatland plateaus, thawing peatland features, and both burnt and unburnt forests on permafrost in subarctic Canada.
- Measurements conducted during summers of 2013 and 2014, with site conditions and treatments differing between years.

## Study sites and coding
- 2013 (Teslin, Yukon): 
  - Peatland plateau: TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau) with five replicates (TPP1–TPP5).
  - Thawing peatland plateau: TWM (margin), T5M (~5 m from margin), TMID (center), each with three replicates (e.g., TWM1–TWM3).
  - Burnt vs unburnt forests near Whitehorse: FFU (FireFox Unburnt) and FFB (FireFox Burnt), five replicates each.
- 2014 (Yellowknife area, Northwest Territories):
  - White Truck Plateau: WTP with five replicates.
  - Thawing features: WTM (Moss), WTS (Sedge), WTW (Wetland); WTM and WTS have three replicates each, WTW has one feature with three replicates.
  - No burnt vs unburnt forest measurements in 2014.

## Measurements and protocols
- Methane flux measurement method:
  - Ground collars installed (160 mm diameter for peatland/forest sites; 315 mm for thawing features).
  - PVC chamber caps (15–35 cm high) placed on collars; two-piece Tygon tubing with shut-off connectors connected to a DP-IR methane analyzer.
  - Flux estimated from slope of linear regression of methane concentration vs time (up to 4 hours; intervals chosen by flux rate).
  - Regression outputs include slope (flux), intercept, and R^2.
  - Fluxes expressed as mg CH4 per day per m2 and mg CH4-C per day per m2.
- Calibration and quality control:
  - DP-IR analyzer calibrated with certified standard (100 ppm CH4, Praxair); performance cross-checked with on-site self-test and standard within 2 ppm.
- Ancillary measurements:
  - Air temperature (on-site weather station); soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar; volumetric soil moisture at the surface (0–6 cm) using ML3 ThetaKit.
  - Thaw depth measured with a metal rod; water table depth measured relative to a datum using a long rod.

## Disturbance minimization and site access
- Boardwalks constructed to minimize disturbance during flux measurements.

## Data structure and units
- All measured variables reported with units in each data column.
- Flux coding aligned with soil profile dataset (note: flux data and soil core data originate from different locations; refer to GPS coordinates in the file).

## Data processing and outputs
- Flux values derived from linear regression of concentration over time; reported as daily fluxes per area and per carbon content.
- Model outputs include slope, intercept, and R^2 for quality assessment.

## Data management considerations and limitations
- Burnt vs unburnt comparisons available only for 2013; not conducted in 2014.
- Data collected across multiple site codes and years with differing replication schemes; coordinates and mapping referenced within the dataset.
- Clear documentation of site codes, replication, and measurement protocol supports reproducibility and cross-dataset integration.
