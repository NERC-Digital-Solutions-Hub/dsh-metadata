# Methane fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Methane flux measurements conducted during summers of 2013 and 2014 in subarctic Canada.
- Comparative design: peatland plateau vs thawing features within the plateau; and burnt vs unburnt forests in 2013 (noted in FireFox sites).
- 2013 sites near Teslin (Yukon) and near Whitehorse (FireFox); 2014 site near Yellowknife (White Truck, Northwest Territories) with no burnt/unburnt forest measurements that year.

## Study Design and Sites
- Peatland plateau coding:
  - TPP = Teslin Peatland Plateau (5 replicates: TPP1–TPP5)
- Thawing features within the plateau (three locations per year where applicable):
  - TWM = Teslin Wetland Margin
  - T5M = Teslin 5 m from thaw margin
  - TMID = Teslin Center of thawing feature
  - Replicates: TWM1–TWM3, T5M1–T5M3, TMID1–TMID3
- Forest sites (2013, FireFox area near Whitehorse):
  - FFU = FireFox Unburnt (5 replicates)
  - FFB = FireFox Burnt (5 replicates)
- White Truck site (2014, Yellowknife region):
  - WTP = White Truck Plateau (5 replicates)
  - Thawing features and replicates:
    - WTM = White Truck Moss (3 replicates)
    - WTS = White Truck Sedge (3 replicates)
    - WTW = White Truck Wetland (older collapse feature; 1 feature with 3 replicates)

## Measurement Protocols
- Access paths:
  - Boardwalks constructed to minimize disturbance during gas flux measurements.
- Chamber and collar setup:
  - Collars: 160 mm diameter for plateau and forest sites; 315 mm diameter for thawing features.
  - Chambers: PVC tubes, 15–35 cm high, placed on top of collars with inner tube to prevent leakage.
- Gas measurement:
  - Methane measured with Detecto Pak-Infrared (DP-IR) analyser connected via two Tygon tubes and shut-off connectors.
  - Calibration: certified 100 ppm CH4 standard; performance within 2 ppm difference.
  - Data collection: CH4 concentration in headspace monitored over up to 4 hours at regular intervals.
  - Flux calculation: slope of CH4 concentration vs. time; intercept and R^2 reported.
- Environmental and site measurements:
  - Air temperature measured on-site (weather station).
  - Soil temperature: measured at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar after chamber removal.
  - Volumetric soil moisture: measured at the surface (upper 6 cm) with ML3 ThetaKit (default calibration).
  - Thaw depth: measured with a metal rod inserted into the ground until resistance; distance recorded.
  - Water table depth: measured in thawing features relative to a datum using a long rod; datum established by inserting the rod to depth at season start.
- Data units:
  - Flux rates expressed as mg CH4 day-1 m-2 and mg CH4-C day-1 m-2.

## Data Coding and Structure
- Methane flux codes align with the soil profiles dataset; however, methane flux data and soil core data originate from different locations (GPS coordinates provided in the file).
- 2014 dataset structure differs from 2013 due to the absence of burnt vs unburnt forest measurements.

## Temporal Coverage
- Summers 2013 and 2014.

## Quality Assurance and Notes
- In-field calibration and instrument self-tests ensure measurement reliability.
- Data include flux intercepts and R^2 values to indicate fit quality.
- All measured variables have units specified within the dataset columns.

## Notable Considerations for Analysis
- Scale differences: local (plot-level) measurements across multiple replicate collars; potential need to harmonize spatial scales when aggregating.
- 2014 dataset lacks burnt/unburnt forest comparisons; analyses comparing forest burn status must use 2013 data only.
- Data integration with soil profiles requires attention to potential location mismatches despite linked dataset codes.
