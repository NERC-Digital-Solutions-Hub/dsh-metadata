# Methane fluxes from peatland plateaus and thawing peatland plateaus and from burnt and unburnt forests from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Aim
- Document methane flux measurements to assess environmental health and policy performance over time using a consistent, standardized dataset.
- Provide transparent methodologies and replicate data to support monitoring responsibilities and data sharing.

## Study sites and design
- 2013: Teslin, Yukon – peatland plateau (TPP) and thawing peatland plateau; FireFox site north of Whitehorse – burnt (FFB) and unburnt (FFU) black spruce forest.
  - Peatland plateau: TPP with five replicates/collars (TPP1–TPP5).
  - Thawing plateau: three locations (TWM, T5M, TMID) with three replicates each.
  - Forest sites: FFU and FFB with five replicates each.
- 2014: White Truck, near Yellowknife, Northwest Territories – peatland plateau (WTP) and thawing features (WTM, WTS, WTW).
  - No burnt vs unburnt forest measurements this year.
  - WTP with five replicates; thaw features include three replicates each for WTM and WTS and a single feature with three replicates for WTW.
- Field access: boardwalks constructed to minimize disturbance during gas flux measurements.

## Measurements and methodology
- Methane flux measurement approach:
  - Ground collars: PVC tubes (160 mm diameter for peatland and forest sites; 315 mm for thawing features).
  - Chambers: PVC tubes 15–35 cm high placed on collars; inner tube prevents leakage.
  - Gas analysis: DP-IR infrared methane analyzer with two Tygon tubing connections; on-site measurements over up to 4 hours.
  - Calibration: certified 100 ppm CH4 standard; DP-IR auto self-test with performance checked against standard (within 2 ppm).
  - Flux calculation: slope of linear regression of methane concentration versus time; report slope (flux) and regression intercept and R^2.
  - Flux units: mg CH4 m^-2 d^-1 and mg CH4-C m^-2 d^-1.
- Auxiliary environmental measurements:
  - Air temperature (on-site weather station).
  - Soil temperature at 5 cm and 10 cm inside the collar (post-chamber removal).
  - Volumetric soil moisture at the surface (upper 6 cm) using ML3 ThetaKit; default calibration.
  - Thaw depth measured with a metal rod (measured to resistance).
  - Water table depth within thawing features measured relative to a datum rod.
  - Headspace volume calculation from distance of collar edge to ground.
- Data structure:
  - All measured variables included in each data column; units documented per column.
  - Note: methane flux data and soil core data originate from different GPS coordinates; coordinates are provided in the respective files.

## Data quality, validation, and standardization
- On-site quality checks:
  - DP-IR self-test and calibration against 100 ppm CH4 standard; measurements within 2 ppm of standard.
- Transparency and reproducibility:
  - Detailed documentation of collar dimensions, chamber construction, and measurement timing.
  - Clear recording of replicate structure for each site and feature.

## Data coding and organization
- Site and feature codes:
  - Peatland plateau and thawing features: TPP, TWM, T5M, TMID, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW.
  - Forest sites: FFU (unburnt), FFB (burnt).
- Replication:
  - Peat plateau and forest sites generally five replicates each (TPP1–TPP5; FFU, FFB).
  - Thaw features: three replicates for most features (TWM1–TWM3; T5M1–T5M3; TMID1–TMID3; WTM, WTS with three replicates each; WTW with a single feature and three replicates).
- Data integration note:
  - Flux data and soil core data are aligned conceptually but come from different GPS coordinates; GPS coordinates are present in the respective data files.

## Implications for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized methane flux measurements across contrasting peatland conditions and permafrost-related thaw features, including disturbance (burnt vs unburnt).
- Enables temporal comparisons (2013 vs 2014) and cross-site analyses with consistent protocols and QA procedures.
- Supports data sharing and portal submission through explicit data structures, replicates, and unit consistency.
- Highlights the importance of accessible underlying data to maximize the value of monitoring datasets.
