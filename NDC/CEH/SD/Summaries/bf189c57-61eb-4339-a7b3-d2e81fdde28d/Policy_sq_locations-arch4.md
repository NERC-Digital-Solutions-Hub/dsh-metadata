# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - The policy aims to maximise public interest utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England (NE), Welsh Government (WG), The Scottish Government (SG), Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA), Forestry Commission (FC), Countryside Council for Wales (CCW), Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

- Confidentiality rationale
  - Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Confidentiality ensures scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land, supporting robust environmental policy.

- Access levels and release rules
  - Data access allows identifying whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
  - Very exceptional cases may permit release of precise six-digit locations, contingent on CEH preprocessing to avoid unnecessary release; external access must demonstrate equal or higher IP confidentiality protections.
  - Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and hence are treated with the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

- Conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
  - No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners.
  - If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have looser IP confidentiality requirements but still prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

- Roles, governance, and reporting
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - If access is denied, CEH follows FOI/Environmental Regulations procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual public report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal data use within CS partners by preprocessing data as needed; external requests are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to define requirements and/or guidance; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid depending on the arrangement.
