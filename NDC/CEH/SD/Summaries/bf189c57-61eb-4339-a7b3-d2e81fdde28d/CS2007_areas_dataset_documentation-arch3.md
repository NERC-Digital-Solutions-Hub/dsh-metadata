- Data use and purpose for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides spatially explicit habitat extents and associated attributes useful for environmental health measures.
  - Supports assessment of habitat extent, land-use relationships, and landscape structure for policy scrutiny and decision making.
  - Facilitates integration with other indicators (e.g., biodiversity, land classification) for monitoring frameworks.

- Data quality, metadata, and governance
  - Data subject to Countryside Survey ownership and licensing.
  - All use must acknowledge: “Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology” and copyright statements.
  - References and methodology rely on established classifications (ITE Land Classification 2007; Biodiversity Broad Habitat classifications).

- Access, limitations, and references
  - Refused access areas excluded from the dataset.
  - Potential data sharing barriers include metadata quality and ensuring proper data governance and provenance.
