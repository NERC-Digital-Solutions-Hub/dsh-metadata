# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public interest value of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (Nature of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Location data can help determine if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate localisation.
- Six-digit (precise) locations require CEH pre-processing to avoid release; VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases may allow external release under licence if the requester demonstrates equal or higher IP confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could indirectly reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Licence terms and conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to specifically named individuals for the agreed purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project and must be destroyed with written confirmation at the end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data cannot be used to plan visits or to monitor landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have terms similar to six-digit releases but need not meet the highest IP confidentiality criteria.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences (four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) with appropriate clauses; signatures required from authorized representatives.
- If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under statutory provisions.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications and decision rationale.
- CEH aims to provide necessary pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
