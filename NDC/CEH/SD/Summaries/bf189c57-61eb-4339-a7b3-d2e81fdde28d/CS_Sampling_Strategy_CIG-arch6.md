# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify sampling for Countryside Survey GB ( Great Britain) through 2007.
  - Emphasises the linkage between sampling design, data collection, and the production of national and country-specific habitat estimates over time.

- Core concepts for data support
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage across ecological variation.
  - ITE Land Classification as the principal strata framework, linking environmental attributes to sampling units.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km squares; center squares classified and surrounding squares assigned to the corresponding class.
  - Longitudinal data emphasis: keeping the time series coherent by anchoring new surveys to the evolving Land Classification.

- The Beginning (CS1978 baseline)
  - ITE Land Classification created in the mid-1970s using environmental variables and a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis) on 1 km squares.
  - Central 1 km squares from a 15 × 15 km grid classified into 32 land classes; surrounding four squares per center were allocated to classes.
  - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per land class (total 256) surveyed in CS1978, focusing on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
  - National habitat estimates derived by combining class-wide averages with land-class area proportions.

- The importance of stratification
  - Pure random sampling risks bias and non-typical representation; stratification ensures coverage of diverse ecological contexts (e.g., altitude, geology, climate, land-use patterns).
  - Land Classification provides a structured, objective basis for stratification and comparability across surveys.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (progression overview)
  - Early version (1970s): 32 land classes based on environmental attributes; used for GB-wide stratification.
  - Methodological basis: evolution from Quadrat-based vegetation types to landscape-scale environmental stratification.

- The sampling framework across key surveys
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
    - Class-based stratification with 8 squares per class; 256 total samples.
    - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class times the class area.
  - CS1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384); eight CS1978 squares retained.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats; additional environmental and habitat data collected.
    - National estimates calculated using the 1990 land classification framework.
  - Developments leading to CS2000 (4th Field Survey)
    - Recognition that a GB-wide classification needed updating; major surrogates for climate/geology/physiography used to redevelop a classification covering all squares.
    - The 1990 classification was retained for continuity in some analyses, but shifts caused by reclassification affected stratum representation.
    - Adjustments implemented to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) as well as Wales-only reporting.
    - Introduction of country-unit sub-classes, class aggregation for sparsely represented cases, and additional sample squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes.
    - Upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - CS2000 outputs and structure
    - Revised land-class maps and distribution across England with Wales and Scotland.
    - Table summarizing the numbers of squares surveyed by class and country, illustrating changes in sampling rates and representation.
    - Aimed to balance representation across England & Wales vs Scotland and to improve precision for country-specific estimates.

- Wales-focused adjustments and CS2007 redesign
  - Wales-specific reporting needs led to further refinement for Wales-only estimates.
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into Wales-and-England country-unit versions, creating additional strata (five new Welsh sub-classes).
  - Total strata increased (from 40 to 45) with 43 additional Welsh squares added to meet representation goals; some English classes retained with reduced square counts.
  - Wales-only representation substantially enhanced; England adjustments limited to maintain overall balance.
  - CS2007 maps reflect England, Wales, and Scotland sampling framework with updated class distributions and sample squares.

- Wales, uplands, and country-based sampling strategies
  - Separate country estimates: England with Wales and Scotland; Wales-specific reporting improvements implemented via class sub-divisions and targeted sampling.
  - Upland module (CS2000): 30 additional squares placed in upland and marginal upland Land Classes to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales.
  - Wales-focused adjustments (CS2007): added Welsh-derived classes and additional Welsh samples to meet reporting needs.

- Outputs, estimation approach, and data considerations
  - National estimates rely on combining per-square habitat data within each land class with the known area of each class.
  - Changes in Land Classification across surveys affect comparability; the document discusses the trade-off between using the latest classification for consistency within a survey vs maintaining cross-survey comparability.
  - Outputs include landscape maps, class distributions, and country-specific sampling rates to support UK-wide and country-level habitat status reporting.
  - Figures and tables illustrate the revised land-class maps, the spatial distribution of sample squares, and the numbers of squares by class and country across CS2000 and CS2007.
  - Documentation emphasizes referencing both original and revised classifications when presenting national estimates to maintain methodological transparency.

- Practical implications for data users
  - Understand the evolving Land Classification framework and its impact on estimates over time.
  - Recognize the emphasis on country-specific reporting and the administrative decisions (e.g., Wales-only, upland modules) that shape the datasets.
  - Leverage maps and class-based stratification to structure analyses and ensure comparable, transparent estimates across survey years.
