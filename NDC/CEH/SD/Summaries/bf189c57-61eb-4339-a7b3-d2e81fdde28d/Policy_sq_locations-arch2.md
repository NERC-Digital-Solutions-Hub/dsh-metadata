# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Who are the CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Public interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision levels)
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release, or extremely exceptional justification.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could imply square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as precise location data.
- Very exceptional access requires a legal demonstration that the external data to be used carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, stored securely, and access restricted to authorised individuals for the approved purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; no use to guide visits or monitor landowners.
- Potential licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if required.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level.
- Licensees must not derive or claim the ability to precisely locate CS squares from the data.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases using these principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences containing compliance clauses; signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; internal use may be accommodated subject to moderate demand.
- Requests from external organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult with CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory and may incur payment, negotiated case-by-case.
