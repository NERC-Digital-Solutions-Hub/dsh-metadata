# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Historical account of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey field sampling from 1978 to 2007.
- Describes how stratified, random sampling and environmental classifications were developed to create representative national surveys of Great Britain.
- Explains the evolution of sampling frameworks, country-specific reporting needs, and the impact of classification updates on long-term trend analyses.

## Data Governance and Metadata (Data Stewardship lens)
- Emphasises the need for clear documentation of classifications (versions) and their rules to maintain data provenance and comparability over time.
- Highlights that changes to the Land Classification affect consistency of national estimates, requiring careful versioning, mapping, and transparency for users.
- Notes the connection between classification maps, sampling frames, and published outputs (e.g., land cover maps, habitat estimates) that underpin policy-relevant results.

## Land Classification and Data Structures
- Land Classification originated from the ITE approach using environmental attributes to group land into classes (32 original classes; later expanded to 40, then 45 with country-specific subdivisions).
- Early method: classify 1 km squares (with surrounding squares included for context) to form a stratified framework for sampling.
- Key concept: environmental stratification (via ISA and multivariate methods) to ensure samples represent different ecological conditions across GB.

## Sampling Framework and Survey Phases
- 1978: First GB ecological survey used 256 squares (8 per class) from the classified landscape.
- 1984: 12 squares per class (total 384) for a land-use/habitat focus, maintaining the earlier framework.
- 1990: Countryside Survey (CS1990) expanded to all GB squares within a revised Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; complemented by the first Land Cover Map (from satellite data).
- 1998–2000: CS2000 refined the framework to support separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland); introduced country-unit land classes, class subdivision, aggregation, and additional squares to improve representation.
- 2007: CS2007 addressed Wales-only reporting needs, adding Welsh subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing total strata to 45; Wales received more representation, and England adjustments were made to maintain balance.
- Across phases, the sampling rate and total squares varied by country and class to meet policy and reporting needs.

## Separate Country Estimates and Wales/England/Scotland
- Recognises devolution: need for England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates, plus Wales-only reporting.
- Modifications included class sub-division into country-unit versions, class aggregation where necessary, and targeted additional sampling (especially in Wales) to ensure adequate representation of new Welsh classes.
- Isle of Man squares were replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
- Uplands module in CS2000 improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Uplands and Special Modules
- An additional uplands module in CS2000 added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland land classes to boost precision for those habitats.
- This module acknowledges the need for better coverage of less-represented ecological zones within country units.

## Outputs, Publications, and Consistency
- Outputs include classified land maps and national habitat/land-use estimates, published in successive survey reports (CS1990 main report; CS2000; CS2007 UK results).
- Important caveat: changing Land Classification for national estimates affects cross-survey consistency; two approaches are noted:
  - Use the latest classification for country estimates (more consistent within a survey).
  - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
- Tables and figures in the document illustrate the distribution of squares and changes in sampling across surveys.

## Practical Implications and Challenges for Data Stewards
- Balancing representation across diverse land classes while meeting country-specific reporting needs.
- Managing the impact of reclassification on time-series analyses and ensuring transparent version control and documentation.
- Ensuring adequate sample sizes in Wales for Wales-only reporting, while maintaining acceptable precision in England and Scotland.
- Navigating shifts from ecological quadrats and soils focus to landscape/habitat mapping and satellite-derived data, and incorporating these changes into the data governance framework.
- Maintaining linkage between raw survey data, land classifications, sampling frames, and published outputs to support reproducibility and policy use.

## Endnotes and Context
- Presents a historical narrative of the ITE Land Classification development, survey design decisions, and the evolution of sampling strategies tied to policy and reporting requirements.
- Serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding the provenance, structure, and limitations of Countryside Survey data up to 2007.
