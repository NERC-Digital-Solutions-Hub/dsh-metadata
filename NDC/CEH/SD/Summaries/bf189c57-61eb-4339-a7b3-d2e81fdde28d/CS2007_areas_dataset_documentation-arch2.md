# Landscape area data 2007 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

- Scope and purpose
  - Landscape area data from Countryside Survey 2007 covering 591 1km squares across Great Britain (refused access areas excluded).
  - Aims to document broad/habitat types and associated attributes to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Data intended for verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and standardized analysis; outputs can be reports, maps, and charts; datasets should be stored in appropriate portals.

- Data files and key contents
  - LANDSCAPE_AREA_FEATURE_HAB_2007.csv
    - Core habitat information at 1km square level
    - Columns: SQUARE, YEAR, ID, BROAD_HABITAT, BROAD_HABITAT_NAME, AREA (m2), LC07, LC07_NUM, COUNTRY, COUNTY, EZ_DESC_07
  - LANDSCAPE_AREA_FEATURE_ATT_2007.csv
    - Additional attributes for the same 1km squares
    - Columns include: YEAR, SQUARE, ID, THEME, THEME_NAME, PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE, PRIMARY_ATTRIBUTE_NAME, SPECIES, SPECIES_NAME, SPECIES_COVER, SPECIES_COVER_NAME, PRIMARY_QUALIFIER, PRIMARY_QUALIFIER_NAME, STRUCTURE_USE, STRUCTURE_USE_NAME, PHYSIOGRAPHY_COVER, PHYSIOGRAPHY_COVER_NAME, ROAD_VERGE_A, ROAD_VERGE_A_NAME, ROAD_VERGE_B, ROAD_VERGE_B_NAME, MODAL_DBH, MODAL_DBH_NAME, MOSAIC_PRECENT_AREA, LC07, LC07_NUM, COUNTRY, COUNTY, EZ_DESC_07

- Coverage details
  - Broad Habitat classifications aligned with Jackson (2000) terminology.
  - Includes Land Class 2007 (ITE) codes (LC07 and LC07_NUM).
  - Country and administrative units (England, Scotland, Wales; counties or councils).

- Environment and literature reference
  - See Countryside Survey website for project overview and methodologies.
  - KeyReferences include: ITE Land Classification documents (Bunce et al. 1996, 2007), Jackson (2000) on Broad Habitat guidance, and related Countryside Survey 2007 datasets (DOIs and links provided in the references).

- Practical use for analysts monitoring the environment
  - Verify and ingest standardized habitat data from established sources for trend analyses.
  - Combine habitat data with other environmental datasets to enhance monitoring value (moving beyond single-use datasets).
  - Analyze habitat extent, distribution, and associated attributes to assess environmental health against standards.
  - Produce outputs (maps, charts, reports) and ensure data is accessible through appropriate data portals.

- Caveats and considerations
  - Snapshot from 2007; consider temporal gaps when assessing trends.
  - Refused access areas excluded; interpret extent with this in mind.
