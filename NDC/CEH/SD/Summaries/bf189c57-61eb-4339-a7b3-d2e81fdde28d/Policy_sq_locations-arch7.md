# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH))
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission from landowners.
- Requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release and precision levels
- Access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, or Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square contains each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only released under very exceptional circumstances; CEH may pre-process analysis to avoid releasing locations; otherwise, exceptional external access may be granted if the requester demonstrates equivalent/confidential IP protection.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could, in combination with other data, identify square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases have similar licence terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
- Licences prohibit attempts to infer precise square locations or identify CS squares from the data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other purposes.
- At the end of a licensing period, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP when required.
- Four-digit licences are similar but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempting to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data releases, with clauses reflecting policy requirements; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under FOI/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partnership needs; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, with terms negotiated case-by-case.
