# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the link between sampling design, land classification, and time-series habitat/land-use estimates across Great Britain.
- Highlights how policy needs (e.g., Wales-only, Scotland-only reporting) shaped methodological updates and data governance.

## Core Concepts and Approach
- Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s varied landscapes and to minimize bias.
- Use of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework to stratifyGB into distinct land classes.
- Sample unit: 1 km square; original method used the centre square plus surrounding squares to define classes and allocate samples.
- Sample allocation aims to balance ecological representation, data quality, and the ability to derive national and regional estimates.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 32 classes derived from 1228 centre 1 km squares; surrounding four squares also assigned; formed the basis for the first sampling frame.
- 1984: Sampling framework retained the same Land Classification; increased sample size to 12 squares per class (total 384).
- 1990: Land Classification expanded to cover all 1 km squares in GB; introduced Land Cover Map linkage; 508 squares surveyed; groundwork for national estimates across the entire grid.
- 1998: Land Classification revised to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40; framing adjusted to improve regional estimates.
- 2000 (CS2000): Further refinements to support separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland); introduced country-unit sub-divisions and re-aggregation to maintain adequate representation; added upland habitat focus; additional upland squares planned for better upland statistics.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved governance; Wales received dedicated Welsh-class sub-divisions (creating five new country-unit classes, 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata; extra sampling in Wales (43 additional squares) to ensure six squares per Welsh class; England adjustments to maintain overall balance; introduction of an uplands module with 30 additional upland squares; revised England-Wales and Scotland maps produced to reflect the updated framework.

## Sampling Framework Details and Outputs by Survey
- CS1978: 256 squares (8 per Land Class) across GB; foundational estimate approach using class-area proportions.
- CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); continued use of 32 Land Classes.
- CS1990: 508 squares; full GB-wide Land Classification applied; integration with first Land Cover Map; expanded features recorded.
- CS2000: 40 strata (country-unit refinements); additional squares to improve country-specific estimates; separate country estimates established (England & Wales vs Scotland); upland module introduced.
- CS2007: 45 strata; Welsh-class sub-divisions established (5 new Welsh classes); 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation; uplands sampling expanded (30 extra squares); total sampling adapted to support Wales-only reporting and nationwide comparability.
- Overall GB sampling scale grew from hundreds to just under six hundred sample squares across the period, with country-specific sampling refinements driving data governance and reporting capabilities.

## Data Outputs, Use, and Policy Alignment
- Land Classification maps underpinning stratification and sampling allocations (original 32 classes evolving to 40–45 classes with country-unit splits).
- Habitat and land-use estimates derived from field surveys; national estimates link to Land Class areas and mean per-square values.
- 1990 linkage of Land Classification with the first Land Cover Map (satellite imagery) enabled broader spatial interpretation and regional estimates.
- CS2000 and CS2007 allow England & Wales and Scotland-specific reporting, improving policy relevance for devolved administrations.

## Methodological and Governance Considerations
- Changing the underlying Land Classification affects national estimates; balancing consistency with comparability across surveys was a key consideration.
- The approach favours using the latest classification for country-specific estimates but notes potential trade-offs with cross-survey comparability.
- Under-representation of certain classes was addressed through class subdivisions and targeted additional sampling, particularly for Wales and upland areas.
- Metadata, documentation, and transparency around classification changes are essential for reproducibility and discoverability of historical time-series data.

## Practical Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates the need for flexible yet coherent data frameworks to satisfy evolving policy questions (e.g., country-specific reporting) while preserving time-series integrity.
- Highlights importance of maintaining clear documentation on classification schemes, sampling allocations, and their impact on estimates.
- Illustrates strategies to handle data heterogeneity, class redefinitions, and targeted sampling to improve precision in specific regions or habitat types.
- Emphasizes cross-system collaboration (ecologists, policymakers, statisticians) to ensure data products meet user needs and are discoverable and reusable across networks.
