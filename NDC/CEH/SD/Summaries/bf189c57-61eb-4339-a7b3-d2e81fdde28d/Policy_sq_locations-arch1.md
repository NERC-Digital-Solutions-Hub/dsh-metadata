# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and ongoing permission from landowners.
- Policy is framed as in the public interest; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and the CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how location data can be released
- Location data can be used to determine if squares fall within predetermined areas (country, county, ITE land class, environmental zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit (precise) locations are only allowed in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external release requires demonstration that the related IP data has equal or higher confidentiality/protection than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Licensing terms and restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained afterward.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data may be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; a clause prevents attempting to derive precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If an application is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support for internal CS partnerships within moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- It is highly recommended that partners consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for payment, negotiated case-by-case.
