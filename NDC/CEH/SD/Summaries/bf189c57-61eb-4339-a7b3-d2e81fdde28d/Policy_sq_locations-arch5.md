# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope: Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill to enable future surveys.
- Maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ability to obtain landowner permission for ongoing surveys.
- Requests for information handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision

- General access: allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each survey square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, with pre-processing by CEH when possible; licence required and must meet high confidentiality/IP criteria.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit data.
- Pre-processing by CEH is preferred to avoid releasing precise locations.

## Licence terms and data handling

- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Prohibitions: no release to third parties that could reveal square locations; data not to be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards: licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent standards.
- Four-digit releases: similar terms but do not require the same high IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
- Prohibition on attempts to derive precise square locations from provided data.

## Roles, governance, and transparency

- Decision-maker: CEH, on behalf of NERC, applies policy principles for exceptional releases.
- Licensing: CEH issues hard-copy licences with clauses reflecting policy; senior-authority signature required.
- Appeals and compliance: if approval is denied, CEH follows statutory processes; annual reporting to CS partners on applications and decision grounds.
- Support and preprocessing: CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within reasonable timeframes for CS partners; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Consultation: CS partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and negotiated case-by-case.
