# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview: Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys from 1978 to 2007. Emphasizes the link between sampling design, environmental stratification, and national/regional habitat estimates.

## Purpose and core concepts

- Purpose: To stratify field sampling across Great Britain so that ecological surveys are representative and enable robust national and country-level estimates of habitat features.
- Key concepts:
  - Stratified, random sampling to reduce bias and capture variability across land types.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes used to define land classes; classes underpin sampling strata.
  - Sample units: 1 km squares (with surrounding squares helping classify and map).
  - National estimates: derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each land class with the total area of that class.
  - Evolution of classification: early versions were refined to allow country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales, etc.) and to improve regional/local estimates.

## 1978 – Initial Land Classification and first field survey

- Classification: 32 land classes created using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on environmental variables; based on 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified).
- Sampling: 8 squares per land class; total 256 squares surveyed.
- Estimation: national habitat areas calculated as the mean habitat area per square in each land class multiplied by the land class area.
- Output basis: early national estimates published in related literature.

## 1984 – Second field survey

- Expansion: sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
- Continuity: used the 1978 Land Classification as the framework for national estimates.
- Purpose: improved precision and ability to detect change over time.

## 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey

- Change: Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares (not just a sample of centre squares); urban and sea corrections added.
- Sampling: 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats recorded; full data from 1984 plus new measurements.
- Estimation approach: national estimates based on the updated All Squares classification; transition to using a comprehensive GB dataset for classification.

## 1990 – 2000 developments (UK-wide refinement)

- Motivation: policy needs to extend classification to all GB squares; ensure regional and local estimations are viable and representative.
- Method: substitute classification for the entire GB dataset using surrogates for climatic/geological/physiographic factors; some squares reclassified.
- Implications: some classes under-represented; distribution across land classes distorted; adjustments documented and considered in subsequent surveys.

## 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) and new country-focused reporting

- Separate country estimates: move toward England & Wales vs Scotland reporting, requiring country-specific representation.
- Framework changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; total strata increased from 32 to 40.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country; minimum 6 squares per class.
  - Wales-specific adjustments: Land Class 17 sub-divided to reflect Wales’ dominant land types; Wales allocated extra squares (including 43 additional squares overall for Wales).
  - Isle of Man: removed from country-unit estimates; replaced with new England squares.
- Upland habitat module: added 30 squares focused on uplands, improving accuracy for upland estimates in England and Wales.
- Summary data: large-scale tables (Table 2) detailing square distribution and sampling rates; maps illustrating the revised classifications.

## 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) and Wales-only reporting

- Wales reporting needs intensified after devolution; further Welsh adjustments implemented.
- Welsh sub-divisions: five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) created to reflect Wales-specific land classifications; total strata increased to 45.
- Additional Wales squares: 43 extra squares added to Wales to ensure adequate representation; minimum 6 squares per Welsh class.
- England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) left with only 4 squares per class to maintain overall sampling efficiency; precision deemed acceptable based on scoping studies.
- England, Wales, Scotland maps updated to reflect revised framework (Figure 6; Figure 7).
- Table 3 provides a detailed summary of CS2007 square counts by class and country.
- Outcome: Wales-only results enhanced; overall UK results maintained with a country-aware framework.

## Note on national estimates and comparability

- National estimates: Changing the classification framework affects the consistency of stock estimates across surveys. Approaches differ:
  - Use latest country-specific classification for national estimates within each survey.
  - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey consistency (at times preferred for cross-survey comparability).
- Table 4 (Original vs. New Classification): Documents the number of squares per class across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 to illustrate impacts on estimates and sampling design.

## Outputs, limitations, and challenges

- Data outputs: Detailed survey results, habitat area estimates, and maps for England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales; country-specific esterimates supported by expanded sampling and upland modules.
- Challenges:
  - Balancing representativeness with the need for country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).
  - Representing underrepresented classes due to reclassification and sampling allocation changes.
  - Ensuring adequate sample sizes for reliable estimates at regional and upland scales.
- Takeaway for analysts: The Sampling Strategy demonstrates a careful evolution of stratification, data collection, and estimation methods to support robust, country-specific habitat assessments over time, while acknowledging trade-offs in comparability across survey waves.
