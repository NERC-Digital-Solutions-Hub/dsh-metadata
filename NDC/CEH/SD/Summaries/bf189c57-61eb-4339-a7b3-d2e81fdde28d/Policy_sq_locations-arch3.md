# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets rules to maximise public use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.

## CS Partners (as of policy)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Maintains scientific integrity of sampling and future permission to survey land.
- Aims to preserve the ability to inform environmental policy reliably.

## Release and precision: what may be released and how
- Data can indicate whether CS squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the corresponding 10x10 km grid square.
- Six-digit grid references can be released only in very exceptional circumstances after CEH processing to avoid direct release; requires demonstration that associated IP/data is equally confidential.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could, by themselves, help identify square locations and therefore are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed in writing at licence end.
- No data should be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to verify landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, and include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; approvals signed by senior authority.
- If access is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses to facilitate use within CS partnership; other organisations’ requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as agreed.

## Practical guidance for monitoring framework authors
- Balances data utility for policy monitoring with confidentiality requirements.
- Requires careful data governance, licensing, and secure data handling.
- Encourages collaboration with CEH for data processing and access planning.
- Highlights the importance of metadata clarity, access controls, and explicit use limitations to protect site confidentiality.
