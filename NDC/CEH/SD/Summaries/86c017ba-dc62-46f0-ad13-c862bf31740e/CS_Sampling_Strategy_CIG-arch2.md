# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Aims to provide a consistent, time-series basis to monitor environmental condition and policy performance, using stratified, random sampling and standardized outputs (maps, charts, reports).
- Emphasizes data quality, comparability, and a framework that supports national and country-specific estimates.

## Core Concepts and Approach
- Stratified sampling to ensure representativeness and reduce bias, using objective (often random) selection within discrete strata.
- The sampling unit is the 1 km square; the sampling frame has historically used the centre square of a 15 × 15 km grid, with additional surrounding squares classified to each centre.
- Land Classification provides the stratification: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) define classes that guide sample allocation.
- National estimates are derived by combining class-level statistics (e.g., mean habitat area per square) with the total area of each class.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the Countryside Survey (CS) Framework
- 1978 – The Beginning
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to form 32 Land Classes from environmental attributes across 1228 centre 1 km squares.
  - Eight samples per class were selected to form a national, stratified sample (total 256 squares).
  - Habitat-area estimates for GB derived from class proportions and square-level data.
- 1984 – Second GB Land-Use Survey
  - Sample size increased: 12 squares per class (total 384); eight previously visited squares retained.
  - Focus shifted to land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping; results published later.
- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First Land Cover Map of GB linked to CS1990; all features recorded as in 1984 plus repeat quadrats.
  - National estimates based on the all-squares classification; groundwork for policy-relevant reporting.
- 1998 – Revised Land Classification for CS1990
  - Classification extended to classify every GB square; 40 classes were defined.
  - Computational limitations led to using surrogates for some squares; results compared with the original classification.
  - Implications for national estimates acknowledged; some distortion in class representation across the country.
- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs for separate England, Scotland, and Wales reporting; introduced separate country estimates.
  - Land Classes restructured into country-unit versions; total strata increased to 40 (with aggregations where necessary).
  - 19 additional squares added to improve representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling module introduced to boost upland accuracy.
- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-focused reporting requirements drove further adjustments.
  - Wales subdivided into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata rose to 45.
  - Additional squares: 43 extra squares in Wales to ensure adequate representation; England adjusted to maintain overall balance (some English classes retained with 4 squares).
  - Wales-only and Wales-with-EnglandReporting enhanced; upland sampling module continued to refine country-specific estimates.

## Sampling Framework Details
- Sample Allocation and Class Structure
  - Early: 32 Land Classes; CS1990 expanded to 40; CS2007 to 45 strata with country-unit subdivisions.
  - Class sub-divisions created country-specific classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to enable Wales-only reporting.
- Country and Regional Estimates
  - CS1990: national estimates irrespective of country boundaries.
  - CS2000 and CS2007: country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) with adjustments to ensure adequate representation within each country.
  - Additional sampling to improve Wales representation and upland habitat precision; Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced in England.
- Upland Habitat Module
  - CS2000 included an uplands module with 30 extra squares in upland/marginal zones to improve precision for upland habitats.
- Data Outputs and Outputs Management
  - Outputs include habitat-area estimates, landscape-change statistics, and related outputs suitable for reports, maps, and charts.
  - The framework supports standardised data storage and dissemination through national projects and portals.
- Important Considerations for National Estimates
  - Changing the Land Classification can affect consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
  - Two approaches: using the latest country-specific classification or maintaining the original classification for cross-survey consistency; the former is preferred for survey-specific consistency, while the latter aids cross-survey comparability.

## Beginning, Middle, and End: What Changes Who, and Why
- The Sampling Strategy has evolved from a simple 32-class system with eight samples per class to a nuanced, country-specific, multi-class framework (up to 45 strata) that supports Wales-only and upland reporting.
- The changes have been driven by:
  - The need for country-specific environmental policy reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).
  - The requirement for finer resolution in Wales and upland areas.
  - Technological and data challenges in classifying every GB square with the original detail.
- The strategy maintains core principles of stratified random sampling, representativeness, and standardized outputs, while expanding and refining the framework to support multiple national perspectives and improved precision.
