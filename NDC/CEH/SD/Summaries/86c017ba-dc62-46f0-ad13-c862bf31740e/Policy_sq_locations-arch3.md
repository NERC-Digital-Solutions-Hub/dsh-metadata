# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to Countryside Survey (CS) survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest value of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## CS Partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey access permissions.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## Access and release circumstances
- Approximate location: four-digit grid references released under licence to indicate 10x10 km grid area.
- Precise locations (six-digit grid references): only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations; external release requires demonstration that associated data/methods carry equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features): release subject to same exceptional-circumstance terms as six-digit locations.

## Licensing terms and data handling
- Licensees must: preserve confidentiality, store securely, restrict access to named individuals, use for defined projects, and not retain data beyond the license period.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Prohibited uses: any activity that could compromise square confidentiality, including planning visits or checking landowner compliance.
- Provisions may require evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: similar terms to six-digit, but do not require the same depth of IP confidentiality.
- License clauses prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to identify squares from data.

## Roles and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licenses; approvals documented with terms.
- If access is denied, CEH supports decision under FOI/Environmental Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licensing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Pre-processing support: CEH aims to assist internal CS initiatives within moderate demand; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partner organizations are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by the policy to define requirements and ensure appropriate use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

## Practical guidance for users
- Consider engaging CEH early to determine feasibility and required safeguards.
- For internal use, anticipate pre-processing by CEH; for external requests, be prepared for case-by-case assessment and licensing conditions.
