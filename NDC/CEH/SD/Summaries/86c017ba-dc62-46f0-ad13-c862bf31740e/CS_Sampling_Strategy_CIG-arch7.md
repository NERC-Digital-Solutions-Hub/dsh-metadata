# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview and purpose
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its role as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) fieldwork from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasises that modern CS methodology is tightly linked to earlier classification work and that understanding the history is essential for interpreting time-series data.
- Highlights the use of stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological and land-use variation across Great Britain.

## The ITE Land Classification and stratification
- The Land Classification groups land into discrete classes (initially 32 in 1978) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to capture ecological variation.
- Stratification aims to reduce sampling bias by ensuring all parts of the population (land types) are represented.
- Early method used a center 1 km square within a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding four squares were assigned to the same class to bolster representation.
- Classes are descriptive and used to estimate national habitat areas by weighting class area with mean habitat area per class square.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and CS sampling by year

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
- 32 Land Classes derived from 1228 classified 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid); the center square plus surrounding squares formed the initial classification.
- 8 km² per class were surveyed, totaling 256 squares.
- National habitat estimates were calculated from class-level means multiplied by class-area proportions.

### 1984 – Second field survey
- Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384); eight squares previously visited were retained.
- National estimates re-derived using the 1978 classification framework.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
- Land Classification expanded to cover every 1 km square in GB (more comprehensive framework).
- 508 squares were surveyed; repeat vegetation sampling from 1978 and 1984 was included.
- Resulted in a revision to align with a land-class map where every square could be classified.

### 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification for CS2000
- To enable regional and local estimates, the classification was extended to classify every GB square using proxy surrogates for climatic/geologic factors.
- Several classification attempts were tested; best match to original classes achieved with limited reclassification, though some class representations shifted regionally.
- CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) to address policy needs and ensure robust country-specific reporting.

### 2007 – Wales-specific reporting and further refinements
- Wales required dedicated Wales-only habitat reporting; existing Welsh sample (64 squares) was deemed insufficient for Wales-only estimates.
- Class sub-divisions created for country units (England and Wales) resulting in 45 strata (up from 40).
- Additional Welsh squares (43) were added to ensure adequate representation; English squares remained largely unchanged except for a couple of low-representation classes.
- Wales-specific upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland estimates.
- The CS2007 sampling framework is depicted with revised country-specific Land Classes and sample square distributions.

## Sampling framework and numbers
- Tables and figures (CS1978–CS2007) detail the number of squares and sampling rates by class, country, and survey year.
- Country-level sampling adjustments: introduction of country-unit Land Classes, class sub-division, and aggregation to maintain minimum squares per class per country.
- Upland module: targeted sampling to improve accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Wales, uplands, and country-specific considerations
- Wales required more intensive sampling and distinct country-unit classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to support Wales-only reporting.
- Wales gained additional squares and class subdivisions to ensure adequate representation of Welsh land-cover types.
- An upland habitat module was added in CS2000 and maintained in CS2007 to improve estimates in upland areas.

## National estimates and data interpretation
- Estimates are produced by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
- Changing the Land Classification across surveys affects cross-survey comparability; the 2006 scoping study recommends using the latest country-specific classification for consistency within a survey, while older classifications provide cross-survey consistency.
- Tables illustrate how sample sizes and strata counts evolved over time, and how the distribution of samples across Land Classes impacts national and country-level estimates.

## Practical implications for GIS specialists
- The Land Classification serves as a foundational GIS stratification framework; updates to the classification require careful handling to maintain time-series comparability.
- Spatial mapping of sample squares, land-class maps, and country-unit classifications are essential for producing country-specific habitat estimates.
- When integrating CS data, be mindful of the year-specific classification version (1978 vs. 1990 vs. 2000 vs. 2007) used; recoding squares to the corresponding class definitions is necessary for accurate temporal analyses.
- Upland and Wales-focused modules introduce additional layers of detail that may affect GIS analyses and reporting.
