# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

## Overview
- A handbook of guidelines for field surveying within a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
- Acknowledges variability and force majeure in real-world conditions; deviations should be recorded.
- Objective: obtain a consistent, broad ecological assessment across the square using standardized procedures.
- Data collected includes vegetation, soils, habitats, land use, boundaries, and associated features; keys to species and land-use categories are provided.

## Sampling Design and Scope
- Square-based framework: aims for a representative, consistent ecological picture across each kilometre square.
- Data collection components within each square:
  - Five randomly located vegetation plots (200 m each).
  - Five randomly located soil pits (centered on the vegetation plots).
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the entire square.
- Data collection aims to facilitate later synthesis and comparison across squares, with standardized terminology and coding.

## Plot Location, Setup, and Permissions
- On arrival, obtain landowners’ permission and ownership details when possible; limit disturbance.
- Plot location method:
  - Use five posts to form the square’s diagonals; center located by navigating from a nearby map reference with a compass.
  - If necessary, determine position by stepping from nearest unambiguous map feature; avoid overemphasis on exact pinpointing since samples are random within the square.
  - Mark plots on maps and relocate if they would overlap with roads, buildings, or safety hazards.
- Random plots are pre-marked on maps; alterations require careful documentation.

## Vegetation Plots: Data Capture and Sampling
- Vegetation data collected from inner quadrats outward, recording all vascular plants and a restricted list of bryophytes and lichens.
- Species data:
  - Documentation of principal species with cover estimates in 5% categories.
  - Record only additional (new) species beyond those already listed; avoid over- or under-estimation.
  - If plots fall within cropped fields, record edge species along hedgerows or tracks.
- Plot description highlights slope and aspect; data sheets guide habitat attributes and species recording.
- Handling of difficult identifications: collect specimens as needed; note any uncertainties on the data sheet.

## Habitat Descriptions and Coding
- Plot-level habitat attributes include:
  - Vegetation categories (e.g., woodland types, grassland, heath, moorland, arable, etc.).
  - Woodland structure (hardwood, conifer, mixed, isolated trees, coppice, regeneration, dead trees, glades, shelter belts, etc.).
  - Agricultural and land-use types (meadow, pasture, cereal, root crops, other arable, horticulture, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens, orchards, recreation areas, drainage, rubbish).
  - Boundaries and linear features (roads, tracks, hedges with subcategories for hedge condition and composition).
  - Ground features (cliffs, rocks, scree, soils, peat, streams, ponds, rivers, lakes, ditches, reservoirs, etc.).
  - Animal and human-use features (domestic animals, bird/habitat notes, buildings, vernacular architecture, roadways, pylons, rubbish dumps).
- Sketch maps document habitat and land-use layout; extensive notes are encouraged to capture relevant details for interpretation.

## Soil Pit Methodology and Data
- Soil pits are centered on the vegetation plot quarter with light considerations and practical avoidance of obstructions.
- Pit dimensions and soil horizon work:
  - Typical pit roughly 45–60 cm wide and up to 60 cm long; deeper in some soil groups.
  - Dig until reaching a B, C, or R horizon (up to ~75 cm) and describe horizons by color, texture, structure, roots, organic matter, moisture, and other features.
  - End face aligned with maximum light for horizon description; horizons are physically distinguished and recorded with markers.
- Data collected per horizon (example fields):
  - Horizon thickness, moisture status, color, mottles, texture, structure, stone content, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and any notable features.
  - Sampling of surface horizons and shallow underlying horizons when appropriate.
- Soil data sheets and horizon symbol sheets guide systematic recording and coding.

## Linear Features and Field Sampling
- Linear plots along hedges, streams, and roads are placed in direct line from the two most widely spaced plots on the feature.
- Measurement approach uses a 1-m stick to trace lines, with plots marked on maps.
- Species data collection mirrors that of large quadrats, with emphasis on principal species and hedge vegetation where relevant.

## Documentation, Sketch Maps, and Additional Observations
- Sketch maps: annotate crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, woodlands, and other features; write names directly on the map copies.
- Domestic animals and habitat notes: farmer engagement is encouraged for breed and habitat detail; simple keys are provided for breed identification.
- Buildings and vernacular architecture: record the type (vernacular/local vs non-local) and condition when encountered; note architecture details where useful.
- Additional comments sections are provided to amplify key points and ensure clarity.

## Data Quality, Completeness, and Management
- Emphasis on capturing information with as much detail as possible, documenting deviations, and avoiding omissions.
- After fieldwork, verify all data sheets are complete, clipped together, and ready for processing.
- A comprehensive project checklist (Project 424) guides equipment, data sheets, and field procedures to ensure consistency and traceability.

## Appendices and Coding Guidance (Key Points)
- Horizon symbol, colour, moisture, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, and soil group coding schemes are standardized for cross-square comparability.
- Extensive species, bryophyte, and lichen identification lists and aggregates are provided to support consistent taxonomic coding.
- Land classes and upland classifications offer categorical context for landscape interpretation and comparability across squares and regions.

## Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
- The document exemplifies a tightly codified data collection regime with explicit definitions, categories, and data sheets, facilitating consistency and comparability.
- Critical governance needs include:
  - Maintaining a comprehensive data dictionary and codebooks for all categories (habitats, soils, boundaries, species groups, land-use classes).
  - Documenting deviations and variations from standard methods with rationale to preserve provenance.
  - Ensuring consistent plot IDs, square identifiers, dates, and land-owner/permission metadata for traceability and reuse.
  - Preserving both qualitative (descriptions, notes) and quantitative (cover percentages, horizon measurements) data in well-structured formats, enabling later aggregation and analysis.
  - Capturing methodological context (location precision, permission status, safety considerations) to support reproducibility and data integrity.
  - Aligning field forms and checklists (e.g., Project 424) to enable rigorous data quality checks and efficient data ingestion.
