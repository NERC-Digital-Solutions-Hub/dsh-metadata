# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- The Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future surveying permissions.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Data release and precision levels
- Location transparency: approximate identification possible to determine if squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: allowed under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: released only under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess to avoid direct release, under strict conditions.
- Spatial data inside squares (maps of habitats, etc.): equivalent confidentiality; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Exceptional access criteria
- External release of precise location data requires demonstration that the requester’s IP/confidentiality needs are equal or higher than CS data, and cannot be processed by CEH.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to authorised individuals.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits, monitor landowner compliance, or identify exact square locations.
- For four-digit releases, IP confidentiality criteria are less stringent than for six-digit releases.
- If needed, a licence includes a clause preventing identification or derivation of precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with confidentiality clauses; licences require senior sign-off.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising access applications, decisions, and rationale.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult CEH before committing to datacovered by this policy; CEH involvement may be via collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.
