# Countryside Survey:
Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- Purpose
  - Document the digitization and data rescue of the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to enable a continuous, long-term time series (1978–2007) of Broad Habitats across Great Britain.
  - Create a GIS-ready dataset to analyse habitat stock and change, supporting environmental monitoring, policy scrutiny, and future decision-making.

- Data, timeline, and management
  - Original field records: hard copy land-cover and landscape feature data from 1977/78, 1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007.
  - 1978 maps (256 squares) digitized for the first time in 2009; digitized maps stored in a CEH Lancaster GIS.
  - 1984/1990/1998/2007 line work aligned with subsequent datasets to ensure comparability, with 1978 digitization evaluated for consistency.
  - Data rescue expands the GB time series, enabling analysis of Broad Habitat stock back to 1978 and linking with coincident plant species and soil data (pH, Loss on Ignition).

- Methodology and data handling
  - 1978 field codes translated to BAP Broad Habitats (per Jackson 2000); ambiguous allocations resolved using original annotated maps and available vegetation data.
  - Broad Habitat allocations include some Priority Habitats (Coastal Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture).
  - Data processing involved digitization according to a predefined protocol, followed by quality checks against original field maps and cross-year validation.
  - Spatial confidentiality maintained by masking precise square locations in public-facing figures; maps manipulated to prevent square identification.
  - Data governance: metadata enhancement and open sharing of underlying data are pursued to ensure transparency and reuse.

- Data quality, validation, and challenges
  - Key concerns: potential inconsistencies between surveyors, interpretation bias during transfer to base maps, absence of contemporaneous QA in 1978.
  - Validation approach: visual and data-driven comparisons between 1978 and later years, cross-checks with species data, and expert reviews; results indicate high consistency and real change detection is reliable.
  - Digitization and classification complexities: upland codes and some grassland categories were difficult to allocate; methodology accommodated mosaic options and refined allocations where possible.
  - Data comparability caveats: 1978 estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differences in Land Classification schemes (1990 All Squares vs 2007 classification) and sample size limitations.

- Broad Habitat allocations and classification evolution
  - 1978 mapping used 80 field codes; these were mapped to Broad Habitats with careful review, particularly for ambiguous categories.
  - Evolution of land classifications over time: 15x15 km sampling grid; 1980s refinement to All Squares (1990) with expanded classes; further refinements (40 classes in 1998; 45 classes in 2007) to support regional reporting (Scotland, Wales, etc.).
  - Allocation notes: some upland categories difficult to delineate; some minor codes required re-interpretation using plant/soil data; a few areas allocated to Priority Habitats based on available data.

- Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
  - Presentation of 1978 national stock estimates for selected Broad Habitats (in thousands of hectares) across GB.
  - Important caveats:
    - Estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to different land classifications and class aggregations.
    - Small sample size (256 squares) and retrospective allocation to later classifications affect direct comparability.
    - Some habitat categories show methodological differences (e.g., 1978 vs 1990 vs 2007 classifications) and may require careful adjustment when analyzing change.
  - Example results (selected habitats):
    - Arable and Horticulture: mean ~5105 thousand ha; lower/upper bounds indicate substantial uncertainty due to classification changes.
    - Improved Grassland: mean ~5188 thousand ha.
    - Bog: mean ~2004 thousand ha; substantial upper/lower bounds reflect sampling and classification differences.
    - Urban: mean ~1441 thousand ha; suitability affected by being treated as a constant in some estimates.
  - Comparisons with earlier publications (Bunce & Heal 1984; Barr et al. 1993) show differences mainly due to changing classifications and allocation approaches; supporting notes explain likely causes.

- Interpretive notes and methodological comparisons
  - Reasons for differences with earlier published data include:
    - Incompatibilities between Broad Habitat allocations and earlier Reporting Classes.
    - Ambiguities in polygon-to-habitat allocations that were sometimes edited for consistency with later data.
    - Transition from the 1978 ITE Land Classification to the revised All Squares/1990 framework.
  - Specific habitat notes address overestimation or misclassification in earlier studies (e.g., Boundary and Linear Features, Arable and Horticulture, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Urban) and how these were reconciled or explained.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Extends the Countryside Survey time series back to 1978, strengthening capability for detecting long-term habitat change and assessing land-use impacts on ecological variation.
  - Highlights need for consistent, well-documented classification schemes and robust metadata to enable cross-year comparability.
  - Demonstrates value of data rescue for policy evaluation, where historical baselines underpin assessment of policy-driven change and environmental health indicators.
  - Underlines governance considerations: data sharing, provenance, QA, and transparent documentation of mapping decisions are essential to maximize utility for monitoring frameworks.

- Appendices and supporting materials
  - Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup Table (translation between 1978 descriptions and Broad Habitat allocations; examples include Improved Grassland, Neutral Grassland, Calcareous Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath, etc.).
  - Appendix III: Summary of the ITE Land Classification evolution and flowchart for national estimates.
  - Additional references and methodological context on field mapping, sampling strategy, and habitat classifications.

- Conclusion
  - The 1978 data rescue successfully digitized and validated the primary land-cover maps, enabling inclusion of 1978 data in the Countryside Survey time series.
  - This enhances long-term monitoring of Broad Habitats across GB and supports more robust policy evaluation, while also acknowledging limitations arising from historical classification schemes and sample size.
