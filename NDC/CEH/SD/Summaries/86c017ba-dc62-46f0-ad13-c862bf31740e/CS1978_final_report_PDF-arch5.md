# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- A data rescue project to digitize the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps (256 1km squares) into a GIS, enabling integration with later survey years (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and extending a 30-year time series.
- Provides a digitized, spatially explicit dataset that links Broad Habitats with coincident plant species and soil data, enhancing analyses of land-use change and ecological variation.
- Data stored and managed by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) with provenance and quality checks to support reuse and discovery.

## Scope and Data Lifecycle
- Background: 1978 field records were at risk and existed only in hard copy; digitization adds a new, analysable dataset for long-term habitat stock assessment.
- Outcome: A new digital dataset enabling national-scale comparisons back to 1978, while maintaining linkage to later survey classifications and methodologies.

## Digitization and Storage
- Materials digitized: 256 1km survey square maps and associated plot data sheets; maps scanned to .jpg and .pdf formats.
- Digitization work: Conducted by ADAS in summer 2009 following a defined protocol; digital maps stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.
- Data backups and originals: Originals housed in fire-safe storage; electronic backups created; primary field data organized in Field Assessment Book (FAB) boxes.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial quality checks: Verified against original field maps to identify omissions, queries, or digitizing errors.
- Cross-year consistency: Each square from 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 was compiled on separate sheets to assess real changes versus error.
- Anonymization: Survey squares were spatially manipulated to prevent identification, preserving scientific integrity while enabling comparative analyses.
- Outcome: 1978 dataset judged to be of comparable quality and consistency to other Countryside Survey datasets, supporting direct change analyses in future work.

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Classification
- Objective: Translate 1978 codes to Broad Habitat Allocations (BH) with careful handling of ambiguous categories.
- Process: Used original habitat maps with annotated species and vegetation plot data to clarify allocations; performed visual checks for each square.
- Challenges:
  - Upland codes and heterogeneity complicate precise allocations (potential use of “Mosaic” in some areas).
  - Some codes (e.g., 23 Herb-rich pasture) required cross-referencing to determine correct BH (Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, etc.).
  - Inland Rock overestimation due to 1978 primary coding; later years recorded as secondary codes.
  - 1978-to-later-year translations not always straightforward for certain grassland and upland categories.
  - Priority Habitats (e.g., Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) identifiable where data allowed.

## Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications
- Background: 1978 analyses used the original ITE Land Classification (1228 squares, with most centered 15x15 km grid squares); a broader All Squares classification was developed in 1990.
- Data lineage: National estimates were originally calculated using different classification schemes across years (1978 vs. 1990 All Squares; later refinements to 40 and then 45 classes).
- Implications: Cross-year comparability is affected by changes in classification schemes; the 1978 results are not directly comparable to the later 2007 results without accounting for classification differences.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Provides stock estimates for Great Britain across a subset of Broad Habitats (as reported in the 2007 survey).
- Important caveats:
  - Estimates are not directly comparable to 1984, 1990, 1998, or 2007 outputs due to differing Land Classifications (32 vs. 45 classes) and retrospective allocations.
  - Acknowledges that adding 1978 to the time series can slightly alter later-year results.
  - For some habitats, limited sample sizes necessitated use of older classifications, reducing direct comparability.
- Example results listed for multiple habitats (areas in thousands of hectares and percentage of GB).

## Comparability and Interpretation Notes
- Differences with earlier published datasets (Bunce & Heal 1984; Barr et al. 1993) arise from:
  - Inconsistent reporting classes versus the later all-squares classifications.
  - Allocation difficulties for certain habitat types and potential reallocation during validation.
  - Use of revised All Squares classifications (1990) in this dataset, aligning more with Barr et al. (1993) than Bunce & Heal (1984).
- Specific habitat notes highlight over- or under-estimation tendencies related to 1978 classification and the ambiguous nature of some habitat categories.

## Appendices and Metadata
- Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup Table (maps 1978 descriptions to Broad Habitat Allocations; details for multiple categories and cross-walks).
- Appendix III: Summary of the ITE Land Classification evolution.
- Maps and habitat classifications linked to the 1978 data rescue for user-reference and reproducibility.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Demonstrates a robust data rescue workflow: preservation, digitization, GIS integration, and cross-year validation to enable long-term analyses.
- Highlights the importance of clear provenance, documentation of classifications, and explicit notes on comparability when reconciling historical datasets with newer frameworks.
- Emphasizes ongoing data governance considerations:
  - Clear metadata and codebooks for 1978 Broad Habitat allocations and their crosswalks to later classifications.
  - Documentation of QA processes and human-in-the-loop validation decisions.
  - Transparent discussion of biases, limitations, and uncertainties inherent in legacy data and classification changes.
  - Accessibility through CEH GIS repositories with de-identified square identifiers to protect scientific integrity while enabling reuse.
