# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Objective: obtain an overall ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square in a consistent, repeatable way, despite variable terrain and conditions.
- Data types collected:
  - Vegetation: five 200 m vegetation plots per square, with a progression from inner quadrat to additional species; notes on dominant habitat categories and broad ecological information for the square.
  - Soil: five randomly located soil pits (in the centre of the vegetation plots) to describe horizons and soil properties.
  - Linear features: linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows to capture habitat along features.
  - Whole-square data: broad ecological information for the entire kilometre square; included keys to information (e.g., CowS and Sheep) for consistency.
- Outputs produced:
  - Data sheets and plots for vegetation, soils, and linear features.
  - Sketch maps recording crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and habitat information.
  - Kilometre-square sheets and checklists to ensure comprehensive coverage and data quality.

- Permissions and field setup:
  - On arrival, obtain landowner permission and ownership details when possible; highlight minimal disturbance and short visit duration.
  - Record ownership and official notes at the end of the relevant data sheets.
  - Some plots may use nearby farm fields for soil pits; document exceptions.

- Plot location and layout:
  - Vegetation plot: 200 m square defined by five posts; diagonals aligned carefully, with directional strings to mark extent.
  - Centers determined by objective placement: navigate from the nearest map feature to the plot center using a compass; minor adjustments for terrain.
  - Plots are random within the square; marked on maps to avoid linear features; relocate if necessary to avoid roads, tracks, hedgerows, or gardens.
  - Five randomised plots are fixed on the map; any alteration should be carefully recorded.

- Vegetation recording:
  - Species recorded progressively from inner quadrat; all vascular plants and restricted bryophytes/lichens noted; vegetation categories include broad classes such as woodland, scrub, grassland, moorland, arable, and others.
  - Cover estimates are categorized within 5% intervals; note dominant species and multiple layers where present.
  - If plots fall in cropped fields, edge species from hedgerows or tracks may be used; accuracy for crops is acknowledged as challenging but necessary for a fuller square picture.

- Plot description and habitats:
  - Habitat data begin with slope measurement (highest to lowest point in the square) using a pole-based setup; aspect noted along the same line.
  - Data sheets contain numerous attributes with guidance notes and problem-solving tips for difficult categories; a sample data sheet is referenced.

- Data sheets and coding:
  - Extensive data sheets for plot-level information (vegetation, soils, horizons, moisture, colour, mottles, texture, structure, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, soil group, parent material, comments).
  - Horizon data: horizon number, thickness, symbol, moisture, colour, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans.
  - Soil sampling: surface horizon sampling, with rules for selecting deeper horizons when the surface is thin; 200 mm samples collected as directed.
  - Horizon and color codes are standardized; guidance for how to indicate uncertainties (e.g., question marks).

- Soil pits:
  - Pit location: center of the quadrat within the designated quarter; if obstructed, relocate to specific string endpoints unless entirely blocked.
  - Pit dimensions: typically 45–60 cm wide and 1 m long, depth to horizon C, Cr, or R (up to 75 cm if needed).
  - Horizon boundaries marked with markers; horizons described with standard descriptors and notes.

- Linear features:
  - Pits not used for linear plots; linear plots are 10 x 1 m transects located along hedges, streams, and roads.
  - Data collection along features uses the same species identifications as the larger plots; principal species cover estimated for hedges and streams.

- Mapping and boundaries:
  - Where possible, boundaries and walls/fences are marked directly on maps to enable later measurement.
  - If not possible, provide an overall estimate; categories cover historical and current condition (e.g., old vs new mortar, wall types, hedgerow status).
  - Hedgerow and boundary categories include hedgerow continuity, management, gaps, and presence of trees or shrubs.

- Crops, habitats, and other elements:
  - Crops (agriculture and horticulture) are categorized; farmer comments and crop varieties may be added.
  - Sketch maps require recording crops, hedgerows, boundaries, and habitat composition; notes should help future interpretation without clutter.

- Domestic animals and habitats:
  - Documentation includes domestic animals and breeds; practice is to identify breeds with keys and reference materials; where uncertain, describe more generally and attach notes or imagery.

- Appendices and reference materials:
  - Horizon symbol legend and color/texture/structure keys.
  - Species identification guidelines and aggregate coding lists, including representative taxa and example codes for plants (e.g., bryophytes, lichens) and common species.
  - Bryophyte and lichen identifications for field use.
  - Vegetation and habitat category notes, including land classes with descriptive guidance and illustrative examples.

- Land classes and regional guidance:
  - Preliminary notes on land classes (e.g., Central South, South-east downs, Plaing, etc.) provide landscape-type guidance and variability for interpretation across regions.
  - Emphasis on capturing the full range of variation within each land class while remaining practical for field data collection.

- End-of-survey process:
  - After completing plots and kilometre-square data, verify that all sheets are complete and the data are clean.
  - Compile a concise description of the square, noting notable features, hedgerows, and land cover to aid interpretation.
  - Use back-of-book summaries for quick reference to land classes and modifications.

- Overall Data Support implications:
  - The Handbook embodies a rigorous, standardized data collection framework suitable for integration into data products, dashboards, and cross-square analyses.
  - Potential challenges include dealing with patchy data, varying formats, and the need for clear metadata to ensure outputs are self-serve and reusable by end users.
