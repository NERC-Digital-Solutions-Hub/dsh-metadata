# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partner organisations
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Public-interest rationale: confidentiality supports ongoing survey capability and reliable environmental policy insights.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and what level of precision can be released
- Access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; requester must demonstrate in legal terms that their IP/data protection needs are equal or higher than CS data, and CEH would need to process data instead of releasing directly.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) could potentially identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- In all cases, data releases must not enable locating squares for visits or landowner compliance checks.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals for a defined project.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor individual landowners' compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality threshold.
- Licences for spatial data and four-digit releases include a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences, signed by an authorised representative of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Analysts and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy (benefits may include collaborative scientific input; arrangements may involve collaboration or payment).

## Practical implications for analysts monitoring the environment
- Access to precise CS locations is controlled and requires licensing via CEH/NERC.
- Where possible, use four-digit or processed data to avoid disclosing exact locations; otherwise, anticipate a rigorous licensing process and potential pre-processing by CEH.
- Ensure compliance with confidentiality, data handling, destruction, and governance requirements; avoid using data to facilitate visits or landowner monitoring without explicit authorization.
- Consider engaging with CEH early to define requirements, understand licensing terms, and explore possible pre-processing support.
