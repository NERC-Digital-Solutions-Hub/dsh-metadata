# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Global long-term dataset: Countryside Survey tracks land-cover and landscape features across Great Britain at multiple intervals (1977/78, 1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007).
- 1978 maps digitised for the first time, creating a new digital dataset that extends the time series back to 1978.
- Provides a robust basis for estimating stock and change in Broad Habitats over 30 years and analyzing drivers of ecological variation.

## Purpose and Methods
- Digitization: 1978 maps scanned and digitised in 2009; GIS-based storage at CEH Lancaster; linked with other years.
- Data preparation: 1978 field codes allocated to BAP Broad Habitats; where ambiguous, used habitat maps, vegetation plots, and species/soil data (pH, LOI) for clarification.
- Data outputs: Generation of national estimates of Broad Habitat stock for 1978, enabling future time-series analyses with later surveys.
- Data management: Primary source records stored securely; data are prepared for analysis and portal submission.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial QA: Checked for omissions and digitizing errors against original field maps.
- Cross-year validation: Compared 1978 squares with 1984, 1990, etc., to distinguish real change from error; assessments conducted with staff involved in the 1978 survey.
- Outcome: 1978 data judged to be of quality and consistency comparable to other Countryside Survey datasets, supporting direct comparisons in future work.

## Digitization Process
- Maps: Digitised from 1978 line work; 1984/1990/1998/2007 line work aligned for consistency, with the 1978 dataset digitised independently but found to be highly consistent with other years.
- Storage: Digitized maps and plot sheets stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster; original hard copies retained in field assessment boxes for reference.

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Issues
- Allocation: Most 1978 codes mapped straightforwardly to Broad Habitats; ambiguous cases resolved using original maps and vegetation data.
- Key issues:
  - Upland codes and mosaic habitats are difficult to delineate.
  - Calcareous Grassland vs Herb Rich Pasture, Inland Rock distinctions, and pragmatic handling of urban areas.
  - Some 1978 codes mapped to multiple potential Broad Habitats; final allocation used supporting data.
- Priority Habitats: Where identifiable, some areas linked to Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture).

## ITE Land Classifications and Classification Evolution
- 1978 framework: Used original ITE Land Classification with 1215 squares; Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) defined 32 classes across 6039 squares used for national estimates.
- 1990 onward: All Squares classification expanded (32 to 40 classes, then to 45 by 2007) and regionally separated (Scotland, Wales) for national estimates.
- Implications: Cross-year comparability is affected by changes in classification schemes; direct 1978-2007 comparisons require careful mapping between classifications.

## 1978 National Estimates
- Presents stock of Broad Habitats for Great Britain in 1978 (not all figures directly comparable with 2007 results due to classification and sampling differences).
- Example stocks (mean area in thousands of hectares and %GB):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5105k ha (21.9%)
  - Improved Grassland: ~5188k ha (22.3%)
  - Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995k ha (4.3%)
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~1413k ha (6.1%)
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1677k ha (7.2%)
  - Bog: ~2004k ha (8.6%)
  - Urban: ~1441k ha (6.2%)
  - Other Land: ~249k ha (1.1%)
  - Total Area: ~23,313k ha (100%)
- Notes on comparability:
  - Differences with earlier publications (Bunce & Heal 1984; Barr et al. 1993) arise from classification changes, allocation uncertainties, and years’ methodological shifts.
  - Some habitat classes are not directly equivalent across publications due to evolving reporting classifications.

## Notes on Specific Habitats
- Boundary/Linear Features: Older methods tended to overestimate small habitats; reconciliation with 1978 data requires careful interpretation.
- Grasslands and uplands: Recasting between Neutral/Calcareous/Acid Grasslands and upland categories is complex due to definitional differences.
- Urban: Earlier estimates treated Unsurveyed Urban differently; later classifications incorporate urban corrections and constants.
- Data alignment: Some 1978 categories could be cross-walked to multiple later classifications; discrepancies highlighted and explained.

## Appendices and Data Access
- Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup Table ( mappings between 1978 descriptions and Broad Habitat allocations).
- Appendix III: Summary of ITE Land Classification evolution.
- Maps and data: 1978 maps available as digital images; full dataset stored in CEH Lancaster GIS; ongoing and future analyses supported.

## Implications for Environmental Analysis
- Extends a unique, long-term time series of habitat stock and change back to 1978, supporting assessments of land-use change and ecological responses to post-WWII intensification.
- Provides a framework to couple habitat data with plant species composition and soil data (pH, LOI) for integrated ecological analyses.
- Enables broader data integration and re-use by improving data accessibility and standardisation for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
