# Countryside Survey 1978

## Overview
- Purpose: Define guidelines for field surveys to obtain an ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit, informing policy scrutiny and future decisions.
- Audience: Authors of monitoring frameworks and managers responsible for designing and implementing environmental health monitoring.
- Approach: Recognizes wide variation in conditions; emphasizes standardized methods, documentation of divergences, stakeholder engagement, data verification, and clear presentation of findings.

## Aims and scope (survey design)
- Objective: Produce an overall ecological assessment of each kilometre square using a consistent methodology.
- Core sampling components within a square:
  - Five vegetation plots (roughly 200 m each) randomly located.
  - Five soil pits (in the centers of the plots) for soil analysis.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the entire square.
- Flexibility: Field conditions may require deviations; such deviations should be recorded.

## Permission, ownership, and data access
- On-site permission: Obtain ownership information before starting; brief, minimal disturbance; maintain records of landowners and estate boundaries.
- Information handling: Requests managed by the surveyor; relevant information logged at the end of the square’s data sheets.
- Data sharing considerations: Data collection involves documenting ownership, with attention to sensitive or restricted datasets.

## Plot location and field procedures
- Vegetation plots: Marked with five posts; diagonal layout; orientation using right-angled diagonals; determine the centre by pacing from map features; maintain objectivity in plot placement.
- Plot integrity: Avoid proximity to hazards; relocate if necessary but record adjustments.
- Randomization: Five random plots per square; plots marked on maps to avoid linear features; if a plot lies in a field with crops, sample along the edge and record edge species.
- Species data: Record all vascular plants plus bryophytes and lichens; use predefined aggregates and restricted lists; note identification issues and collect specimens as needed.
- Data accuracy: Estimate cover in 5% increments; aim for principal species; avoid over/under estimation; handle multi-layer vegetation appropriately.

## Plot description and habitats
- Slope and aspect: Measure slope (highest to lowest point) using poles; determine aspect along the same line.
- Habitat attributes: Record square-level and plot-level habitat features; notes for interpretive difficulties; data sheets provide self-explanatory attributes with guidance on tricky categories.
- Vegetation categories: Detailed classification (woodland, grassland, moorland, arable, shrub layers, regeneration, coppice, damaged/removed habitats, etc.) with coded categories for consistency.
- Sketch map: Document woodland types, hedgerows, field boundaries, crops, and other landscape features; annotate with farmer’s notes when possible.

## Soil pit methodology and data capture
- Soil pit placement: Center of the quadrat in the quarter containing a key reference face; if obstructed, relocate to predefined corner positions; document any relocations.
- Pit orientation: Align to maximize light on one end face for horizon description.
- Pit dimensions and depth: Typically 45–60 cm wide and about 1 m long; dig until a C or R horizon or 75 cm depth is reached.
- Horizon description: Mark horizon boundaries with a distinctive marker; determine color, moisture, structure, texture, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, etc.
- Data sheet components (per horizon): Stratum, thickness, horizon symbol, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and additional comments.
- Sampling: Collect small surface samples and, if needed, samples from underlying horizons; prefer samples where horizons are thicker than given thresholds.
- Documentation: Use standard horizon coding sheets; note any problems or deviations.

## Linear features and sampling along features
- Linear plots (hedges, streams, roads) are not mapped ahead of time; field-based placement along features.
- Sampling along lines: 10 m × 1 m plots placed along features from two widely spaced plots in the square; record species identifications with similar rules as the main plots.
- Hedge and road sampling: Document along edges with precise placement and include principal species cover.

## Boundaries, hedges, and boundaries-related categories
- Boundaries and walls/fences: Record condition, age, mortar, wall type, hedgerow integrity, and boundary management status.
- Hedge categories: Complete hedge, hedge with gaps, hedgerow trees, managed or neglected hedges, hedges on walls/banks, and hedgerow removal events (within specified periods).
- Woody species (hedges): Record principal species composition and abundance; provide estimates of major constituents.

## Habitats, crops, and buildings
- Habitats: Notes on vegetation dominance and ecosystem type using Tansley-style interpretation; dominance takes precedence over minor patches.
- Crops and horticulture: Record crop types and relevant farming practices; include farmer comments on varieties when possible.
- Sketch map details: Record crop location and hedgerow/field boundary details; provide notes to aid later interpretation.

## Domestic animals and buildings
- Domestic animals: Gather information on breeds and composition via farmer interview when possible; use provided keys and pictures if necessary.
- Buildings and amenities: Classify and describe buildings (vernacular vs non-vernacular, local vs non-local materials), farm buildings, housing types, and associated land use.
- Breed sheets and animal data: Use published breed keys for cattle, sheep, goats, poultry, horses, etc., to document livestock presence and composition.

## Habitats (rocks, aquatic, and structural features)
- Rock and cliff habitats: Document cliff/rock outcrops, scree, rocks, peat, and exposed mineral soils.
- Aquatic habitats: Record streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, canals, and wet features with lengths/areas where applicable; note ongoing movement or standing water.
- Other habitat notes: Include caves, pools, and other notable landscape features that influence ecological assessments.

## Data quality, guidance, and standardization
- Standardization: Use consistent data sheets, horizon coding, and species aggregates to enable cross-square comparisons.
- Metadata considerations: Document data origins, plot relocations, and boundary changes; note limitations or uncertainties in difficult categories.
- Data presentation: Emphasize clear, uncluttered maps and charts to convey complex ecological information.

## Land classes and landscape typology
- Land Classes: A structured framework describing broad landscape types (e.g., Central South, Southeast Down, Plains, Wolds, Coastal, Uplands, etc.).
- Purpose: Provide a standardized language to describe landscape context and variation across squares.
- Practical note: The classifications acknowledge wide variation and rely on photographic or mapped exemplars to capture the full spectrum of land types.

## Species identification resources and indicators
- Bryophytes and lichens: Appendices list exemplar taxa to aid identification for field recording.
- Indicator species and aggregates: Guidelines describe how to use indicator species when exact identification is challenging; lists include common genera and representative species across plants, bryophytes, and lichens.
- Practical usage: Where specimens are unavailable or uncertain, entries may be rejected as indicators but can still inform qualitative interpretation.

## Equipment, forms, and checklists
- Project 424 Checklist: Detailed equipment and form list to ensure consistent data collection (rucksacks, poles, sheets, stakes, compasses, trowels, knives, etc.).
- Data sheets and codes: Standardized forms for vegetation, soils, horizons, boundaries, and habitats; Horzion symbols, color/mottles/texture codes, and species coding schemes are provided.
- Data handling: Emphasizes completing all sheets and clipping them together for review; ensure that data captured across plots is coherent and complete.

## Appendices: species, sample, and land-class notes
- Species lists and field guides: Consolidated lists for bryophytes and lichens, plus a broad set of plant species with coding guidance.
- Land-class notes: Supplementary commentary and photographs to illustrate landscape types, supporting consistent classification.

## Conclusion and data integration
- Post-survey steps: Verify completeness of all sheets, ensure data cleanliness, and assemble the kilometre square map with all relevant notes.
- Final objective: Provide a comprehensive, standardized ecological snapshot for each square to support policy analysis and future decision-making.
