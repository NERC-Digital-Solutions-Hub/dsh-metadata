# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling strategy for Countryside Survey field work up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, used to stratify sampling since 1978.
  - Aims to support time-series analyses of habitat and land-use change across Great Britain.
  - Emphasises alignment between sampling framework, land classification, and national/regional reporting needs.

- Core data assets and concepts
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attribute–based system used to stratify GB into land classes.
  - Sampling units: 1 km x 1 km squares across GB; centre squares underpin classification, with surrounding squares allocated to classes for context.
  - Time-series framework: successive CS surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) linked to evolving classifications to enable change detection.
  - National estimates: derived by combining class-level statistics (mean habitat area per square) with class areas.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling
  - 1978 (First GB ecological survey)
    - ISA-based classification created 32 land classes from 1228 centre squares; 4 surrounding squares per centre included.
    - Sample: 8 squares per class (256 total) for field survey.
  - 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
    - Framework kept, sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked with early land-cover mapping; broader data collection.
  - 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification for CS2000)
    - Reclassification to enable Scotland-only and England & Wales reporting; total classes increased (to about 40).
    - Implemented “country unit” reporting: England with Wales vs Scotland; added 40 strata with new class subdivisions and 19 additional squares to improve representation.
    - Introduced an uplands module (CS2000) to improve habitat estimates in upland England/Wales.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification for CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs driven further: added Wales-specific class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to create 45 strata.
    - Adjusted class counts and sampling to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes; England allocations adjusted accordingly.
    - Maintained and expanded the framework to support Wales-, England-, and Scotland-specific estimates.

- Sampling framework and numbers
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; CS1990 field module).
  - CS2000: expanded to 40 strata with country-unit subdivision; added 19 Welsh squares and 11 additional English adjustments; upland module included; Wales allocated more squares to support Wales-only reporting.
  - CS2007: further Welsh sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) in 45 strata; 43 Welsh additional squares; English classes adjusted to maintain overall precision; Wales-focused reporting strengthened.

- Separate country estimates and regional considerations
  - Recognition that post-devolution needs require country-specific estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland; later Wales-only reporting).
  - Framework adaptations include class sub-division by country unit, class aggregation where country totals would be underrepresented, and targeted additional sampling to maintain precision.

- Upland and habitat-focused enhancements
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - Enhanced sampling density in upland/highland strata to support robust country-level estimates.

- Data consistency, comparability, and guidance
  - Changing land classifications affects national estimate consistency; the 2006 scoping guidance recommends using the latest classification for internal consistency while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - National estimates can be generated using either the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 classification; recommended approach depends on the reporting context.
  - Documentation accompanies each survey to explain classification changes and their impact on estimates.

- Outputs and documentation
  - CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 main reports and citations outlined.
  - Illustrative figures and tables map class revisions, sampling squares, and country-specific sampling frames (Figures 4–7 in the document; tables detailing square counts and sampling rates).
  - Acknowledgments and references acknowledge methodological and statistical contributions.

- Implications for data governance and leadership
  - The Countryside Survey sampling framework represents a long-running, multi-decade time-series data asset requiring careful metadata, versioning, and documentation of classification changes.
  - Data leaders should manage evolving land classifications and country-unit reporting requirements to ensure clarity on comparability, coverage, and precision.
  - The approach demonstrates the value of stratified, environment-based classifications for targeted data gathering, efficient resource use, and credible national/regional habitat estimates.
