# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (via CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Critical for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing access/permission for future surveys.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations can be released

- General access: Allows users to see whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km): Can be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise): Collaborative pre-processing by CEH preferred; exceptional external release only if the requester demonstrates, legally, that their data/IP require at least equal confidentiality to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares: Could enable square identification; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)

- Confidentiality: Data must be stored securely and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licence duration: Finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End of project: Written confirmation that data have remained secure and have been destroyed.
- Third-party access: No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Use restrictions: Location data must not be used to plan visits, check landowner compliance, or identify exact square locations.
- IP/confidentiality standards: If applicable, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: Similar licensing terms to six-digit but do not require the same high IP confidentiality; still prohibited from attempting to identify precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process

- Decision-maker: CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides exceptional releases according to policy; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Compliance: If approved, CEH issues licences signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- Denials: If refused, CEH applies the Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- Oversight: CEH provides an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Practical support: CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes for CS partners; external requests considered case-by-case.
- Stakeholder guidance: Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to CS-location data use; CEH involvement may be via collaboration or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
