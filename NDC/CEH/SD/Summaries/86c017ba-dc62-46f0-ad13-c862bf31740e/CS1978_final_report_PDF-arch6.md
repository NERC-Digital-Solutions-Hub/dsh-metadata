# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Introduction
- CEH holds hard-copy field records of land-cover and landscape features from multiple years (1977/78, 1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007) forming a unique long-term dataset for Britain.
- The 1978 maps had never been digitised into GIS before 2009; digitisation creates a new, spatially explicit dataset to extend the Time Series back to 1978.
- The data rescue enables analysis of Broad Habitat stock and change across GB for 1978 and linkage with coincident plant species and soil data (pH, LOI).
- Field codes from 1978 were reconciled with BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson, 2000); enables characterization of habitat mosaics across GB in 1978.

## History of the Countryside Survey and Data Background
- 1970s: Preliminary vegetation plots (1 km squares) informed the 1978 GB survey; eight plots per square reduced to five with additional features (rivers, roads, hedges).
- The 1978 approach introduced habitat area mapping using 80 field codes, later translatable to Broad Habitats; early sketches transferred to base maps.
- Data have supported later ecological analyses and models (e.g., LUAM, landscape change studies, wood energy potential), with national estimates historically calculated from tabulated figures.

## Issues to Address Regarding the 1978 Dataset
- Consistency: visual checks show 1978 data are largely consistent with later surveys, enabling reliable change detection.
- Potential bias: transfer/coding to base maps could introduce interpretation bias; bias was consistent and comparable with later digitisation processes.
- Quality assurance: addressed by cross-checking 1978 data against species data and later surveys.
- Despite caveats, the non-spatial 1978 data were used robustly in models since the 1980s.

## Digitization Procedure
- Maps scanned (JPEG and PDF); originals moved to fire-safe storage.
- Digitisation performed by ADAS in summer 2009 following the CS1978 Data Rescue scoping plan; maps stored in a CEH Lancaster GIS.
- Scanned plot data sheets also archived; digitised maps enable GIS-enabled analysis with Broad Habitat categories.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial checks for omissions, queries, and digitising errors against original field maps.
- Cross-year comparison: each square and year laid on a separate sheet to identify real changes vs. errors; involved staff from the 1978 team.
- Spatial privacy preserved by manipulating figure locations; enabled assessment of changes (e.g., habitat stock shifts) across years.
- Visual examples illustrate changes such as conifer expansion, grassland/urban changes, and woodland increase.

## Broad Habitat Allocations
- Most 1978 codes easily mapped to BH categories; a few were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath, or Acid Grassland).
- Where ambiguity remained, maps, species data, and vegetation plots were used for clarification; visual square checks were essential.

## Issues Arising from the 1978 Broad Habitat Allocations
- Upland codes are particularly challenging due to heterogeneity and small patch sizes; some areas may be best described as mosaics.
- Some codes (e.g., Herb-rich pasture) could map to multiple Broad Habitats; cross-referenced with plots to assign correctly.
- Inland Rock overestimation in 1978 due to classification changes (primary vs. secondary coding) and mapping method differences.
- Translations between 1978 codes and later Broad Habitats not always straightforward for grassland categories and upland types.
- Digitisation kept linework consistent with later years (1984/1990 mapped to 1990s schemes; 1998/2007 aligned with earlier linework where possible).
- Some Priority Habitats (BRIG) identifiable: Coastal Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture.

## Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications
- 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification: 15 x 15 km squares with 1,215 classified squares; ISA created a broader set of 6,039 squares for analysis.
- National estimates were derived by multiplying mean habitat per square by land-class area.
- Over time, Land Classification evolved:
  - 1984: 12 km squares per land class; used 1978 classification for estimates.
  - 1990: All Squares classification; urban/sea corrections; 508 squares surveyed.
  - 1998: Updated to 40 land classes; Scottish reporting separated.
  - 2007: Updated to 45 land classes; Welsh reporting separated.
- See Appendix III for the flow of classification evolution.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- National stock estimates produced for selected Broad Habitats; notes that 1978 estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to classification changes and sample size (256 squares in 1978).
- Uses the 1990 ITE Land Classification (32 classes) for consistency with historical methods; direct 1978-2007 change assessment requires careful treatment.
- 1978 stock highlights (illustrative means in thousands of hectares):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5105
  - Improved Grassland: ~5188
  - Urban (including some adjustments): ~1441
  - Bog: ~2004
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1677
  - Acid Grassland: ~1786
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~1413
  - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995
  - Neutral Grassland: ~1442
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp: ~231
  - Other habitats varied with uncertainties and required careful interpretation
- Cautions:
  - 1978 results not directly comparable to 2007 due to changes in Land Classification and retrospective allocation of Broad Habitats.
  - Some habitat classes had sparse representation, impacting precision and comparability.

## 8.1 Comparison of New Results with Previously Published Data
- Newly digitized 1978 results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Differences in Broad Habitat reporting classes and aggregation.
  - Variation in how 1978 polygons were allocated to Broad Habitats.
  - Use of revised All Squares (1990) classification vs original 1978 classification.
- New data align more closely with Barr et al. (1993) than with Bunce & Heal (1984) due to the updated land classification framework.
- Specific habitat notes:
  - Boundary/Linear Features: Bunce & Heal (1984) overestimated small habitats due to 1978 classification tendencies.
  - Arable and Horticulture: new mean higher; Bunce & Heal lower due to classification version.
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp, Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath: complex cross-year comparability; reclassification influences results.
  - Urban: Bunce & Heal combined unsurveyed urban; later work treated unsurveyed urban as a constant value.

## 8.1.1 Notes Regarding Specific Habitats
- Explains discrepancies between earlier publications and rescued data, including boundary delineation issues, role of different Land Classifications, and interpretation of uncertain categories.
- Highlights how some small habitats were over- or under-represented under different classification schemes and data handling.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Support Perspective
- The 1978 Data Rescue significantly enhances the data support ecosystem by enabling a long-term, spatially explicit view of habitat change across GB, anchored to Broad Habitat classifications.
- Digitisation and validation processes were thorough, enabling credible cross-year comparisons while acknowledging calibration and classification challenges.
- The dataset supports retrospective analyses of land-use change drivers, informing policy and planning discussions with a robust 30-year perspective.
- Users should apply consistent classification schemes when comparing 1978 with later years and be mindful of methodological differences that affect direct comparability.
