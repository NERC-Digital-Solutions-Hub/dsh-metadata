# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aims to maximise public-benefit use of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and obtaining landowner permission.
- Public interest justification; requests managed under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release: when and how
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence to identify whether squares fall within predefined areas.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only released under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances, after CEH checks; external processing may be used to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- In exceptional cases, access may be granted if the requester demonstrates in legal terms that their data or IP has equal/higher confidentiality than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
- End-of-licence confirmation required that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to assess landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- License terms include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting this policy.
- Licence approvals or denials follow appropriate Act/Regulations procedures; CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical work, CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe; requests from external organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for implementation
- Requests should be routed through CEH; ensure compliance with confidentiality and licensing terms.
- Consideration of pre-processing options to avoid exposing precise locations.
- Maintain a balance between data utility and protection of survey integrity and landowner relationships.
