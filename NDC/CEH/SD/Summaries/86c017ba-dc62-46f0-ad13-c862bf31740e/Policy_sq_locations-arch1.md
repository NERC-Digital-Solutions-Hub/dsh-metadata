# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and purpose
  - Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Current Countryside Survey partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why locations are confidential
  - Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission to survey.
  - Public-interest rationale: safeguard sampling strategy and policy-relevant data quality.

- Circumstances for location release and precision
  - Approximate square locations can be identified within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when precise location is not essential.
  - Six-digit grid references require exceptionally necessary justification; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations; exceptional external release only if the applicant demonstrates IP data requires equal/higher confidentiality.

- Spatial data within survey squares
  - Maps of habitats and linear features could identify square locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

- Specific release conditions
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
  - No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Applicants may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
  - A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

- Licensing responsibilities and process
  - Decisions on exceptional release are made by CEH on behalf of NERC.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
  - If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.

- Practical guidance
  - Partners and potential CS data users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy.
  - CEH may assist as needed, potentially as part of collaboration or for payment; specifics negotiated case-by-case.
