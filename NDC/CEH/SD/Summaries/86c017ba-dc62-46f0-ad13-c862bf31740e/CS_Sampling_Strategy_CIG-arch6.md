# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview: A longitudinal framework (1978–2007) for field surveys of Great Britain that uses the ITE Land Classification to create a stratified sampling design. Built to ensure samples are representative and comparable across time, while evolving to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland).

- Core objective for data support: provide robust, recorder-friendly data frameworks and outputs (e.g., habitat area estimates, land-class maps, and sample-level data) to detect change in countryside habitats and land use over time.

## Key concepts and data framework

- Stratified sampling to minimize bias and reflect ecological variability:
  - Population carved into discreet strata (Land Classes) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Random or objective selection within strata to ensure representativeness.

- Land Classification as the sampling framework:
  - ITE Land Classification (32 classes originally; expanded over time to 40, then 45 with country-specific refinements).
  - Early approach used a centre 1 km square (plus four surrounding squares) to classify; later work allowed classification of all GB squares using surrogates and multivariate methods when full classification was computationally prohibitive.

- Sampling units and data collection:
  - Primary unit: 1 km squares.
  - Field surveys conducted in distinct campaigns (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) with progressively larger sample sizes and refined data collection (habitat mapping, land-use features, etc.).

## Chronology and evolution of the methodology

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey:
  - 1228 centre squares classified; 6039 km squares including surrounding squares.
  - 8 squares per Land Class surveyed (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas by class.

- 1984 – Second field survey:
  - 12 squares per class (total 384) to enhance estimates; continued use of the original 32-class framework.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990):
  - Expanded to classify every GB square using key surrogates; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Repetition of 1978 quadrats; integration with first Land Cover Map (satellite-derived).

- 1998–2000 – Developments for CS2000:
  - Need for regional and country-specific estimates led to sub-dividing classes into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Aggregation and additional squares to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat modules added for England and Wales to improve upland estimates.

- 2007 – CS2007 adjustments for Wales and broader comparability:
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted class sub-divisions to create Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure adequate representation; England adjustments to maintain comparability.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; explicit Wales-only and England-only reporting considerations.

## Data outputs and how they are used

- National estimates:
  - Calculated as mean habitat area per square in each Land Class multiplied by the Land Class’s total area (and adjusted for country units in CS2000/CS2007).
  - Tables and maps illustrate the distribution of Land Classes and sample squares (e.g., Figures 1–7, Maps of Land Classes and survey squares).

- Country- and region-specific outputs:
  - England & Wales and Scotland outputs generated separately (with specific class subdivisions and sampling allocations).
  - Wales-specific refinements to improve Wales-only reporting; upland habitat modules added to bolster England and Wales estimates.

- Outputs published in major reports:
  - Countryside Survey 1990: main report.
  - Countryside Survey 2000: UK results; country-specific adaptations.
  - Countryside Survey 2007: Wales-focused reporting developments; expanded country-unit framework.

## Data quality, challenges, and considerations for users

- Representativeness and classification changes:
  - The Land Classification has evolved; 1990–2000 revisions caused some classes to be under-represented in certain countries.
  - 2006 scoping study notes that changing the classification affects consistency of national stock estimates; two approaches recommended for consistency (latest country-unit classification vs. original cross-survey classification).

- Comparability across time:
  - When comparing habitat areas across CS surveys, users should account for changes in Land Classification schemes and the country-unit breakdowns.
  - There are different numbers of squares per class across surveys and countries; care is needed when aggregating or comparing counts.

- Wales and uplands focus:
  - Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions and more Welsh squares to meet policy and reporting needs.
  - An uplands module was added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Welsh-specific and 2007 adjustments (highlights)

- Welsh-only estimates driven by devolved policy needs:
  - Introduction of country-unit subdivisions increasing total strata to 45.
  - 43 Welsh extra squares to guarantee minimum representation per Welsh class; 6+ squares per new Welsh class.

- England adjustments:
  - Some classes in England retained only 4 squares per class due to Welsh expansions; overall precision considered acceptable per scoping guidance.

- Outputs and maps:
  - Revised country-unit land-class maps for CS2007 (England with Wales and Scotland).
  - Updated tables of sample squares by class and country, enabling Wales-only and England-only reporting.
