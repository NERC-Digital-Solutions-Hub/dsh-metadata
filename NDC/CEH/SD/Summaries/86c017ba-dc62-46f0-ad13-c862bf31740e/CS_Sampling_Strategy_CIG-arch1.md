# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and provenance
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year lineage of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field samples.
  - Emphasises that the current methodology is tightly linked to its predecessors and that understanding the evolution is essential for interpreting time-series data.

- Core ideas: stratified sampling and land classification
  - To avoid bias, samples are drawn from stratified (not purely random) schemes that carve landscape into discrete strata (land classes) representing ecological variation.
  - The ITE Land Classification uses environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to define land classes, enabling representative sampling across Great Britain.
  - The sampling framework combines environmental stratification with random selection within strata to produce nationally and regionally representative estimates.

- Historic development of the Land Classification
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 32 classes developed from 1 km squares using Indicator Species Analysis and environmental attributes; 8 squares per class, totaling 256 field samples.
  - 1984 (Second survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares/CS1990): classification updated to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed; linked to the first Land Cover Map from satellite data; some squares reclassified, urban/sea corrections applied.
  - 2000 (CS2000): further refinement to support separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); sub-division and aggregation created 40 strata; added 19 more squares to improve Welsh representation; upland habitat sampling added as a separate module; Isle of Man squares removed/relocated.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting formalised; Land Classes sub-divided into country-unit versions (creating five new Wales- or England-specific classes) and total strata increasing to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure adequate representation; some English classes reduced (to 4 squares in a few cases) based on scoping study findings.

- Sampling allocation and country framing
  - England & Wales: CS2000 and CS2007 introduced country-specific strata and sampling, ensuring robust Wales reporting and balancing numbers across England and Wales.
  - Scotland: Stratification and sampling adjusted to maintain regional representativeness; separate country framing preserved for Scotland.
  - Isle of Man: Squares previously included were reassigned to other country units or replaced to maintain country-specific sampling integrity.
  - Wales: Wales required denser sampling in some classes to achieve Wales-only estimates; new sub-classes created for Wales (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).

- Upland module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 upland squares to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales, addressing under-sampling in high-altitude zones when reporting by country.

- How national estimates are produced
  - National estimates are calculated as: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that Land Class.
  - This framework is sensitive to changes in Land Classification over time, which can affect cross-survey comparability.

- Consistency and comparability notes
  - The 2006 scoping work notes that changing the underlying land classification affects the consistency of national stock estimates; two approaches exist: use the latest (country-specific) classification for current estimates or maintain a consistent older classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - CS2000 and CS2007 addressed this by establishing country-unit classifications and documenting the implications for national vs. country-level reporting.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - Time-series interpretation requires attention to: whether estimates are derived from the latest country-specific Land Class definitions or from earlier, unified classifications.
  - Changes in the number of classes and class boundaries can alter the precision and comparability of habitat area estimates, especially for Wales and upland habitats.
  - The sampling framework evolves to meet policy and governance needs (e.g., Wales-only reporting) while attempting to preserve overall representativeness across GB.
