## Data content and field descriptions
- File: LANDSCAPE_AREA_FEATURE_HAB_1978.csv
- Key columns:
  - SQUARE: 1km square sampling site code (text)
  - YEAR: Year of survey (numeric)
  - ID: Landscape area polygon identifier (unique within a year)
  - BROAD_HABITAT: Broad Habitat code (numeric)
  - BROAD_HABITAT_NAME: Broad or Priority Habitat name (text)
  - AREA: Area of habitat within the 1km square (square metres)

  - EZ_DESC_07: Countryside Survey Environmental Zone description
- Purpose of fields: to quantify habitat extent within standardized 1km grid cells using established classifications.

## Purpose and use within monitoring
- Enables assessment of habitat extent and change over time within a standardized GB framework.
- Outputs typically include clear formats such as reports, maps, and charts to support environmental health monitoring and policy performance evaluation.

## Data quality, standards, and outputs
- Data are verified and quality assured as part of the Countryside Survey workflow; standardized methods are used to transform and present habitat data.
- Outputs are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, ensuring accessibility for ongoing monitoring.
