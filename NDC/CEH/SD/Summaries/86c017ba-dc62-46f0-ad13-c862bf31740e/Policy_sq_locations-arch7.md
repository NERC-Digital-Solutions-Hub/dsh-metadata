# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose
  - Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- CS partners (current)
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- Why square locations are confidential
  - Preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Critical for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission for surveys.
  - Confidentiality supports ongoing ability to inform environmental policy.

- Release circumstances and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
  - Six-digit grid references: released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external user must show legal grounds that their data/models carry equal/higher confidentiality than CS data; CEH may pre-process instead of releasing raw locations.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, features): potentially identifying the square; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - General access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) without precise locations.

- Licensing terms and use restrictions
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end; written confirmation required.
  - No data should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive exact square locations or to claim such derivations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; licences must be signed by an authorised senior official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under statutory processes.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case basis for requests from other organisations.
  - Partners and potential users are recommended to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may assist as scientific lead or determine collaboration/fee arrangements.

- Practical guidance for GIS practitioners
  - Use CS location data with understanding of confidentiality constraints and licensing requirements.
  - For policy or planning analyses that do not require precise locations, rely on four-digit grid references or area-based indications.
  - When precise locations are essential, anticipate exceptional access pathways and engagement with CEH/NERC to justify need and confidentiality level.
  - Plan for secure data handling, restricted access, and eventual destruction as per licence terms.
