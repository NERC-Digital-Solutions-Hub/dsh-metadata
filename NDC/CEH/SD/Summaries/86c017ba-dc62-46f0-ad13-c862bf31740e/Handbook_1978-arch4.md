# Countryside Survey 1978

## Aim and Scope
- Defines guidelines for field survey data collection to obtain an ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
- Allows for substantial real-world variation; deviations from basic methodology should be recorded.
- Seeks a consistent, repeatable data framework that accommodates different terrains and conditions.

## Survey Design and Data Streams
- Four data streams per square:
  - Five randomly located 200 m vegetation plots.
  - Five randomly located soil pits in the centers of the plots.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
  - Broad ecological information for the entire kilometre square.
- Additional data to be captured: keys to information such as Cow/Sheep ownership and other contextual details.

## Field Procedures and Plot Location
- Permission and ownership: obtain ownership information before starting; brief field contacts about minimal disturbance; record owner details at the end of the data sheets.
- Plot locating principles:
  - Use objective methods; nearest recognizable map point to navigate to plot with compass.
  - The plot center is determined by stepping along a diagonal using marked strings; minor deviations allowed for physical constraints.
  - If features interfere with plot placement, relocate and annotate on maps; plots should remain random samples of the square.
- Plot marking and integrity:
  - Mark plots on maps to avoid linear features; relocate if pacing would place the plot on a feature unexpectedly.
  - Five randomized plots are fixed on maps; any alterations require careful documentation.
- Data collection within plots:
  - Record all vascular plants; limited bryophyte and lichen data; use predefined aggregates and restricted lists.
  - Estimate cover within 5% categories; aim to capture principal species and, when necessary, edge species from crops or hedgerows.

## Vegetation Data Collection
- Species lists: exhaustive recording of vascular plants; bryophytes/lichens limited per guidelines.
- Cover estimation: categories with checks to avoid systematic bias (over/under estimation).
- Plot interpretation: if crops dominate, record edge species from adjacent hedgerows or tracks; diagrams provided to illustrate plotting procedure.

## Soil Data Collection (Soil Pit)
- Soil pit location: center of quadrat within the quarter containing face number one; if obstructed, relocate through a defined sequence and record the reason.
- Pit construction and depth: typically 45–60 cm wide, 60–100 cm long; dig until C/R horizon or 75 cm depth with best light on one end to describe horizons.
- Horizon description: identify horizons by color, texture, structure, roots, organic matter, moisture, and other characteristics; use matchsticks or stones to mark boundaries.
- Data capture on soil sheet:
  - Horizon thickness, symbol, moisture status, color, mottling, texture, structure, stones, roots.
  - Carbonates presence, earthworms, iron pan presence, soil group, parent material, and any notable comments.
  - Sampling guidelines for surface horizons; contingencies when horizons are thin or multiple horizons exist.
- Soil data completion: follow a structured data sheet (with horizon codes and descriptive fields) and record any deviations.

## Linear Features and Boundaries
- Linear plots (two per feature) measure 10 × 1 m and run along hedges, streams, and roads.
- Plot positioning is field-located along the feature, traced with a string and 1 m ruler to follow curves.
- Features to include: hedges (woody species within hedge counted), streams (permanent water), roads (edge alignment), fences, and banks.
- Species identification for linear plots follows the same rules as large quadrats, with principal species emphasized.

## Habitats, Land Use, and Sketch Map
- Habitats: vegetation types recorded with a dominant species emphasis (Tansley sense of vegetation). Patch data captured without exhaustive abundance estimates unless clearly shown on the sketch.
- Crops and agriculture: record crop types, horticulture, farm buildings, enclosures, gardens, orchards, recreation areas, and drainage features; capture farmers’ notes when relevant.
- Sketch map: record crops, hedgerows, field boundaries, and land features directly on the map; add notes to provide a clear picture of square characteristics.
- Domestic animals and habitats (rock, aquatic, and built environments): classify and document presence of domestic animals, sheds, vernacular buildings, and other features as observed.

## Data Management, Quality Control, and Documentation
- Completion checklist and field kit: Project 424 checklist outlines required field equipment and data sheets; aim to ensure data completeness and consistency.
- Data integrity practices:
  - Check for completeness across vegetation, soil, and habitat sheets.
  - Cross-check maps with field observations; note deviations and rationale.
  - Ensure data are as clean as possible for later analysis, acknowledging limitations in field conditions.
- Documentation discipline: record dates, square numbers, and any site-specific variations; maintain a balanced approach rather than over-scrutinizing every square.

## Taxonomy Guidance: Species and Aggregates
- Guidelines for species identification emphasize using aggregates when precise identification is uncertain.
- Lists provided for bryophytes, lichens, and selected vascular plants; use provided codes to classify species when feasible.
- Identify hedgerow species and document principal species composition; note mixtures and edge species where applicable.

## Land Classes and Interpretation
- Land classes framework (illustrative, with regional variations) provides context for landscape interpretation.
- Descriptions and photographic references illustrate typical landscapes across multiple classes (e.g., Central South, Southeast downs, Plains, Wolds, etc.).
- Classes guide interpretation of data within the broader landscape context and support comparative analyses across squares.

## Concluding Guidance
- After fieldwork, verify all sheets for completeness and consistency, and collate into a unified kilometre-square data package.
- Record anything left out or uncertain with clear notes to facilitate future data cleaning and interpretation.
- Use the land-class framework and sketches to aid later analysis and cross-square comparisons.
