Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

# Summary for Data Leaders

## Overview
- This report documents the digitisation and rescue of the 1978 Countryside Survey field data (land-cover maps and landscape features) to create a GIS-ready dataset, enabling long-term analysis of Broad Habitat stock back to 1978.
- The Digitisation adds a new data point to the time-series (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and strengthens analyses of habitat change in the context of post-WWII agricultural intensification.
- The work supports cross-year analyses, consistency checks, and improved data discovery and reuse for researchers and policy colleagues.

## Data Assets and Scope
- Primary data: 256 1km survey squares from 1978; 256 maps originally hand-drawn and coded with species-based field codes.
- Outputs:
  - Digitised 1978 land-cover maps with Broad Habitat allocations aligned to later classifications (BAP Broad Habitats; some Priority Habitats identified).
  - GIS dataset stored centrally at CEH Lancaster, with legacy field data sheets scanned and preserved.
  - Summary national estimates of Broad Habitat stock for 1978 (Table 1) and a comparison (Table 2) with previously published 1984 and 1993 figures, plus notes on comparability.
  - Appendices: habitat code lookup, and summaries that aid interpretation of the ITE Land Classification evolution.

## Digitisation and Data Processing
- Process:
  - Maps scanned to .jpg and .pdf; primary maps moved to secure storage; plot data sheets scanned.
  - Digitisation conducted by ADAS in summer 2009 following the CS1978 Data Rescue protocol; GIS-based storage established at CEH Lancaster.
- Provenance and lineage:
  - Establishes traceability from original 1978 field codes to modern Broad Habitat allocations (with cross-walks to later classifications).
  - Documentation captures the mapping decisions, including handling of ambiguous categories (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor, Inland Rock, Calcareous vs. Acid Grassland).

## Data Checking, Validation, and Quality
- Validation approach:
  - Initial checks for omissions and digitising errors against original maps.
  - Cross-year consistency checks by placing each square’s data from 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 on dedicated sheets, then cross-checking for real change versus error.
  - Visual review with input from survey staff involved in 1978 to assess plausibility of changes.
- Outcomes:
  - The 1978 data are judged to be robust and sufficiently consistent with other CS datasets to allow direct future change analyses.
  - Spatial and non-spatial integrity preserved, with safeguards to anonymise square locations in published figures.

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Classification
- Translation:
  - Most 1978 field codes mapped straightforwardly to Broad Habitats (e.g., Conifer Woodland to BH 2; Broadleaved Woodland types, etc.).
  - Some codes were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be various Broad Habitats); used habitat maps and vegetation plot data to resolve.
- Issues and caveats:
  - Upland codes are particularly challenging due to heterogeneity and small patch sizes; mosaic classifications may be needed in future work.
  - Certain grasses and upland habitats had potential cross-allocations requiring validation against plot data.
  - 1978 code translation to Neutral/Improved/Calcareous/Acid Grassland categories required careful scrutiny.
  - Notes that 1978 “Inland Rock” and related categories were affected by methodological changes in later years (e.g., secondary coding in later surveys).

## Land Classification Evolution and Comparability
- Classification history:
  - 1978: Original ITE Land Classification with ISA-based 32 classes derived from 1228 squares.
  - 1984: 12 km2 sample in some analyses; continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990: All Squares Land Classification (broadening to 40 classes) with urban/sea corrections.
  - 1998: 40 classes retained, Scotland separated; refinement continued.
  - 2007: 45 classes; Wales separated; results published in UK Countryside Survey 2007.
- Implications for comparisons:
  - 1978 results are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differences in classification schemas and sampling design.
  - The 1990 All Squares framework is used as the primary reference for cross-year comparability when integrating 1978 with later data.
  - Differences in reporting classes across publications explain many disparities when comparing 1978 to later years.

## Results: 1978 National Estimates (Broad Habitats)
- National stock estimates (1978) are provided for a subset of Broad Habitats; values are not directly equivalent to 2007 figures due to classification changes.
- Key example figures (mean areas in 000s ha; %GB area):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5,105; ~21.9%
  - Improved Grassland: ~5,188; ~22.3%
  - Bog: ~2,004; ~8.6%
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1,677; ~7.2%
  - Urban: ~1,441; ~6.2%
  - Others include Broadleaved/Mixed Yew woodland, Conifer woodland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid Grasslands, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, etc.
- Important caveats:
  - Estimates reflect the 1978 Land Classification and the 256-square sample; retrospective allocations to newer classes introduce uncertainty.
  - Some habitat categories combine multiple potential real-world types; exact boundaries may differ from later datasets.
  - The report emphasizes that the 1978 results should be interpreted with these comparability caveats in mind.

## Notes on Differences with Previously Published Data
- The report explains differences with Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) results, attributing discrepancies to:
  - Differences in Broad Habitat reporting classes and aggregation.
  - Ambiguities in 1978 polygon allocations and retrospective edits for consistency.
  - Use of the 1978 ITE Land Classification vs. the later All Squares (1990) and Wales/Scotland refinements.

## Data Governance, Access, and Future Work
- Data governance:
  - Digitised 1978 data are stored in a GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM at CEH Lancaster, with original field maps preserved in secure storage.
  - Metadata and documentation accompany the dataset to support reuse and cross-year analyses.
- Future work and considerations:
  - Further alignment of 1978 allocations with the 1990/2007 classification framework to improve cross-year change detection.
  - Potential refinement of “Mosaic” approaches for upland habitats and more granular upland categorizations.
  - Ongoing development of methods to handle differences in classification schemes when comparing historic and modern datasets.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Leaders
- Data Rescue creates a valuable, long-running data asset by digitising 1978 field records, enabling robust 30-year habitat-change analyses when used with careful treatment of classification differences.
- Provenance, validation, and metadata are central to trustworthy reuse, especially when integrating with later years that use updated land classifications.
- Understanding classification evolution and documentation of cross-year mapping decisions are essential for accurate interpretation of trends and for informing policy and planning discussions that rely on historical habitat data.
