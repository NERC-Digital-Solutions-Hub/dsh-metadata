# Countryside Survey:
Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Documents the digitisation and QA of the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to enable GIS analysis and integration with later surveys (1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007).
- Extends the GB Countryside Survey time series back to 1978, allowing assessment of 30-year habitat stock and change and linking vegetation and soil data with Broad Habitat classifications.

## Aim and Context
- Goal: rescue, digitise, and validate the 1978 field records to study Broad Habitat stock, drivers of ecological variation, and landscape change over time.
- Context: Countryside Survey program provides long-term land-cover data; 1978 data had not been in GIS form and were at risk of loss, limiting temporal analyses prior to 2009.

## Data Rescue and Digitization
- Primary source: hard-copy field records of land-cover and landscape features from 1978.
- Digitisation workflow:
  - Scan maps (.jpg/.pdf) and plot data sheets; relocate originals to safe storage.
  - Digitise maps in 2009 using a CEH-approved protocol; store in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.
  - Allocate 1978 field codes to BAP Broad Habitats (Jackson, 2000); ensure consistency with later years.
- Data products: digitised 1978 maps aligned with later Countryside Survey years for cross-year analysis.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial data checks against original field maps to identify omissions or digitising errors.
- Cross-year validation:
  - Each survey year represented on separate sheets per 1km square (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) to identify real changes versus errors.
  - Visual and expert review with staff involved in the 1978 survey to assess plausibility of changes.
- Outcome: 1978 dataset deemed robust and comparable to other Countryside Survey datasets for future change analysis, despite legacy limitations.

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Challenges
- Process: translate 1978 codes to Broad Habitats; use habitat maps and vegetation plots to resolve ambiguities (e.g., 69 Mixed Upland Moor; 23 Herb-rich pasture).
- Key allocation challenges:
  - Upland codes are difficult to delineate; mosaic or patchy definitions may be needed.
  - Ambiguities between grassland subtypes (Neutral, Improved, Calcareous, Acid) require cross-reference with plots.
  - Inland Rock overestimation due to coding changes between 1978 and later years.
  - 1978 line work diverged from later years (1984/1990) but is largely consistent after review.
  - Some areas could be identified as Priority Habitats (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture).

## Note on ITE Land Classifications
- 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification (15 x 15 km grid squares) with Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create initial land classes.
- Later work used revised classifications (All Squares, 1990) with expanded class numbers and region-specific reporting (Scotland, Wales).
- National estimates for 1978 calculated by applying mean habitat per square to land-class areas; cross-year comparability adjusted by evolving classifications.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Produced national stock estimates for a selection of Broad Habitats (not directly comparable to 2007 results due to methodological and classification changes).
- Key notes:
  - Sample: 256 1km squares; estimates based on 1990 Land Classification (32 classes) rather than the later 45-class system.
  - Some habitats lack direct comparability across years; changes in classification and allocation methods affect direct trend interpretation.
  - The report provides mean areas and 95% limits (in thousands of hectares) for multiple habitats (e.g., Arable and Horticulture ~21.9% GB; Improved Grassland ~22.3%; Broadleaved/Mixed/Yew Woodland ~4.3%; Coniferous Woodland ~6.1%; etc.).
- Purpose of the results: establish a baseline and enable future analyses of change when integrated with 1984–2007 data.

## Comparisons with Previously Published Data
- 8.1.1 Notes: some previously published values (Bunce & Heal 1984; Barr et al. 1993) fall outside the new digitised dataset’s limits due to differences in Land Classification, class definitions, and allocation methods.
- Explanations for discrepancies:
  - Changing Broad Habitat groupings and reporting classes across publications.
  - Ambiguities in 1978 polygon allocations requiring reclassification with reference data.
  - Differences between original 1978 classification and the revised All Squares (1990) framework used in later reports.
- General outcome: the new results align more closely with Barr et al. (1993) than with Bunce & Heal (1984) due to the use of the All Squares Land Classification.

## Specific Habitat Notes
- Boundary and Linear Features: higher Bunce & Heal (1984) estimates likely inflated by 1978 classification biases.
- Arable and Horticulture: new mean higher than earlier estimates due to revised classifications.
- Difficult-to-compare habitats (Acid Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog) due to inconsistent reporting across publications.
- Urban: retrospective handling of unsurveyed urban land introduced in later classifications; in 1978, urban land is treated as a constant component.

## Implications for Researchers and Analysts
- Enables extended time-series analysis of Broad Habitats from 1978 onward, supporting investigations into drivers of habitat change, land-use intensification, and ecological variation.
- Provides a validated, GIS-ready 1978 baseline for cross-year comparisons and modelling (stock, change, and potential future scenarios).
- Users must account for classification differences and potential allocation biases when comparing 1978 with later years; harmonisation decisions are necessary for direct trend interpretation.
