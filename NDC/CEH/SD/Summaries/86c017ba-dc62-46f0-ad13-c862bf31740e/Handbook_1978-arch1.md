# Countryside Survey 1978 Introduction

- Purpose and scope
  - Define guidelines for a field survey to obtain an overall ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
  - Use standardized, broadly applicable methods with allowances for local variation; deviations should be recorded.
  - Aim to cover vegetation, soils, habitats, and broad ecological information systematically.

- Survey design and sampling components
  - Five randomly located vegetation plots, each about 200 m in extent.
  - Five randomly located soil pits distributed within the square.
  - Linear plots along streams, roads, hedgerows to capture edge and boundary features.
  - Comprehensive ecological information collected for the entire kilometre square.
  - Keys and aggregates (e.g., cow/sheep data) provided to consolidate information in one place.

- Permissions and access
  - Obtain owner/land access information prior to starting; visits are brief with minimal disturbance.
  - Document ownership details and any constraints; note that beals or crops may influence soil pit placement.

- Plot location and establishment
  - Plot centers established using a 200 m square framework with diagonals oriented at right angles.
  - Nearest recognizable map point used to navigate to the plot center by compass; adjust pace in steep or difficult terrain.
  - Plots should be positioned to avoid linear features when possible; if necessary, relocate and mark on maps.
  - Five plots are pre-marked on maps; alterations to these placements should be carefully recorded.

- Vegetation data collection
  - Record all vascular plants,Restricted bryophytes, and lichens within plots.
  - Data entry includes progressive species listing and, where possible, abundance/cover estimates.
  - If plots fall within cropped fields, sample the edge vegetation and hedgerow/track species as appropriate.
  - Summaries include a structured plant list and cover categories.

- Habitat and plot descriptors
  - Measure slope from highest to lowest point within the square; record aspect.
  - Attributes within 50 m of the plot are noted; provide notes for difficult categorizations.
  - Data sheets specify categories for vegetation types (woodland, moorland, grassland, arable, etc.) and woodland structure (hardwood, conifer, mixed, isolated trees, canopy, regeneration, dead trees, glades, coppice, etc.).

- Soil pits and soil data
  - Soil pit located at the centre of the quadrat; if obstructed, relocate with documented reasons.
  - Pit typically 45–60 cm wide and 1 m long, dug to horizon boundaries (up to 75 cm if needed).
  - Horizons described using horizon symbol, colour, moisture, mottling, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, and soil group.
  - Record parent material and horizon boundaries with precise notes; collect a surface horizon sample (approx. 200 mg) for analysis.
  - Complete horizon data on the soil data sheet; horizon descriptions and sampling guidelines provided.

- Data sheets and coding
  - Structured forms for vegetation, soil horizons, and habitat attributes.
  - Codes and aggregates provided for consistent data entry (e.g., color codes, texture codes, horizon symbols, and structure types).
  - Special sections for notes on difficult classifications or ambiguous identifications.

- Linear features sampling
  - Two linear plots per feature (10 m x 1 m) located on hedges, streams, and roads with direct line sampling.
  - Plots traced along the feature using strings and a measuring stick; species identification follows the same rules as large plots.
  - Principal species cover estimated for each linear feature; woody species recorded for hedges.

- Boundaries, walls, and hedges
  - Field boundary data collected and later cross-checked with direct measurements where possible.
  - Categories include age, construction, condition, and management status (stockproof, derelict, hedge status, wall integrity, etc.).
  - Hedges recorded by constituent woody species; principal species estimated.

- Crops, habitats, and sketch maps
  - Crops and agricultural practices documented (crops, silage, orchards, etc.); additional farmers’ notes encouraged.
  - Sketch maps capture crops, hedgerows, boundaries, and major habitat features with as much detail as possible without clutter.
  - Domestic animals documented; breed keys provided to assist identification and recording.

- Rock, aquatic, and other habitats
  - Habitats under rocks and aquatic environments categorized; notes on geology and hydrology included when useful.
  - aquatic habitats include streams, ponds, lakes, and associated features such as ditches and channels.
  - Other habitat types and features catalogued to support broad ecological interpretation.

- Buildings and human infrastructure
  - Vernacular vs non-vernacular buildings documented; industrial sites, waste areas, and other features recorded as observed.

- Conclusions and quality assurance
  - After data collection, ensure all sheets are complete, data are clean, and maps reflect square-level information.
  - Cross-check data against the kilometre square map, and reference the Land Class summaries for context and modification notes.

- Appendices and coding systems
  - Horizon symbol coding (e.g., dry, moist, wet) and color/mottling/texture/structure/stones/root codes.
  - Soil horizon entries include depth, moisture, color, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pans, and soil group.
  - Lists of species identifiers and aggregates, bryophytes, lichens, and common plant genera with codes.
  - Livestock breeds (sheep, cattle, horses) and domestic animal breed keys for field notes.
  - Land Class descriptions and regional variants to assist interpretation of habitat context.

- Equipment and project checklist
  - Comprehensive lists of field tools and data-collection materials (plows, tapes, meters, sheets, compasses, pens, labels, and species keys) to support standardized data collection and record-keeping.
