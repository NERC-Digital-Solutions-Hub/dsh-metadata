# Countryside Survey
1978

- Overview and objective
  - Defines guidelines for field survey to obtain an ecological assessment of a 2-kilometre square sampling unit.
  - Emphasises consistency across trials, with allowances for local divergences recorded where they occur.
  - Aims to produce map-based, spatially explicit ecological information for a range of audiences.

- Survey design and data streams
  - Data collection within each square comprises four components:
    - 5 randomly located vegetation plots (each about 200 m in extent).
    - 5 randomly located soil pits within the centres of the vegetation plots.
    - Linear plots along streams, roads, and hedgerows.
    - Broad ecological information for the entire kilometre square.
  - Keys and aggregated lists (e.g., species, habitats, and land types) are provided to centralise information.

- Plot location and field positioning
  - Plots are positioned indirectly: locate the nearest recognizable point on the map, then navigate to the plot center by compass and pacing.
  - Plot diagonals are oriented at right angles; different plot-size markings are indicated by colored strings.
  - Plots should avoid linear features where possible; if the pacing leads to a feature, relocate and record on the map.
  - Five randomised plots are marked on maps; alterations require careful documentation.

- Vegetation data collection
  - Record all vascular plants; include restricted bryophytes and lichens as per Tables 1 and 2.
  - Species lists are compiled with cover estimates, typically within 5% categories, prioritising principal (dominant) species.
  - If crops or field conditions affect identification, note edge species from hedgerows or tracks or record edge effects.
  - A diagram and a standardized species list support consistent data capture.

- Soil pit methodology
  - Soil pit located at the center of the quadrat (or nearest permissible location if blocked).
  - Typical pit size: approximately 45–60 cm wide by 1 m long; dug to horizon C/R or to 75 cm depth.
  - Horizons are identified and marked; the horizon boundaries are recorded and described.
  - The sunlit end of the pit is used for horizon description; soil features are documented using a structured data sheet (horizon symbol, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, and additional comments).
  - Soil samples (~200 g) are collected from the surface horizon or appropriate underlying horizon as described, with careful handling to avoid contamination.

- Data sheets, coding, and metadata
  - Completion of data sheets follows standardized fields (stratum, horizon thickness, horizon symbol, moisture, color, mottles, texture, structure, stones, roots, carbonates, earthworms, iron pan, soil group, parent material, comments).
  - Horizon symbols and color/mottling codes are provided; moisture, texture, and structure use predefined codes to ensure consistency across plots.
  - A dedicated section describes sampling depth and horizon-level procedures, with guidelines for when horizons are irregular.

- Linear features and boundary sampling
  - Linear plots (two per feature) are 10 x 1 m and are completed for hedges, streams, and roads.
  - Plots are placed in direct line from the feature, with transects traced using a 1 m ruler and a straight string to accommodate curves.
  - Feature types include hedges (and hedgerows), roads (edge or centerline as appropriate), streams (water edge), and ditches (permanent water not required).
  - Species identification follows the same rules as the main plots; principal species along features are recorded, with woody species in brackets where relevant.

- Sketch maps, crops, and habitats
  - Sketch maps require identification of crops, woodlands, hedgerows, field boundaries, and other features to convey the square's landscape.
  - Farmer input is sought for crop types; names should be written directly on the map copy.
  - Habitats are indicated on the sketch map and summarized using vegetation-dominant categories (e.g., woodland, arable, moor, bog).

- Domestic animals and other subjects
  - Documentation includes livestock breeds and domestic animals, using provided keys; cross-squares may be used for reference breeds.

- Land classes and supplementary material
  - Land classes provide a broader landscape typology; a back section includes brief summaries and examples to aid interpretation.
  - The document includes extensive auxiliary material (e.g., guidelines for land classes, species and aggregate coding, bryophytes, and lichens) to support consistent GIS-ready data capture.

- Data quality, completeness, and workflow
  - After completing plots and the kilometre square sheet, researchers are advised to check for completeness and data cleanliness.
  - Sheets should be clipped together and cross-referenced with the kilometre square map to ensure no information is omitted.
  - The approach favors including information with comments rather than omitting uncertain data, facilitating later cleaning and cross-checking.

- Outputs and GIS relevance
  - The methodology yields a rich, multi-layered dataset suitable for GIS map-based data products, including: vegetation composition, soil horizon data, soil properties, linear feature data, boundaries, and habitat classifications.
  - Standardized coding, landscape classification, and detailed metadata support cross-square comparisons and integrated mapping across large regions.
  - The handbook emphasizes reproducibility, transparent field decisions (e.g., plot relocation rules), and thorough documentation to enable robust spatial analyses.
