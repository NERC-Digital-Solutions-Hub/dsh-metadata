# River Wensum Water Quality Data (2010 - 2016)

- What the dataset covers
  - River Wensum catchment in the UK
  - 20 river water sampling sites (17 tributary outlets + 3 main river sites)
  - Approximately monthly sampling from October 2010 to September 2016
  - Total of 899 water samples collected

- Sampling design and collection methods
  - River water grab samples collected from the centre of the channel
  - Sample size: 1 liter, acid pre-washed polypropylene bottles
  - Samples transported in cool boxes and stored at 4°C within 5 hours of collection to minimise degradation

- Laboratory analysis and quality control
  - Analyses conducted within five days of collection
  - Analytes: nutrients, carbon, major ions, and total suspended solids (TSS)
  - Quality assurance:
    - Regular instrument accuracy and limits-of-detection tests using certified reference materials
    - Precision checked via repeat measurements
    - Out-of-tolerance analyses reanalysed after instrument recalibration
    - Manual data checks prior to acceptance

- The dataset and its metadata
  - Comprehensive metadata for a wide range of analytes, including:
    - Physical/chemical parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (EC)
    - Major ions: Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, total alkalinity (CaCO3), HCO3-, CO3 2-
    - Nutrients and nitrogen species: NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, total nitrogen (TN), total particulate nitrogen (TPN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved organic nitrogen (DON)
    - Total phosphorus forms: TP, TPP, TDP, TRP, PO4 3-
    - Carbon forms: total carbon (TC), total organic carbon (TOC)
    - Particulate matter: TSS
    - Other: ion balance error
  - Units and data structure are specified for each parameter (where available)
  - Date/time format: yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm; geographic coordinates in decimal degrees
  - Tables include instrument provenance and performance indicators

- Instruments and analytical methods used
  - Metrohm 855 robotic titro sampler (instruments for titration)
  - Agilent ICP-OES Vista Pro (major element concentrations)
  - Dionex ICS2000 Ion Chromatography (anions/cations)
  - Skalar San++ Autoanalyser (water chemistry analyses)
  - Skalar Formacs CA15 TOC TN analyser (total organic carbon and total nitrogen)

- Data quality, validation, and governance
  - Data quality assured through systematic QA procedures
  - Instrument performance validated per batch; recalibration performed as needed
  - Data checked manually for errors before acceptance
  - Metadata provided to support reproducibility and data governance
  - Some metadata fields indicated as not applicable or not available (NA) in places, reflecting gaps that could affect full interoperability

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy decision-making
  - Demonstrates end-to-end workflow for robust environmental monitoring: systematic sampling, rigorous laboratory QA, comprehensive metadata, and clear data provenance
  - Provides a rich, long-term baseline for river water quality indicators (nutrients, carbon, ions, TSS, and related phosphorus/nitrogen forms)
  - Highlights the importance of detailed metadata, instrument documentation, and quality control to support transparent reporting and evidence-based decision-making
  - Illustrates practical data-management considerations (timeliness, data sharing readiness, and potential metadata gaps) relevant to designing and implementing monitoring frameworks
