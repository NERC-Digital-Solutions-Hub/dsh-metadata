# River Wensum Water Quality Data (2010 - 2016)

## Overview
- A long-term dataset (2010–2016) of river water quality covering 20 sampling sites within the River Wensum catchment (17 tributary outlets and 3 main river sites).
- Aimed at illustrating environmental condition in a consistent, monitorable format to support assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Sampling design and collection
- Approximately monthly sampling across the 20 sites, totaling 899 water samples.
- Sites include 17 tributaries and 3 main river locations.
- Sampling method: manual grab samples from the center of the river channel into 1 L acid-prewashed bottles.
- Sample handling: transported in cool boxes and returned to cold storage (4°C) within 5 hours to minimise biological degradation.

## Laboratory analysis and quality assurance
- Analyses conducted within five days of collection at the UEA Science Analytical Facilities.
- Parameters measured: nutrients, carbon, major ions, and total suspended solids (TSS).
- Quality assurance:
  - Instrument accuracy and limits of detection validated each batch using certified reference materials.
  - Instrument precision checked via repeat measurements.
  - Any out-of-tolerance runs reanalyzed after recalibration.
  - Manual data checks for errors prior to acceptance.

## The dataset and metadata
- Metadata provides detailed documentation for each measurement, including:
  - Geographic coordinates (latitude/longitude) and date/time stamps.
  - A wide range of chemical measurements with units, instrumentation, and quality metrics.
  - Long-term precision and accuracy values where applicable, plus detection limits.
- Measured parameters cover:
  - pH, electrical conductivity, major ions (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, CO3/CO3 2-, HCO3-), total alkalinity.
  - Carbon and nitrogen species (TC, TOC, TN, TDN, TPN, DON, NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, TDP/TN components, TRP, TSS, Si, various metals such as B, Al, Fe, Mn).
  - Phosphorus forms (TP, TPP, TDP, TRP, PO4 3-).
- Data tables include comprehensive instrument-specific details and performance indicators.

## Instruments and methods
- Table 2 (Analytical instruments) lists:
  - Metrohm 855 robotic titro sampler (titration-based analyses).
  - Agilent ICP-OES Vista pro (inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy) for elemental analysis.
  - Dionex ICS2000 Ion Chromatography (for ionic species).
  - Skalar San ++ Autoanalyser (for routine chemical analysis).
  - Skalar Formacs CA15 TOC/TN analyser (for total carbon and total nitrogen analyses).

## Data quality and standardisation
- Data are processed and stored following standardised procedures to enable comparability over time.
- Emphasis on ensuring data quality, traceability, and consistency across sites and years.
- Outputs are prepared for clear presentation in reports, maps, and charts, aligning with standard monitoring outputs.

## Practical implications and use
- Facilitates long-term assessment of river water quality against standards.
- Useful for monitoring environmental policy performance and identifying temporal/spatial trends.
- Encourages integration with other datasets to enhance the value of monitoring data (as per challenges for this archetype).

## Challenges and opportunities (alignment with analyst archetype)
- Challenge: increasing the value of the datasets by combining with other relevant data sources to avoid single-use limitations.
- Challenge: enabling broad access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs, promoting transparency and secondary analyses.
