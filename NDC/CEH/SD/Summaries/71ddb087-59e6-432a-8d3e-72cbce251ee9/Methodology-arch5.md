# River Wensum Water Quality Data (2010 - 2016)

## Overview
- 899 water samples collected from 20 sites (17 tributaries + 3 main river sites) across the catchment.
- Sampling occurred approximately monthly from October 2010 to September 2016.
- Sample handling: 1 L acid pre-washed polypropylene bottles; transported in cool boxes and stored at 4°C within 5 hours to minimise degradation.

## Sampling and Handling
- Samples were collected manually from the centre of the channel.

## Laboratory Analysis and QA/QC
- Analyses conducted within five days of collection to determine concentrations of nutrients, carbon, major ions, and total suspended solids (TSS).
- Quality assurance included: certified reference materials, calibration checks, repeat measurements, and reanalysis of runs outside tolerances.
- All data were manually checked for errors prior to acceptance.

## The Dataset and Metadata Details
- Metadata (Table 1) includes:
  - Spatial/temporal: latitude/longitude (decimal degrees), date/time (yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm).
  - Chemical/physical parameters and units: pH, electrical conductivity (µS/cm), Ca, Mg, Na, K, sulfate, chloride, total alkalinity, bicarbonate, carbonate, silica, boron, aluminum, iron, manganese, nitrate, nitrite, ammonium, total nitrogen (TN), total particulate nitrogen, total dissolved nitrogen, dissolved organic nitrogen, total phosphorus, total particulate phosphorus, total dissolved phosphorus, total reactive phosphorus, phosphate, total carbon, total organic carbon, TSS, ion balance.
  - Many analytes include long-term precision, limits of detection, and other QA-related notes.
- Metadata (Table 2) lists analytical instruments and manufacturers/models used:
  - Metrohm 855 robotic titro sampler.
  - Agilent ICP-OES Vista Pro.
  - Dionex ICS2000 Ion Chromatography.
  - Skalar San++ Autoanalyser.
  - Skalar Formacs CA15 TOC TN analyser.

## Data Quality, Uncertainty and Provenance
- Long-term precision and detection limits are provided for numerous analytes (e.g., EC, various ions, metals, N and P species, TC/TOC, TSS).
- Some entries show not applicable (N/A) precision or accuracy values.
- Instrumentation details and QA procedures are documented to support traceability and reuse.

## Data Availability and Sharing Considerations
- Dataset is described with comprehensive QA and metadata, suitable for sharing via data portals.
- Users should note fields with N/A in precision/LOD and ensure appropriate data handling, standardization, and versioning.

## Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Emphasizes the need for complete, standardized metadata (consistent date/time formats, coordinates, units, calibration records).
- Documentation of QA procedures and instrument performance is essential for reuse and data provenance.
- Consider establishing clear update, revision, and embargo policies to manage data lifecycle and discoverability.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Data Stewards
- Managing a multi-analyte dataset across multiple instruments requires careful standardization and interoperability of metadata.
- Balancing timely data sharing with rigorous QA.
- Handling any data access limitations or sharing restrictions while maintaining transparency of provenance.
