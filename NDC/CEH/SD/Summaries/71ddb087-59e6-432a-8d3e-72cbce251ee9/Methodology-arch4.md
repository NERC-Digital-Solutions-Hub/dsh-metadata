# River Wensum Water Quality Data (2010 - 2016)

## Overview
- 899 river water samples collected 2010–2016 from 20 sites (17 tributaries outlets + 3 main river sites) across the catchment.
- Sampling cadence: approximately monthly from October 2010 to September 2016.
- Locations and sampling framework depicted in Figure 1.
- Samples collected as grab samples from the center of the channel using 1 L acid pre-washed polypropylene bottles.

## Sample Collection and Handling
- Samples transported in cool boxes and returned to cold storage (4°C) within 5 hours to minimise degradation.

## Laboratory Analysis and QA/QC
- Analyses performed within five days of collection at UEA Science Analytical Facilities.
- Analytes: nutrients, carbon, major ions, and total suspended solids (TSS).
- Quality assurance: use of certified reference materials, instrument accuracy checks, and repeat measurements for precision; reanalysis if runs fell outside tolerances after instrument recalibration.
- All data manually checked for errors prior to acceptance.

## The Dataset and Metadata
- Table 1: Metadata coverage includes parameters such as:
  - Spatial/temporal: Latitude, Longitude, Date/Time (yyyy/mm/dd:hh:mm)
  - Water chemistry parameters: pH, electrical conductivity (µS/cm), Ca, Mg, Na, K, SO4, Cl, total alkalinity (CaCO3), HCO3-, CO3 2-, Si, B, Al, Fe, Mn
  - Nitrogen and phosphorus species: NO3-, NO2-, NH4+, TN, TPN, TDN, DON, TP, TPP, TDP, TRP, PO4 3-
  - Carbon and particulates: Total Carbon (TC), Total Organic Carbon (TOC), TSS
  - Data quality indicators: Analytic instrument references, long-term precision (±), long-term accuracy (absolute), and detection limits (where applicable)

## Data Quality, Standards, and Usability
- Comprehensive QA/QC framework supports data reliability and reproducibility across multiple years and numerous parameters.
- Detailed metadata and instrument specifications enable traceability, auditability, and reuse in long-term trend analyses and cross-parameter studies.
- The dataset is suitable for integration into broader data systems with attention to units, detection limits, and calibration records.
