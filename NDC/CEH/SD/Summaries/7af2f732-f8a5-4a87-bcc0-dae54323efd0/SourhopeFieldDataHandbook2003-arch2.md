  - pH(H2O): 4.45–4.82
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.64–4.05

- Vegetation survey (Block 4, PLOTS 4A–4F)
  - Plots show presence/absence data and species totals across subplots, with overall totals indicating diverse vegetation patterns within the experimental area.
  - Documented alignment with broad vegetation classifications observed at Sourhope (notably grasses/shrubby indicators) and variations across plots consistent with microtopography and moisture.

- Notable vegetation conclusions for Block 4
  - Dominant vegetation associations and species consistent with site characteristics observed in earlier sections, including Festuca and Agrostis-dominated communities and evidence of microclimatic moisture gradients.

- Data quality and handling
  - Analyses follow standardized soil sampling and measurement protocols; samples archived for future re-analysis; data linked to barcodes for traceability.

- Data relevance to monitoring aims
  - Provides granular soil chemical and physical properties to track environmental health and interpret treatment or site changes over time.
  - Supports integration with broader Sourhope datasets (climate, vegetation, soil profiles) for long-term environmental health assessments.

- Data management and archiving
  - Associated records and samples are archived with unique MLURI barcodes; intended for reuse and cross-site comparisons within CEH and related monitoring programs.

# BLOCK 5 SOIL AND VEGETATION DATA

- Site details (Block 5)
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520
  - Altitude: 315 m
  - Slope: 5 degrees
  - Soil drainage: Imperfect
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying
  - Parent material: Undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite
  - Profile pits and horizons described (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg)

- Soil profile (Block 5)
  - Detailed horizon descriptions and depth ranges (0–100 cm) with features such as organic-rich Ah, mottled horizons (ABg, Bg, BCg), and clay loams at deeper horizons.
  - Horizon-by-horizon data include texture, colour, structure, moisture status, roots, and boundary descriptions.

- Soil analysis (Block 5; profiles FH–Cg)
  - Representative measurements across sampled horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg)
  - %N: values range from 0.01 to 2.17
  - %C: values range from 0.12 to 33.81
  - C:N Ratio: ranges from ~10.20 to ~16.46
  - Ca (meq/100g): 0.35–11.91
  - Na (meq/100g): largely non-detectable in several horizons
  - K (meq/100g): 0.58–0.83 (some horizons higher, e.g., 1.26–5.0 in select layers)
  - Mg (meq/100g): 0.58–5.92
  - %Moisture loss: 2.97–9.43
  - %Loss on Ignition: 4.83–67.00
  - pH(H2O): 4.34–5.20
  - pH(CaCl2): 3.53–4.41
  - Note: Block 5 profile shows a gradient of acidity with depth and substantial organic and mineral horizon variation, consistent with brown forest soil with gleying.

  - Vegetation: Data indicate presence/absence across subplots with low to moderate species counts, reflecting controlled-environment conditions.

- Data management and archiving (Blocks 4–5 and ECOTRON)
  - Each sample and plot is catalogued with barcodes and stored for long-term use and cross-site comparisons.
  - Standardised methodologies enable integration into larger data ecosystems and reuse for monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Relevance to the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype
  - Demonstrates a structured, site-based monitoring program capturing soil chemistry, horizon-based soil profiles, moisture status, and vegetation composition.
  - Uses standardized analytical outputs (N, C, C:N, base cations, moisture loss, LOI, pH) to quantify environmental health and track changes over time.
  - Faciliates data sharing and open access by archiving samples and datasets with unique identifiers, supporting scrutiny and reuse by researchers and monitoring programs.
