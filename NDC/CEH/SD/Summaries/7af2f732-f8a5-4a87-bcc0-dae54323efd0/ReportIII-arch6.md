# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: provide broad context for detailed studies, enable year-to-year comparisons, and support data synthesis across groups.
- Measurements monitored (1999–2001): automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth disease; no visitors Feb–May; first biocide application in May missed; subsequent management actions largely maintained; change in site Officer in Charge.

## Key Measurements and Findings

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001; 845 mm in 1999).
- Total annual radiation ~3473–3472 MJ/m²; average air temperatures ~7.3–7.7°C; soil moisture ~0.37 m³/m³.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchical response to treatments; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Analysis shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year × treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
- Nitrogen and Lime (N&L) and related treatments most strongly promoted biomass.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continues to raise topsoil pH: October 2001 averages of 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots show no significant change since baseline measures in August 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis: ~58% more total hits than 2000; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
- Species-level shifts by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (N and/or L) and in N&L plots for Festuca rubra.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) more evident in fertilised plots; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential early diversity loss in the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis: PCA separates nitrogen-/lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with Bryophytes and Nardus stricta; improved plots associated with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and related species.
- Biomass correlations: higher Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance linked to higher biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases.
- Litter: increased frequency in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F (on the right-facing slope) show more acidic plots, especially within N and/or Lime plots, suggesting underlying spatial patterns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Outliers: several plots with notably low biomass across treatments.
- Conversely, central plots tend to show higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks.

## Data, Methods and Implications

- Data collection and measurement schedule (1998–2001) included mowing, clipping for biomass, Point Quadrat surveys, and supplementary botanical surveys.
- Analyses employed: general ANOVA (split-plot design), year-to-year inter-year comparisons, and Principal Components Analysis (Genstat 5) to explore species associations with treatments.
- Implications for data use:
  - Fertilisation and liming profoundly affect biomass and plant community composition.
  - Soil pH is a key driver of biomass and species distributions; management actions that alter pH have cascading ecological effects.
  - Site geometry and spatial heterogeneity must be accounted for in cross-plot analyses to avoid confounding effects.
  - Data quality indicators: higher sampling intensity in 2001; cross-checks showed consistent measurements across surveyors.
