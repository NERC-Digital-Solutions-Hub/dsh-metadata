# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment at MLURI's Sourhope farm in the Scottish Borders is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, designed to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies with data collected routinely across years.
- Baseline monitoring started at the outset (1998 baseline described in Baseline Data Survey); measurements were intended to enable inter-project comparisons and linkage to other data.
- 2001 management and field conditions were affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (Feb–May) and a change of site officer, with subsequent protocol-driven resumption of sampling and continued site management (e.g., lime, nitrogen applications, pH measurements, biomass collections, cutting, and Point Analysis).

## Monitoring and Data Collection

- A diverse monitoring suite was prescribed, with measurement types and dates listed (Table 1), including:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture)
  - Above-ground biomass production across plots and sub-plots
  - Soil pH measurements (upper 5 cm)
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat (July 2001 protocol mirrored 2000)
  - Mowing regimes and biomass sampling across five cuts per summer
  - Fine-scale vegetation surveys around minirhizotron tubes and targeted sub-plots
- Management activities for 2001 proceeded largely as planned, though one biocide application in May was missed; the field program incorporated a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Data handling included normalising biomass by a reference plot (C1), statistical analyses (ANOVA on log-transformed biomass), and multivariate analyses (PCA) for vegetation composition.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather largely unremarkable: rainfall close to long-term average after a very wet prior year; radiation similar; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across plots, with peak production in July/August.
- 2001 biomass estimates increased notably relative to 2000, likely due to a combination of personnel changes and the switch to mechanical cutting.
- After normalising to C1, nitrogen and/or lime treatments continued to show positive impacts on productivity.
- Split-plot ANOVAs showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots and a significant treatment-by-year interaction, but no significant block effect.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raised surface pH to 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey: no significant difference between surveyors; total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (likely from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment differences in dominant species emerged:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001 (except remaining most abundant in Control and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (Festuca rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); less diverse, more fertile plots differed from unimproved plots that favored species like Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta.
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs. 18 in Nitrogen & Lime, suggesting reduced diversity in more fertilised/improved plots.
- PCA indicated clear separation of improved vs. unimproved plots; control/unimproved plots clustered together with bryophyte indicators and less productive species, while improved plots showed dominance by Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass was positively correlated with relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; ABOVE-GROUND biomass increased with these species, while Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass rose.
- Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic, with underlying variation suggesting that some columns (notably with higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots) exhibited lower pH in nitrogen and/or lime improved columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Some outlier plots showed particularly low biomass across treatments; conversely, higher biomass tended to cluster in more centrally located plots.
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks in biomass.

## Data and Monitoring Considerations for Monitoring Frameworks

- The Sourhope experiment demonstrates a long-term, multi-metric monitoring approach, integrating climate, soil chemistry, biomass, and plant community data to interpret treatment effects.
- Key considerations highlighted by the report relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Importance of baseline data and consistent cross-year measurements to enable trend recognition and inter-study comparisons.
  - Sensitivity of results to operational changes (e.g., switch from manual to mechanical cutting) and personnel changes; need to document such changes for data interpretation.
  - Handling of data quality and metadata: the study relies on metadata (treatment codes, block structure, sampling dates) and notes data management practices (data shared with a data manager), underscoring governance requirements for transparency and reproducibility.
  - Use of transformations (e.g., log transformation for biomass) to meet statistical assumptions in analysis.
  - Need to account for site heterogeneity (spatial variation across plots/columns) when interpreting treatment effects, and to report spatial patterns that may confound or modify treatment signals.
  - Demonstrates value of multivariate analyses (PCA) to summarize complex community responses and linkage to productivity metrics.
