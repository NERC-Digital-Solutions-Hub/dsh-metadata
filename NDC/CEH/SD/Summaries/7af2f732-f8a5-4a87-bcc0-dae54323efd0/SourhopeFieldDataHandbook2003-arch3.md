## ECOTRON AND Monitoring Context

- ECOTRON plots: a dedicated ECOTRON plot exists within the Sourhope site, with soil analyses (Wt ~6.1 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76; Mg 1.7; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82) and vegetation inventories, supporting controlled-environment experiments.
- Data management considerations: sample barcodes (MLURI), storage practices (-80°C archives), and integration with ECN and open data goals; metadata completeness and cross-block comparability are essential for monitoring use.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Measured indicators relevant for policy evaluation:
  - Soil fertility and acidity: %N, %C, C:N, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2), Ca/Mg/K/Na, moisture retention.
  - Organic matter and texture dynamics: LOI and horizon-specific carbon content; presence of amorphous vs. structured horizons.
  - Vegetation community structure: species richness, dominant/indicator species, and NVC-relevant classifications inferred from community composition.
  - Treatment and microhabitat responses: horizon-depth–dependent variability informs responses to liming, nitrogen addition, and disturbance.
- Data quality and governance:
  - The dataset emphasizes the need for complete metadata, standardized formats, and accessible underlying data to enable cross-site monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.
  - Open data practices are pursued, with archival storage and public dissemination, though metadata quality and data-sharing barriers may require ongoing governance work.

## Beginning, Middle, and End — Key Takeaways for Monitoring Frameworks

- Beginning: Establishment of a long-term, multi-block soil-vegetation monitoring site at Sourhope (Block 4 and Block 5), with systematic horizon-level soil analyses and vegetation surveys.
- Middle: Implementation of detailed horizon-based sampling (0–100 cm) and auger-based sampling across blocks, coupled with ECOTRON integration to study soil-plant responses under controlled conditions; development of a robust data framework linking soil chemistry, organic matter, and vegetation composition.
- End: Production of a policy-relevant monitoring dataset—emphasizing soil health indicators, vegetation indicators, metadata quality, and governance—to inform environmental health decisions, policy evaluation, and future monitoring enhancements. The dataset illustrates both opportunities for open data-enabled monitoring and barriers related to metadata completeness and cross-site standardization.
