# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Detailed soil profiles and vegetation data from Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus ECOTRON PLOT data.
- Data types include horizon descriptions (depths and structure), auger samples, and comprehensive soil chemistry and physical properties: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition (LOI); pH in water and CaCl2; sample weights and barcodes linking to records.
- Vegetation surveys recorded per plot/sub-plot with presence/absence and species totals; ECOTRON vegetation data included.
- Contextual site information includes grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, and parent material; data archived with barcodes enabling traceability and cross-project reuse.
- Observed patterns reflect horizon development, drainage differences, and substrate variation (intermediate igneous/andesite) across blocks; Block 5 shows deeper horizons (BG/CG) and more developed profiles.

## Data structure and provenance

- BLOCK 4
  - Horizons described: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Analyses per horizon: sample weights, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O); pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples: labeled 4A–4F with corresponding chemical/physical measurements.
- BLOCK 5
  - Horizons described: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Analyses per horizon: similar set of metrics as Block 4 (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, LOI, pH, etc.).
  - Auger samples: 5A–5F with parallel measurements.
- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Soil analysis: single plot with weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O); pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation: per-subplot records with species totals and presence/absence across subplots.
- Data capture and linkage
  - MLURI barcodes link each horizon and sample to dataset records.
  - Associated site details (grid refs, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) provided per block.
  - Data integrated with ECN collaboration and long-term soil/vegetation monitoring plans.

## Data quality, gaps, and governance

- Data completeness and consistency
  - Horizons and horizon-designation schemes vary by block; some horizons and auger samples have incomplete data entries (noted with blanks).
  - Block 4 shows high LOI in surface horizons with decreasing LOI in deeper horizons; pH values indicate acidity across horizons (roughly pH 4.0–5.0 range, depending on horizon and sample).
  - Block 5 exhibits multi-horizon development with prominent mottles and clay-rich lower horizons; deeper horizons (Cg) show higher Ca and Mg variability.
- Variability and limitations
  - Within-block variability in chemical parameters (Ca, Mg, K, Na) and LOI across horizons and plots; some blocks show gaps (e.g., incomplete Block 4–5 data pages) requiring careful handling in analyses.
  - Vegetation data show per-plot richness and composition differences across subplots, reflecting microtopography and soil variation.
- Governance and provenance
  - Long-term data stewardship via MLURI; archived samples (notably soil) with barcodes; ECN collaboration supports ongoing monitoring.
  - Extensive appendices and metadata (block/site details, horizon descriptions, barcodes) facilitate reproducibility and reuse for policy, ecosystem services, and cross-network research.

## Applications for data leaders

- System-wide data perspective
  - Integrates plot- and horizon-level vegetation data with multi-horizon soil chemistry to explore soil–plant interactions under varying conditions (e.g., differing horizon development, drainage, and substrate).
  - Enables slope- and zone-based analyses to identify drivers of nutrient availability, soil acidity, and organic matter dynamics.
- Discoverability and governance
  - Detailed metadata and barcode linkage enhance discoverability and traceability for researchers across networks (policy, SERAD, ECN Micronet).
  - Strong data governance through archived samples and longitudinal collaboration supports reproducibility and future analyses.
- Gaps and coordination
  - Identified gaps include incomplete Block 4–5 soil data in some horizons and subplots; emphasis on completing cross-block coverage for robust longitudinal analyses.
  - Data design supports cross-project collaboration and data sharing of vegetation and soil metrics to support ecosystem assessments.
- Practical outcomes
  - Data enable analyses of soil-vegetation relationships along management and natural gradients, inform soil stewardship decisions, and contribute to broader understandings of upland soil ecosystems in networked research.

## Appendices and metadata highlights

- Appendix-style details per block, including block-level site details, horizon descriptions, and comprehensive soil and vegetation data.
- Tables and figures with species lists, dominance classifications, vegetation types, and soil parameter tables by block, plot, and horizon.
- Barcoded samples for traceability; ECOTRON data complementary to the main blocks, supporting cross-site comparisons and long-term monitoring.
