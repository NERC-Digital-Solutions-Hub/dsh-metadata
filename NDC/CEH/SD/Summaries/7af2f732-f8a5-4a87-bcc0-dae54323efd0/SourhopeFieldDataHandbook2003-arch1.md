# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Provides baseline soil and vegetation data for the Sourhope field site, focusing on Rigg Foot across BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, with ancillary ECOTRON plots.
- Aims to support long-term monitoring and cross-block comparisons of soil biodiversity, vegetation composition, and nutrient status within broader environmental-change programmes.

## Data collected and methods
- Soil profiling
  - Blocks 4 and 5: detailed soil profile descriptions by horizon (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges.
  - Profile pits and auger cores (0–30 cm and deeper horizons) to characterize horizon morphology and boundary types.
- Soil analysis (performed by MLURI)
  - Chemical and physical properties by horizon: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, loss on ignition (LOI), pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Key patterns tracked: pH trends with depth, LOI and moisture loss in surface horizons, carbon/nitrogen relationships, and exchangeable cations.
- Auger sampling
  - Horizon-specific auger samples (e.g., 4A–4F; 5A–5F) with measurements of N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH.
- Vegetation surveys
  - 50 cm x 50 cm point quadrats within plots; multiple subplots per main plot; presence/absence with incidence data and occasional abundance notes.
  - Data organized per plot and subplot; analysis includes species richness, dominant species, and community classification (in context of Twinspan and NVC-style groupings).
- ECOTRON data
  - Subset of BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 represented in ECOTRON plots with soil chemistry and vegetation surveys, enabling comparison with the main blocks under controlled environment conditions.
- Data organization and accessibility
  - Horizon-level and plot-level data linked to MLURI barcodes; detailed appendices accompany the main sections for full datasets, including site details, horizon descriptions, and baseline vegetation and soil tables.

## Block-specific data highlights
- BLOCK 4
  - Soil profiles show horizon progression from surface organic-rich layers (LF, FH, H, Ah) to deeper mineral horizons (Abg, B sg, C gx).
  - Soil chemistry indicates strong surface-layer organic content (high LOI in FH/H/Ah), notable acidity (pH H2O ~4.6–4.9; CaCl2 even lower in some horizons), and elevated carbon and nitrogen in upper horizons.
  - Exchangeable Ca dominates across horizons with variable Mg; other cations (Na, K) show horizon-dependent patterns.
  - Moisture loss values are higher in upper horizons and LOI values are substantial in FH and H, declining with depth.
  - Auger samples (4A–4F) reveal intra-plot variability in N, C, C:N, and exchangeable cations, reflecting microtopography and horizon differences.
- BLOCK 5
  - Similar horizon structure with a pronounced Ah horizon and BCg/Cg layers, showing substantial organic-rich surface and mottling in mineral horizons.
  - Block 5 profile data show high LOI in surface horizons and elevated %C and %N in Ah in several cores; Ca and other cations vary by horizon and sublayer.
  - Auger samples (5A–5F) demonstrate notable subplot variation in nutrient content, moisture loss, LOI, pH, and C:N ratios, highlighting small-scale heterogeneity.
  - Vegetation data across PLOTS 5A–5F indicate diverse subplots with varying species totals and compositions, reflecting microhabitat differences within the block.
- ECOTRON PLOTS
  - Soil analyses from ECOTRON PLOT show baseline values suitable for cross-comparison with main-block data (e.g., %N, %C, C:N, nutrient concentrations, pH).
  - Vegetation surveys in ECOTRON plots provide a controlled-point reference for community composition relative to field blocks.

## Vegetation findings (summary)
- Across plots, communities are characterized by mixtures of grasses and forbs common to upland/peaty grasslands.
- Dominant or frequent taxa include grasses such as Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta, and other welfare-associated grasses; indicator and association species are noted through the detailed plot-by-plot data.
- Species richness varies by block and plot, with cooler microhabitats (shallower, damper hollows) showing distinct compositions compared to drier ridges or south-facing aspects.
- The data support classification into community types consistent with existing vegetation frameworks (e.g., NVC-like groupings) and provide baseline indicators for monitoring shifts under management or climate change.

## Data quality, limitations, and context
- Baseline data are year-1 with full depth and horizon data in main plots but may have partial subplot coverage in some vegetation surveys.
- Some blocks show localized anomalies in soil data, necessitating cautious interpretation when comparing across plots.
- Data are intended as foundational references for long-term monitoring and for evaluating treatment effects (e.g., grazing, nutrients) within the Sourhope programme.

## Uses and future applications
- Baseline for monitoring long-term soil biodiversity, nutrient cycling, and grassland community responses to environmental change and management.
- Enables cross-block comparisons (Blocks 4 and 5) and integration with ECOTRON datasets for controlled-environment insights.
- Supports data-driven assessment of how soil properties relate to vegetation composition and productivity over time.

## Appendices and data availability
- Extensive appendices provide full datasets: horizon-level soil descriptions, profile data, auger sample analyses, and detailed vegetation inventories by plot and subplot.
- Datasets are organized with MLURI barcodes and return a citable, discoverable record for subsequent analyses and cross-referencing with related reports and Twinspan/Association analyses.
