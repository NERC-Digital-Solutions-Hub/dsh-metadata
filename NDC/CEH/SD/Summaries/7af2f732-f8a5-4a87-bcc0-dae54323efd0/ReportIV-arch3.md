# SUMMARY

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders) with intensive study of above- and below-ground interactions.
- Focus on monitoring changes in above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in response to management treatments.

## Monitoring framework and site setup
- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
- Design: Each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random; 0.5 m2 cells used for repeated sampling.
- Treatments (plot-level and site-level): 
  - Control 1 (unmanipulated)
  - Control 2 (unmanipulated)
  - Nitrogen (NH4NO3)
  - Lime (CaCO3)
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA, chlorpyrifos)
- Management actions: Site-wide mowing of vegetation monthly (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots; nutrients added spring; long-term mowing regime since 1999.
- Data collection and indicators:
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (from Feb 1999)
  - Above-ground productivity: annual biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 samples within sub-plots
  - Baseline and repeated botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 quadrats and 100-point analysis (2000–2002)
  - Soil data: pH measurements (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in 2002)
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant inventories; species lists (Appendix 3)
  - Data products include biomass time-series, treatment-normalised productivity, PCA/STATISTICAL analyses, and functional-group classifications (CSR framework)

## Key results (beginning to end)

### Mowing effects
- Regular mowing supported Festuca rubra expansion in more fertile plots, often at the expense of Agrostis spp., which appear more sensitive to mowing.
- Stress-tolerant species expanded across most plots, suggesting mowing reduced disturbance (relative to past grazing) and lowered nutrient-cavailability in unfertilised plots.
- Bryophyte abundance increased across the site, particularly in unfertilised plots, possibly aided by maintained sward height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing.

### Fertilisation effects
- Nitrogen and/or lime additions increased above-ground productivity; plots receiving both N and lime were the most productive.
- High lime applications pushed soil pH toward ~7.0; the pH–productivity relationship is strong, with a positive overall link between higher pH and biomass, though the relationship weakened in plots with both N and lime (potential moisture stress and chlorosis observed in some lime-treated plots).
- Fertilised plots showed functional shifts: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) and SR/C-S-R groups expanded in N+L plots; stress-tolerant (S) species gained in unimproved plots.

### Insecticide effects
- The insecticide plots showed higher diversity indicators in some years, but evidence linking reduced herbivory directly to diversity changes is inconclusive and likely context-dependent.
- Patterns align with other field studies where insecticide effects can increase or decrease diversity depending on life form and timing.

### Trampling effect
- 2002 sampling in C2 plots (where trampling was likely intense during 13CO2 pulse experiments) coincided with a notable drop in productivity relative to C1 plots, suggesting trampling can suppress growth in active sampling areas.

### Community structure and diversity
- Point Analysis reveals treatment-driven differences in the frequency of key species; improved plots (N, Lime, N&L) show higher occurrences of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while unimproved plots show higher bryophyte dominance and rarer occurrence of these forbs.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of point hits clearly separates improved vs unimproved plots and shows lime-treated plots forming a distinct cluster.
- Shannon Diversity Index declined in the N&L plots between 1998 and 2002, while other treatments generally maintained or increased diversity (notably insecticide-treated plots).
- Functional-group results (S, CSR, SR/CSR) show consistent treatment-linked shifts; N&L plots favor CSR and SR/CSR species, while unimproved plots favor S-type species.

## Notable patterns and relationships
- Soil pH increases (due to lime) are strongly associated with higher productivity, but very high pH in combination with nitrogen can reduce productivity, likely via moisture stress or chlorosis.
- Soil moisture and pH are inversely related; higher pH plots tend to have lower moisture and higher productivity, but the relationship is treatment-dependent.
- Mowing appears to be a major driver of vascular plant community changes, with bryophytes increasing as vascular competition decreases in some plots.
- Long-term data show cumulative biomass gains across most treatments since 1999, with a temporary dip in 2002, influenced by local slope position and plot-specific factors.

## Data and outputs
- Outputs include:
  - Time-series biomass data by plot and treatment (1999–2002)
  - Baseline and repeated point analyses with species-level and bryophyte data
  - Soil pH and moisture measurements
  - Weather data and annual summaries
  - Functional group (CSR) composition and diversity metrics
  - Appendices detailing species lists, treatment maps, and methodological specifics

## Implications for monitoring and policy design
- The programme demonstrates how paired below- and above-ground monitoring, across multiple treatments, reveals clear links between management actions (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide use) and plant community dynamics.
- Functional-type analysis provides a robust framework to interpret how communities respond to nutrient status, disturbance regime, and soil chemistry.
- Long-term, integrated data collection supports understanding of trade-offs between productivity and biodiversity, and informs adaptive management decisions in grassland ecosystems.
