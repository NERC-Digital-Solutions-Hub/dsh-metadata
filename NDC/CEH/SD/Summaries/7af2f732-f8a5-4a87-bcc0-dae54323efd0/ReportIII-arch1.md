# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Location and purpose
  - Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - A baseline monitoring framework was used to contextualise detailed studies; aims include tracking links between management, biodiversity, and productivity and enabling cross-year comparisons.
  - Key changes in 2001: government restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (Feb–May 2001) with restricted site access; change of Officer in Charge.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather data were generally unremarkable: rainfall near long-term average, total radiation similar to previous years, average temperatures slightly lower, and soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Treatments showed a consistent hierarchical response; peak biomass occurred in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass was substantially higher than 2000, likely due to a combination of personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass analyses: all treatment plots improved with nitrogen and/or lime; significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant differences between blocks.
    - Normalisation to a control (C1) showed continued positive biomass response from nitrogen and lime, similar to the previous year.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming raised the upper 5 cm soil pH to about 6.19 on limed plots and 6.38 on nitrogen plus lime plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 Point Analysis recorded 58% more species hits than 2000; no significant difference between surveyors.
    - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in nitrogen+lime plots, suggesting potential diversification loss with deeper improvement.
    - Treatment effects on species: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; Festuca spp. increased and were most frequent in nitrogen and biocide–fertilized plots (F. ovina and F. rubra); improved plots showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed a shift toward species associated with improved pastures; unimproved plots retained species linked to poorer soils (e.g., Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, bryophytes).
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots were more uniform.
    - Biomass correlation with species: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis tended to decline as biomass increased.
    - Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) showed comparatively more acidic plots, possibly due to a higher proportion of Control or Biocide plots in those columns, indicating underlying site heterogeneity across the experiment.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Several outlier plots with low biomass across treatments; higher biomass often found in more central plots (e.g., certain Nitrogen and Lime, Lime, Biocide, and Control plots).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences in biomass between blocks.
