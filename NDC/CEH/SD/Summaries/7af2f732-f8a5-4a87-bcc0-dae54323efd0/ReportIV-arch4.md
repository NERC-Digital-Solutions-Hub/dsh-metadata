# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, Sourhope Site: Summary

- Overview
  - Four-year field programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focused on linking soil biodiversity with above-ground plant responses.
  - Site managed as a multi-project platform with 24 Phase I and 8 Phase II projects; aims include understanding soil biota, ecological processes, and links to vegetation.
  - Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells; randomised treatments across plots.

- Treatments and management
  - Treatments (6 total): Control 1 (unmanipulated), Control 2 (unmanipulated), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
  - Management actions applied annually since 1999: monthly mowing to ~6 cm from May–Sept; insecticide applied post-mowing to insecticide plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime to designated plots.
  - 2002 context: fieldwork resumed after Foot-and-Mouth restrictions; Phase II groups conducted substantial fieldwork, including labelled CO2 pulses.

- Data collection and data management
  - Climate and site data: on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999; regular temperature, rainfall, and other weather measures; some 2002 data gaps due to station issues (replaced using Konza station for missing periods).
  - Vegetation and productivity data:
    - Above-ground productivity: 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; vegetation clipped, dried, and weighed after each mow (1999–2002).
    - Point analysis surveys: baseline in 1998; annual surveys in 2000–2002 using a 100-point grid to record species hits within a 0.5 m2 cell; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil and bryophyte data: soil pH measured ~5 cm depth (1998 baseline and 2002 re-sampling); soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002; bryophyte and vascular plant species lists collected.
  - Data volume: by 2002, site data comprised 11,621 soil samples; extensive appendices document biomass, weather, species lists, and statistical analyses.
  - Data access: results and species lists are documented in multiple appendices; ongoing data sharing via the Soil Biodiversity website and project contacts.

- Key results and interpretations (2002)
  - Above-ground productivity
    - Overall biomass productivity fell in 2002 relative to 2001 across many treatments; most fertile response remained in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, though gains were smaller than previously.
    - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) increased productivity relative to unfertilised plots; the combined N&L treatment produced the strongest productivity signal.
    - Slope position mattered: Block 5 showed the largest drop in biomass; Block 1 (at the bottom) showed pronounced declines in 2002.
  - Soil chemistry and moisture
    - Lime dramatically increased soil pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil, with nitrogen also increasing pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Higher pH correlated with higher biomass across treatments; however, in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the positive relationship weakened or became negative, suggesting complex interactions.
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; higher pH plots tended to be drier.
  - Plant community composition and functional groups
    - Mowing effect: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across all treatments, suggesting a site-wide response to mowing that is not solely treatment-driven; Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- and/or nitrogen-enhanced plots.
    - Bryophyte expansion: Mosses became more abundant across the site, with a notable rise in bryophyte hits in 2002 (nearly 20% of total hits, up from previous years); bryophyte increases were most pronounced in unimproved plots.
    - Fertilisation effect on plant functional groups: The community shifted toward competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) types in fertilised plots; stress-tolerant (S) species remained dominant in unimproved plots.
    - Nutrient and disturbance gradients: In lime- and nitrogen-treated plots, C-S-R species expanded; stress-tolerant species benefited most in unfertilised plots; overall, fertilisation and liming promoted faster-perennial and nutrient-demanding species.
  - Insecticide effects
    - The insecticide treatment coincided with higher Shannon diversity in some years, but causality remains uncertain; potential mechanism discussed includes reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist, though site fertility and other factors modulate outcomes.
  - Trampling/experimental activity
    - 2002 C2 plots (insecticide/other treatments) showed reduced productivity likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments, highlighting how experimental activities can affect measured productivity.

- Data quality, limitations and governance implications
  - Data challenges: 2002 weather data gaps; slope-related heterogeneity; trampling effects in certain plots; shift in C2 plots with new sampling in 2002; data harmonisation across Phase I/II projects important for cross-year analyses.
  - Metadata and standards: detailed appendices (treatment summaries, species lists, and methodological notes) support data discoverability and reuse; emphasis on long-term data consistency (baseline 1998; 1999–2002 measurements).
  - Opportunities for data-leadership:
    - Maintain and improve centralized metadata schemas, data dictionaries, and documentation across multiple projects.
    - Ensure consistent sampling units, taxonomic standards (e.g., bryophyte vs vascular plant classification), and measurement protocols for cross-study comparability.
    - Promote data discoverability and sharing through a central portal (e.g., Soil Biodiversity website) to facilitate cross-project analyses and community-of-practice collaboration.

- Practical implications for data-driven leadership
  - The Sourhope dataset demonstrates the value of long-term, multi-factor field experiments for understanding data-system dynamics, including how management actions translate into ecosystem responses.
  - To maximise value for data strategy: invest in robust metadata, standardized data collection, clear data provenance, and accessible data products; foster cross-project data integration to support holistic system-level analyses.

- Key data products and resources
  - Biomass time series by plot and year (1999–2002)
  - Point-analysis results and bryophyte/vascular plant species lists (2000–2002)
  - Soil pH and soil moisture measurements (1998 baseline and 2002)
  - Automatic Weather Station records (1999–2002; with noted gaps and adjustments)
  - Appendices detailing site activity, treatment schemes, and species rank abundances
  - Public access via the Soil Biodiversity website and project PI contacts

- Conclusion
  - The Sourhope site provides a robust, multi-faceted data platform enabling nuanced interpretation of how mowing, fertilisation, insecticides, and trampling interact to shape productivity and plant community functional structure.
  - Data leadership takeaways emphasize rigorous data governance, long-term continuity, and cross-project data integration to support evidence-based management and policy-relevant insights.
