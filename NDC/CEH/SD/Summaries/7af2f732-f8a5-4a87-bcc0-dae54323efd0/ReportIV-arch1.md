# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope

- Four years into the Sourhope field experiment, monitoring above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity under five main management treatments.
- Three key management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application.
- Strong links observed between soil chemistry (pH), moisture, and plant productivity, with notable shifts in community structure and functional groups over time.

## Experimental setup and site management

- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments across plots (randomly assigned): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide.
- Site-level management: monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots (Dursban 4 OPA, chlorpyrifos).
- Plot-level inputs: spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on designated plots; lime applied at higher rates; nitrogen and lime schedules detailed in appendices.
- Data collection: weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station; above-ground biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 samples; baseline and subsequent botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 point analyses (repeated 2000–2002); soil pH measurements; soil moisture via theta probe; bryophyte identification; supplementary biomass and cover surveys; extensive appendix datasets (Appendices 1–8).

## Key results and interpretations

### Biomass production and trends
- Clear hierarchical productivity: plots receiving nitrogen and lime together show the highest above-ground biomass; unfertilised plots show lower productivity.
- In 2002, total biomass declined relative to 2001 across most treatments (13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2), though long-term growth from 1999 baseline remains upward.
- Productivity also varied with slope position; lower plots showed larger relative declines than upper blocks.

### Plant community composition and diversity
- Mowing effect: consistent decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments since 2000, suggesting a site-level response likely linked to mowing regime rather than specific treatments. Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertile (lime/N) plots.
- Fertilisation effect: fertilised plots (N, Lime, N&L) show greater dominance by nutrient-responsive species; potential stress relief with higher pH and nutrients but possible moisture limitation with high lime application.
- Insecticide effect: Shannon diversity is higher in insecticide-treated plots, though causality with reduced herbivory is not definitively established; observed patterns align with prior work suggesting herbivory changes can influence plant diversity.
- Bryophyte expansion: mosses and liverworts increasingly prominent across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; regular mowing and consequent sward height maintenance (~6 cm) may promote bryophyte proliferation.

### Functional groups and CSR framework
- Functional classification (CSR framework): stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderals/CSR (SR/CSR) dominate the community.
- By 2002, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species became dominant in nitrogen and lime plots, reflecting higher growth rates and tolerance to improved conditions.
- Unfertilised/undisturbed plots show a greater relative abundance of stress-tolerant species; overall, lime and nitrogen application shift communities toward competitive-stress/ruderal types.
- Across years, differences among treatments in the three functional groupings became statistically significant, with nitrogen+lime plots showing the strongest shifts toward competitive types and unimproved plots favoring stress-tolerators.

### Soil chemistry, moisture, and productivity relationships
- Lime dramatically increases soil pH (toward ~7.0 in upper soil), nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
- Soil moisture is negatively correlated with pH; improved plots tend to be drier than unimproved plots.
- Overall, higher soil pH is positively correlated with biomass when considering all plots, but the relationship weakens or reverses within plots receiving both nitrogen and lime, where higher pH and reduced moisture may constrain productivity under drought stress.

### Point analysis and community ordination
- Point-quadrat surveys (2002) show clearer separation between improved (lime, N, N&L) and unimproved plots; lime treatments often cluster together in multivariate space.
- Species-level responses show two grasses associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominating in fertilised plots, while Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. remain more frequent in unimproved plots.
- Bryophyte hits rise across treatments but are particularly prominent in unimproved plots; some bryophyte species are suppressed in nutrient-rich plots.

### Trampling effects
- The introduction of C2 plots and associated trampling during high-activity periods (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) likely contributed to observed productivity declines in those plots, illustrating the impact of disturbance level on biomass.

## Discussion: implications for management and interpretation

- Mowing appears to favor stress-tolerant bryophytes and Festuca rubra in fertile plots, while reducing dominant Agrostis spp.; it may reduce overall diversity in fertilised plots but increase bryophyte presence across the site.
- Fertilisation boosts productivity but drives functional and species turnover toward competitive-stress-ruderal types; high lime application raises pH toward seven, which together with potential moisture stress may limit productivity in the long term.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are consistent with literature suggesting herbivore pressure can influence plant community dynamics; however, causation remains to be conclusively established for this system.
- Trampling and disturbance levels, particularly in plots exposed to intensive sampling or experimental pulses, can acutely reduce productivity, emphasizing the importance of disturbance management in experimental design and land-use decisions.
- Overall, the project demonstrates strong interactions among mowing, nutrient inputs, soil chemistry, moisture, and plant functional traits in shaping productivity and biodiversity at Sourhope.

## Data and accessibility

- The study provides detailed datasets on biomass, point analyses, bryophyte inventories, soil pH, and moisture, with year-by-year comparisons and treatment-by-year analyses.
- Appendices include comprehensive species lists, treatment summaries, weather data, and graphical analyses (PCA, ANOVA results) to support replication and further modelling.
