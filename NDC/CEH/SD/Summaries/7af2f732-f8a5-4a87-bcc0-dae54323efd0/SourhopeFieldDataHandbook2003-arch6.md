Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003

## Overview

- This portion documents soil profiles, chemical analyses, and vegetation surveys for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus ECOTRON plots.
- Data are structured by horizon and by subplots/plots, with archived soil samples and horizon-specific measurements intended for long-term biodiversity and soil-plant studies within ECN/Micronet frameworks.

## Data types and variables

- Soil profile descriptions and horizons
  - BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 horizon sequences with depth boundaries and qualitative soil descriptions (color, structure, roots, rocks).
  - Horizon labels include LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, Cx, etc., with depth ranges (e.g., 0-1 cm LF to 61-95 cm Cgx in BLOCK 4; 0-5 cm LF/FH to 70-100 cm Cg in BLOCK 5).
- Laboratory soil analyses (per horizon and per auger sample)
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Major cations: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss and %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH measurements: H2O and CaCl2
  - Sample identifiers (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; auger samples 4A–4F; BLOCK 5 augers 5A–5F)
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot- and subplot-level species counts and totals (presence/absence entries with species totals per plot/subplot)
  - Example data are organized by PLOT (e.g., 4A, 4B, 5A, 5B, etc.)
- Site and storage metadata
  - MLURI barcodes for each horizon/core, sample weights (mg)
  - Site details for BLOCK 5 (grid reference, altitude, slope, soil drainage, major soil subgroups)
  - ECOTRON PLOT entries (soil and vegetation data)
- Data organization notes
  - Data are organized by block and horizon, with separate sections for profiles, auger samples, and vegetation surveys
  - Archival storage at -80°C for select samples; detailed results linked to horizon and plot identifiers

## Sampling and methods (summary)

- Soil profiles
  - Layered horizons described and sampled at defined depths (e.g., 0-1 LF, 1-4 FH, 4-8 H, 8-29 Ah, 29-40 Abg in BLOCK 4; similar sequences in BLOCK 5)
  - Physical description includes texture, color, mottles, structure, root presence
- Chemical analyses
  - Horizon-specific chemical analyses for N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, moisture, pH (H2O and CaCl2)
  - Auger samples (0–30 cm samples, plus deeper horizons in some blocks) with similar variables
- Vegetation surveys
  - Descriptive inventories per plot/subplot with species totals and occurrences
- Data handling
  - Data captured in horizon/plot blocks with archival specimens (barcodes) and per-horizon summaries
  - Some fields show missing data or notations (e.g., "." or blank) indicating not measured or not entered for that subunit

## Key datasets and representative findings (high-level)

- BLOCK 4 soil profile (0–95 cm region)
  - Surface horizons show high organic matter indicators (e.g., Ah with high N and C, LOI)
  - pH H2O around 4.5–5.0; CaCl2 pH around 3.9–4.2
  - %N ranges from ~0.8 to ~2.1 across horizons; %C high in surface horizons (e.g., %C up to ~38% in FH)
  - C:N ratios generally high in surface and subsoil horizons; Ca, Mg, CaCl2-pH values vary by horizon
- BLOCK 5 soil profile (0–100 cm region)
  - Similar pattern: higher %N and %C in Ah; LOI values indicating substantial organic matter in surface horizons
  - Ca values rise in upper horizons (FH, H, Ah) relative to deeper horizons
  - pH H2O typically ~4.3–5.2; CaCl2 pH ~3.8–4.4
- BLOCK 5 auger samples (5A–5F)
  - %N ~0.5–0.62; %C ~6.8–9.1; C:N ~12–14
  - Ca ~1–5 meq/100 g; Mg ~1.5–3.5 meq/100 g; K ~0.58–0.83 meq/100 g
  - %Moisture loss ~4.3–5.5%; LOI ~15–21%
  - pH H2O ~4.5–4.9; pH CaCl2 ~3.5–4.2
- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Soil: %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100 g
  - pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82
  - Vegetation data present with plot-level tallies and species counts
- Site details (BLOCK 5)
  - Grid NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope 5°; soil drainage imperfect
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying
  - Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite

## Data quality and limitations

- Sampling coverage
  - Block-specific sampling sometimes limited to a subset of subplots in year one; results may not fully represent entire plots or blocks
- Data gaps
  - Some horizon entries and some plots have missing measurements (indicated by blanks or dots)
- Interpretive caution
  - Horizon-to-horizon variability and block-to-block differences require careful interpretation when making cross-block comparisons
- Temporal scope
  - Data capture reflects establishment-year conditions with potential for longitudinal extension

## Data products and practical applications for data support

- Self-serve dashboards
  - Horizon-level soil dashboards showing key properties (pH, %N, %C, LOI, Ca, Mg) by block and horizon
  - Plot- and horizon-specific maps of dominant soil chemical properties
- Vegetation-soil integration tools
  - Dashboards linking vegetation presence/absence and dominance with soil fertility indicators (C, N, LOI, pH) across plots
- Longitudinal and cross-site analyses
  - Time-enabled views to track changes if longitudinal data become available
  - Integration with ECN/Micronet datasets for cross-site comparisons of soil-plant biodiversity dynamics
- Data quality-aware reports
  - Clear caveats about sampling coverage and representativeness for establish-year datasets; explicit notes on missing values and measurement gaps

## Storage, access, and preservation

- Archival samples
  - Some horizon samples archived at -80°C (e.g., CEH Merlewood)
- Data identifiers
  - MLURI barcodes used for horizon cores and auger samples (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; 4A–4F; 5A–5F)
- Documentation and outputs
  - Results organized by block/plot/horizon; appendix-level data accompany site-level analyses and broader Soil Biodiversity Programme reports

## Context and takeaways for data support

- The document segment provides a multi-layered, horizon- and plot-grounded data framework for soil-plant biodiversity research at Sourhope, enabling cross-dataset exploration and integration with regional environmental networks.
- It highlights opportunities for developing user-friendly data products (dashboards, interactive soil maps, and time-enabled views) while emphasizing data quality considerations and the importance of clear caveats where sampling is incomplete.
