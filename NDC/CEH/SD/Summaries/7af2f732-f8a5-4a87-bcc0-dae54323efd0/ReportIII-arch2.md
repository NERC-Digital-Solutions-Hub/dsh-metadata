# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Longitudinal environmental monitoring at Sourhope Farm to contextualise broader soil biodiversity research.
- Employed a standardized set of measurements (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) to compare across years and treatments.
- 2001 field operations affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change in site management personnel; despite this, key monitoring activities continued under approved protocols.
- Main aim: demonstrate environmental health and treatment effects in a consistent, policy-relevant format suitable for cross-study comparisons.

## Key Monitoring Results (2. Results)

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather was broadly unremarkable compared with prior years.
- Compared with the very wet previous year, 2001 rainfall near the long-term average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments each year; peak biomass consistently in July–August.
- 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase vs. earlier years, likely due to personnel changes and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass promoted most strongly by nitrogen and lime (N and/or L additions); analyses show significant biomass differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots.
- When biomass was analyzed across years, there was a significant treatment-by-year interaction, with nitrogen and lime treatments maintaining higher productivity.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime additions continued to raise topsoil pH: approximately 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen-plus-lime plots by Oct 2001.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots remained close to baseline pH since 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis mirrored July 2000 methodology; no significant inter-surveyor bias detected.
- 2001 saw a 58% increase in total “hits” (species touches) across treatments, suggesting greater sward density, possibly due to past grazing removal.
- Distinct treatment-driven shifts in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments from 2000 to 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments, most notably in fertilised plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) became more prevalent in fertilised plots, especially with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity trends: unimproved plots supported 24 species, while nitrogen-plus-lime plots showed only 18 species, suggesting reduced diversity with strong fertility enhancement.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) generally separated nitrogen- and lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots, indicating distinct vegetation communities under fertilised conditions.
- Biomass–vegetation relationships: higher biomass correlated with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines observed for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and certain other species as biomass rose.
- Litter increases were more frequent in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity (3. Site heterogeneity)

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) tended to have more acidic plots, influenced by a higher proportion of Control/Biocide plots in those zones.
- Underlying spatial structure evident, with pH differences linked to plot column location.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass varied across plots, with some outliers showing lower biomass and others higher biomass, often related to central site location.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility/pH as a driver of above-ground production.
- No significant biomass difference between broader block designations, suggesting within-site heterogeneity overrides simple block effects.

## Monitoring, Data Quality, and Outputs

- Data collection routine included:
  - 1999–2001 soil sampling, biomass harvests across five mowing events per summer, and annual botanical surveys using standardized point quadrats.
  - Continuous weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station.
  - Full documentation of measurement schedules and site activities to enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Data integrity checks included cross-validation of surveyors via parallel sampling and statistical testing (e.g., ANOVA, PCA).
- Outputs comprise multiple data forms:
  - Annual and cumulative above-ground biomass by plot
  - Soil pH maps and time-series
  - Species-abundance tables and PCA biplots
  - Correlation analyses linking biomass to community composition and soil fertility

## Context and Management Impacts

- External events affected site management in 2001:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site access Feb–May 2001; subsequent sampling followed a mandated protocol.
  - A change in the site officer in May 2001 occurred, but standard monitoring continued.
- Management actions (liming, nitrogen, and biocide use) were maintained according to the 2001 Site Management Plan, preserving comparability with prior years despite disruptions.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring

- The study demonstrates how nutrient additions (N and/or lime) influence biomass productivity, soil chemistry (pH), and plant community composition in a managed field experiment.
- It highlights the value of standardized, multi-metric monitoring for detecting treatment effects and spatial heterogeneity over time.
- Findings support the use of consistent data formats (biomass, pH, species composition, and diversity indices) to assess environmental health and policy-relevant outcomes across years and sites.
