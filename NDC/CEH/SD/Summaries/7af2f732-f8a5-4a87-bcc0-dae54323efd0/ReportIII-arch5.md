# REPORT III
## RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Objectives: provide a broad context dataset for linked studies; enable year-to-year comparison and cross-study links; baseline context data since 1998 Baseline Data Survey.
- Site management and governance notes: 2001 impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May; protocols for sampling thereafter). Change of site Officer in Charge occurred mid-2001.
- Data stewardship context: Automatic Weather Station (AWS) data collected on site; data transmitted to CEH Data Manager; extensive documentation of methods and measurement schedules supports reproducibility and cross-study use.

## Data Collection and Methods (Overview of datasets and protocols)

- Measurements and dates:
  - Weather: headline measures from 1999–2001 via on-site AWS; data include rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture.
  - Above-ground biomass: annual biomass estimates from May–Sept mowing across five plots; five subplots per plot; mowing method switched from manual to mechanical in 2001; biomass data normalized to a reference plot (C1) for year-to-year comparisons.
  - Soil pH: upper 0–5 cm soil pH measured; lime and nitrogen treatments shown to affect pH over time.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (and 2000 for comparison) using 100-cell grids with 25 strike measurements per 0.5 m2 cell; species coded with standardized abbreviations.
- Experimental design elements:
  - Treatments: Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), Biocide (B).
  - Blocks, plots, and subplots (with 5 blocks referenced in analyses); inter-year analysis (1999–2001) includes cross-year treatment effects.
- Data collection cadence and documentation:
  - Table 1 outlines intensive data collection on 9 March 2001 and 16 October 2001; multiple measurement events throughout the 1999–2001 period.
  - Appendix data include annual biomass per plot and total for each year (Appendix 1).

## Key Findings (Highlights by measurement type)

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather broadly near long-term averages; rainfall around 839–845 mm; radiation ~3473 MJ m-2; slight decreases in average temperatures and modest increases in soil moisture relative to prior years.
- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions increase biomass; N and Lime together typically yield the highest productivity.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, likely due to personnel change and switch to mechanical cutting; after normalizing to C1, nitrogen and/or lime effects persist.
  - Statistical findings: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots; significant treatment-by-year interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Species and biomass relationships: higher biomass correlates with increased presence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; decline of Agrostis capillaris with fertilization; indicators of a shift toward more productive, improved pastures with nutrient additions.
- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime additions raise soil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone also raises pH modestly; control plots show little change since 1998 baseline.
- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - 2001 point quadrat surveys show shifts in species abundance by treatment; improved plots show dominance shifts toward Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and Trifolium repens, with broader shifts toward species typical of improved pastures.
  - Diversity: unimproved plots maintain higher species richness (24 species) than the Nitrogen + Lime plots (18 species), suggesting possible early signs of reduced diversity with higher fertility.
  - Multivariate patterns: Principal Components Analysis separates improved (N and/or L) plots from control/biocide plots; increased litter frequency in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Relative abundance changes accompany biomass shifts; species closely tied to higher biomass (F. rubra, Poa pratensis) become more frequent; bryophytes and acidophilic species (e.g., Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum) more apparent in unimproved plots.
  - Correlations: biomass increases align with higher frequencies of certain grasses; some low-diversity plots show strong abundance of selected species.

## Site Heterogeneity (Spatial variation within the site)

- 3.1 Soil and plant community variation
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibit more acidic conditions; underlying gradient across the slope contributes to varied soil chemistry within the same treatment groups.
- 3.2 Biomass variation
  - Biomass is unevenly distributed across plots; higher biomass tends to be associated with centrally located plots (e.g., N&L plots in central positions).
  - Positive correlation noted between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks in biomass.

## Data Management and Stewardship Implications (For Data Stewards)

- Provenance and versioning
  - Detailed methodologies across 1999–2001, including mowing regime changes, measurement protocols, and data transformations (e.g., ln-transform of biomass for ANOVA).
  - Documentation captures shifts in management (FMD restrictions, personnel change) and their potential impact on data comparability.
- Metadata and data schema
  - Datasets span multiple dimensions: weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; explicit variable codes for species (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; N = Nitrogen; L = Lime; B = Biocide, etc.) to support cross-dataset linking.
  - Measurements are depth-specific (0–5 cm for pH; biomass from mowing cells; plant surveys per 0.5 m2 cell) and time-stamped, enabling precise data merging and reproducibility.
- Data quality and QA/QC
  - Inter-surveyor reliability tested: two surveyors produced no significant differences in 2001 (NS result).
  - Data transformations (e.g., logarithms for biomass) used to normalize distributions for ANOVA and other analyses.
  - Comprehensive statistical outputs (ANOVA tables, PCA loadings) embedded in the report provide a model for documenting data analysis steps and rationale.
- Data availability and access
  - AWS and weather datasets are actively managed (transmitted to CEH data manager); site-level data are collected under formal protocols and are intended for sharing within the research community.
  - Given the explicit linkage to other projects and baseline data, ensure cross-referencing with Baseline Data Survey (1998) and Project-specific documentation.
- Data limitations and caveats
  - 2001 disruptions (FMD restrictions) and a change in site leadership may affect data consistency across years; note in metadata and data consumer notes.
  - Mechanical vs. manual mowing difference in 2001 introduces normalization needs; document the normalization basis (to C1) and any implications for cross-year comparability.
  - Spatial heterogeneity means that treatment effects may be confounded by plot position; include site geometry and pH gradients in metadata for proper interpretation.
- Recommended stewardship actions
  - Catalog datasets with clear variable dictionaries, units, and codes (including species codes) to support discovery and reuse.
  - Link related datasets (weather, biomass, pH, botanical data) via common identifiers: plot, sub-plot, block, treatment, year.
  - Include provenance notes for management changes (FMD period, personnel change, mowing method shift) and their documented impact on measurements.
  - Archive all measurement schedules (Table 1-like metadata) and analysis scripts or summary statistics (ANOVA, PCA) to enable reproducibility.
  - Provide accessibility provisions for data users to understand site heterogeneity and its implications for analyses and interpretation.

## Data Access and Preservation

- Weather data are managed by the CEH data manager; other site datasets (biomass, pH, botanical surveys) have detailed methodological documentation within the report and appendices.
- To maximize discoverability, publish a curated dataset bundle with:
  - Metadata including measurement dates, depths, units, and protocols.
  - Testable data quality notes (e.g., inter-surveyor reliability, normalization steps).
  - Links to related Baseline Data Survey (1998) and any linked projects (e.g., Point Analysis protocols, 2001 PCA results).

## Conclusion (Implications for Data Stewards)

- The Sourhope field experiment provides multi-year, multi-measurement datasets illustrating treatment effects (N, Lime, N&L, Biocide) on biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition within a heterogeneous landscape.
- Data governance should emphasize thorough metadata, provenance tracking (including methodological changes and external disruptions), data quality assurances, and clear documentation of limitations.
- With careful curation and explicit metadata, these datasets can be robustly reused for cross-study synthesis, comparative analyses, and long-term biodiversity and soil-chemistry research.
