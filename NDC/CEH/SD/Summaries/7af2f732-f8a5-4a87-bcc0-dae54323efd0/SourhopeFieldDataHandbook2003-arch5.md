# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Comprehensive documentation of the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Programme site (Rigg Foot), covering site characteristics, long-term experimental design, and multi-layered data intended for discovery, reuse, and governance.
- Integrates vegetation and soil data with provenance and archival practices to support long-term ecological research.

## Data assets and data types
- Vegetation data
  - Plot- and subplot-level surveys with species occurrences, codes, and frequencies.
  - Community designations (e.g., National Vegetation Classification - NVC) and associated indicator species analyses.
- Soil data
  - Detailed soil profiles by horizon (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, Cg) with depth, colour, boundary descriptions, and texture.
  - Chemical and physical measurements across horizons: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2), moisture content.
  - Auger samples and profile pits with horizon-specific data, including horizon descriptions and drainage variation across blocks.
- Archive and provenance data
  - Sub-samples archived at -80°C (CEH Merlewood) with linkage to horizon data and site descriptions.
  - Data hosted on MLURI servers and integrated with ECN and Serad Micronet projects for cross-network accessibility.
- Other program data
  - ECN baseline data and Micronet context used to situate soil-plant-microbial relationships across grasslands.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Site structure
  - Five blocks (1–5) with main plots (A–F) and Ecotron subplots for specialized studies; varied treatments applied to main plots (e.g., Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime+Nitrogen, Biocide, Fallow).
- Vegetation sampling
  - 5 randomly selected subplots per plot; 25 points per 50 × 50 cm quadrat; presence/absence data with potential abundance notes.
  - Sampling conducted in July–August; data intended for vegetation analyses (Twinspan, NVC, associations).
- Soil sampling
  - 30 auger cores per plot in a W-shaped pattern; horizon descriptions from pit data; sub-samples for immediate analysis and archival storage.
- Data documentation
  - Appendices and tables document block/plot-level data, species lists, and soil properties; cross-references to supplementary documents (e.g., Twinspan.doc, Association.xls).

## Metadata, standards, and documentation
- Vegetation metadata
  - Species codes, dominant species, and per-plot/subplot occurrences; NVC site designations (e.g., U4d, U5b) to contextualize communities.
- Soil metadata
  - Standardized horizon nomenclature (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.); depth intervals and horizon descriptions captured for cross-block interoperability.
  - Block- and horizon-level summaries for chemical and physical properties; documentation of measurement methods and analytical approaches.
- Documentation and codes
  - Detailed tables (e.g., Tables 2–9) outlining species occurrence/dominance and soil data; Appendix A provides block-wise soil/vegetation data; explicit data provenance for re-use.

## Storage, provenance, and data governance
- Storage and archiving
  - Sub-samples archived at -80°C; physical samples linked to horizon data and site descriptions.
  - Data hosted on MLURI servers and cross-referenced with ECN data streams and Sourhope site baseline data.
- Provenance and traceability
  - Clear linkage between plot-level treatments, block layouts, horizons, and chemical/physical measurements to support re-use and auditability.
- Data sharing and re-use
  - Rich metadata and external references (e.g., Twinspan.doc, Association.xls) to support advanced analyses; baseline and long-term data designed for broad reuse with awareness of sampling coverage and block-level anomalies.

## Data quality, completeness, and limitations
- Completeness and coverage
  - In establishment years, vegetation data sampling was incomplete (e.g., only a third of subplots sampled); results are indicative rather than exhaustive for all blocks.
  - Some blocks/plots show anomalous or missing data; considerable spatial variability observed across blocks and slopes.
- Data interpretation
  - Vegetation and soil data are influenced by drainage and climate gradients; multivariate analyses (Twinspan, NVC, associations) require careful interpretation given partial coverage.
- Stewardship implications
  - Document horizon-level variability and block differences; ensure metadata completeness during ingestion to preserve traceability and reuse potential.

## Practical guidance for data reuse and governance

- For data stewards
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata: block, plot, subplot, horizon, treatment, sampling date, analytical methods.
  - Preserve horizon taxonomy (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.) and consistent plot identifiers to enable interoperability across studies.
  - Maintain archival samples with explicit links to corresponding soil and vegetation datasets; monitor and record storage conditions and accession references.
  - Clearly communicate data limitations (e.g., partial subplot sampling) to downstream users.
- For data users
  - Use NVC classifications (e.g., U4d, U5b) to contextualize vegetation data within recognized grassland communities.
  - Approach Twinspan and association results with consideration of sampling completeness and block/ slope effects.
  - Cross-reference soil data with horizon descriptions and block context to interpret variability in chemical/physical properties.

## End notes
- The Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003 provides a detailed framework of field design, sampling protocols, and multi-layered datasets (vegetation and soil) with explicit attention to data governance, storage, and accessibility to support ongoing discovery, reuse, and long-term ecological research.
