# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed at providing context for detailed studies and enabling cross-year comparisons; baseline data survey completed in 1998.
- Monitoring covers weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
- 2001 site operations affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May) and a change of site Officer in Charge; management plan still progressed with lime, nitrogen, pH and biomass measurements, and most biocide applications completed.

## Key Methods and Data Collection
- Measurements and dates summarized in Table 1 (1998–2001); consistent protocols for biomass harvest, soil sampling, pH, and botanical surveys.
- Above-ground biomass monitored via five summer cuts per year; data normalised to a reference plot (C1) for year-to-year comparisons.
- Botanical composition assessed using Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 mirrored July 2000 survey) with species hits recorded; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to explore community shifts.
- Automatic Weather Station on site provided headline measures; data continuously downloaded and shared with the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- Appendix includes annualised biomass per plot and mean values across blocks.

## Results: Weather, Biomass, Soil pH, and Botany

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation consistent with prior years.
- Average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in previous year.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak production in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than 2000, likely due to staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- When normalised to C1, nitrogen and/or lime treatments maintained stronger positive effects on biomass.
- Separate analyses indicate:
  - Significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L added) and unimproved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise surface soil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen-plus-lime plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but less; control plots showed no significant change since baseline (1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- 2001 survey showed no significant difference between surveyors; total hits in 2001 58% higher than 2000, suggesting greater sward density (possibly from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; prominent in fertilised plots (especially N & L).
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed dominance shifts toward Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis.
  - Ditched diversity in improved plots: 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in N&L plots, suggesting potential early diversity decline with higher fertility.
- PCA generally separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Biomass correlated with species abundance:
  - Positive: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass.
  - Negative: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with higher biomass.
- Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots indicated faster turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
- Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F tended to be more acidic, potentially due to plot mix (more Controls/Biocides in those columns) but underlying pattern suggests slope-related heterogeneity.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values show spatial pattern: central plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen and Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- A strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass across blocks.

## Data Management and Operational Notes
- Table 1 outlines the data collection schedule across 1998–2001; multiple sampling events (soil, biomass, weather) consistently documented.
- Weather data routinely uploaded to the data manager; ongoing data integration supports cross-study comparisons.
- The 2001 FMD restrictions temporarily limited site access; data collection proceeded under protocol with Vet-led visitation controls and an adjusted timetable.
- A change in site leadership occurred May 2001, but management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass, and most biocide applications) largely continued as planned.

## Implications for Data Strategy and Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a multi-domain data ecosystem: weather, soil chemistry, biomass productivity, and plant community data collected on a standardized schedule, enabling cross-year analyses and cross-study linking.
- Shows the value of baseline data and consistent protocols for long-term monitoring, crucial for detecting treatment effects and site heterogeneity over time.
- Highlights the importance of documenting management events and external disruptions (e.g., FMD) that can impact data collection and comparability.
- Uses robust analytical approaches (split-plot ANOVA, PCA, biomass correlations) to uncover treatment effects and ecological relationships, emphasizing the need for clear metadata and data provenance to support reuse.
- Reveals spatial heterogeneity as a key factor in interpreting results, underscoring the need to account for location effects in data models and reporting.
- Indicates data governance considerations: maintaining data quality, cross-surveyor reliability (validated by consistent survey results), and transparent reporting of data collection changes and their potential impacts on analyses.
