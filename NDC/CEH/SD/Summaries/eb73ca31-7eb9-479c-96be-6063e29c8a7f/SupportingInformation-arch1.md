# Predicting and Understanding the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Rural Diffuse Pollution

## 5.1.1 National nutrient, sediment and FIOs emissions
- Nitrate (Total 73.3 kt): Agriculture dominates (about 60.1 kt N; ~82%), with Sewage Treatment Works (STWs) ~7%, and woodland ~7% also contributing. Other sources (urban, septic tanks, bank erosion, etc.) contribute smaller shares.
- Phosphorus (Total 3.89 kt): Agriculture is dominant (2.47 kt P; ~67%), followed by STWs (~18%), with smaller shares from urban, montane, bank erosion and other sources.
- Sediment (Total Z ≈ 1,685 kt): Agriculture dominates (about two‑thirds; ~1,049–1,140 kt), with bank erosion next (≈339 kt; ~20%). STWs, urban, montane, woodlands contribute smaller amounts.
- Faecal Indicator Organisms (FIOs) (10^15 cfu): Agriculture ≈ 636; STWs ≈ 922; septic tanks ≈ 425; urban ≈ 37; other sources smaller; total ≈ 2,020 (10^15 cfu).
- Comparisons with the SNIFFER (2004) Screening Tool show differences in STW contributions (population-based vs. discharge‑based scope) and the inclusion of bank erosion in this project (absent in the Screening Tool); nitrate/phosphorus losses from septic tanks are lower in this project, while FIO losses from septic tanks are higher due to methodology; bank erosion is a notable contributor to sediment in this analysis.

## 5.1.2 National nitrous oxide and methane emissions
- Agricultural emissions (current practice, Scotland):
  - Nitrous oxide (N2O): ≈ 4775 kt CO2e
  - Methane (CH4): ≈ 3154 kt CO2e
- Official inventory comparison (Thistlethwaite et al., 2010):
  - Inventory figures: N2O ≈ 4188 kt CO2e; CH4 ≈ 2967 kt CO2e
  - Agriculture accounts for about 86% of N2O and 55% of CH4 in Scotland’s total greenhouse gas budget.
- Total Scotland GHG budget (including non‑agricultural sectors): ≈ 53.9 Mt CO2e; agriculture contributes roughly 3.1% of total for CH4 and 4.8% for N2O.
- Key methodological note: The project uses a refined, Scotland‑specific approach (with factors for soil compaction, poaching, and waterlogging) that yields N2O/CH4 totals that are broadly in line but not identical to the official inventory.

## 5.1.3 Spatial variation in emissions and sector apportionment
- Nitrate: Other point sources (septic tanks, STWs) cluster along central/eastern rivers; inland catchments mostly <0.5 kg ha⁻¹, mean inland ≈0.01 kg ha⁻¹; agricultural loads per ha are much higher (upper quartile ≈17.2 kg ha⁻¹). Agriculture dominates total emissions in most inland catchments (≥50% in 91% of inland catchments; ≥50% of total in ~45% of inland catchments).
- Phosphorus: Spatial pattern similar to nitrate but more influenced by soil drainage and rainfall; western Scotland with higher rainfall/drainage shows higher phosphorus flux; agriculture dominates inland catchments (~79%).
- Sediment: No significant non‑agricultural point-source emissions modeled; bank erosion contributes notably in some catchments; agriculture dominates inland catchments in about 66%.
- FIOs: Urban and population patterns drive non‑agricultural loads; STWs contribute ≈69% of non‑agricultural FIOs and septic tanks ≈31%. Among inland catchments, agriculture remains dominant for FIOs in about 71%, but urban central catchments still show high FIO loads.
- Nitrous oxide and methane (spatial patterns): Variation is largely driven by agriculture. N2O is influenced by stocking density and intensity; CH4 is driven by stocking density and enteric processes. Non‑agricultural contributions are more spatially concentrated for methane in some areas.

## 5.2 Agricultural emissions
- Farm types: Nine Robust Farm Types (RFT) used (e.g., Specialist Poultry, Cereal, General Cropping, Horticulture, Specialist Pig, Dairy, Cattle & Sheep [LFA], Cattle & Sheep [Lowland], Mixed).
- Relative footprints: Dairy farms show the highest methane footprints due to high stocking density and fertiliser use; arable land shows the highest nitrate and phosphorus footprints; LFA cattle/sheep systems have the lowest footprints overall (except methane which tracks stocking density).
- Spatial allocation: Pollutant footprints reflect dominant farm types per area but vary by land use; arable land drives high nitrate and phosphorus losses (and sediment from bare winter soils); rough grazing has elevated erosion and related sediment losses due to rainfall/drainage patterns.
- Pathways and sources (illustrative highlights):
  - Nitrate: Soil (dominant on arable), fertiliser, manure, and grazing excreta contribute; surface runoff and leaching have distinct role by land use (e.g., leaching dominates on arable and grassy systems; surface runoff more important where drainage is prevalent).
  - Phosphorus: Soil transfers dominate (74%), with fertiliser and drainage pathways also important; under-drainage and intense rainfall increase phosphorus transfer.
  - Sediment: Surface runoff dominates (on arable and grassland, with notable role for drains in arable); rough grazing shows substantial sediment via preferential flow in wetter areas.
  - FIOs: Excreta at grazing dominates (≈95%), with little contribution from managed manure storage; catchments with grazing inside fields show higher FIO losses.
  - Nitrous oxide: Major portions from fertiliser (≈32%) and excreta at grazing (≈32%), with notable winter/long‑term leaching components (~20%).
  - Methane: Enteric fermentation is the dominant source (≈83%), with additional contributions from manure management and dung pools.
- Non‑field areas: Emissions from yards/housing and tracks/fords are generally small for nitrate/phosphorus/sediment but can be substantial for methane due to livestock distribution; manure storage contributes to methane and nitrous oxide via volatilisation and slurry management.

## 6 Verification of pollutant loads

### 6.1.1 OSPAR-COM data
- Loads exported to marine areas derived from HMS/HQS networks and river flows (2006–2010 averages) for 56 HMS catchments.
- Adjustment: SPM (sediment) measurements corrected by factor 0.6 to exclude organic content for fair comparison with mineral sediment modeled.

### 6.1.2 In-channel retention
- Phosphorus and nitrate retention estimated using Behrendt & Opitz (2000) equations based on river/lake surface area and hydraulic load.
- Sediment retention based on Vanoni (1975) formulation as a function of catchment area.

### 6.1.3 Comparison of modelled results and OSPAR-COM data
- Phosphorus: Measured vs modeled loads well correlated (r² ≈ 0.74). Model tends to underpredict low loads and overpredict high loads (South Calder Water as notable outlier with STWs contributing ~72%). Agriculture dominates in about 40 of 56 catchments.
- Nitrate: Good correlation (r² ≈ 0.67) but some high-end values underpredicted. Agriculture dominates in all but 4 catchments (where STWs dominate; modeled results exceed measured values in those cases).
- Sediment: Weaker correlation (r² ≈ 0.41); some high measured values in rough grazing uplands not consistently captured by the model, while several overpredictions occur in catchments with substantial rough grazing.
- Overall: The model generally tracks measured loads, with stronger performance for nutrients than for sediment; agriculture remains a major contributor in most inland catchments.

### 6.2 Faecal indicator organisms (FIOs)
- Kay et al. (2008) data (15 catchments) used to benchmark baseflow/high flow FIOs; this project reports total annual catchment loads (not WFD catchments) and includes retention in lakes.
- Baseflow: This project tends to produce higher annual FIO loads than Kay et al. (2.1× urban, 2.5× semi‑urban, 2.4× rural).
- High flow: This project yields higher loads than baseflow Kay et al., with less agreement in rural land‑use breakdowns due to small sample sizes.
- Dee/North Esk (Tetzlaff et al. 2012): r² ≈ 0.38; observed FIO measurements typically ~50% of modelled totals, reflecting model structure and retention effects.

### 6.3 Nitrous oxide and methane (GHG)
- The project’s N2O/CH4 outputs are benchmarked against the official GHG Inventory (Thistlethwaite et al., 2010). Figures reflect a baseline (no mitigation actions) and a version including soil compaction/poaching impacts.
- Before compaction/poaching: project N2O is about 90% of inventory; major discrepancy arises from how indirect emissions via nitrate leaching are treated (the project computes indirect leaching more explicitly and often at lower fractions than the inventory’s 30% assumption).
- After including compaction/poaching: N2O budget increases by ~30%, making total N2O higher than the inventory in some scenarios.
- Methane: The project’s methane totals are generally higher than inventory figures, driven by Scottish livestock management assumptions (e.g., slurry management factors). The inventory often assumes different proportions of manure management and housing time.
- Overall: The project provides a detailed, scenario‑capable accounting of agricultural emissions with some differences from official inventories due to methodology (e.g., timing of housing, slurry emission factors, FracLeach assumptions). It highlights how mitigation actions can influence modeled GHG totals.

Summary for data‑driven analysis
- The project delivers a comprehensive, data‑rich framework linking agricultural practices to nutrient, sediment, and FIO emissions, with explicit source–pathway apportionments and scenario analysis capabilities.
- It validates model outputs against measured loads and offers transparent comparisons to prior tools, while documenting data gaps and uncertainties (e.g., emission factors, climate sensitivity, spatial data needs).
- The approach supports policy evaluation (uptake scenarios, policy mix effects) and RBMP reporting, while enabling updates as new data become available.
