# Predicting and Understanding the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Rural Diffuse Pollution

- The study combines agricultural and non-agricultural pollutant modelling to estimate national emissions of nitrate, phosphorus, sediment, and faecal indicator organisms (FIOs) for Scotland and to compare them with prior tools.
- It provides a detailed breakdown of emissions by sector, farm-type, land use, and delivery pathway to support monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Key national emissions and sector contributions

- Nitrate (N): Total 73.3 kt; agriculture contributes over 80%; significant contributions from sewage treatment works (STWs, 7%) and woodland (7%).
- Phosphorus (P): Total 2.47 kt; agriculture dominates (67%); STWs (18%) and woodland smaller.
- Sediment (Z): Total 1,685 kt; agriculture dominates (68%); bank erosion next (17%).
- FIOs: Total 2,020 x 10^9 cfu; agriculture contributes 31%; STWs (46%) and septic tanks (21%) are major non-agricultural contributors.
- Compared to the SNIFFER Screening Tool (2004), differences arise from data scope and methodologies (e.g., STW inclusions, bank erosion, and septic-tank considerations).

## Greenhouse gases: nitrous oxide and methane

- Agricultural emissions (current practice): N2O = 4,775 kt CO2-e; CH4 = 3,154 kt CO2-e.
- When combined with non-agricultural sectors (Thistlethwaite et al., 2010), agriculture accounts for:
  - ~86% of total N2O emissions
  - ~55% of total CH4 emissions
  - Overall, agriculture contributes a modest share to Scotland’s total greenhouse gases (GHG) budget, with methane and nitrous oxide contributions separated in policy contexts.
- Comparisons with official inventories show reasonable alignment for some components, with notable differences influenced by modelling details (e.g., indirect emissions from leaching, soil compaction, and waterlogging).

## Spatial variation and sector apportionment

- Nitrate: Most inland catchments show low per-hectare loads; agriculture per-hectare loads are highest in intensive arable and dairy-dominated areas. Agriculture dominates total nitrate in 91% of inland catchments (≥50% of total).
- Phosphorus: Western Scotland areas with high rainfall and drainage show higher P loads; agriculture dominates 79% of inland catchments.
- Sediment: Higher in catchments affected by rainfall and drainage; agriculture is dominant in 66% of inland catchments; bank erosion can dominate non-agricultural loads in some areas.
- FIOs: Urban and population-driven diffuse sources are strong; agriculture dominates inland catchments in 71%, though non-agricultural sources are substantial in many catchments.
- Across pollutants, spatial patterns reflect livestock density, land use intensity, soil drainage, and catchment characteristics.

## Agricultural emissions: farm-types, land-use footprints, and pathways

- Farm-type footprints: Dairy farms typically yield the largest footprints for nitrate, phosphorus, and sediment due to high stocking densities and fertiliser use; LFA cattle and sheep farms show lower footprints; arable land often shows high nitrate and phosphorus losses due to intensive inputs and drainage.
- Land-use footprints by pollutant:
  - Nitrate and phosphorus: highest on arable land; lower on grassland and rough grazing; arable lands contribute disproportionately to national totals due to higher input intensity.
  - Sediment: highest on arable land; rough grazing experiences erosion due to rainfall and waterlogging.
  - FIOs: substantial contributions from grazing areas; higher near populated or grazing-intensive zones.
  - Methane: predominantly from enteric sources; arable and grassland footprints linked to livestock density.
- Non-field sources (yard housing, manure storage, tracks, etc.) contribute variably across pollutants; methane is notably influenced by livestock location (non-field areas can dominate in methane footprints in some farm types).
- Source and pathway apportionment (examples):
  - Nitrate: 56% from soil stores on arable land; 69% leaching; 29% surface runoff pathways for leaching emphasis.
  - Phosphorus: soil sources dominate; surface runoff and drains (preferential flow) are critical pathways.
  - Sediment: surface runoff dominates (about 56% on arable land); preferential flow through drains.
  - FIOs: excreta at grazing is a major pathway; manure storage and on-site handling contribute variably by farm type.
- Pathway emphasis by farm type highlights where monitoring and mitigation may be most effective, e.g., leaching in arable areas for nitrate, preferential flow for phosphorus, and surface runoff for FIO transport.

## Verification, monitoring, and data integration

- Verification with observational data:
  - Pollutant loads exported to seas (OSPAR-COM) used for comparison with modelled Scotland-wide loads (nitrate, phosphorus, suspended solids) across 56 HMS catchments.
  - A flow-based correction factor (0.6) adjusts HMS suspended solids to account for organic matter, enabling fair comparison with mineral sediment in the model.
  - In-channel retention models (Behrendt and Opitz for phosphorus and nitrate; Vanoni for sediment) adjust model outputs to reflect downstream delivery.
  - Nitrate and phosphorus loads show reasonable correlation with observed data (N: r2 ≈ 0.67; P: r2 ≈ 0.74; Sediment: r2 ≈ 0.41).
- Faecal indicator organisms (FIOs):
  - Modelled FIO loads compared with Kay et al. (2008) and Tetzlaff et al. (2012) in the Dee and North Esk.
  - Overall, modelled annual catchment loads exceed observed base-flow values but align with high-flow patterns; correlations indicate the framework captures broad spatial and temporal trends, albeit with variability by land use and urbanization.
- Nitrous oxide and methane:
  - Model outputs are compared to official GHG inventories (Thistlethwaite et al., 2010). Pre-compaction/poaching results show agricultural N2O around 90% of inventory totals, with differences arising from indirect leaching assumptions and manure management dynamics.
  - Including soil compaction and waterlogging increases the N2O budget by about 30%, raising the total agricultural N2O to ~117% of the inventory when combined with other factors.
  - Methane results show closer alignment for some components, but differences reflect livestock housing assumptions and slurry management practices.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks

- The approach provides a spatially explicit, coordinate-based framework that maps policy actions to auditable emissions reductions across sources, farm types, and pathways.
- It supports policy evaluation of measures such as Diffuse Pollution General Binding Rules (DP GBRs), NVZ regulations, and SRDP uptake by linking on-farm actions to quantified load reductions.
- Verification integrates multiple data streams (climate, soils, census data, land use) and multiple process models into a coherent decision-support tool, with explicit validation against HMS, OSPAR-COM data, and official GHG inventories.
- The methodology highlights data gaps and uncertainties (e.g., methane and nitrous oxide emission factors, bank erosion contributions, and connectivity assumptions) and emphasizes the importance of metadata, data sharing, and data governance for transparent monitoring.
- Outputs support catchment-based reporting and the assessment of whether policy actions yield measurable improvements in water quality and pollutant loads under WFD criteria.

## Limitations and uncertainties

- Emission factors, particularly for methane and nitrous oxide, carry substantial uncertainties despite regional refinements.
- Bank erosion contributions to sediment loads remain uncertain and are subject to calibration with fingerprinting data.
- Boundary connectivity and track effects are simplified in places, potentially affecting delivery pathways.
- Some data gaps require assumptions (e.g., tile drainage extent, boundary permeability), which are acknowledged and documented in the framework.
