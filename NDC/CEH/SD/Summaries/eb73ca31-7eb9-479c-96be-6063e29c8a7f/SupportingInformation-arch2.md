# Predicting and Understanding the Effectiveness of Measures to Mitigate Rural Diffuse Pollution

## 5.1 National nutrient, sediment and FIOs emissions
- Total emissions ( Scotland-wide ) for nitrate, phosphorus, sediment and FIOs result from combining agricultural and non-agricultural sources.
- Nitrate: total 73.3 kt; agriculture contributes over 80% of total; major non-agricultural sources are sewage treatment works (STWs) and woodland (each ~7%).
- Phosphorus: total 2.47 kt; agriculture dominates with ~67% of total; STWs ~18%.
- Sediment: agriculture dominates ~68%; bank erosion ~17%.
- FIOs: agriculture contributes ~31%; STWs ~46%; septic tanks ~21%.
- Comparison with the SNIFFER Screening Tool (2004):
  - Differences largely due to scope of STW sources, septic-tank assumptions, and bank-erosion contributions.
  - This project emphasizes bank-erosion and direct agricultural inputs, leading to distinct apportions and totals.
- Provided sectoral and per-component breakdowns (agriculture vs STWs vs other sources) and national totals by pollutant.

## 5.1.2 National nitrous oxide and methane emissions
- Based on a modified IPCC methodology.
- Agricultural emissions (current practice): N2O ≈ 4775 kt CO2-e; CH4 ≈ 3154 kt CO2-e.
- Compared with official Scottish inventory: N2O ≈ 4188 kt CO2-e; CH4 ≈ 2967 kt CO2-e.
- Agriculture accounted for:
  - ~86% of total N2O emissions
  - ~55% of total CH4 emissions
- All greenhouse gas totals (with agricultural results from this study and other sectors from official inventory) show agriculture contributing a modest share to total Scotland GHGs.

## 5.1.3 Spatial variation in emissions and sector apportionment
- Nitrate: other point sources (septic tanks, STWs) concentrated along central/eastern Scotland; many inland catchments have low per-hectare loads; agriculture dominates in most inland catchments (50%+ of total in 91% of inland catchments; >90% in 45%).
- Phosphorus: patterns similar to nitrate but with soil- and rainfall-driven mobility; phosphorus emissions high where under-drainage is needed; agriculture dominates in 79% of inland catchments.
- Sediment: exports from other diffuse sources (e.g., bank erosion) significant in some catchments; agriculture dominates in 66% of inland catchments.
- FIOs: urban and population-driven patterns along central areas; agricultural losses largely tied to grazing and manuring; agriculture dominates inland catchments but with different patterns than nitrate/phosphorus.
- Nitrous oxide and methane spatial variation shown only for agriculture (per hectare of agricultural land).

## 5.2 Agricultural emissions
- Pollutant footprints vary by farm type:
  - Dairy farms have the highest footprints for nitrate, phosphorus, and sediment due to high stocking densities and fertilizer use.
  - LFA cattle and sheep farms show lower footprints due to extensive, non-intensive practices.
  - Pig and poultry farms show very high FIO footprints (manure-related) but land area is small; dairy dominates methane emissions due to slurry management and higher methane per animal.
  - Arable land tends to have higher nitrate and phosphorus losses; sediment losses are high on arable land due to bare soil in winter.
- Pollutant apportionment by source type and pathway:
  - Nitrate: majority from soil, with substantial contributions from fertiliser and manure; grazing excreta also involves notable losses.
  - Phosphorus: dominated by soil sources; fertiliser next; surface runoff and drains are key pathways.
  - FIOs: almost entirely from grazing excreta; manure storage contributes less due to rapid die-off and management practices.
  - Methane: mainly enteric emissions; cattle and dairy contribute most.
  - Nitrous oxide: substantial from fertiliser and grazing excreta; a portion from soil processes following nitrogen inputs.
- Non-field areas (yards, housing, storage) contribute variably across pollutants; methane largely linked to livestock habitat and manure management.
- The framework supports disaggregation by land use (arable, grass, rough, etc.) and by source pathways (soil, fertiliser, manure, slurry, grazing, surface, leaching, direct, air).

## 6 Verification of Pollutant Loads

### 6.1.1 OSPAR-COM data
- Loads exported to UK marine areas are estimated using HMS/GQA data and river-flow measurements.
- Comparison uses 5-year average loads (2006–2010) from 56 HMS catchments; adjustments made for sediment to account for organic matter:
  - Correction factor applied to measured suspended solids to reflect mineral fraction (0.6 adjustment).

### 6.1.2 In-channel retention
- Retention in rivers/lakes affects delivery to estuaries.
- Phosphorus and nitrate retention estimated with Behrendt & Opitz empirical model using catchment hydraulic load.
- Sediment retention estimated with Vanoni (1975) model as a function of catchment area.

### 6.1.3 Comparison of modelled results and OSPAR-COM data
- Phosphorus: model vs measurements well correlated (r2 ≈ 0.74); under-predict at low loads, over-predict at high loads; agriculture dominates in about 40 of 56 catchments.
- Nitrate: good correlation (r2 ≈ 0.67); model sometimes underestimates high load events; agriculture dominates in most catchments except a few STW-dominated cases.
- Sediment: poorer correlation (r2 ≈ 0.41); over-prediction in catchments with significant rough grazing; under-prediction in some other areas.
- Overall, model validation indicates reasonable performance with notable variability across pollutants and catchments.

### 6.2 Faecal indicator organisms
- Comparison with Kay et al. (2008) 205 observations across 15 catchments; higher annual totals in this study than in base-flow conditions, lower than high-flow conditions.
- Tetzlaff et al. (2012) data (Dee and North Esk) show reasonable correlation (r2 ≈ 0.38) with measured FIO loads; observed loads often lower than modelled totals, but trends by land use are aligned.

### 6.3 Nitrous oxide and methane
- Comparison with official inventory (Thistlethwaite et al. 2010) shows:
  - Before accounting for mitigation actions, this study’s agricultural N2O is about 90% of inventory; indirect leaching emissions differ due to explicit calculation of nitrate leaching versus a fixed 30% assumption in inventory approaches.
  - Behrendt/Optiz and waterlogged area factors raise N2O when including soil compaction/poaching (about 30% higher). Methane is more sensitive to slurry/manure management assumptions and housing practices.
  - Overall, the study’s results with compaction effects show higher N2O totals than the inventory, reflecting localized high-denitrification in wet areas.

## 7 Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- The study provides a spatially explicit, policy-relevant framework to predict how current and future uptake of mitigation actions influence diffuse pollution to water bodies in Scotland.
- It integrates agricultural practices with landscape connectivity, soil/climate context, and non-agricultural sources to support scenario analysis.
- Allows identification of cost-effective mitigation mixes and targeted priorities (e.g., Priority Catchments) to improve WFD status and RBMP objectives.
- Demonstrates the importance of validating model outputs against multiple data streams (OSPAr-COM, HMS, in-channel retention, FIO datasets, and official inventories) to understand uncertainties and improve monitoring strategies.
