# Data Structure

- Data describe non-agricultural pollution loads to rivers in Scotland, stored in two CSV files:
  - NonAgLoadsInland_Scotland.csv
  - NonAgLoadsCoastal_Scotland.csv
- Key columns and identifiers:
  - CATCH_ID: Unique identifier of the Water Framework Directive (WFD) river catchment; Units = -
  - INLAND_ID: SEPA ID for inland catchments; Units = -
  - COASTAL_ID: SEPA ID for coastal catchments; Units = -
  - The ID fields map to WFD catchment features (catchment or waterbody IDs) in a WFD catchment shapefile/class.
- Variables (example groups and their units):
  - Sediment loads (kg sediment per year): STW_Z (sewage treatment works), Urban_Z (urban), Wood_Z (woodland), Bank_Z (bank erosion), Montane_Z (montane), Other_Z (other)
  - Phosphorus loads (kg phosphorus per year): STW_P, SEP_P, Urban_P, Wood_P, Bank_P, Montane_P, Other_P
  - Nitrogen loads (kg nitrate per year): STW_N, SEP_N, Urban_N, Wood_N, Bank_N, Montane_N, Other_N
  - Faecal coliform loads (10^6 cfu per year): STW_F, SEP_F, Urban_F
- GIS mapping:
  - The CSVs can be joined to WFD catchment polygons to map pollution loads spatially.
  - CATCH_ID, INLAND_ID, and COASTAL_ID serve as linking fields to the WFD catchment dataset.
- Data provenance and publishing status:
  - WFD catchments are not published by SEPA yet.
  - SEPA intends to add the WFD catchment dataset to its Environmental data page in the future.
- Data use and interpretation:
  - Enables assessment of non-agricultural pollution contributions to river catchments and supports integration with WFD frameworks for monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Metadata and standards:
  - Column descriptions and units are specified in the dataset (Description and Units per field).
