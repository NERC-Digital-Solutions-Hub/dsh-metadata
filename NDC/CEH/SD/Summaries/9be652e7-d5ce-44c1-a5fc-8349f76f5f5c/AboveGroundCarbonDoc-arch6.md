# Carbon in the vegetation of Great Britain

## Overview
- Presents a carbon stock estimate for British vegetation using a design-based, stratified approach consistent with Milne & Brown (1997), updated with recent Countryside Survey (CS) data, Land Cover Map (LCM) and national woodland inventories.
- Aims to produce a comparative, up-to-date national estimate of vegetation carbon and show its spatial distribution.

## Data sources
- Countryside Survey (GB) 1990 baseline with 1 km2 sampling units, stratified by land classes to enable unbiased national estimates.
- Updated data: Countryside Survey 2007, 2003 National Inventory of Woodland and Trees.
- Habitat mapping from the 2007 CS to obtain relative areas by land class and woodland species distribution.
- 2007 Land Cover Map (LCM) for higher-resolution, spatial weighting and improved spatial coherence.
- Supplementary uncertainty data from Carey (2008) and assumed woodland density variance (±10 t/ha).

## Methodology

- Carbon density assignment
  - Non-woodland vegetation: baseline carbon densities assigned by land cover type, following Milne & Brown.
  - Woodlands: carbon density depends on species, age class, and standing biomass; density estimates for each species and age class derived from M&B (Table 4) and updated with 2003 woodland inventory data.
  - Net carbon density for woodland species (CDs) computed as a weighted mean across age classes, weighted by area of each age class.

- Upscaling to national stock
  - Use land class strata to upscale density estimates to GB scale.
  - Relative area by land class (RAsl) derived from the 2007 CS habitat mapping.
  - Total carbon stock by land class combines species densities with relative areas; summed across land classes to yield GB total.

- Mapping and spatial weighting
  - Initially map using land class stocks, then weight by actual habitat distribution from the 2007 LCM to obtain a spatially coherent GB distribution.
  - Apply conversion ratios to align density estimates with LC extents, ensuring the mapped total matches the land-class total.

- Uncertainty
  - Combine habitat area extents uncertainty (CS 2007) with density estimate uncertainty.
  - Adopt ±10 t/ha as the woodland density standard error, consistent with Milne & Brown methodology.

## Key results

- Total vegetation carbon stock in Great Britain
  - 169 million tonnes of carbon (Mt C) stored in above-ground vegetation.
- Component contributions (by land class category)
  - Broadleaf woodland accounts for the largest share, with notable contributions from broadleaved, mixed, and yew woodlands.
  - Coniferous woodland and other vegetation contribute smaller shares, but conifers are significant within woodland totals.
- Proportions
  - Broadleaved woodland contributes about 63% of the total vegetation carbon stock.
  - Woodlands (broadleaved + conifers) account for roughly 87% of the total vegetation carbon stock.

- Spatial distribution insights
  - Mapping highlights high carbon stocks in large timbered areas (e.g., Thetford Forest, Langdale Forest, Kielder Forest).
  - Areas like fen districts show lower above-ground vegetation carbon stocks.

## Output data

- Data product: "Carbon" representing the carbon density (tonnes per hectare) stored in above-ground vegetation.

## Conclusions and implications

- By following the Milne & Brown analytical framework with updated data, the GB vegetation carbon stock is estimated at 169 Mt.
- The approach provides a coherent, map-enabled view of where carbon is stored, facilitating policy interpretation and scenario analysis for carbon management and land-use planning.
- The combination of CS stratification and high-resolution LC mapping yields both robust national estimates and spatially informative distribution.
