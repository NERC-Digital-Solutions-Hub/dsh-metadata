# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climate change manipulation experiment using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years for upland moorland.
  - Established in 1998 at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; representative upland west-atlantic moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather).

- Site and soil context
  - Dominant vegetation: Calluna vulgaris (>60% plant biomass); also Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum.
  - Soil: humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons; E horizon typically 6–17 cm depth when present.
  - Location coordinates: 53°03′19″N, -3°27′55″W.
  - Ecosystem type and species composition documented in site tables and appendices.

- Climate change treatments and experimental design
  - Treatments and replication
    - Drought: 3 replicate plots (4 m x 5 m) across 3 blocks; historically May–Sept droughts (1999–2011), since 2012 Apr–Oct.
    - Warming: 3 replicate plots (4 m x 5 m) using retractable aluminium curtains; reduces infrared loss at night; rainfall reduction ~14% on average due to rain retraction.
    - Controls: 3 plots with scaffolding to mirror shading effects of treatments; total n = 9 plots.
  - Operation details
    - Drought: retractable polyethylene roof triggered by tipping bucket rainfall sensor; excludes rainfall, reducing total and growing-season rainfall (varies by year; up to ~80% rainfall exclusion during drought periods).
    - Warming: curtains operate at night; retraction during rainfall to avoid rainfall loss; curtains do not operate in winds >10 m/s.
  - Timings and metrics
    - Drought intensity and timing documented year-by-year (percent rainfall reduction and growing-season reduction).
    - Warming effect quantified via growing degree days (GDD) as a measure of warming impact, with year-by-year changes.

- Abiotic and biotic data collected (high-level)
  - On-site AWS meteorological data are collected daily; plot-level micro-meteorology tracked daily.
  - Site rainfall and rainfall chemistry; throughfall measurements per plot; water table depth since 2009.
  - Soil processes: soil respiration, trace gases (CH4, N2O), net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE), photosynthesis.
  - Vegetation and litter: vegetation biomass via pin-point method, canopy reflectance, phenology and annual growth, pathogen assessments, litterfall, root biomass.
  - Vegetation chemistry and litter chemistry (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates).
  - Soil biology and chemistry: soil microbial biomass, nitrogen mineralisation, SOM/SOC/bulk density, soil solution and leachate chemistry.

- Data collection methods and time scales (selected highlights)
  - Weather and micro-meteorology
    - AWS meteorological data: sensors for temperature, humidity, rainfall, pressure, net/radiation, PAR, wind; hourly averages; 1999–present.
    - Plot-level micro-meteorological data: soil and air temperatures, soil moisture; hourly, from 1998–present (varying protocols over time).
  - Hydrology and rainfall
    - Storage rain gauge: biweekly rainfall collection (robust to logger power issues).
    - Throughfall: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; data used to calibrate treatment-level rainfall reductions.
  - Soil and ecosystem fluxes
    - Soil respiration: CO2 efflux measured with collars; multiple measurement systems used over time (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated IRGA systems); 1999–present with adjustments and site changes.
    - Trace gases: CH4 and N2O measured with static chambers in the same collars; gas samples analyzed via GC.
    - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): occasional measurements (2002–2004, 2011) with different chamber systems; adjustments for biomass differences.
    - Photosynthesis: ambient and response-curve measurements across several years (2001–2007); leaf-level measurements with PAR and Ci controls; species include Calluna vulgaris and Vaccinium myrtillus.
  - Vegetation and chemistry
    - Pin-point vegetation surveys: annual biomass estimates (1998–2012, with earlier years); 300 pins per plot; conversion factors established for biomass by species.
    - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices derived from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2004).
    - Phenology and growth: shoot elongation, budburst, growth stages, and herbivory/pathogen indicators (1999–2009, with ongoing measurements).
    - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates.
    - Litterfall: monthly collections (1999–2002) with subsequent pooling and analysis.
  - Below-ground and soil biology
    - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (soil cores, sieving, WinRHIZO analysis); 2003–2011 intervals.
    - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation with DOC post-extraction; 2000–2012.
    - Nitrogen mineralisation: paired core approach; ammonium and nitrate analyses; 1998–2004.
    - SOM, SOC and bulk density: derived from paired cores; conversion to mass per area.
    - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium analyses; 1998–2008.

- Data processing, quality control, and accessibility
  - Data processing
    - Units and conversions across equipment (e.g., CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100) documented; CO2 flux conversions applied to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
    - Vegetation biomass conversions from pin hits established with calibration experiments; adjustments for missing pins.
    - Synthesis of throughfall to treatment-level rainfall involves percent-difference calculations with data exclusions when measurements are compromised.
  - Quality and scope notes
    - Some legacy data use older protocols; best-practice documentation for data processing not always available.
    - Not all data are stored in the EIDC portal; some smaller or post-2015 data may require direct contact for access.
    - Data quality control relied on manual visual checks in addition to standard calibration where applicable.
  - Data availability and contacts
    - Data summaries and data requests: contact Sabine Reinsch or Bridget Emmett at CEH Bangor for details.
    - Appendix materials provide site layout, plot and quadrat configurations.

- Appendices and site layout
  - Appendix 1: Site layout and coordinates.
  - Appendix 2: Quadrat layout across plots.
  - Appendix 3: Plot layout with quadrats and measurement areas (e.g., LYS, PQ, SS).

- Practical implications for analysts
  - Rich, multi-factor, long-term dataset linking climate manipulations to ecosystem responses across hydrology, carbon cycling, vegetation dynamics, soil biology, and chemistry.
  - Useful for exploring correlations and predictive relationships between drought/warmer climate treatments and biogeochemical fluxes, vegetation productivity, and nutrient cycling.
  - Requires careful handling of methodological changes over time and cross-year data harmonization due to instrument transitions and data storage variations.
