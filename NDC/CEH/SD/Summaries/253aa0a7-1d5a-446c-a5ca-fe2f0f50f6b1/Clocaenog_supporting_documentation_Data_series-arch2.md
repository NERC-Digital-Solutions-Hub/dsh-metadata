# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- A climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland over the next 20–30 years.
- Established in 1998; powered by solar and wind; replicated drought and warming treatments with three plots per treatment and three control plots (nine plots total).
- Dominant ecosystem: wet upland heath dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather), with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum present; soil type is humo-ferric podzol.

## Site and climate context

- Location: 53°03'19" N, -3°27'55" W; grid reference SJ019519.
- Vegetation and soils characterized; a range of plant species and biomass data tracked over time.
- Mean climate indicators and site conditions provided (e.g., soil horizons, moisture, nutrient metrics) to support interpretation of treatment effects.

## Climate change treatments

- Treatments and replication:
  - Drought: three replicate plots and three controls; 4 m × 5 m plots.
  - Warming: three replicate plots and three controls; same plot size.
- Drought mechanism:
  - Retractable polyethylene roof triggered by tipping-bucket rainfall sensor.
  - May–September drought period originally (1999–2011); April–October since 2012.
  - Rain exclusion reduces annual rainfall by ~20% and excludes ~80% of growing-season rainfall; high rainfall events sometimes missed due to sensor limits.
- Warming mechanism:
  - Retractable aluminum mesh curtains over warming plots; reflect 96–97% of IR, reducing nighttime heat loss by ~64%.
  - Curtains retract in response to rain to avoid rainfall loss; operation restricted in winds >10 m s-1.
  - Nighttime warming and rainfall management lead to ~14% annual rainfall reduction on warming plots.
- Timing details and changes over years are documented (Tables 1 and 2 references).

## Data collection framework and data types

- On-site automated weather station (AWS) for meteorological data plus plot-level (micro-meteorological) sensors.
- Data types collected (with approximate time scales):
  - AWS meteorological data: daily, 1999–present (air temp, humidity, rainfall, pressure, net/radiation, PAR, wind).
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily, 1998–present (soil/air temp, soil moisture).
  - Rainfall: site-level storage rain gauge (biweekly), rainfall chemistry (lab analyses).
  - Throughfall: plot-level rainfall (biweekly), used to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes.
  - Water table depth: biweekly since 2009.
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly; multiple measurement systems over time; collar-based CO2 fluxes.
  - Trace gases (CH4, N2O): static chambers; sampling timing to estimate fluxes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): multiple years (2002–2004, 2011) with different chamber systems; biomass adjustments applied.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient measurements and response curves; leaf-level measurements on multiple species.
  - Vegetation surveys (plant biomass): Pin-point (hit-mapping) method; repeated years 1998–2012 and onward with biomass calibration.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectroscopy (2001–2004, plus select years).
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth, and pathogen assessment: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, and disease/herbivory indicators (1998–2009+).
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates (green and litter).
  - Litterfall: collectors; monthly samples (1999–2002) and annual data thereafter; C and N analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple years and methods (2003–2013) with soil cores and washing/WinRHIZO analyses.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation in select years (2000, 2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: soil cores with initial/final analyses (1998–2004).
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: soil core analyses linked to mineralisation studies.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; monthly sampling (1998–2008).
- Data processing and QA:
  - Data quality checks largely conducted via visual reviews in Excel.
  - Unit conversions across various measurement systems documented (e.g., soil respiration and NEE conversions between g CO2 m^-2 h^-1 and mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1; LICOR vs CIRAS data).
  - Throughfall and rainfall data require adjustments to express plot-level rainfall changes from site-level rainfall.
- Metadata and accessibility:
  - Summary data and raw field data stored in CEH Bangor data systems, with some datasets not stored in the central EIDC portal; contact information provided for access (Sabine Reinsch, Bridget Emmett).

## Equipment, protocols, and data processing highlights

- AWS and micro-meteorological setups:
  - Sensors and locations upgraded after 2007 to secure masts; measurements captured hourly or daily as specified.
- Sample collection and laboratory analyses:
  - Rainfall chemistry: pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium analyzed with established lab methods.
  - Throughfall and leachate: standardized sampling and QC steps, with data gaps treated by exclusion or infilling as needed.
- Data integration notes:
  - Data from different instruments over time require careful conversions and calibration when combining datasets (e.g., soil respiration methods, NEE flux calculations).
  - Appendix materials provide site layout and quadrat arrangements for contextualization.

## Data accessibility and end-use

- The documentation emphasizes standardized data outputs (maps, charts) suitable for environmental health and policy performance monitoring.
- Data stewardship considerations include improving dataset value through data integration and ensuring broader access to underlying data used to generate final outputs.
- Appendix references: site layout and quadrat configurations (2012 Climoor plot layout; LYS, PQ, SS coding).

## Key takeaways for monitoring and policy-analysis workflows

- Climoor provides a long-term, replicated experimental platform to quantify drought and warming effects on an upland moorland ecosystem, with extensive multi-omic and biogeochemical datasets.
- A wide range of abiotic and biotic measurements enable integrated assessments of climate manipulation impacts on carbon fluxes, water dynamics, plant and microbial communities, and nutrient cycling.
- The data pipeline includes robust but evolving methodologies over time, with explicit documentation of equipment changes, data processing steps, and QA approaches.
- Access is available through CEH Bangor channels, with awareness that some legacy data may reside outside centralized portals (EIDC); readiness to link datasets for cross-data analyses is highlighted as a priority.
