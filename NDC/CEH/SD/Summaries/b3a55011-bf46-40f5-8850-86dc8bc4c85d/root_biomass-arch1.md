# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

- Study area and context
  - Located in the BDFFP area, KM41 reserve, about 100 km from Manaus, Brazil (02 24'S, 59 52'W).
  - Local soils: clay-rich Ferrasols (≈30% of the Amazon Basin); annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (June–October).
  - Forest characteristics in the area: above-ground biomass (AGB) about 322 ± 54 Mg ha-1 (ind. ≥ 10 cm DBH); mean wood density 0.67 g cm-3; ~280 species (≥10 cm DBH) per hectare.

- Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX) – design and treatments
  - Initiated in March 2017; full factorial design with eight treatments, four replicates per treatment, totaling 32 plots.
  - Experimental layout: four independent blocks, plots spaced at least 200 m apart.
  - Fertilization regime: annual nutrient additions split into three applications to minimize leaching and runoff.
    - Rates per year: N 125 kg ha-1; P 50 kg ha-1; cations 50 kg ha-1; Ca 50 kg ha-1; Mg 20 kg ha-1 (as dolomitic limestone).
  - Treatments (eight total):
    - Control
    - Nitrogen (N)
    - Phosphorus (P)
    - Cations
    - Nitrogen + Phosphorus (N + P)
    - Nitrogen + cations (N + cations)
    - Phosphorus + cations (P + cations)
    - Nitrogen + Phosphorus + cations (N + P + cations)
  - Plot details: each 50 × 50 m; all plots established in areas with similar soil, vegetation, and topography; plots at least 50 m apart within blocks.
  - AFEX 2.0: Plot delineation and management updates; fertilization carried out annually as three applications, applied by hand during systematic walks within plots.

- Collection methods for fine-root biomass
  - Target: fine roots defined as <2 mm in diameter.
  - Method: in-growth core approach using plastic mesh traps (12 cm diameter, 30 cm depth) installed in five holes within the central 30 × 30 m of each plot; initial soil in cores was root-free.
  - Sampling protocol: five ingrowth cores per plot, pooled into a composite sample, analyzed by depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm).
  - Root extraction and processing: roots removed by hand in the field within 60 minutes, cleaned, dried at 60 °C to constant weight, then weighed.
  - Stock definition: the root biomass from the first installation (initial stock).
  - Sampling schedule: every three months during 2017–2019.
    - 2017: August and November
    - 2018: February, June, September, December
    - 2019: March, June, September, December

- Data and metadata (data spreadsheet)
  - Structure notes (as described in the dataset):
    - Columns include: PlotID, Block, Plot, Depth, Time_int (sampling interval), Time, Time_min (sampling times in minutes), tot_weight (dry weight of fine roots).
    - Depths: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
    - Time_int and Time correspond to sampling intervals (e.g., 0–15 min, 15–30 min, etc.) with total observation times up to 60 minutes.
  - Data management: the root biomass data spreadsheet is deposited in the EIDC system (Figure 4 reference).

- Intended use and relevance for analysis
  - Enables analysis of how nutrient additions (N, P, cations, and their combinations) affect fine-root biomass across soil depths and over time.
  - Facilitates exploration of treatment effects, depth-specific root dynamics, temporal trends, and interactions among nutrients.
  - With explicit plot, block, depth, and time identifiers, the data support robust statistical analysis and potential meta-analyses.
