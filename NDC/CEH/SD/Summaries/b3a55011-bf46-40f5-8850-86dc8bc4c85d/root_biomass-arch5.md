# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

- Study area and context
  - Conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
  - Local soils: clay-rich Ferrasols; annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (June–October).
  - Forest structure: above-ground biomass (AGB) ~322 ± 54 Mg ha^-1; mean wood density ~0.67 g cm^-3; species richness ~280 species (≥10 cm dbh) per ha.

- Experimental design (AFEX)
  - Full factorial design with eight treatments and four replicates per treatment (32 plots), organized into at least four blocks ≥200 m apart.
  - Plot size: 50 × 50 m; plots within blocks are identified (e.g., P1–P8).
  - Treatments: Control; nitrogen (N); phosphorus (P); cations; N + P; N + cations; P + cations; N + P + cations.
  - Fertilization: annual applications totaling per-year rates of 125 kg N ha^-1 (as urea), 50 kg P ha^-1 (as triple superphosphate), 50 kg ha^-1 of cations (as potassium chloride) plus 50 kg ha^-1 Ca and 20 kg ha^-1 Mg (as dolomitic limestone).
  - AFEX 2.0 includes plot delineation and maintained 50 m minimum separation between plots to reduce cross-treatment effects.

- Data collection methods
  - Root biomass collection via in-growth core method: plastic mesh traps (12 cm diameter, 30 cm depth) installed in five points per plot within the central 30 × 30 m area.
  - Sampling depth: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; roots (<2 mm in diameter) are removed, cleaned, dried at 60 °C to constant mass, and weighed.
  - Stock definition: biomass from the initial installation treated as the stock of roots.
  - Sampling schedule: every three months.
  - Years and times sampled: 2017 (Aug, Nov); 2018 (Feb, Jun, Sep, Dec); 2019 (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec).

- Data structure and spreadsheet
  - Data collected and organized in a root biomass dataset stored in a structured spreadsheet (Figure 4 reference).
  - Key columns and definitions (example mapping):
    - PlotID (combination of Block and Plot codes, e.g., B1P1)
    - Block (B1, B2, B3, B4)
    - Plot (P1–P8)
    - Depth (0–10 cm; 10–30 cm)
    - Time_int (sampling interval within the hour: 0–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60 minutes)
    - Time (sampling times 1–4)
    - Time_min (15, 30, 45, 60)
    - tot_weight (dry weight in g)
  - Data notes indicate how time intervals map to sampling events and depths, with multiple records per plot/depth per time point.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data are deposited and managed within the EIDC (Electronic Institutional Data Catalog) system.
  - Clear documentation of the dataset structure and field definitions supports discoverability and reuse.
  - The dataset supports ongoing updates as AFEX continues and as additional sampling rounds are completed.
