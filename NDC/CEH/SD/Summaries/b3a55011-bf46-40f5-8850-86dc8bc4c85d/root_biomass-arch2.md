# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Purpose and study context
- Experimental evaluation of how different nutrient additions affect soil and root dynamics in an Amazon terra firme forest.
- Located inside the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
- Site characteristics: clay-rich Ferralsols; annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (June–October).
- Forest baseline: approximate above-ground biomass (AGB) 322 ± 54 Mg ha^-1 (ind. ≥10 cm dbh), mean wood density 0.67 g cm^-3, ~280 species ha^-1 (≥10 cm dbh).

## Experimental design (AFEX)
- Full factorial design with eight treatments, four replicates per treatment (32 plots) arranged in four independent blocks (≥200 m apart).
- Plot size: 50 x 50 m; plots grouped by treatment within blocks.
- Fertilization regime: annual application split into three events to mitigate leaching/runoff.
  - Rates per year: 125 kg ha^-1 N (as urea), 50 kg ha^-1 P (as triple superphosphate), 50 kg ha^-1 of cations (as potassium chloride), plus 50 kg ha^-1 Ca and 20 kg ha^-1 Mg (as dolomitic limestone).
- Treatments:
  - Control; N; P; cations; N+P; N+cations; P+cations; N+P+cations.
- AFEX 2.0: Plot delineation and arrangement within KM41 to facilitate comparisons across nutrient combinations.

## Data collection methods (root biomass)
- Target variable: fine root biomass (g) defined as roots <2 mm in diameter.
- Method: in-growth core technique
  - Each plot contains five plastic mesh traps (12 cm diameter, 30 cm depth) with root-free soil, installed in central 30 x 30 m area.
  - Five cores per plot pooled into a single composite sample, subdivided into depths 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
  - Roots removed in the field by hand for 60 minutes (split into four 15-minute intervals), cleaned, dried at 60°C to constant mass, and weighed.
  - First installation’s root biomass treated as the stock.
- Sampling schedule: every three months.
  - 2017: August and November.
  - 2018: February, June, September, December.
  - 2019: March, June, September, December.

## Data management and outputs
- Data collection spreadsheet (metadata and measurements) includes:
  - Plot identifiers, block, plot, depth, sampling interval, sampling times, time in minutes, and total dry weight.
  - Example structure covers multiple blocks, plots, depths, and time points with corresponding biomass values.
- Data deposition: root biomass data deposited in the EIDC system (Figure 4 reference).
- Outputs enable standardized assessments of root biomass response to nutrient additions over time and depth, contributing to broader environmental monitoring and nutrient cycling analyses.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates standardized, repeatable data collection and storage for long-term environmental health assessment.
- Produces comparable metrics (fine root biomass by depth and time) across nutrient treatments, aiding evaluation of ecosystem responses to fertilization.
- Data are organized to support sharing and reuse, aligning with goals to increase dataset value and enable access to underlying data for broader scrutiny and policy-relevant insights.
