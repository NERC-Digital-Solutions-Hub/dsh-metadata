# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area and context
- Located in the BDFFP area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazilian Amazon.
- Soils: clay-rich Ferrasols; annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (Jun–Oct).
- Baseline forest structure: above-ground biomass (AGB) ~322 ± 54 Mg ha-1 (≥10 cm dbh); mean wood density ~0.67 g cm-3; ~280 species (≥10 cm dbh) per ha.

## Experimental design (AFEX)
- Full factorial fertilization experiment started March 2017.
- Treatments: 8 fertilization regimes (Control; N; P; cations; N+P; N+cations; P+cations; N+P+cations).
- Replication: 4 replicates per treatment, total 32 plots.
- Layout: four independent blocks, each ≥200 m apart; plots are 50 × 50 m with ≥50 m separation between plots.
- Nutrients applied annually in three applications to minimize leaching and runoff.
  - Rates: 125 kg ha-1 N (as urea), 50 kg ha-1 P (Ca(H2PO4)2), 50 kg ha-1 Ca+/K+ cations, plus 20 kg ha-1 Mg as dolomitic limestone (as applicable per treatment).
- AFEX 2.0: Plot delineation and replication maintained within KM41 reserve.

## Data collection methods (root biomass)
- Target metric: fine root biomass (<2 mm diameter) as an indicator of below-ground response to nutrient amendments.
- Method: in-growth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm depth) installed in five points per plot within the central 30 × 30 m area.
- Procedure: cores filled with root-free soil; roots extracted by hand in the field over 60 minutes (split into 15-minute intervals), cleaned, dried at 60 °C to constant weight, and weighed.
- Sampling regime:
  - Frequency: every three months.
  - Years and timings: 2017 (Aug, Nov); 2018 (Feb, Jun, Sep, Dec); 2019 (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec).
  - Depths: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
- Stock vs. dynamic pool: initial installation stock used as baseline.
- Data captured per sample: plot, block, plot ID, depth, sampling interval, time point, minutes per sampling, and total dry weight.

## Data management and metadata
- Data representation: a structured spreadsheet with:
  - B = PlotID; Block; Plot; Depth; Time_int (sampling interval 0–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60 min); Time; Time_min (15, 30, 45, 60); tot_weight (g dry weight).
  - Example entries show combinations of Block, Plot (e.g., B1P1, P1, etc.), Depth (0–10, 10–30), time intervals, and measured weights.
- Dataset documentation: table and column descriptions provided (e.g., Census, PlotID, Block, Plot, Depth, Time_int, Time, Time_min, tot_weight).
- Data deposition: root biomass dataset deposited in the EIDC data system (data availability and accessibility supported by the centralized repository).

## Outputs and materials

- Data products: quantitative root biomass measurements by plot, depth, time, and fertilization treatment, suitable for monitoring framework analyses.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy
- Provides a rigorous, repeatable protocol for measuring below-ground health indicators in a tropical forest under nutrient manipulation.
- Combines robust experimental design (randomized block, full factorial treatments, replicated plots) with detailed metadata and standardized data handling, enabling transparent, auditable monitoring frameworks.
- Data governance is addressed through explicit metadata fields and centralized deposition (EIDC), supporting data sharing and policy-relevant reporting.
- Highlights practical considerations for monitoring programs, such as logistical demands of in-field sampling, data processing time, and the need for consistent, long-term data stewardship.
