# Records of leaf damage caused by and parasitism of Cameraria ohridella in Britain in 2010 collected with a citizen science approach, plus validation of the data.

- Aim
  - Investigate two hypotheses about Cameraria ohridella in Britain during 2010:
    - Whether leaf damage on horse-chestnut trees (Aesculus hippocastanum) is greatest where the moth has been present the longest.
    - Whether parasitism levels of C. ohridella larvae are greatest where the moth has been present the longest.

- Study design and data collection
  - Citizen science project: Conker Tree Science; more than 3,500 participants across Great Britain contributed data via the project website (www.conkertreescience.org.uk).
  - Leaf damage data
    - Collected during summer 2010 (1 July – 15 October).
    - Participants scored leaf damage on an ordinal scale 0–4, with illustrated guidance.
  - Parasitism data (rearing method)
    - Participants sampled leaves in early July 2010 and stored infested leaves for two weeks.
    - Reported counts of leaf mines, adult moths, parasitoids, and other insects after rearing.
    - School children aged 8–11 were involved; eight trained volunteers led classes but did not provide directive guidance during counting to avoid bias.
    - A random subset of 669 samples counted by children was selected for expert blind assessment; an additional 75 samples with reported parasitoids were included.
  - Long-term arrival data and modeling
    - Used Forest Research data to determine observed year of arrival in 10 km squares (with permission).
    - Modeled predicted year of arrival by augmenting the known distribution (2006–2010) with a demographic spread model parameterized from continental Europe, comprising short-distance diffusion and rare long-distance movements (long-distance parameter not directly used in the modeled distribution; data inform potential long-distance events).
    - Implemented on a 2.5 km grid; modeled both two- and three-generations-per-year scenarios.
    - End-of-generation updates: at the end of every second or third generation, the predicted distribution was updated with observed distribution; moth presence was assumed in all 16 of the 2.5 km cells within each observed 10 km cell.
  - Location privacy and data provenance
    - Full location data were provided by participants but are restricted in the released data to 10 km grid squares for privacy.
    - Observed year of arrival data were sourced from Forest Research.

- Data quality and validation
  - Quality statement
    - Counts submitted by the public via the Conker Tree Science website are provided without correction or validation.
    - Parasitoid counts in parasitoidrecords.csv are binned for higher counts (e.g., 26–30, 31–40, etc.) and converted to representative values (e.g., 28, 35, 45, 55, 65).
    - A subset of samples used for validation was retained; validation data are provided in validationdata.csv.
  - Validation approach
    - Blind expert validation of counts for the random subset; additional samples with reported parasitoids included in validation.
  - Data privacy and accessibility
    - Location data limited to 10 km squares; raw coordinates not published.
    - Observed year of arrival and modeled year of arrival data used with permission from Forest Research.

- Supporting documentation and modeling details
  - Modeled distribution notes
    - Observed year of arrival data from Forest Research; modeled arrival years via a two-component demography-based spread model using short-distance diffusion (probability of presence exp(-0.025 × d^2), with d being distance to the nearest occupied square) and optional long-distance dispersal events inferred from data.
    - Implemented on a 2.5 km grid; modeled with two and three generations per year; updating the predicted distribution periodically as new observed data became available.
    - Assumes presence in all 16 cells within each 10 km cell for squares where presence was recorded.
  - Data origin and usage
    - Data are drawn from public participation in citizen science, with additional expert validation and long-term distribution modeling to contextualize current observations.

- Access, provenance, and potential uses
  - Data collected to analyze spatial and temporal patterns of leaf damage and parasitism in relation to the duration of C. ohridella presence.
  - Suitable for exploring correlations between damage severity, parasitism rates, and the inferred arrival history.
  - Data are designed for reproducibility, with explicit modeling approach and clearly defined data schemas, though privacy constraints limit precise location granularity.
  - Original project website and supporting publications provide access to detailed methodologies and potential downloadable data, with datasets accompanied by metadata and documentation.
