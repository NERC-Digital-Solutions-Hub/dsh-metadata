# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides supplementary details on the experimental design, sampling regime, and questionnaire surveys used to explore knowledge-management (KM) methods in environment research.
  - Focuses on a joint international critical zone (CZ) project, comparing British and Chinese scientists to gain insights and assess representativeness against the wider Chinese community.

- Sampling and respondents
  - British scientists: 16 respondents.
  - Chinese scientists: 27 respondents within the CZ project.
  - Extended survey: an additional 45 general Chinese environmental scientists surveyed (via responses gathered at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference, Guizhou, China) to test representativeness of initial Chinese responses.

- Data collection methods
  - Surveys conducted during project meetings or via email circulation.
  - Extended surveys collected at a major conference (Guizhou, 2017).
  - Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation details marked as N/A; analytical methods and calibration steps marked as N/A.

- Data type and structure
  - Nature and units: questionnaire data.
  - Data files:
    - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results from geo-scientists at the 2017 conference).
    - SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv (survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZO programme, including Nov. 2017 emails).
  - Metadata: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf (the questions used for the survey), advising users to read data files in conjunction with this document.

- Quality control and spatial considerations
  - Two different counties surveyed to account for spatial variation in KE understanding.

- Data usage and interpretation notes
  - The provided questions (ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf) are essential for interpreting the survey results.
  - Data are suitable for analysis of KM methods and cross-country comparisons within the CZ project context; designed to aid interpretation rather than to provide field/instrumentation measurements.
