# Scientist survey:

- Purpose
  - Aimed at capturing scientists' experiences with knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge exchange (KE), including whether they are based in the UK, China, or elsewhere.
  - Examines how scientists have shared research with end users (policy makers, practitioners, the public) and the types of outputs produced.

- Core questions about KT/KE experience
  - Whether respondents have ever done knowledge transfer or exchange with users.
  - If based in the UK or China (or other), and the context of KT/KE performed.
  - Prior familiarity with the terms knowledge exchange and co-production before the presentation.

- Types of KT/KE activities and outputs
  - Types of KT/KE outputs produced: policy briefing, best practice guidance, webinars, training workshops, farmer’s guidance, decision support tools, technical reports, and other outputs.
  - Whether outputs were created with end users (co-produced), for end users (hybrid/traditional KT), or not at all.
  - Whether outputs were designed for end users or generated as scientific outputs (reports/papers) with users acting on their own.

- KT/KE processes and collaboration modes
  - Methods used to deliver KE: co-designing research questions, co-produced outputs with end users, participatory workshops, secondment in end-user organisations, or other approaches.
  - Extent of end-user involvement in KE activities (from no involvement to full co-production).

- Evaluation and impact
  - Whether the success of KT/KE activities has been measured, who measured it (local government, the research team, etc.), and how changes in practice were assessed.
  - Perceived possibility of applying KE approaches to current projects, with explanations for why or why not.
  - Interest in using KE approaches in future research projects if KE concepts were new to respondents.

- Geographic and project relevance
  - Questions distinguish respondents by region (UK, China, Other) and ask about relevance of KE to ongoing or proposed projects.
  - Encourages explanation of why KE approaches would or would not fit particular projects.

- Relevance for GIS Specialists
  - KE outputs align with GIS work when they include decision-support tools, technical guidance, and policy briefs that inform spatial planning and practice.
  - End-user co-production can improve map design, data standards, and the usability of geospatial products.
  - Participatory methods and secondments can enhance engagement with local authorities and practitioners who rely on GIS for decision-making.
  - Measuring impact of map-based KE outputs may require clear indicators linked to policy changes, practice adoption, or improved spatial decision processes.
