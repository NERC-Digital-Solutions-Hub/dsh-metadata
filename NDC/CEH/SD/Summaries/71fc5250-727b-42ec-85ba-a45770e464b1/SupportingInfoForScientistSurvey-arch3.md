# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents questionnaire surveys conducted with British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge exchange (KE) methods used in environmental research.
  - UKKE experience is leveraged to provide helpful cross-country insights; aims to inform understanding of KE practices within environmental science.

- Sampling and data collection
  - Participants: Chinese (n = 27) and British (n = 16) scientists from a joint international critical zone (CZ) project; responses gathered during project meetings or via email.
  - Additional sampling: 45 general Chinese environmental scientists surveyed via responses collected at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to test representativeness of the initial Chinese responses.
  - Timeframe: Responses collected in Nov 2017 for the CZ-related surveys.

- Data collection methods
  - Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation: Not applicable (N/A).
  - Data type: Questionnaire data.
  - Data structure: Two files containing survey results:
    1) SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (geo-scientists who attended the 2017 Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China).
    2) SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv (Chinese and British scientists in the CZ programme, including Nov 2017 email responses).

- Metadata and data interpretation
  - Comprehensive questions file: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf, containing the survey questions, to be referenced alongside the data files for interpretation.
  - The two datasets should be read in conjunction with the questions file to understand the context and meaning of responses.

- Quality control and representativeness
  - Quality control: Two different counties were surveyed to account for spatial variation in KE understanding.
  - Representativeness: The additional Chinese responses at the conference were used to assess whether the CZ responses reflect the wider Chinese environmental science community.

- Data contents and structure
  - Dataset 1: SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (responses from geo-scientists at the 2017 Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China).
  - Dataset 2: SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv (survey responses from Chinese and British scientists in the CZ programme, including Nov 2017 emails).

- Relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates a method for gathering stakeholder perspectives on KE practices to inform monitoring design and evaluation.
  - Highlights the importance of accessible, well-documented metadata, and the potential data-sharing considerations when publicly sharing datasets.
  - Provides a basis for cross-country comparisons and assessment of representativeness in environmental monitoring-related data.
