# Scientist survey:

- Purpose
  - Gather information on scientists’ experience with knowledge transfer (KT), knowledge exchange (KE), and coproduction with end users (policymakers, practitioners, the public).
  - Assess awareness of KE/coproduction, types of KT activities, outputs produced, end-user involvement, KE processes, impact measurement, and openness to KE approaches in future projects.

- Respondents and geography
  - Questions identify whether respondents are based in the UK, China, or other regions.
  - Includes a coding scheme to classify country origin and related responses.

- Knowledge transfer history
  - Have you ever done any knowledge transfer or exchange during your research career?
  - If yes, report types of KT/KE used: traditional, hybrid, or knowledge exchange.
  - Prior awareness of KE/coproduction before the session.

- Examples and outputs
  - Provide examples of KT activities: who you worked with (e.g., local government), how you collaborated, and what was produced (reports, guidance, etc.).
  - List outputs created through KT/KE: policy briefings, best practice guidance, webinars, training workshops, farmer guidance, decision support tools, technical reports, other.
  - Indicate whether outputs were produced with end users (co-produced), for end users (hybrid), or solely as scientific outputs/guidance handed to users.

- End-user involvement and collaboration methods
  - Whether outputs were co-produced with end users, produced for end users, or not directly tied to end users.
  - How outputs were created: co-designed research questions, co-produced outputs, participatory workshops, secondments to end-user organizations, or other methods.

- Impact measurement
  - Whether the success of KT/KE activities has been measured, who measured it, and how changes in practice or outcomes were tracked (e.g., farmers' practices).

- Applicability and interest in KE
  - Perceived possibility of applying KE approaches in ongoing or future projects (Not applicable, Yes, No, Maybe) and the reasoning.
  - If KE concepts were new, interest in adopting KE approaches when working with end users (Yes, No, Maybe) and the rationale.

- Additional comments
  - Space for any other relevant remarks about KT/KE experiences or preferences.

- Implications for Data Support practice
  - KE/coevaluation mindset can help data teams design user-centered data products.
  - Emphasize co-design with end users to ensure dashboards, tools, and reports meet real needs.
  - Consider incorporating participatory processes and clear impact metrics to demonstrate data-driven improvements.
