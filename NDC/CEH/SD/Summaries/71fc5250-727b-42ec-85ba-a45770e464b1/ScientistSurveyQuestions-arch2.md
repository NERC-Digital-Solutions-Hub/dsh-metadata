# Scientist survey:

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to capture researchers' experience with knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge exchange (KE), including awareness, methods, outputs, and end-user engagement.
- Questions cover geography (UK, China, Other), types of KT/KE conducted, and potential for KE integration in current and future projects.
- Focus on how data and research are translated into actionable outputs for policymakers, practitioners, and the public.

## Respondent context
- Geographic base options: China, UK, or Other.
- Whether respondents have previously engaged in any form of knowledge transfer to end-users (e.g., policymakers, practitioners, public).

## Knowledge transfer activity
- If based in UK/China/Other, which KT/KE activities have been undertaken (traditional, hybrid, knowledge exchange).
- Whether respondents were aware of KE and/or co-production before the presentation.

## Outputs and collaboration
- Examples of KT activities: who was involved (e.g., local government), how collaboration occurred, and what outputs were produced (reports, guidance, etc.).
- Types of KT outputs respondents have contributed to (select all that apply):
  - Policy briefing
  - Best practice guidance
  - Webinars
  - Training workshops
  - Farmer's guidance
  - Decision support tools
  - Technical reports
  - Other
- Whether outputs were produced with end users (co-produced KE), produced for end users (hybrid KE), or scientific outputs only (no involvement by end users).

## Processes and engagement methods
- KT processes used to deliver knowledge to end users:
  - Co-designed research questions to meet research and end-user goals
  - Co-produced outputs with end users
  - Participatory workshops with end users
  - Secondments in end-user organizations (e.g., government) to help embed knowledge
  - Other methods (with space to explain)

## Evaluation and impact
- Whether the success of KT/KE activities has been measured, and if so, how and by whom (e.g., changes in farmer practices, evaluation by local government or the research team).
- If KE could be applied to the current project, and the reasoning behind the choice.
- If KE concepts were new, interest in applying KE approaches in future research projects, with space to explain reasons.

## Attitudes toward knowledge exchange
- Willingness to adopt KE or co-production approaches in future research projects, including conditions or constraints.

## Additional comments
- Space for any relevant remarks about experiences with KT/KE, collaboration with end users, or challenges and opportunities.
