# Scientist survey:

- Purpose and scope
  - Assesses scientists’ experience with knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge exchange (KE), including awareness, types of interactions, engagement with end users, and potential for applying KE approaches in projects.
  - Aims to identify outputs, processes, measurement of impact, and openness to KE in future work.

- Respondent background
  - Location: UK, China, or Other.

- KT/KE experience
  - Have you ever done any knowledge transfer or exchange during your research career? Yes or No.
  - If yes, which types of KT/KE have you undertaken? Traditional, Hybrid, Knowledge exchange (KE); if No, select “I have never done KT/KE.”

- Awareness of KE/coproduction
  - Before this presentation, had you heard of knowledge exchange and/or co-production? Yes or No.

- Examples of KT activities
  - Provide examples of KT activities, including who you worked with (e.g., local government) and what you produced (e.g., report, guidance).
  - Options include: No KT/KE experience; Traditional; Hybrid; KE; plus space to explain (5a).

- KT/KE outputs
  - What types of KT/KE outputs have you been involved in creating? Policy briefing; Best practice guidance; Webinars; Training workshops; Farmer’s guidance; Decision support tools; Technical report; Other; and option indicating no KT/KE experience.

- End-user involvement
  - Were outputs created WITH end users (co-produced), FOR end users (hybrid), or not at all?
  - Choices: No KT/KE experience; WITH end users (co-produced); FOR end users (hybrid); Scientific reports/papers only (end users produce outputs themselves).

- KT/KE processes used
  - Which KE processes have you used to deliver KT/KE? Co-designed research questions; Co-produced outputs with end users; Ran participatory workshops; Secondment in an end-user organisation; Other.

- Measuring success
  - Has the success of KT/KE activities been measured? Yes/No.
  - If Yes, explain how success was measured (e.g., changes in farmers’ practice) and by whom (e.g., local government or research team).

- Applicability to a project
  - Do you think it would be possible to use a KE approach in this project? Not applicable; Yes; No; Maybe.
  - Explain your choice.

- Interest in KE going forward
  - If KE concepts were new to you before this talk, would you be interested in using KE approaches in future research projects? Options: Yes; No; Maybe; Not applicable if already using KE.
  - Explain your choice.
