# Scientist survey

## Purpose and scope
- A questionnaire to assess researchers' experience with knowledge transfer and knowledge exchange (KE), awareness of KE and co-production, types of outputs, collaboration with end users, processes, measurement of success, and openness to KE in future projects.

## Key questions/topics

- Geographic/base affiliation
  - Based in UK, China, or other

- Experience with knowledge transfer
  - Have you ever done knowledge transfer to users (policymakers, practitioners, public) during your research career? Yes/No

- Types of knowledge transfer used
  - If yes: Traditional, Hybrid, Knowledge exchange

- Awareness of KE/coproduction
  - Before this presentation, had you heard of knowledge exchange or coproduction? Yes/No

- Examples of knowledge transfer activities
  - Provide examples: who you worked with (e.g., local government), how you worked with them, and outputs produced (e.g., report, guidance)

- Outputs produced (types)
  - Policy briefing
  - Best practice guidance
  - Webinars
  - Training workshops
  - Farmer's guidance
  - Decision support tools
  - Technical report
  - Other

- End-user involvement in outputs
  - Outputs produced WITH end users (co-produced), FOR end users (hybrid), or not at all (scientific report/papers provided to users)

- Knowledge transfer processes used
  - Co-designed research questions to meet goals
  - Co-produced outputs with end users
  - Participatory workshops to involve end users
  - Secondment in an end-user organization to embed knowledge
  - Other

- Measurement of success
  - Have these KE activities been measured? If yes, how and by whom (e.g., changes in practice by farmers, evaluation by local government or research team)

- Feasibility of KE in current project
  - Is it possible to use a KE approach in this project? Yes/No/Maybe/Not applicable
  - If applicable, please explain

- Interest in KE for future projects
  - If KE concepts were new, would you be interested in using KE approaches in future research projects? Yes/No/Maybe
  - Please explain your reasoning

## Relevance for monitoring framework authors

- KE activities inform what outputs and processes to monitor to evaluate policy relevance and uptake.
- Data on end-user involvement and co-production informs governance and collaborative design of monitoring frameworks.
- Understanding success measures helps define indicators for policy impact and decision support tools.
- Awareness and openness to KE affect how monitoring frameworks plan stakeholder engagement and knowledge translation.

## Data and governance considerations

- Data about KE outputs, collaborations, and outcomes require clear metadata and transparent sharing where appropriate.
- Collaboration with end users and co-produced outputs imply specific data governance and quality assurance needs.
