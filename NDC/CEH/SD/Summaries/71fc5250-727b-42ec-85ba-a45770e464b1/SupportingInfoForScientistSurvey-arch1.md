# Supporting information for interpreting

## Objective and scope
- Explores knowledge-exchange (KE) methods in environment research by surveying scientists from China and the UK.
- Aims to compare experiences, leveraging the UK’s relatively established KE research background.
- Part of a joint international critical zone (CZ) project.

## Sampling and participants
- Joint project participants: Chinese scientists (n = 27) and British scientists (n = 16) involved in the CZ collaboration.
- Recruitment: Surveys completed at project meetings or circulated via email.
- Representativeness check: An additional 45 general Chinese environmental scientists were surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to assess whether responses from the joint-project Chinese scientists were representative of the wider Chinese community.

## Data collection details
- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation: Not applicable (N/A).
- Data collection approach: Questionnaire surveys (question content provided in a separate file).
- Spatial variation: Two different counties were surveyed to account for potential spatial differences in KE understanding.

## Data files and structure
- The dataset comprises two CSV files:
  1. SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv — survey results from geoscientists who attended the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
  2. SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv — survey results from Chinese and British scientists within the CZ program, including responses collected via emails in November 2017.
- Additional metadata: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf contains the survey questions and should be used alongside the data files to interpret variables.

## Nature of data and units
- Type: Questionnaire data.
- Units and scales: Defined by the questions in ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf; data structure aligns with those questions.

## Quality control and interpretation notes
- Quality control: Implemented by surveying two counties to capture spatial variation in KE understanding.
- Data interpretation: Read the two data files in conjunction with ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf to map responses to the corresponding questions and variables.

## How to use the data
- Compare KE understanding and methods between Chinese and British scientists.
- Assess representativeness of the joint-project Chinese responses against a broader Chinese environmental-science sample.
- Analyze cross-country differences and potential regional (county-level) variation in KE concepts.
- Use the included questions file to understand variable definitions and response formats before analysis.
