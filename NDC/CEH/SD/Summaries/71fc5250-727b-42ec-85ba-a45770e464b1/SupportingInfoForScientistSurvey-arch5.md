# Supporting information for interpreting

## Overview
- Describes questionnaire surveys of British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge management (KM) methods in environment research.
- Aims to compare experiences and practices between the UK (with more KE experience) and China, potentially providing helpful insights.

## Data collection and participants
- Survey participants:
  - Chinese scientists: 27
  - British scientists: 16
  - Additional Chinese environmental scientists: 45 (responses gathered at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China)
- Recruitment and administration:
  - Voluntary participation
  - Surveys conducted during project meetings or via email circulation
  - ExtendedResponses collected Nov 2017 via emails
- Context:
  - Part of a joint international Critical Zone (CZ) project

## Sampling and scope
- Two counties surveyed to allow consideration of spatial variation in KE (knowledge/understanding) across environments
- Data intended to reflect cross-country perspectives within the CZ framework and broader Chinese environmental science community

## Data files and structure
- The dataset consists of 2 files:
  1. SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results from geo-scientists who attended the 2017 Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China)
  2. SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv (survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZ programme, including responses collected via email in Nov 2017)
- Additional metadata:
  - ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf (the questions used for the survey)
  - The two data files should be interpreted in conjunction with the questions in ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf

## Data type and units
- Nature and units: questionnaire data (survey responses)
- Data structure: two CSV files plus a separate metadata file with the questions

## Metadata and documentation
- Inclusion of the questions file (ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf) to enable interpretation of responses
- The dataset and metadata are organized to support understanding of KM practices and KE understandings across the surveyed populations

## Quality control
- Spatial variation considered by surveying two counties
- Data collection framed to enable cross-national comparison; representativeness may be limited by voluntary response and geographic scope

## Data use guidance and governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure alignment between SurveyScientists_* files and ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf to preserve context of each response
- Maintain clear provenance: document how respondents were recruited, timing (Nov 2017), and project context (CZ involvement)
- Consider representativeness and potential biases when sharing or reusing datasets (voluntary responses, two-county scope)
- Provide versioning and access notes, given the two related datasets and accompanying questions file
- Facilitate discoverability by cataloging datasets together (survey results, cross-country context, and the questions metadata) within data portals
- If integrating with other datasets, maintain consistent naming conventions and metadata mappings for variables corresponding to survey questions
