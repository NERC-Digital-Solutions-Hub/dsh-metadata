# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose: Questionnaire surveys were conducted with British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge exchange (KE) methods used in environment research; the UK is positioned as more experienced in KE, providing a basis for cross-cultural comparison with China.
- Study design: Focus on a joint international critical zone (CZ) project; included comparison to see if Chinese responses on the joint project reflect the wider Chinese environmental science community.
- Fieldwork and instrumentation: Not applicable (N/A).
- Data collection methods:
  - Primary survey participants: Chinese (n = 27) and British (n = 16) scientists associated with the CZ project, completed during project meetings or via email.
  - Extended sampling: An additional 45 Chinese environmental scientists surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China, to assess representativeness of the Chinese responses.
- Analytical methods: N/A.
- Calibration steps and values: N/A.
- Nature and units of recorded data: Questionnaire data.
- Quality control: Surveys conducted in two different counties to account for spatial variation in KE understanding.
- Data structure:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv: Responses from geoscientists who attended the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
  - SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv: Responses from Chinese and British scientists within the CZ programme, including email responses collected in November 2017.
- Additional metadata: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf (the survey questions) is included; data files should be interpreted in conjunction with these questions.
