# Supporting information for interpreting

## Purpose
- Explore KM (knowledge management) methods used in environment research by surveying British and Chinese scientists.
- Compare UK and China experiences to provide helpful insights for KE (knowledge exchange) in environmental science.

## Participants and sampling
- Joint international CZ (critical zone) project scientists:
  - Chinese: n = 27
  - British: n = 16
- Extended survey to additional Chinese environmental scientists (n = 45) via responses collected at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
- Aim to assess whether responses from the joint project reflect the wider Chinese environmental science community.

## Data collection methods
- Collection through: project meetings or via email circulation for the CZ project participants; conference responses for the extended Chinese sample.
- Time frame noted for extended responses: November 2017 (via emails).

## Data files and formats
- Dataset consists of 2 files:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results of geo-scientists at the 2017 Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China)
  - SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv (survey results of Chinese and British scientists from the CZO programme, including results collected via emails in Nov. 2017)
- Additional metadata: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf (the questions used in the survey). Data files 1 & 2 should be interpreted in reference to the questions in this file.

## Data content and variables
- Nature and units: Questionnaire data (responses to survey questions).
- Analytical methods and calibration: Not applicable (N/A) for this dataset.
- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation: Not applicable (N/A).

## Quality control
- Sampling included two different counties to assess spatial variation in KE understanding.

## Data structure and interpretation guidance
- Two CSV files provide the questionnaire responses; interpret them together with ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf.
- The data reflect respondents’ knowledge management and knowledge exchange understandings within environmental science contexts, enabling cross-country comparisons (UK vs. China) and within the CZ programme.

## Notes and cautions
- There are no described analytical methods or instrumentation; outputs are survey responses requiring interpretation against the question set provided in the metadata file.
