# Supporting information for interpreting

- Overview
  - Describes questionnaire-based surveys of British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge exchange (KE) methods in environmental research.
  - Aims to contrast UK experience with China to obtain helpful insights for interpreting KE in environment research.

- Data collection and sampling
  - Participants: Chinese scientists (initially n = 27) and British scientists (n = 16) from a joint international critical zone (CZ) project; additional 45 Chinese environmental scientists surveyed via responses from the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to assess representativeness.
  - Recruitment: Volunteers completed surveys during project meetings or circulated by email.
  - Scope: Extended sampling to gauge whether responses from the initial Chinese cohort represented the broader Chinese environmental science community.

- Data structure and files
  - The dataset comprises two CSV files:
    1) SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv — survey results from geo-scientists who attended the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
    2) SurveyScientists_ChinaUKinCZO.csv — survey results from Chinese and British scientists within the CZO programme, including responses collected via email in Nov 2017.
  - Additional metadata: ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf contains the survey questions; these questions should be referred to when interpreting the responses.

- Quality control and representativeness
  - Spatial consideration: Two different counties were surveyed to account for spatial variation in KE understanding.
  - Data nature: Questionnaire data; units are not specified beyond the survey responses themselves.

- Potential GIS usage and considerations
  - Opportunities to map responses by country and, where available, by county to analyze spatial variation in KE understanding.
  - Useful for cross-referencing survey results with existing spatial datasets on KE practices or environmental research networks.
  - Ensure alignment between questions (from the RTF) and response variables for accurate GIS visualization and analysis.

- Metadata and accessibility
  - Data and metadata are organized into two primary CSV files plus the accompanying questions document (RTF).
  - For interpretation and integration in GIS projects, refer to the two CSVs alongside ScientistSurveyQuestions.rtf to understand variable definitions.

- Limitations and cautions
  - Sample sizes are relatively small and not uniformly distributed across regions, which may affect generalizability.
  - Representativeness is partially addressed by the additional Chinese respondents from a conference, but caution is needed when extrapolating to broader populations.
