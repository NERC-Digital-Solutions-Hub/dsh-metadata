# Scientist survey:

## Respondent location
- Question asks if respondents are based in the UK, China, or Other (coded: 1=China, 2=UK, 3=Other).

## Prior knowledge transfer (KT) experience
- Question: Have you ever done any knowledge transfer to users (stakeholders such as policymakers, practitioners, or the public) during your research career?
- Response options: Yes or No.

## Types of knowledge transfer used
- If Yes to prior KT, indicate which types you have used: Traditional; Hybrid; Knowledge exchange (KE).

## Awareness of KE and coproduction
- Question: Before this presentation, had you heard of the term knowledge exchange and/or coproduction? (Yes/No)

## Examples of KT activities
- Prompt to provide examples of different KT activities, including:
  - Who you worked with (e.g., local government)
  - How you worked with them
  - What you produced (e.g., report, guidance)

## KT outputs produced
- Types of KT outputs you have produced (select all that apply): Policy briefing; Best practice guidance; Webinars; Training workshops; Farmer's guidance; Decision support tools; Technical report; Other.
- If Other selected, provide explanation.

## Development mode of outputs
- Question: Were these tools produced WITH end users (co-produced), FOR end users (hybrid/for end users), or not at all?
  - Options: WITH end users (co-produced); FOR end users (hybrid); No KT experience; I only produced scientific reports/papers which users then used on their own (traditional transfer).
- If applicable, provide comments.

## KT processes used
- Question: Which KT processes have you used to deliver KT? (Select all that apply)
  - No KT experience
  - Co-designed research questions to meet research and end-user goals
  - Co-produced KT outputs with end users
  - Ran participatory workshops to involve end users in creating outputs
  - Secondment in an end-user organisation to embed knowledge
  - Other
- If Other selected, provide explanation.

## Measuring KT success
- Question: In projects where KT activities occurred, has their success been measured? If yes, explain how (e.g., changes in farmer practices) and by whom (e.g., local government or your research team).

## Applicability of KE to a project
- Question: Do you think it will be possible to use a KE approach in this project? Options: Not applicable; Yes; No; Maybe.
- If applicable, explain why.

## Interest in KE concepts
- Question: If KE concepts were new to you before this talk, would you be interested in using a KE approach when working with end users on your research projects?
  - Options: Yes; No; Maybe; Not applicable if KE already used.
- If applicable, explain why.

## Final comments
- Open-ended space for any additional remarks relevant to KE/KE for end users.
