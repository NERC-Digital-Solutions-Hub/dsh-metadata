# Bore Hole monitoring

## Overview
- Divers equipped with barodivers were deployed across five boreholes at Tyn y Bryn farm to monitor water levels.
- Deployment began on 03/08/05, with subsequent relocations and reconfigurations to optimize data quality and temperature stability.
- Data consist of time-stamped water level measurements, adjusted for measurement reference points above ground and diver presence (when applicable).
- Records include frequent notes about diver status (in/out), readings during downloads, and occasional reliability concerns or instrument adjustments.

## Monitoring setup and devices
- Barodiver system used to measure water levels in boreholes.
- Boreholes and depths:
  - Borehole 1: 11.6 m total depth.
  - Borehole 2: 5.5 m total depth.
  - Borehole 3 (Bowl): 5.89 m total depth.
  - Borehole 4 (Above shelterbelt): 12.085 m total depth.
  - Borehole 5 (Below shelterbelt): approx. 7.75 m depth.
- Key operational notes:
  - 03/08/05: Divers installed in all relevant boreholes.
  - 09/08/05: Barodiver moved from borehole 1 to above the tree shelterbelt to achieve more stable temperature.
  - 03/03/08: Barodiver installed in Borehole 3; divers repeatedly downloaded/removed across holes; wires sometimes left in place after downloads.

## Borehole summaries

- Borehole 1 (Yellow cap)
  - Depth: 11.6 m
  - Typical water level readings cluster around mid-to-high 200s to low 400s cm (measured with point above ground considered for actual level).
  - Notable events: diver relocation to above shelterbelt on 09/08/05; ongoing monitoring with many updates through 2007; diver downloaded/removed on 03/03/08.

- Borehole 2
  - Depth: 5.5 m
  - Readings show water levels in the low tens to around 170 cm range after adjustments (actual level dependent on measurement point and diver status).
  - Notable events: frequent diver in/out; multiple download sessions concluding with diver removal on 03/03/08.

- Borehole 3 (Bowl)
  - Depth: 5.89 m
  - Measurements include periods with diver in/out and manual readings; barodiver installed at this borehole on 03/03/08.
  - Post-installation notes include continued monitoring and several data adjustments; several readings indicate significant adjustments when diver presence changes.
  - 17/04/07: Diver reinstalled below the shelterbelt after retrieval and reinstallation in the bowl borehole; 03/03/08: BaroDiver installed here.

- Borehole 4 (Above shelterbelt)
  - Depth: 12.085 m
  - Readings around 1140–1148 cm when adjusted (actual water level subtracted by 31 cm above ground); numerous entries show divers deployed/retrieved and pauses during readings.
  - 16/11/06: BaroDiver installed for testing; 03/03/08: Diver downloaded/removed, wire left in hole.

- Borehole 5 (Below shelterbelt)
  - Depth: ~7.75 m
  - Readings include values around 700–800 cm (with adjustments for above-ground reference) and higher values when diver statuses changed.
  - Notable events: concerns about diver reliability led to removal and reinstallation (e.g., 17/04/07), diver moved to Bowl borehole; 03/03/08: Diver downloaded/removed with wire left in hole.

## Data processing and quality notes
- Adjustments applied to readings to obtain actual water levels:
  - Subtracting the reference point above ground to convert from measured depth to actual water level.
  - Accounting for whether the diver is in or out of the borehole (diver in/out affects depth readings).
- Data quality considerations:
  - Readings sometimes disrupted by diver presence, mud, or diver reliability concerns.
  - Occasional “not possible to get a reading when diver was still in the bore hole” notes indicate data gaps during certain operations.
  - Divers moved between boreholes and occasionally removed for maintenance, affecting continuity.
  - Warnings to delete files after downloads and occasional “wire left in hole” notes highlight data management considerations.
- Data volume and structure:
  - Time-stamped measurements with GMT times, multiple entries per day during downloads, and frequent references to whether the diver was in or out.
  - Longitudinal dataset spanning Aug 2005 through at least Mar 2008 (with continued posts as of 2009 in some boreholes).

## End notes and status
- By March 2008, routine downloads/removals of divers were recorded, with some wires left in holes after removal.
- The dataset provides a rich time-series of borehole water levels across five locations, including metadata on diver status and procedural adjustments, enabling self-service analysis of groundwater dynamics with caveats about data gaps and instrument reliability.
