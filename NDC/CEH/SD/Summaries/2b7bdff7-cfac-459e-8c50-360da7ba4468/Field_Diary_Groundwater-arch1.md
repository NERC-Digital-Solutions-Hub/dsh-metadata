# Bore Hole monitoring

- Purpose and timeline
  - Groundwater monitoring using divers and a BaroDiver conducted at five boreholes near Tyn y Bryn farm.
  - Initial deployment: divers installed in the bowl borehole on 03/08/05, then moved to the borehole above the tree shelterbelt on 09/08/05 to achieve more stable temperatures.
  - BaroDiver introduced later; in particular, BaroDiver was installed in the bowl borehole on 03/03/08.

- Equipment and measurement approach
  - Devices used: divers (wire-following devices) and BaroDiver for continuous water level measurements.
  - Readings recorded with date/time stamps; some entries also provide “actual water level” values calculated by subtracting the measurement-point offset (typically 15 cm above ground, with variations noted in some entries).
  - Readings include whether a diver was in the borehole, diver status (in/out), and downstream notes about sampling frequency (e.g., sampling every 30 minutes during certain periods).
  - Diver/wire handling notes highlight occasional reliability issues, readings when divers were in place, and explicit warnings to delete or manage data files after downloads.

- Borehole summaries
  - Borehole 1 (11.6 m depth)
    - Frequent measurements from 03/08/05 through early 2007; readings range roughly from the mid-180s cm to the mid-300s cm.
    - Reading adjustments often applied to obtain actual water level due to offset from ground level.
    - Diver remained in use until 03/03/08 when the diver was downloaded/removed.
  - Borehole 2 (5.5 m depth)
    - Measurements recorded from 03/08/05 through 03/03/08; readings span roughly from the 60–130 cm range to around 170 cm in some periods (actual values depend on offset and diver in/out).
    - Notable data quality issue: a jump of about 10 cm in diver readings observed between downloads; sporadic notes on diver reliability leading to adjustments.
    - Diver downloaded/removed on 03/03/08; wire left in the hole.
  - Borehole 3 (Bowl, 5.89 m)
    - Initial readings around 180–200 cm in 2005, with values decreasing to around 120–180 cm over 2006–2007 entries (subject to offset corrections).
    - BaroDiver introduced during 2006–2007 testing; multiple diver in/out events and a significant reconfiguration in 2007 (diver moved, reinstalled, and soon after BaroDiver activity).
    - On 03/03/08, BaroDiver installed in this borehole; diver data continued to be downloaded/managed.
  - Borehole 4 (Above shelterbelt, 12.085 m)
    - Long sequence of readings around 1100–1140 cm; numerous entries indicating no reading when the diver was in the borehole.
    - BaroDiver installed around 16/11/06 for testing; readings continued through early 2007.
    - Final notes indicate diver data downloaded/removed on 03/03/08 with wire left in the hole.
  - Borehole 5 (Below shelterbelt)
    - Readings show water levels around 700–800 cm early on, with later values in the 600–750 cm range; occasional references to diver status and data reliability concerns.
    - Diver reliability issues noted (e.g., 15/08/07 clamp issues, 19/09/07 diver removal, 02/10/07 reinstallation).
    - Diver downloaded and reinstalled on multiple occasions; by 03/03/08, readings indicate the diver was downloaded/removed and the wire left in the hole.

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations
  - Common challenges include lack of data at the right local scale, diver reliability, and readings that depend on whether the diver is in the borehole.
  - Measurements often require offset corrections due to the measurement point being above ground; actual water levels are derived values in several entries.
  - Occasional notes of data gaps when divers were in place or readings could not be obtained, as well as mentions of muddy or dirty diver conditions affecting data.
  - Instances of data management concerns, such as “jump in diver values” between downloads and explicit reminders to delete old diver data after downloads.

- Key procedural and metadata notes
  - Measurement points and offsets varied, with many entries indicating a 15 cm offset above ground (and some entries noting different offsets, such as 13 cm or other values).
  - Downloading, removing, and re-installation of divers were routine parts of the workflow, with occasional notes about wires left in holes and reinstallation of divers following maintenance or reliability checks.
  - By March 2008, BaroDiver activity and routine data handling continued, with the latest notes indicating divers were downloaded/removed and wires left in the boreholes.
