# Pontbren Database Catalogue

## Overview of this document chunk
- Contains detailed Equipment & Methods sections focused on borehole logging and groundwater probing.
- Includes site-specific borehole logs (NP20–NP23) for N-probe manipulation plots at Llanfair Caereinion, with S3 (eastern, central, western) site delineations and multiple N-probe locations.
- Provides two example N-probe borehole logs with grid references, datums, layer descriptions, thicknesses, depths, and completion details.
- Documents field equipment and procedures (hand auger, AQ drill rod, pneumatic hammer, air flush rotary drill) and site metadata (site names, grid references, datum levels, dates).
- Includes Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites with flow metered spot measurements (times, start/finish timestamps, flow estimates in litres per second) across multiple sites.

## Borehole logs and N-probe data (Site S3 and nearby)

  - Each borehole log includes thickness, depth to base of layer, description, and sample intervals (e.g., 0.25 m, 0.60 m, 1.05 m).
  - Documented completions and samples (e.g., Samples 0.80–1.60 m; Samples 1.20–1.55 m).
  - Dates of borehole work: 14/05/06, with repeated sheets for multiple NP boreholes.
- Provenance and commissioning
  - Borehole work carried out for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
  - Ground level and datum references standardized across logs.
- Site-specific notes
  - Multiple манipulation plot sites (NP20–NP23) with distinct log sheets and site descriptors (e.g., edge of wood, N-probe at Tyn y Fron, Trees).

## Equipment, methods, and data lineage
- Equipment and methods emphasis
  - Hand auger, AQ drill rod/guide tube, pneumatic hammer, Atlas Copco RAB/Leopard air flush/rotary drills.
  - Completion tubing: 16 gauge aluminium, 44.5 mm diameter.
- Ground and groundwater focus
  - Logs reflect shallow groundwater probing at defined depths with precise layer descriptions and thicknesses.
- Documentation style
  - Repeated boilerplate entries indicate systematic data capture across multiple boreholes and plots, with consistent formatting for depth, description, and completion data.
- Data provenance
  - Carried out for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; contractor: Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd.
  - Clear linkage between borehole data and N-probe manipulation plots, enabling cross-site hydrological interpretation.

## Appendix D: Streamflow gauging and flow measurements
- Flow measurement approach
  - Flow metered spot measurements accompanying streamflow gauging sites.
  - Start and finish timestamps with corresponding flow estimates (litres per second).
- Data coverage
  - Extensive list of measurements across multiple sites (e.g., Site 10, Site 8, Site 7, Site 6, Site 9, Site 13, Site 4, Site 3, Site 2, Site 1) and numerous dates in 2005–2009 range.
- Data characteristics
  - Flows span wide range from very low (near 0.0 l/s) to hundreds or thousands of l/s (e.g., several entries above 900 l/s, up to ~1500–1600 l/s in some cases).
  - Some entries show multiple readings within short intervals (e.g., 15–20 minute windows) or grouped readings (1 = reading 1, 2 = reading 2).
- Data quality and notes
  - The table sections include both flow estimates and exact metered times; some gaps and partial entries indicate variability in measurement completeness.
- Use cases for data leaders
  - Enables calibration and validation of Starflow or other stage/velocity-derived flow estimates against spot measurements.
  - Provides a time-resolved basis for hydrological analysis across multiple catchment sites.

## Implications for data strategy and stewardship (from this chunk)
- Metadata completeness
  - Borehole logs require consistent metadata (grid references, datum, site descriptors, equipment details) to ensure provenance and cross-site synthesis.
- Data standardization
  - Uniform formats for depth, layer thickness, descriptions, and sampling intervals are essential to integrate logs across NP boreholes and sites.
- Provenance and QA
  - Clear documentation of constructors (who carried out work, when, and for which organization) supports data trust and reuse.
- Integration with hydrological data
  - Streamflow measurements should be reconciled with continuous flow estimates via standardized calibration references and site-specific notes.
- Data discoverability and governance
  - The dispersed borehole logs and measurement tables highlight the need for centralized indexing, consistent QA codes, and a unified portal to improve discoverability and cross-site analyses.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders
- The Pontbren Database Catalogue segment provides a comprehensive view of shallow groundwater characterization through detailed borehole logs, site-specific manipulations, and a robust set of spot streamflow measurements.
- Data are richly described but dispersed across multiple boreholes, plots, and measurement registers, necessitating strong metadata governance, standardized formats, and centralized access to enable rapid discovery and cross-site analysis.
- Ensuring consistent calibration parameters, units, and datum alignment across sites will support effective data stewardship and evidence-based decision-making in data-driven initiatives.
