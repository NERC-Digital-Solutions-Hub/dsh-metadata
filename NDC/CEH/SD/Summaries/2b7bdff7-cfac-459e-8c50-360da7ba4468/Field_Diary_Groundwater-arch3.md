# Bore Hole monitoring

## Overview
- Field monitoring of groundwater levels at Tyn y Bryn farm using divers and barodivers across five boreholes.
- Goals: obtain accurate, temperature-stable water level readings; document installation, movement of sensors, and data processing steps; inform data quality and governance for monitoring frameworks.

## Borehole details
- Borehole 1 (Total depth 11.6 m): initial barodiver placed in the bowl borehole, later moved to the borehole above the tree shelterbelt (09/08/05).
- Borehole 2 (Total depth 5.5 m): multiple water level measurements recorded; diver usage noted.
- Borehole 3 (Bowl, total depth 5.89 m): extensive diver activity; barodiver installed in 03/03/08; readings include diver in/out states and frequent downgrading/adjustments.
- Borehole 4 (Above shelterbelt, total depth 1208.5 cm / 12.085 m): numerous readings; diver downloads and various diver/downtime events; attempts to obtain readings when diver is in/out; many notes about readings and diver status.
- Borehole 5 (Below shelterbelt): long sequence of water level readings with diver-in/out notes and several maintenance events; occasional issues with diver reliability and data integrity noted.

## Data collection methods and instruments
- Instruments: divers and barodivers used to measure water levels; readings logged with GMT timestamps.
- Measurement approach: water level measured relative to a point above ground level; actual water level adjusted by subtracting this offset (e.g., measuring point above ground level varies between 9–31 cm, 15 cm, 30 cm, etc.).
- Data recorded: dates, times, water levels (in cm), diver status (in/out), notes on diver condition, and occasional manual dips or sensor relocations.
- Data processing steps: conversions to actual water level using specified offsets; notes on diver depth adjustments (e.g., “w/o diver” readings, diver depth changes), and occasional manual readings to verify readings.

## Timeline of key events and procedures
- 03/08/2005: Divers installed across boreholes; initial water level measurements begin.
- 09/08/2005: Barodiver installed in Borehole 1 (above shelterbelt) to enhance temperature stability.
- 2006–2007: Ongoing monthly downloads; numerous adjustments to diver placement, wire lengths, and measurement practices; various maintenance events (diver cleaning, wiring adjustments, diver replacement).
- 01/02/2007–03/03/2008: Continued data collection with frequent notes on reading conditions, diver reliability, and data adjustments (including “diver reset to sample every 30 minutes” in several instances; “diver downloaded then removed; wire left in hole” in others).

## Data quality, metadata, and governance considerations
- Data quality challenges: occasional inability to read when divers were in boreholes; diver reliability issues (dirty divers, unexpected jumps in readings, calibration concerns); significant effort required to transform raw dive data into usable water level measurements.
- Metadata and data management: extensive inline metadata within the log (dates, GMT times, dive status, actual water level calculations, offsets used, and notes on diver conditions); necessity for clear, standardized metadata to enable cross-hole comparability and dataset integrity.
- Data governance relevance: demonstrates the importance of documenting data sources, sensor movements, and transformation rules; highlights barriers such as ensuring timely data access, maintaining metadata quality, and keeping datasets up to date.

## Key takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- Use of multiple sensing technologies (divers and barodivers) can improve measurement reliability but requires rigorous metadata, calibration notes, and movement logs.
- Transparent data transformations (offsets from measuring points to actual water level) must be consistently applied and documented.
- Proactive maintenance and clear recording of diver status, sensor relocations, and data integrity issues are crucial for data quality and governance.
- Expect and plan for data gaps and instrument reliability issues; build in procedures for verification (manual dips, cross-checks) and versioned data handling.

## Conclusion
- The document provides a comprehensive field log of borehole water level monitoring using divers and barodivers across five boreholes, detailing installation histories, measurement procedures, data processing steps, maintenance, and challenges that impact data quality and governance.
