# Equipment & Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - Documentation of borehole logging and N-probe installation methodology for manipulation plots at the Llanfair Caereinion site, including NP20–NP23 boreholes across Site S3 (three sub-sites: 3.1 easternmost, 3.2 central, 3.3 westernmost).
  - Records prepared for Centre for Ecology and Hydrology; data support groundwater and soil investigations.

- Sites, locations, and identifiers
  - Site: PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN LLANFAIR CAEREINION; N-probe manipulation plots across Site S3 (3.1, 3.2, 3.3).
  - Grid references:
    - NP20 (3.1): SJ 07360 06833
    - NP21 (3.2): SJ 07341 06821
    - NP22 (3.3): SJ 07323 06807
  - Each borehole entry includes N-probe designation (NP20–NP23), with separate logs for each site and sub-site.

- Instrumentation and drilling methods
  - Primary equipment: hand auger with AQ drill rod/guide tube; pneumatic hammer; Atlas Copco RAB hand-held air flush rotary drill; Atlas Copco Leopard rotary/percussive air flush drill (as applicable per borehole).
  - Borehole construction: completion tubing using 16-gauge, 44.5 mm aluminium access tubing.
  - Logging approach: borehole logs capturing lithology, thickness of layers, depth to interfaces, groundwater status, and datum levels; logs note water presence (e.g., Water Not struck) and soil descriptions.

- Data captured in borehole logs
  - For each NP borehole: grid reference, datum level, thickness of each interval, depth (mBGL), ground level, soil descriptions (color, texture, mottling, composition), and depth to transitions between lithologies.
  - Notable lithologies documented: dark yellow brown silty clay; soft to stiff clays with mottling; gravelly/clayey clays; presence of sandstone/mudstone fragments in some intervals.
  - Observations on groundwater: entries frequently indicate Water Not struck within logged intervals.
  - Samples: documented depths for sample collection (e.g., 0.80–1.60 m; 1.20–1.55 m, etc.).
  - Dates and provenance: dates such as 14/05/06 repeatedly noted; logging conducted by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd; logs reference CEH as the project client.

  - Site/sub-site label (3.1 Site S3 easternmost; 3.2 Site S3 central; 3.3 Site S3 westernmost)
  - Grid Reference; Datum level; Depth mBGL; Thickness
  - Soil description (colour, texture, mottling)
  - Completion tubing details (16 gauge aluminium, 44.5 mm)
  - Samples (depth ranges)
  - Water status (e.g., Water Not struck)
  - Date of logging; Logging contractor (Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd)
  - Notes on rock fragments and lithological transitions

- Specific observations by borehole
  - NP20 (3.1): multiple lithologies described across depths, including silty clays and clays with mottling; distinctive layers culminating in completion tubing; several depth intervals with sample references.
  - NP21 (3.2): similar multi-layer sequence with detailed lithology changes; notes of mottling, clays, and gravelly clay; presence of sandstone/mudstone fragments in deeper intervals; samples and depths documented.
  - NP22 (3.3): detailed sequence from humic topsoil to silty/clayey layers, including mottling; several depths with soft to stiff clay and gravelly clay; includes rock fragments and groundwater-related notes; completion tubing specified.
  - NP23: additional groundwater logging note with topsoil and deeper stiff clay/silty clay intervals; includes samples and 0.25–1.50 m depth ranges; details aligned with CEH logging.

- Data provenance and quality indicators
  - Contractor attribution: Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd; notes indicate CEH project involvement.
  - Metadata consistency cues: grid references, datum levels, depth measurements, and lithology descriptors are consistently recorded across boreholes.
  - Quality considerations: presence of varied lithologies and moisture states; some intervals described as “not struck” water; logs include detailed lithology notes and sample depths to support reproducibility.

- Additional data context (Appendix D)
  - Included is a separate section (Appendix D) detailing streamflow gauging sites with flow metered spot measurements.
  - Recorded fields include start/finish times and flow meter estimates, illustrating integration of borehole/groundwater data with surface hydrology measurements for comprehensive dataset governance.

- Governance implications for Data Stewards
  - Emphasizes the need for complete, standardized borehole metadata: consistent site naming, precise grid references, uniform depth units (mBGL), consistent lithology descriptors, and explicit groundwater status flags.
  - Critical to capture provenance: contractor identity, logging date, and CEH involvement to support traceability and data lineage.
  - Metadata should link borehole logs to broader datasets (soil moisture, groundwater, and streamflow data) to enable integrated analyses.
  - Ensure data quality flags and notes accompany the records (e.g., “Water Not struck,” lithology transitions, sample depths) to guide reuse and interpretation.

- Practical takeaway for reuse
  - This dataset provides detailed borehole lithology sequences, depth intervals, and sampling points essential for groundwater and soil studies.
  - Data should be harmonized with the rest of the Pontbren/related catalogues by aligning field names, units, and coordinate references to facilitate discovery, discovery lineage, and reliable reuse in governance contexts.
