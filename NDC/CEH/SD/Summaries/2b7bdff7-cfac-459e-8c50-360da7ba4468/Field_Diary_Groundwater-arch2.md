# Bore Hole monitoring

## Overview
- Longitudinal groundwater monitoring at Tyn y Bryn farm using divers and barodivers across five boreholes (Borehole 1–5), starting 03/08/05.
- Purpose: document water levels over time for environmental health and policy monitoring; standardised data collection and reporting formats.
- Method: regular water level readings with diver/barodiver equipment; readings adjusted to account for measurement point above ground; data logged with GMT timestamps.
- Key challenges: reliability and consistency of divers, readings with diver in/out, mud/contamination, occasional jumps between downloads, and occasional equipment issues (e.g., wire left in hole, diver removal/reinstallation).

## Monitoring setup and timeline
- Initial installations (03/08/05–09/08/05): divers installed at multiple boreholes; in Bowl borehole (Borehole 3) a barodiver was installed later in the borehole above the shelterbelt to improve temperature stability.
- Ongoing data collection through 2005–2007 with regular downloads, manual readings, and occasional adjustments to sampling (e.g., every 30 minutes).
- 03/03/08: Baro diver installed in Borehole 3 (Bowl) indicating a shift to barodiver measurements in that location.
- Across boreholes, measurements frequently note:
  - Total hole depths (Boreholes 1–5 depths listed)
  - Water levels at specific GMT times
  - Actual water level calculations subtracting the measuring point above ground (commonly 15 cm, sometimes 30–31 cm)
  - Instances when diver was in/out of the hole, affecting readings
  - Occasional data quality notes (diver dirty, reading not possible, manual readings used)

## Borehole summaries

- Borehole 1 (depth ~11.6 m)
  - Water level readings range from ~225 cm (03/08/05) to ~317–344 cm (early 2006) and up to ~360 cm (late 2006).
  - Corrections account for measuring point height, yielding actual water level values around 274–344 cm in 2006.
  - 03/03/08 onward: diver operations noted; diver downloaded and eventually removed.

- Borehole 2 (depth ~5.5 m)
  - Early readings ~116.5–125.5 cm (08/2005); later readings show higher water levels around 60–100 cm after correction (e.g., 1/2007 onward, several entries show subtractions to reflect actual depths).
  - Frequency of updates includes multiple monthly downloads; divers noted as dirty at times; occasional jumps (e.g., 10 cm) between downloads.
  - 03/03/08: diver operations noted; diver removed for reliability checks.

- Borehole 3 (Bowl; depth ~5.89 m)
  - Water levels around 196.5 cm in Aug 2005; values fluctuate through 2005–2007 (roughly 179–212 cm with diver adjustments).
  - Notable events: multiple diver movements and readjustments; barodiver installed in March 2008.
  - Several entries document manual readings and diver positioning (in/out), with occasional “diver installed” and “reinstalled” notes.

- Borehole 4 (Above shelterbelt; depth ~12.08 m)
  - Readings initially around 1142.5 cm (Aug 2005), with subsequent readings around 1146–1152 cm; actual water level corrections indicate values around 1117–1138 cm depending on date.
  - Frequent notes about readings being impossible when the diver was in the borehole; diver positioning and diver-difference corrections (e.g., 31 cm above ground, 30 cm above ground).
  - 2006–2007: continued monitoring with periodic data downloads; several entries noting “diver in” or “diver out” affecting calculated depths.

- Borehole 5 (Below shelterbelt; depth around 7–8 m)
  - Water levels reported from ~775 cm down to ~650–724 cm, with actual corrected water levels around 689–766 cm depending on date and measuring point height.
  - Several entries document diver in/out, with notes about reliability concerns and subsequent adjustments (including moving the diver to Bowl borehole to test).
  - 01/02/2007 onward: notes include suspicions about diver reliability, diver removal, and relocation of logging equipment (e.g., below shelterbelt logger moved to bowl borehole).

## Data collection methods and changes
- Equipment:
  - Divers and barodivers installed at various boreholes; some readings required manual adjustments when divers were in/out or readings were otherwise impeded.
  - Barodiver deployment progressed (e.g., Baro diver installed in Borehole 3 on 03/03/08).
- Data handling:
  - Readings logged with GMT timestamps; measurement points above ground varied by borehole (commonly 15 cm; sometimes 30–31 cm).
  - Water level values reported as depth from ground level, with actual water level computed by subtracting the measurement point height.
  - During some periods, data collection shifted to increased sampling frequency (e.g., every 30 minutes) and included explicit notes on diver status and data quality.
- Quality and reliability notes:
  - Frequent comments on “diver dirty,” maintenance needs, and reliability concerns prompting reinstallation or relocation of divers.
  - Occasional “jump of almost 10 cm” between downloads; some readings not possible when diver was in the borehole.
  - Equipment issues such as wires left in holes or clamps and connectors requiring adjustment.

## Key findings and challenges for environmental monitoring
- The monitoring program produced a dense time-series of groundwater levels across five boreholes with multiple measurement strategies (divers, barodivers) and frequent equipment interventions.
- Data quality challenges included diver reliability, readings affected by diver position, mud/dirt affecting sensors, and occasional data gaps due to equipment handling.
- The use of barodivers in Borehole 3 (Bowl) from 2008 onward indicates an emphasis on improving data accuracy and temperature stability in at least one borehole.
- Consistency in datum (measurement point above ground) and standardised reporting were necessary to enable reliable cross-borehole comparisons and trend analyses.
- There is an explicit objective to enhance data value by potentially integrating these datasets with other environmental data sources and improving data accessibility for broader analysis.

## Data quality, accessibility, and next steps
- Ensure standardized metadata for each borehole (depth, measuring point height, sampling interval, diver status).
- Maintain and document diver deployment history, calibration, and data processing steps to support reproducibility.
- Address data gaps and outliers (e.g., 10 cm jumps) via calibration checks or sensor replacement.
- Improve data accessibility by storing datasets in centralized portals and enabling access for downstream analyses and policy evaluation.
- Consider integrating groundwater level data with other environmental datasets to support broader environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
