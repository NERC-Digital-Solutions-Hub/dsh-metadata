# Pontbren Database Catalogue

- This text fragment covers Equipment & Methods and Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites with flow metered measurements.

- Documents groundwater monitoring activities at multiple N-probe sites (NP20–NP23) across Site S3 (Easternmost, Central, Westernmost) and other nearby locations (e.g., PEN-TAL-Y-CEIN LLANFAIR CAEREINION; COED CWM-Y-LLWYNOG LLANFAIR CAEREINION).

- Data provenance is provided by Groundwater Monitoring and Drilling Ltd for the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).

- Contains detailed borehole logs (BOREHOLE LOG) including site location, grid references, datum level, depth to various layers, soil descriptions, thicknesses, and completion details.

- Documents the instrumentation and methods used to drill and log boreholes, including hand augers, AQ drill rods/guide tubes, pneumatic hammers, Atlas Copco RAB and Leopard rotary/percussive drills, and aluminium access tubing (16 gauge, 44.5 mm diameter).

- Records site-specific soil profiles and lithologies (e.g., silty clays, clays with mottling, gravelly clay, sandstone/gravel beds, boulders) with depth intervals and sample depths (e.g., 0.25 m to ~1.60 m; various thicknesses).

- Some boreholes indicate “Water Not struck,” showing variability in groundwater encounter across layers and sites.

- Appendix D provides streamflow gauging data with flow metered spot measurements, including start/finish times and flow estimates (liters per second) for numerous sites (e.g., Sites 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, etc) across multiple dates (e.g., 2005–2009), reflecting time-resolved discharge measurements.

- The dataset includes site-specific metadata such as grid references (e.g., SJ 07360 06833; SJ 07341 06821; SJ 07426 06920), datum levels, and depth-to-groundwater observations.

- The documentation emphasizes standardized QA and data provenance through explicit borehole logging, site coordinates, and date stamps, supporting policy scrutiny and future data governance.

- Overall, the material illustrates a meticulous approach to collecting, documenting, and sharing groundwater and surface flow data within a monitoring framework.
