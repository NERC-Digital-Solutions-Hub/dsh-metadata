# Experimental Design

## Aim
- Conduct cross-sectional observations to assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on commensal bacteria in poultry gastrointestinal tracts.
- Capture hygiene practices and interactions in three settings: rural domestic households, small/medium poultry farms, and urban markets handling poultry and waste.
- Record hygiene and biosecurity behaviors around exposure to poultry or poultry waste to understand environmental contamination and transmission potential.

## Study setting and sample
- Locations: five rural households in Mirzapur, Tangail district; five small/medium poultry farms in Mirzapur; five market stalls in urban Dhaka markets.
- Formative research design with no predefined effect size or sample size calculation.

## Data collection methods
- Conducted by trained researchers from the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).
- Observers: female in households; male in farms and markets.
- Timeframe: February–June 2017.
- Data captured using structured observation forms designed for each setting.
- Each setting observed in two sessions of three hours on the same day, with observers positioned differently between sessions to maximize event capture.
- Sessions occur in fixed time slots to represent different parts of the day:
  - Early morning (≈0600–0900)
  - Afternoon (≈1200–1500)
  - Evening (≈1500–1800)

## Observation timing and design
- Repeat observations conducted on the subsequent day for a sub-sample:
  - Two rural homesteads, two urban farms, two urban markets.
- Events categorized to analyze potential transmission and exposure routes.

## Observed events and data captured
- Transmission events: handwashing before eating/drinking, disposal of waste materials.
- Exposure events: contact with poultry, poultry bedding, poultry manure, poultry meat, or other poultry-derived materials.
- For each event recorded:
  - Whether handwashing occurred before/after the event.
  - Whether one hand or both hands were washed.
  - Soap use or no soap.
  - Method of hand-drying.
  - Handwashing before eating, drinking, or feeding a child.
- Additional hygiene/biosecurity measures documented:
  - Use of protective clothing (gloves, boots, face mask).
  - Washing of tools and equipment.
  - Safe disposal of waste.

## Ethical considerations
- Written informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw at any stage.
- Ethical clearance: ICDDR,B PR16071 and Loughborough University R17-P037.

## Quality control
- Real-time data entry on structured tools; Excel data entry by trained staff.
- Random checks against original data collection sheets by an independent researcher.
- Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.

## Data structure and documentation
- Three CSV files comprise the dataset:
  - observationsrural.csv
  - observationsfarms.csv
  - observationsmarkets.csv
- Blank cells indicate data not recorded.
- Supporting documentation with variable lists:
  - Variablelistrural.rtf
  - Variablelistfarms.rtf
  - Variablelistmarkets.rtf

## GIS relevance and potential uses
- Data are collected in settings with identifiable locations, enabling integration with spatial datasets.
- Suitable for mapping/hypothesis testing of hygiene practices and exposure events across rural, farm, and urban environments.
- Requires data cleaning and harmonization due to multiple files and missing values; careful handling of time-slot and setting identifiers for spatial analysis.
