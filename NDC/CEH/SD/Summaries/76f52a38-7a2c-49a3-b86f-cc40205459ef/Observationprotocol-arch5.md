# Experimental Design

## Aim
- Assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on commensal bacteria from poultry GI tracts.
- Record hygiene practices before and after exposure to poultry or poultry-waste to understand environmental contamination and transmission pathways.
- Cover rural domestic settings, small-to-medium scale poultry farms, and urban live-poultry markets.
- Obtain informed consent and allow withdrawal; ethical clearances obtained.

## Study Design and Setting
- Cross-sectional observations conducted to document human-poultry interactions and related hygiene behaviours.
- Settings and samples:
  - Rural households: 5
  - Poultry farms: 5
  - Urban live-poultry markets: 5
- Formative research; no predefined effect size or sample size calculation.
- Observations conducted Feb–June 2017 by icddr,b researchers.
- Two sessions per setting per day (each 3 hours) at different times (early morning, midday, or evening) to capture varied behaviours.
- Sub-sample repeat observations on the following day for comparison (two rural households, two farms, two markets).
- Events categorized as transmission events (e.g., handwashing before eating) or exposure events (e.g., contact with poultry, waste). Data captured include whether handwashing occurred, method (soap, drying), and other biosecurity practices (protective clothing, tool washing, waste disposal).

## Sample/Participants
- Participants: individuals in 5 rural households, 5 poultry farms, and 5 urban markets.
- Informed consent obtained in writing; right to withdraw retained.
- Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data Collection Methods
- Data collectors: trained female observers in households; trained male observers in farms and markets.
- Real-time data recording using structured observation tools adapted from prior instruments.
- Data entry into Excel by trained staff.
- Observation logistics: fixed time slots across different times of day; observer repositioning to maximise captured events; two daily observation sessions per setting.

## Quality Control
- Real-time data entry with structured tools; independent random checks against original data collection sheets.
- Frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values, with corrections applied as needed.

## Data Structure and Files
- Three CSV data files:
  - observationsrural.csv
  - observationsfarms.csv
  - observationsmarkets.csv
- Blank cells indicate missing data.
- Supporting documentation detailing data structure:
  - VariableList rural (Variablelistrural.rtf)
  - VariableList farms (Variablelistfarms.rtf)
  - VariableList markets (Variablelistmarkets.rtf)

## Documentation and Metadata
- Structured observation forms aligned with each setting to capture relevant events and hygiene behaviours.
- Data capture and structure designed to support subsequent analysis of handwashing, protective measures, and waste management as related to potential transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
- Clear labeling of datasets and accompanying metadata aids discovery and reuse, aligning with data governance and stewardship practices.
