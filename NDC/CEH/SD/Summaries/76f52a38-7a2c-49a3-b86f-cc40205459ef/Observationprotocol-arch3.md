# Experimental Design

- Aim
  - Assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on commensal bacteria from the poultry gastrointestinal tract.
  - Examine hygiene practices before and after exposure to poultry or poultry waste that could contribute to environmental contamination or transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from animals to humans.
  - Contexts include rural households, small/medium poultry farms, and urban live-poultry markets.

- Study setting and population
  - 5 rural villages in Mirzapur, Tangail district (one household per village; n=5).
  - 5 small-to-medium commercial poultry farms in Mirzapur (n=5).
  - 5 market stalls selling live poultry in urban Dhaka (n=5).

- Design and timing
  - Cross-sectional observational study.
  - Two sessions of structured observations per unit on the same day, each lasting three hours, at different times of day (early morning, midday, or evening) to capture varied behaviors.
  - Repeat observations on the subsequent day for a sub-sample (two rural homesteads, two urban farms, two urban markets) to compare day-to-day behavior.

- Data collection methods
  - Observations conducted by trained researchers from icddr,b; data recorded on structured forms.
  - Separate observer teams: female observers in households; male observers in farms and urban markets.
  - Documentation of events categorized as transmission events (e.g., handwashing before eating/drinking, disposal of waste) or exposure events (e.g., contact with poultry, bedding, manure, meat).
  - For each event, captured details on handwashing (timing, number of hands washed, soap use, drying method) and additional hygiene measures (protective clothing, tool washing, waste disposal practices).

- Ethical considerations
  - Written informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw at any time.
  - Ethical clearance: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

- Sampling and sample size
  - Formative, exploratory design with no a priori sample size calculation; no expected size effects.
  - Units: 5 households, 5 farms, 5 markets (total n=15 units).

- Data management and structure
  - Real-time data entry using structured observation tools; data entered into Excel by trained staff.
  - Quality control: random checks against original data sheets by an independent researcher; frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range values.
  - Data files: three CSV files — observationsrural.csv, observationsfarms.csv, observationsmarkets.csv.
  - Metadata and variable definitions provided in separate documentation (VariableList rural/farms/markets).
  - Blank cells indicate missing data.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks and data governance
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to capturing behavioral and exposure-related measures relevant to environmental health monitoring.
  - Includes explicit definitions of transmission vs exposure events and quantifiable hygiene practices, useful for developing indicators and dashboards.
  - Highlights practical data governance considerations: real-time data capture, data quality checks, and the need for comprehensive metadata to enable verification and reuse.
  - Reflects potential barriers noted by monitoring-framework authors: data standardization, interoperability across settings, and ensuring data sharing while maintaining quality and context.
