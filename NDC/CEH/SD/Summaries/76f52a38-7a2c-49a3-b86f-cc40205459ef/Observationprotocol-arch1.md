# Experimental Design

- Cross-sectional observations to assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on commensal bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract.
- Settings include rural domestic environments, small-to-medium scale poultry farms, and urban live-poultry markets in Dhaka.
- Aims to record hygiene practices before and after exposure to poultry or poultry-waste, to understand environmental contamination and potential transmission pathways.

## Study design and sampling

- Formative cross-sectional design with no predefined size effect; no formal sample size calculation.
- Sample strata:
  - Rural households: one household from each of five villages in Mirzapur, Tangail district (n=5).
  - Poultry farms: five small-to-medium commercial farms in Mirzapur (n=5).
  - Urban markets: five market stalls selling live poultry in Dhaka (n=5).
- Total units observed: 15 (5 households, 5 farms, 5 markets).
- Two observation sessions per setting on the same day (each three hours) to maximize observed events.
- Sub-sample repeat observations on the subsequent day (two rural homesteads, two urban farms, two markets) for day-to-day comparisons.

## Data collection methods

- Conducted by icddr,b researchers; female observers in households, male observers in farms and markets.
- Observation windows:
  - Early morning (0600–0900)
  - Afternoon (1200–1500)
  - Evening (1500–1800)
- Two sessions per day with repositioning of the observer to capture different events.
- Events recorded as:
  - Transmission events (e.g., handwashing before/after exposure, waste disposal)
  - Exposure events (e.g., contact with poultry, poultry bedding, manure, meat, or other materials)
- For each event, recorded:
  - Handwashing timing (before/after event)
  - Handwashing scope (one hand or both hands)
  - Soap use (yes/no)
  - Drying method (e.g., towel, air)
- Additional hygiene and biosecurity observations:
  - Use of protective clothing (gloves, boots, masks)
  - Washing of tools/equipment
  - Safe disposal of waste
- Data collected alongside handwashing behavior related to eating or feeding a child.
