# Experimental Design

## Aim
- Assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on hygiene practices before and after exposure to poultry or poultry waste.
- Explore pathways of environmental contamination and human transmission from animals to people in rural households, small-to-medium poultry farms, and urban live-poultry markets.

## Setting and Sampling
- Study sites: five rural households, five small-to-medium poultry farms, and five urban live-poultry market stalls in Bangladesh (Mirzapur, Tangail district, and Dhaka).
- Formative research design with no predefined sample size effect or calculation.

## Data Collection Methods
- Observers: trained female researchers in households; trained male researchers in farms and markets.
- Timeframe: February to June 2017.
- Sessions: two 3-hour observation sessions per setting on the same day; observer positions varied between sessions to capture more event types.
- Time slots: early morning, afternoon, or evening to capture different daily behaviors.
- Repeat observations: on the subsequent day for a sub-sample (two rural homes, two urban farms, two markets) to compare behavior across days.

## Observational Protocol
- Events categorized as:
  - Transmission events: handwashing before eating/drinking, disposal of waste, etc.
  - Exposure events: contact with poultry, poultry bedding, manure, meat, or other poultry-derived materials.
- For each event, record:
  - Whether handwashing occurred before/after the event.
  - Which hands were washed (one or both), use of soap, and drying method.
  - Handwashing before eating, drinking, or feeding a child.
- Additional hygiene/biosecurity measures observed: use of protective clothing (gloves, boots, masks), washing of tools/equipment, and safe waste disposal.

## Ethics
- Written informed consent obtained from participants, with right to withdraw at any time.
- Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data Handling and Quality Control
- Data capture: real-time recording on structured observation tools adapted from established instruments.
- Data entry: Excel spreadsheets by trained staff.
- Quality checks:
  - Random audits comparing entries with original data sheets by an independent researcher.
  - Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.

## Data Structure and Accessibility
- Datasets: three CSV files—observationsrural.csv, observationsfarms.csv, observationsmarkets.csv.
- Missing data: blank cells indicate no data recorded.
- Supporting documentation with data dictionaries: Variablelistrural.rtf, Variablelistfarms.rtf, Variablelistmarkets.rtf.

## Key Takeaways for Data Use
- The study provides structured, observational data on hygiene practices related to poultry exposure across rural households, farms, and urban markets.
- Data are organized into separate files by setting, enabling targeted analyses of transmission and exposure events.
- Data quality is enhanced by real-time recording, systematic sessions, and random validation against source materials.
