# Experimental Design

## Purpose and aims
- Assess potential human exposures to antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by poultry, focusing on commensal bacteria from poultry GI tract.
- Record hygiene practices before and after exposure to poultry or poultry waste that may contribute to environmental contamination or transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.
- Cover rural domestic settings, small/medium-scale poultry farms, and urban live-poultry markets.

## Setting and sample
- Rural households: one household from each of five villages in Mirzapur, Tangail district (n=5).
- Poultry farms: one small/medium commercial farm from five villages in Mirzapur (n=5).
- Urban markets: one market stall selling live poultry from five markets in Dhaka (n=5).
- Design deemed formative; no a priori size effect or sample size calculation.

## Data collection design and methods
- Observers: trained female researchers in households; trained male observers in farms and markets.
- Timeframe: February–June 2017.
- Sessions: two sessions per site, each three hours, on the same day; sessions occurred at different times of day (early morning, afternoon, or evening) to capture varying behaviors.
- Session layout: observers positioned slightly differently between the two sessions to capture diverse events.
- Repeat observations: on a subsequent day for a subset (two rural homesteads, two urban farms, two urban markets) to compare behavior across days.
- Event types:
  - Transmission events (e.g., handwashing before eating/drinking, disposal of waste).
  - Exposure events (e.g., contact with poultry, bedding, manure, meat).
- For each event: record whether handwashing occurred, number of hands washed, soap usage, method of drying hands; also whether handwashing occurred before eating/drinking or feeding a child.
- Additional hygiene measures documented: use of protective clothing (gloves, boots, masks), cleaning of tools/equipment, safe waste disposal.

## Data recording, quality control, and governance
- Real-time data capture using structured observation tools adapted from prior work.
- Data entry into Excel by trained staff.
- Quality checks: random checks against original sheets by an independent researcher; frequency checks to identify out-of-range values with corrections as needed.

## Data structure and documentation
- Datasets: three CSV files
  - observationsrural.csv
  - observationsfarms.csv
  - observationsmarkets.csv
- Missing data: blank cells indicate no data recorded.
- Supporting documentation with variable lists:
  - Variablelistrural.rtf
  - Variablelistfarms.rtf
  - Variablelistmarkets.rtf

## Ethics and consent
- Written informed consent obtained from all participants, with right to withdraw at any time.
- Ethical clearance: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Relevance for data leadership and data system design
- Demonstrates cross-setting data collection that spans household, farm, and marketplace contexts, highlighting data integration needs.
- Emphasizes process-focused data capture to understand user-like needs (researchers and policy-relevant stakeholders) and potential productization of hygiene/exposure indicators.
- Illustrates important data governance considerations: consent, ethical approvals, real-time data capture, data quality controls, and comprehensive metadata through accompanying documentation.
- Highlights data structure considerations for discoverability and reuse: multiple related datasets with standardized event-based variables and clear documentation.
