# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey sites.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission to survey.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations can be released
- Access allows checking whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each survey square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require CEH preprocessing; exceptional external release may be granted under licence if IP/confidentiality requirements are met.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-release terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other purposes.
- At license end, written confirmation of data destruction is required.
- No data or imagery should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP- confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; license terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Licensing and usage terms
- Four-digit and six-digit releases governed by similar licence terms, with explicit prohibition on deriving precise locations from the data.
- Licences are issued as hardcopy agreements signed by authorized representatives.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences with appropriate clauses.
- Denied requests follow statutory Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid per case.
