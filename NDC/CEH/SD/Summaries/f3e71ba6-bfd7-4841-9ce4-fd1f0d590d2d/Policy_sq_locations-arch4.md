# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permissions to survey land.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and precision of release

- Available to identify if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) via approximate locations.
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when needed.
- Six-digit grid references: may be released externally only if CEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing exact locations; in very exceptional cases, external release may be allowed under licence with stringent IP/confidentiality checks.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) are considered equivalent in confidentiality and released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific licence conditions

- Licensees must maintain data confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- Upon licence expiry, organizations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high level of IP confidentiality.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data or claim such derivation.

## Roles and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with terms reflecting this policy; licences require signing by a senior authorised official.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partnership use; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH may assist in defining requirements or supporting appropriate data use, either collaboratively or for a fee.
