# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- Describes the Sampling Strategy used for the Countryside Survey field element up to 2007.
- The methodology is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, which began in the 1970s and is essential for understanding long-term time-series data.
- Emphasizes that the Countryside Survey methodology is tightly linked to its predecessors and requires understanding prior developments.

## Core concepts: Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework for GB ecological survey.
- Stratification uses land types (classes) based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling.
- Early approach used center squares with surrounding squares to classify a broader area; aims to reduce bias that arises from purely random sampling.
- The Land Classification evolved from a limited set of classes to more detailed, country-specific frameworks to support policy-relevant reporting.

## Development timeline and key concepts by survey

### 1978 — Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey
- Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group 1 km squares into 32 land classes from environmental data on 1228 centre squares (with surrounding squares allocated to classes).
- Final sampling: 256 squares (8 per class) surveyed in a stratified, random design.
- National habitat estimates calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the land-class area.

### 1984 — 2nd GB Field Survey
- Sample size increased: 12 squares per land class (384 total).
- Land Classification remained the 1978 framework for national estimates; results published later.

### 1990 — Countryside Survey 1990 (All Squares Classification)
- Implemented a revised Land Classification to cover every GB square (all squares classified).
- Field survey comprised 508 squares.
- Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB derived from satellite imagery.
- Results published in 1993; all features from 1984 were repeated alongside the 1990 survey data.

### 1998–2000 — Developments toward CS2000
- Recognition that some land classes were under-represented; needed to support regional and local estimates.
- Introduction of a new Land Classification structure and extension to ensure all GB squares could be represented.
- For policy and regional purposes, separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) were identified as a priority.
- CS2000 introduced class sub-division and aggregation to form 40 strata (instead of 32), and added new samples to ensure adequate class representation in each country unit.
- Additional upland habitat module funded to improve upland estimates for England and Wales.

### 2007 — Developments for CS2007 (Welsh-only Reporting)
- Welsh reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific adjustments.
- Welsh class sub-divisions created (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing to 45 strata.
- Wales received 43 extra sample squares to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes; some English classes were reduced to four squares.
- England and Scotland retained revised country maps and reporting frameworks; Wales-based representation improved to meet policy needs.

## Separate country estimates and consistency considerations
- 1990 classification allowed national estimates for England, Scotland, and Wales to be reported together, potentially crossing country boundaries.
- 2000 scoping study recommended reporting by country units (England with Wales, and Scotland separately) using country-specific class definitions.
- To support this, CS2000 introduced country-unit class subdivisions, aggregations where necessary, and additional sampling to ensure adequate representation in each country.
- A note on national estimates explains that changing the basic classification affects cross-survey comparability; while the latest classification is preferred for consistency within a survey, earlier classifications were kept for cross-survey comparability. Table 4 shows sample sizes under the original 1990 Land Classification for different surveys.

## Outputs, maps, and data structure
- Land Classification maps (for original 1978, revised 1990, and country-specific frameworks) and updated maps for CS2007 (Figures 1, 4, 6).
- Maps showing sample squares distributions across GB and by country (Figures 5 and 7).
- Tables summarize the number of squares surveyed per class and per country, illustrating how sampling design evolved over time (Tables 2–4).

## Implications for GIS and data management
- The Land Classification provides a robust spatial framework for map-based habitat and land-use statistics, enabling GIS practitioners to produce time-series habitat and landscape change outputs.
- Changes in classification affect long-term comparability; when creating GIS products spanning multiple survey years, careful alignment of classes and country units is required.
- The country-specific adjustments improve policy-relevant outputs (e.g., Wales-only reporting) and demonstrate how sampling design can be adapted to support governance needs while maintaining spatial consistency.
