# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification used to underpin Countryside Survey (CS) field work from its inception in 1978 up to CS 2007.
  - Emphasises the need for a representative, stratified sampling framework to enable robust national and country-level habitat estimates across Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales) and, later, Wales-only reporting.
  - Describes how the Land Classification was developed, refined, and applied to successive CS surveys, including adaptations for legal and policy needs arising from devolution and upland habitat assessment.

- Core concepts and data architecture
  - Stratified, random sampling: to avoid bias and ensure all parts of GB are represented by carving the landscape into discrete strata (Land Classes) and sampling within each class.
  - ITE Land Classification: a multivariate system that groups land into Land Classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to serve as the sampling framework.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): used in early development to classify vegetation/land-area units, later extended to broader environmental surrogates for GB-wide classification.
  - Field sampling units: initially 1 km squares (with surrounding squares classified to maintain contextual integrity); samples per class determined by historical minimums to balance effort and precision.
  - National estimates: derived by combining mean habitat areas per square within each Land Class with the overall area of that class, enabling extrapolation to GB totals.

- Evolution by survey year
  - 1978 CS (First field survey)
    - 8 squares per Land Class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
    - 32 Land Classes formed from 1 km squares (centre of 15 x 15 km grid) using ISA-based classification.
  - 1984 CS (Second field survey)
    - Sample expanded to 12 squares per Land Class; total 384 squares.
    - National estimates still based on the original 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares in GB; urban and sea corrections added.
    - 508 squares surveyed; broader features recorded; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1990–2000: Developments in Land Classification
    - Recognition that GB-wide estimates required classifying every square; a new approach tested using surrogates (climate, geology, physiography) with several classification attempts.
    - The best match (about 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square scheme) still produced similar class characteristics overall; some reallocation of squares into neighboring classes kept overall land-class statistics intact.
  - 2000 CS (CS2000; 4th field survey)
    - Response to policy needs: separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants; aggregation of rump classes within each country when representation was too sparse.
    - Introduction of additional squares (to improve representation of new classes) and more balanced sampling across England and Wales; an upland habitat module was added to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 CS (CS2007; 5th field survey)
    - Wales-only reporting became a priority; adjustments to accommodate Wales-specific environmental policy needs.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (England with Wales) resulting in five new Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure adequate representation; England’s English-class sampling slightly reduced in a couple of classes due to Welsh expansion, with limited impact on overall precision.
    - Revised maps and sampling framework reflect England, Wales, and Scotland distributions for country-specific reporting.

- Land Classification development (structural changes)
  - Early version (32 classes) designed to stratify GB for the 1978 survey and subsequent CS surveys.
  - 1990 revision expanded to accommodate all GB squares and introduced urban/urban-rural corrections; still used for national estimates in the 1990 survey.
  - 2000 expansion to 40 classes to better reflect regional and country-level reporting requirements (England, Scotland, Wales) and to refine estimation accuracy.
  - 2007 further subdivision into country-unit classes (total 45 strata) to support Wales-only reporting; Wales gained enhanced representation, with targeted class sub-division and additional sampling.

- Separate country estimates and Wales upland focus
  - Country-unit estimates were introduced to deliver England-with-Wales and Scotland-specific results, using country-aligned class subdivisions and targeted sampling increases where needed.
  - Wales received particular attention to support country-specific environmental policy needs, including Wales-only habitat reporting and upland habitat emphasis.
  - Isle of Man samples were reallocated to ensure country-specific estimates remained representative.

- Upland habitat module
  - An additional 30 survey squares placed in upland and marginal upland contexts to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data quality, comparability, and governance
  - Changing Land Classification across CS surveys affects cross-survey comparability; two approaches for national estimates exist: apply the latest classification within a survey or maintain consistency with the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - For internal consistency within a survey, the latest classification is preferred, but cross-survey comparability may require careful interpretation when class definitions shift.
