Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets a policy to maximise public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while protecting future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners listed.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Confidentiality supports ongoing ability to inform environmental policy.
- Requests for information handled by CEH (for NERC and CS partners) under the UK FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access and release: precision levels
- Data access allows identification of whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit precise locations allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may pre-process analyses to avoid release. Exceptional access requires legal demonstration that the requester’s data/models have equal/higher confidentiality protection than CS data.
- Spatial data inside squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects, and data must not be retained for other purposes.
- After the licensing period, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may be required to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria; a clause prevents deriving precise locations or claiming to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If access is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide necessary preprocessing support within moderate demand; other requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH may provide scientific guidance as part of collaboration or for a negotiated fee.
