# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols.

## Overview
- Describes sampling design, measurement protocols, and statistical considerations for CS soils data in 2007, with historical context from 1978 and 1998.
- Aims to support monitoring for environmental health policy evaluation and future decision-making.

## Sampling design
- Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007. 
- 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to all 591 CS squares.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location
- Sampling occurs on CS x-plots, five plots per CS square.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
- Some x-plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty in location; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Within a location, sampling is around permanently marked 2m x 2m plots, with cores roughly 2–3 m apart at corners.

## Sampling
- Soils sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998/2007 used soil cores; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Some cores cannot be collected due to stones or shallow soils; additional core measurements (dimensions, photographs) recorded in 2007 for a subset.
- In 1998/2007, multiple cores were taken per x-plot; in 1978, only top-depth sampling via pit.

## Measurements
- 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot with various measurements; not all measurements performed on every core.
- Measurements include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density (measured in 2007 but not via ISO whole-core method), core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, texture (hand texturing), soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
- Data availability: many measurements are detailed in Table 1; some data were released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.
- Samples are homogenised before pH/LOI analyses; no chemical analyses by soil horizons.

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring land classes can bias estimates toward stock and change rather than national estimates.
- When land classes are used, results are weighted by land classes to reflect national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used; use of mixed models is advised (e.g., square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within a CS square).
- Design-based considerations: CS emphasizes dispersed, widespread sampling rather than strict spatial structure for regional estimates.
- Users are encouraged to consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing publications utilizing CS soils data (listed on the CS website).

## Data governance and accessibility
- Data availability is variable; some measurements were not released until after 2009, reflecting governance and access considerations.
- Emphasizes openness and data management at the source, with guidance to share underlying data where appropriate and to follow data governance practices.
