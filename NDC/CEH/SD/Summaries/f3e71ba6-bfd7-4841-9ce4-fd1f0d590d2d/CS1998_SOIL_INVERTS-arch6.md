# Soil invertebrate data 1998 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- CS1998_SOIL_INVERTS.csv contains soil invertebrate (mesofauna) counts from samples taken at 0–8 cm depth.
- Data collected from up to 256 1km squares across Great Britain during 1998.

## Data Content and Structure
- Sampling site identifiers:
  - SQUARE: 1km square code (text)
  - PLOT: plot identifier within each square (text)
  - YEAR: survey year (number)
- Taxa counts (counts per sample) for numerous major taxa, including:
  - ACTO (acari total), ARAN (araneae), CHTO (chilopoda), CHGE, CHLI, COLA (coleoptera larvae), COAD (coleoptera adults), COL Loma, and many more (see list in original dataset).
  - TOTAL_CATCH: total invertebrates per core
  - COLL_TOTAL: total collembolan per core
  - AC_COLL_TOTAL: total mites and collembolan per core
  - MC_RATIO: mites to springtails ratio in soils (0–8 cm)
  - TOTAL_TAXA: total invertebrate taxa richness per core
  - SHANNON: Shannon diversity index (dimensionless)
- Land class and location descriptors:
  - LC07, LC07_NUM: ITE Land Class 2007
  - COUNTRY (England, Scotland, Wales), COUNTY07, EZ_DESC_07
- Other descriptors:
  - PLOT within-square, YEAR, and depth specified as 0–8 cm

## Sampling and Laboratory Methods
- Soil invertebrates extracted from soil cores using the dry Tullgren extraction method over ~5 days.
- Extraction apparatus includes a sieve unit, aluminium funnels, and a 40 W light to drive fauna into collection bottles with 70% ethanol.
- Identification to major taxa (Taxonomic level 1); Collembola and mites identified to morphotype level.

## Quality Control Procedures
- Standard methods and project log books for sample processing, identification keys, and issues.
- Quality control includes: approximately 1 in 20 samples rotated between staff; some samples sent to taxonomic specialists for validation.
- Detailed sample records: species identified, counts, processing date, sample codes, and higher taxonomic work.
- Data entry to databases weekly, with copies to CD-ROM; CD-ROMs stored in fireproof cabinet or off-site.
