# Soil invertebrate data 1998 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Provides soil mesofauna counts (0–8 cm) from up to 256 1 km squares across Great Britain, surveyed in 1998.
- Dataset supports analyses of soil biodiversity, community composition, and potential correlations with environmental factors at a coarse spatial scale.

## Data content and variables
- Spatial and sampling identifiers:
  - SQUARE: 1 km square site code, PLOT: one of 5 plots within each square
  - YEAR: survey year
- Taxa counts (major groups and taxon-level details):
  - ACTO, ARAN, CHTO, CHGE, CHLI, COLA, COAD, CONE, COPE, DIPP, DIPL, DILA, DIAD, GAST, HEMI, HYME, ISOP, LEAD, LELA, NEMA, NEMM, OLIG, OPIL, PAUR, PROT, PSEU, PSOC, PULM, SYMP, THYP, THYN
  - TOTAL_CATCH: total invertebrates per core
  - COLL_TOTAL: total collembola per core
  - AC_COLL_TOTAL: total acari mites and collembola per core
  - MC_RATIO: ratio of mites to springtails (soil, 0–8 cm)
  - TOTAL_TAXA: total invertebrate taxa per core
  - SHANNON: Shannon diversity index (dimensionless)
- Environmental and classification data:
  - LC07, LC07_NUM: ITE Land Classification 2007 (text and numeric code)
  - COUNTRY: England (ENG), Scotland (SCO), Wales (WAL)
  - COUNTY07: county or council area

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Field sampling:
  - Soil cores collected and processed according to CS2000 Field Handbook.
- Extraction and identification:
  - Dry Tullgren extraction over 5 days using a 40 W light to drive fauna into collection bottles preserved in 70% ethanol.
  - Fauna identified to major taxa (Taxonomic level 1); Collembola and mites identified to morphotype level.
- Output:
  - Counts reported per core for multiple taxonomic groups and summary metrics.

## Quality control and data management
- Standardized protocols followed for all biological assessments; project log books maintained.
- Quality control procedures:
  - Detailed recording of faunal composition, dates, sample codes, and identification keys.
  - Approximately 1 in 20 samples rotated between staff to compare identifications; some samples verified by taxonomic specialists.
  - Sample details recorded in dedicated notebooks; includes species identified and counts, processing dates, and any higher-level classifications requested.
  - Data entered weekly into databases, then copied to CD-ROMs; data undergo standard checks and are stored in fireproof cabinets or off-site.
