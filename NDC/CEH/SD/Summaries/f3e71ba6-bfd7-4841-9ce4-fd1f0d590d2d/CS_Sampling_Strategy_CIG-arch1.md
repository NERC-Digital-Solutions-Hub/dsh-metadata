# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification-based stratified sampling system.
  - Aims to produce representative, time-series data on landscape habitats, land use, and related features to detect change and inform policy and planning.
  - Built to be consistent with prior surveys while accommodating devolution-driven reporting needs (e.g., separate England, Scotland, Wales estimates).

- Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Stratified random sampling is used to reduce bias and ensure all parts of the landscape are represented.
  - Land Classification groups land into discrete, homogeneous classes defined by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate).
  - Field sampling units are 1 km squares; early methodology used a center square plus surrounding squares to assign class membership.
  - The classification underpins both sample allocation and estimation, linking area of each class to national (and country-specific) habitat estimates.

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey year
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification; 1st Field Survey)
    - 32 land classes; 1228 classified squares; 8 samples per class (256 total).
    - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the land area of that class.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per class; 384 total; continued use of the original 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Extended classification to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; full data collection repeats from 1984.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; Scotland reporting separated; prepared for regional/local estimates.
    - 569 squares surveyed.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; 5th Field Survey)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales vs Scotland); framework subdivided classes into country-unit variants.
    - 40 strata with new allocations; additional squares to ensure representation (19 extra in total; 11 more to balance England/Wales); upland module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
    - Isle of Man samples replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further adjustments.
    - Country-unit sub-divisions created for five classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); English counts preserved where Welsh samples replaced, with some reductions in a couple of English classes.
    - Revised land-class maps (England with Wales and Scotland) and updated sample square distribution (England, Wales, Scotland).

- Country-specific adjustments and upland focus
  - Wales-specific refinements to improve Wales-only estimates, including dedicated Welsh sub-classes and additional Welsh sampling.
  - An uplands module added for CS2000 to boost statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with domestic samples where needed.

- Data collection, estimation approach, and reporting
  - Estimation method: national estimates are calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Country-unit estimates: use only squares within the target country boundary, with class subdivided into country-unit variants and, where necessary, aggregated to maintain representation.
  - Data management: maps and figures illustrate land-class distributions and sample locations; the framework supports cross-survey comparability while allowing country-specific reporting.
  - Note on consistency: changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; within a single survey, the latest classification is preferred for GB estimates, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.

- Key figures and scope (high level)
  - CS2007 totals: 591 sample squares across Great Britain; England 288, Scotland 196, Wales 107.
  - Land Class structure: expansion from 32 to 40 classes (and then to 45 with country-unit subdivisions for 2007).
  - Upland sampling: 30 additional upland squares were added for England and Wales under the upland module.
  - Wales and England adjustments: targeted increases in Welsh sampling and adjustments to class definitions to enable Wales-only reporting.

- Summary of the methodological arc
  - The Countryside Survey sampling framework evolved from a small, strictly classified 1 km-square, eight-per-class design to a more complex, country-aware system with up to 45 strata.
  - The changes reflect a balance between maintaining continuity with time-series data and meeting policy-relevant needs for Wales- and England-/Scotland-specific reporting.
  - Throughout, the backbone remains stratified, random sampling anchored in the ITE Land Classification, with explicit attention to data representation, regional estimates, and time-series comparability.
