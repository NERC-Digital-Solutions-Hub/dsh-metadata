# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Executive summary for Data Leaders

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized guidelines for CS2000 field data to ensure consistent, current, and comparable time-series data across time and observers.
  - Supports integration with biodiversity monitoring and landscape change analysis, with potential alignment to broader policy and reporting frameworks.

- Data architecture, lineage, and output
  - Clear data flow from field observations to maps and datasets, with explicit linking between Field Assessment Booklets (FAB) and mapped outputs.
  - Core components: FABs, 1:10,000 base maps, theme maps, and data recording forms; crosswalks to historic datasets (e.g., CS1990) enable long-term comparability.
  - Annexes provide relocation procedures (GPS) and standardized codes to ensure provenance and traceability.
  - Outputs include de novo mapping for new squares, change mapping for old squares, Broad Habitat (BAP) maps, and various thematic maps (habitats, boundaries, roads, boundaries, etc.).

- Sampling design and temporal scope
  - Large-scale, time-series sampling using 1 x 1 km squares; differentiation between 'old' and 'new' squares to maintain continuity while incorporating new land classes.
  - Detailed plots designed to capture vegetation and landscape change, with a plan to maintain comparability over time (e.g., upland sampling, enclosures, and boundary features).

- Data collection framework and plot types
  - Comprehensive plotting system (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W, R, V plots) to cover vegetation, habitat, boundaries, and edge effects.
  - Emphasis on consistent placement, marking (permanent markers where feasible), and recording procedures to support repeat visits and time-series analyses.

- Metadata, coding, and data recording
  - FAB consolidates multiple data sheets with standardized coding (primary/secondary codes) for land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and uses.
  - Structured handling of changes within parcels or as new parcels, with cross-referencing to CS1990 and BAP codes.
  - Universal codes (e.g., 555 curtilage boundary, 888 new to map, 999 no longer on map) support historical data management and map digitization.

- Permissions, access, and governance
  - Formal landowner consent required; processes to engage landowners and manage access limitations, including partial access and square relocation if access is denied.
  - Documentation and governance procedures to ensure data collection aligns with permissions and background information gathering.

- Quality control, training, and standardization
  - Acknowledges observer variation as a primary quality risk; emphasizes standardized guidance, training, and ongoing quality control to maintain reliable time-series data, especially for detecting changes.

- Data capture, GPS, and mapping
  - Annex 1 outlines GPS data collection and relocation of plot markers to ensure accurate geospatial placement.
  - Detailed guidance on file naming for GPS-derived data (square ID and plot/feature identifiers) to maintain clear provenance.
  - Mapping approaches include change-focused mapping for old squares, broad habitats, upland/narrow-feature mapping, and use of aerial imagery as an auxiliary aid.

- Section-specific procedures and sub-programs
  - Section 10 covers sampling types: soil, Calluna (soil/foliar nitrogen context), and freshwater biota (IFS sampling done by ITE); includes sampling procedures, equipment logistics, and despatch to laboratories.
  - Section 11 covers photography standards to document plots with consistent reference features and labeling for traceability.
  - Section 12 covers post-survey procedures to ensure data integrity, with guidance against transcription-heavy recounts unless necessary.

- Data products and strategic relevance
  - Emphasizes provenance, metadata quality, and traceability across time, actors, and geographies.
  - Provides a robust framework for data governance, change tracking, and integration with biodiversity and land-use monitoring initiatives, supporting national and EU reporting requirements.

- Annexes and supplementary guidance
  - Annexes include detailed coding schemes, species lists, boundary/hedgerow coding guidance, and GPS-related operational instructions to ensure repeatable data entry and geospatial accuracy.
