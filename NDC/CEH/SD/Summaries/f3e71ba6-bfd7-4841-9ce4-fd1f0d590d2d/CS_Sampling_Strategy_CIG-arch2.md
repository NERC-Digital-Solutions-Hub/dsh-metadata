# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Built on the ITE Land Classification, first used in 1978, and evolved to enable robust, time-series assessment of Britain’s countryside.
  - Aims to provide consistent, comparable environmental health signals and policy-relevant outputs (e.g., habitat estimates, maps, charts) while ensuring data quality and accessibility.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representativeness and minimize bias.
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework, grouping land into classes by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Use of 1 km squares as sampling units; historically linked to class areas to derive national estimates.
  - Progressive refinement to support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and, later, upland habitat assessment.

- Evolution by survey rounds (key milestones)
  - 1978 CS (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1228 classified 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15×15 km grid).
    - 8 squares surveyed per class (256 total); national estimates based on class-area proportions.
  - 1984 CS (Second field survey)
    - 12 squares per class (384 total); continues using 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd survey)
    - Revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map; broader data collection including land-use features.
  - 1998 CS (Revised Land Classification; 4th survey)
    - Classification expanded to 40 classes; enabled separate Scottish reporting; total 569 squares surveyed.
  - 2000 CS (CS2000; 5th survey)
    - Need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales; Scotland); added subdivisions to create 40+ strata and 19 extra squares.
    - Introduced upland habitat sampling module to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 CS (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requested; Welsh subdivisions added (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - 43 additional Welsh squares; England adjustments to maintain representation; Wales obtains minimum 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - Revised land-class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; sample square counts summarized in new tables/maps.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling design
  - Separate country estimates introduced to enable England & Wales versus Scotland reporting.
  - Methods include class subdivision into country-unit versions, selective aggregation where needed, and additional country-specific samples to ensure adequate representation.
  - Isle of Man samples replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
  - Overall framework expanded from 32 to 40, then to 45 strata to reflect country-specific needs.

- Upland module and Wales-focused adjustments
  - CS2000 added an uplands module (30 extra squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - CS2007 expanded Welsh representation with new Welsh-specific classes and bumped Wales sampling density for Wales-only outputs.

- Data outputs, quality, and accessibility
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, trend indicators, and accompanying maps/charts suitable for policy monitoring.
  - Emphasis on standardised methods, data verification, quality assurance, and data storage/upload to portals.
  - Acknowledges the need for consistency in national estimates, balancing the use of latest classifications with cross-survey comparability.

- National estimates and classification consistency
  - Note on choosing classification for national estimates: using the latest classification enhances internal consistency; older classifications can be used for cross-survey consistency.
  - Tables in the document document the impact of classification changes on sample numbers and Strata areas across CS rounds.

- Acknowledgements and references
  - Acknowledges contributions from statisticians and ecologists; includes extensive references detailing the development and application of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey methodology.

- Practical takeaways for analysts
  - The Countryside Survey sampling strategy is a historically grounded, progressively refined framework for monitoring environmental condition in Britain.
  - Stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification provides representative coverage and supports time-series comparisons, with country-specific reporting and upland-focused modules.
  - Data quality, standardised methods, and accessible data portals are central to turning field observations into policy-relevant environmental health indicators.
