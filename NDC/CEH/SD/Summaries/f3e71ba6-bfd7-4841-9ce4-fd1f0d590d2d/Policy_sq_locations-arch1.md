# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Scope and Partners
- Current CS partners: CEH (Natural Environment Research Council), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Rationale for Confidentiality
- Locations must remain confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future access/permissions for surveying land.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release Scenarios and Licence Levels
- Public-use option: determine if survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) without revealing exact locations.
- Four-digit grid references: released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external demonstration that IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data protection.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features): treated as equivalent to location data and released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific Release Conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed or confirmed destroyed at licence end.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP-confidentiality requirements; prohibition remains on attempting to deduce exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and Governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement in projects may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical Guidance for Analysts
- Use aggregated or four-digit level data where possible to preserve confidentiality while meeting analytical needs.
- Plan analyses with pre-processing steps handled by CEH when possible to minimise exposure risk.
- For non-CS partners, approach is case-by-case and requires demonstrating equivalent confidentiality protections.
