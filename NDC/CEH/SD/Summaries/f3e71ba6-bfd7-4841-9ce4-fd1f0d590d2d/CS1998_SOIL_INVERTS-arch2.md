# Soil invertebrate data 1998 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

## Overview
- Dataset from Countryside Survey 1998, capturing soil invertebrate (mesofauna) counts from soil cores (0–8 cm) across up to 256 1 km squares in Great Britain.
- CS1998_SOIL_INVERTS.csv contains per-sample counts and summary metrics for a wide range of taxa, plus environmental and classification metadata.
- Purpose aligned with environmental monitoring to assess soil biodiversity and health at a national scale.

## Data Collected
- Spatial and sampling metadata:
  - SQUARE (1 km square code), PLOT (within-square plot ID), YEAR.
  - COUNTRY, COUNTY07, EZ_DESC_07 (land classification description), LC07, LC07_NUM (ITE Land Classification 2007).
- Taxa counts (numerical counts per sample) across major soil invertebrate groups, including:
  - Acari, Araneae, Chilopoda (and subgroups), Coleoptera (larvae and adults), Collembola (multiple morphotypes), Copepoda, Diplopoda, Diptera, Gastropoda, Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Isopoda, Lepidoptera (adult and larva), Nematoda, Oligochaeta, Opiliones, Pauropoda, Protura, Pseudoscorpions, Psocoptera, Symphyla, Thysanoptera, Thysanura, among others.
- Community and diversity metrics:
  - TOTAL_CATCH, COLL_TOTAL (total Collembola), AC_COLL_TOTAL (mites + Collembola), MC_RATIO (mites: springtails), TOTAL_TAXA (taxa richness), SHANNON (diversity index).

## Methods
- Soil sampling and extraction:
  - Soil cores collected 0–8 cm depth; invertebrates extracted using dry Tullgren funnels over ~5 days with a heat source.
  - Collected organisms preserved in 70% ethanol and identified to major taxa; Collembola and mites identified to morphotype level.
- Laboratory workflow:
  - Identification and counting aligned with standard protocols; detailed documentation of sample processing.
- Field and lab preparation:
  - Soil samples processed per CS2000 Field Handbook.

## Quality Control and Data Management
- Standardised procedures followed; project log books maintained for sample processing, identification keys, and actions.
- Quality control:
  - Approximately 1 in 20 samples rotated between staff for cross-checking identifications.
  - Selected samples sent to taxonomic specialists for higher-level validation.
  - Detailed notebooks record species, counts, dates, sample codes, and any higher-taxon work.
- Data handling:
  - Data entered weekly into databases, then copied to CD-ROM; standard data checks performed.
  - CD-ROMs stored in fireproof cabinets or off-site locations to safeguard data.

## Outputs, Access, and Usage
- Outputs typically presented as reports, maps, and charts; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals for accessibility.
- Data use requires acknowledgement: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC-Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; Countryside Survey © Database Right/Copyright CEH; all rights reserved.
- Soil data collection and handling followed CS2000 procedures; associated publications provide methodological context.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring
- Demonstrates standardized, repeatable soil biodiversity monitoring at a national scale.
- Facilitates temporal comparisons and policy performance assessment by providing consistent metrics (e.g., total catches, taxa richness, diversity, and land-class context).
- Highlights ongoing goals to maximize data value and accessibility by integrating with other environmental datasets and ensuring underlying data are accessible to researchers and policymakers.

## References and Context
- Includes extensive references to Countryside Survey methodologies, MASQ soil quality modules, and ITE Land Classification (GB 1981–2007), among others, supporting the methodological framework and data interpretation.
