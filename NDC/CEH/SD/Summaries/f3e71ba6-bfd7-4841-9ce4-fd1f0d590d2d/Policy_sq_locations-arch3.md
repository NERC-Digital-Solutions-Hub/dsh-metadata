# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Defines how survey square location data and within-square spatial data are handled.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When locations may be released and at what precision
- Location data can be released as four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid square) under licence.
- Six-digit grid references are generally not released; only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances with justification that IP and confidentiality are at least as protected as CS data, and CEH can’t process it.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and may be released only under exceptional terms.
- To avoid releasing precise locations, CEH can perform pre-processing analyses.
- In all cases, precise location data should not be used to plan visits, identify square locations, or check landowner compliance.

## Specific license terms for release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to approved individuals for defined projects.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed or confirmed secure at project end.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality.
- If relevant, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar but lighter IP constraints compared to six-digit releases.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Roles, responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with the specified clauses; must be signed by an authorized senior official.
- If access is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal processing needs within reasonable timeframes; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated.
