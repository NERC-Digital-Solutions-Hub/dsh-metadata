# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and aims
- Establishes standardized methods for the Countryside Survey CS2000 across Great Britain to support time-series analysis of land cover, habitats, and landscape features.
- Emphasizes data quality, governance, metadata, and reproducible workflows to enable reliable change detection and policy-relevant reporting.
- Supports interoperability and long-term reuse through a robust data dictionary, coding schemes, versioning, and clear provenance.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- Document metadata, coding schemes, data workflows, and data lineage to ensure usability and discoverability.
- Maintain data quality through planning, training, quality control, and consistent field handbooks.
- Facilitate integration with policy frameworks (e.g., Broad Habitats, BAPs) and national reporting.
- Preserve standardized outputs (BAP maps, broad habitat categorizations, time-series results) for sharing with government bodies, NGOs, and researchers.
- Track versioning and transitions (CS1990 vs CS2000) to maintain historical continuity.

## Sampling framework (Section 10)
- Three sampling types:
  - Soil sampling: five replicates per square to assess soil chemistry, soil fauna, and microbiological status; coordinated with ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen analysis to relate to nitrogen deposition and identify deposition hotspots; random selection of current-year growth within Calluna-dominated areas.
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with field teams.
- Soil sampling specifics:
  - Five samples per 1 km square within each X-plot center, using designated pipe sizes, with standardized packaging and transport to ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling specifics:
  - Collect 30–50 g of current-year growth per Calluna plant, label, dry as needed, and ship to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted in parallel by IFE to align with field survey timing.

## Plot types, layout, and field procedures
- Plot frameworks:
  - X plots (Large, 200 m2): core vegetation sampling sites.
  - Y plots (Small, 4 m2): supplementary habitat plots in semi-natural vegetation.
  - U plots (Unenclosed, 4 m2): added to sample unenclosed landscapes.
  - B plots (Boundary, 200 m2): boundaries such as hedges and ditches.
  - A plots (Arable margins, 100 x 1 m): edge biodiversity sampling near arable fields.
  - H plots (Hedgerow, 10 x 1 m) and D plots (Hedgerow diversity, 30 m): woody vegetation structure and diversity baselines.
  - S & W plots (Streamside/Waterside, 10 x 1 m; 5 total): waterway-associated habitats.
  - R & V plots (Roadside/Verge, 10 x 1 m): roadsides and verge habitats.
- Plot handling:
  - Locate, relocate (for old squares), record, and permanently mark with metal plates.
  - Maintain strict spacing to avoid overlap and bias across plots.
- Data capture and vegetation recording:
  - Emphasize dominant vegetation using codes and percentages; reference a standard species list with groupings for uncertain identifications.
  - Follow thresholds (e.g., 25% cover) and habitat-diagnostic species guidance to ensure comparability with CS1990/previous surveys.

## Data capture, field sheets, and coding
- Field Assessment Books (FABs) used to record:
  - Ownership, physiography, land use, vegetation, plots, boundaries, buildings, and other landscape features.
  - Standardized codes and alpha-numeric combinations for land cover, vegetation types, and boundaries.
- Emphasis on legible, well-organized entries and linking primary codes with appropriate qualifiers.
- Documentation of changes, parcel numbers, and alignment with theme maps and data sheets to support change detection and audit trails.
- Annexes include extensive coding schemes for landscape features, boundaries, and designated vs non-designated recreation areas.

## Species recording, identification, and data quality
- Focus on capturing dominant vegetation with standardized codes and a consistent core species list.
- Recording thresholds and careful handling of woody species, shrubs, and trees to maintain comparability across years.
- Use of predefined species groupings when exact IDs are uncertain to preserve cross-year consistency.
- Standardized data capture techniques and documentation to minimize observer variation and improve the reliability of time-series analyses.

## Data quality, standardization, and governance
- Central role of standardized field methods, data capture, and coding to reduce observer variation.
- Emphasis on training, quality control, and adherence to Field Handbook guidelines.
- Clear provenance, parcel numbers, and change documentation to support reproducibility and auditability.

## End-to-end workflow (summary)
- Plan sampling and allocate squares among teams; prepare equipment and obtain permissions.
- Visit squares (old and new), confirm access, and collect baseline information (ownership, physiography, boundaries, etc.).
- Conduct mapping and plot-based vegetation surveys using FABs and coded data sheets.
- Relocate and mark plots, record species data, and document changes relative to prior surveys where applicable.
- Integrate results into BAP maps, CS broad habitat frameworks, and national reporting requirements.
- Archive data with clear provenance, ensuring compatibility with future CS2000 initiatives and beyond 1998.

## Annexes and supplementary elements
- GPS data collection: relocation accuracy, satellite checks, PDOP considerations, file naming conventions, and procedures for stationary vs moving features.
- GPS data management: step-by-step guidance for recording, logging, and organizing GPS-derived data files.
- Photography: standardized photography protocols to document plots, including reference features, square/plot labeling, and composition guidelines.
- Post-survey procedures: checks for data completeness, handling of damaged sheets, and transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Practical implications for Data Stewards
- Maintain a robust data dictionary and code lists to support interoperability and long-term reuse.
- Track versioning, field method updates, and mapping rule transitions (CS1990 vs CS2000) to preserve historical continuity.
- Ensure metadata include sampling plans, plot layouts, relocation methods, GPS usage, and data quality checks.
- Facilitate data sharing with government bodies, NGOs, and researchers by preserving standardized outputs (BAP maps, broad habitats, and time-series results).
