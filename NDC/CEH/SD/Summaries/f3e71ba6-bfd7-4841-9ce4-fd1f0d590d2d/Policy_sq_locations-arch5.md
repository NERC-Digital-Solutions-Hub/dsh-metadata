# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners involved: CEH (on behalf of NERC) and other CS partners (Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future access permissions.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision levels

- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to show which grid squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid needing release, or provide data under licence if conditions are strictly met.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-terms process as six-digit releases.
- Any use of four-digit releases must not allow identification of precise square locations; similar restrictions apply to spatial data to prevent pinpointing.

## Specific licence conditions and data handling

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are for finite periods and specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- Upon licence expiry, written confirmation of data destruction and continued security must be provided.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases follow similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria; users must not attempt to derive precise locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- CEH/NERC will, if approvals are denied, follow FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH will provide an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Internal data-use efficiency: CEH aims to support pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are advised to consult with CEH before using data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or fee-based, as negotiated.
- A senior signatory from the licensee organisation is required to sign licences.
