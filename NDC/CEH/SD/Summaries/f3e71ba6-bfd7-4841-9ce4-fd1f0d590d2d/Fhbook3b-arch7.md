# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview for GIS Specialists
- Provides standardized field data collection for national vegetation and landscape monitoring with GIS-ready outputs.
- Aims to enable robust time-series analyses and spatial change detection through consistent methods across 1:10,000 base maps and thematic maps.
- Aligns field observations with Broad Habitats and Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) to support policy, science, and management.

## Vegetation Coding and Data Recording
- Detailed coding systems for plants and habitats, including:
  - Ferns (e.g., Blechnum spicant, Dryopteris species) and Forbs/Woody species.
  - Mosses/Lichens with structured alpha-numeric codes and optional color-coding for complex cases.
- Field data captured on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and mapped on enlarged 1:10,000 sheets.
- Data elements include: Mapping (geographic features), Plant species in plots, and Sampling information (plot-level data).
- Dominant primary codes guide multi-code situations; secondary codes capture supporting attributes (e.g., species, habitat, management).
- Boundary-related coding (hedges, fences, walls, ditches) and boundary status are explicitly defined.

## Thematic Mapping and Output
- Outputs organized by Broad Habitats to support biodiversity policy reporting (BAP-aligned).
- Two main mapping approaches:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (for lowland enclosed landscapes): specific, mappable BAP categories.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (upland unenclosed landscapes): higher-level habitat categories with additional plot data.
- Outputs include 1:10,000 base maps with expanded attribute coding, BAP maps, theme maps, and change-detection products.
- Change-focused mapping (CS2000) facilitates temporal trend analysis and GIS-based change assessment.

## Field Sampling and Data Collection
- Three main sampling strands within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors): five replicate samples per 1 km square, analyzed for pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, soil fauna, and microbiological status.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen concentration to identify regions exceeding critical loads (requires samples from Calluna vulgaris within squares).
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with survey teams.
- Sampling aims to establish national, spatially-referenced soil and biota baselines to support future indices of soil biological activity and diversity.

## Plot Types and Layout (Data Capture Framework)
- X-plots (center for soil sampling; 2 x 2 m plots): five sampling locations per square; nested vegetation recording within the plots.
- Y plots (2 m x 2 m): five plots per square across land-cover types for baseline vegetation data.
- U plots (Unenclosed plots): up to 10 plots per square in plottable broad habitats for habitat change monitoring.
- B plots (Boundary plots): five 200 m2 plots along field boundaries to document boundary elements and changes.
- A plots (Arable field margin plots): 100 x 1 m plots along arable boundaries; species presence noted without cover estimates.
- H plots (Hedgerow plots): two plots per square to record woody species composition and canopy.
- D plots (Hedgerow diversity plots): ten plots along hedgerows to measure woody species diversity.
- S & W plots (Streamside and Waterside plots): five plots per square at water edges, recording vegetation within 1 m of water edge.
- R & V plots (Roadside and Verge plots): five plots per square along roads, tracks, and verges.
- Permanent marking and relocation protocols are in place to ensure time-series comparability across surveys.

## GPS and Spatial Data Management
- Annex 1 provides a detailed guide for collecting GPS data to support plot relocation and spatial accuracy.
- Steps cover equipment check, stationary vs moving position logging, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4), sampling rate, and data integrity.
- Emphasis on achieving low PDOP (<6) for accurate positioning; guidance on dealing with obstructions and GPS antenna placement to improve signal quality.
- GPS data are integrated with FABs and GIS databases to enhance locate-ability and time-series continuity.

## Photography and Documentation
- Each vegetation plot is photographed to document general appearance and position relative to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, unique, and within a viewable distance.
- Photos must include square/plot identifiers on a board placed at the plot edge and should cover a representative portion of the plot without excessive sky.

## Data Quality, Training, and Standardization
- Strong emphasis on consistent field recording to minimize observer variation and improve change detection.
- Training and quality control ensure consistent application of definitions, codes, and field procedures.
- Use of the Field Handbook definitions to guide field interpretation and coding.

## Outputs, Outputs Integration, and Practical Considerations for GIS Work
- GIS-ready products include:
  - 1:10,000 base maps with expanded attribute coding for broad habitats and BAP categories.
  - FABs and code sheets linked to a structured database for efficient GIS integration.
  - Thematic maps, BAP maps, and change-detection outputs for monitoring ecological change.
- Guidelines support translating CS1990 and CS2000 coding schemes and handling changes across squares, including parcel renumbering and mosaics.

## Post-Survey Procedures and Annexes
- After surveying: verify data completeness, minimize omissions, and transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.
- Annexes cover GPS data collection practices, including almanac handling, battery management, and data file naming for spatial datasets.
