# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Overview
  - Aims to maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest stance; FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations govern information requests.

- Data access and release levels
  - Access can indicate whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location context.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require exceptional justification and legal demonstration of higher confidentiality protection; CEH handles processing to avoid direct release.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional access terms as six-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
  - Licencees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
  - No data or derivatives may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - Data cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from data or claim to have done so.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) decides on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses.
  - Licence approvals/denials follow the UK Act and Regulations; CEH supports decision justification.
  - CEH provides an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid.

- Practical guidance for data support (how to help others)
  - Assess whether a request seeks four-digit, six-digit, or broader spatial data and determine licence requirements.
  - Ensure proper licensing, secure storage, and restricted access for authorised individuals.
  - Manage project duration and confirmation of data destruction at project end.
  - Evaluate whether the requested data could enable identification of square locations and apply exceptional access where justified.
  - Coordinate with CEH for pre-processing or data handling to minimise need for direct location release.
  - Communicate licensing terms clearly to licensees and monitor compliance throughout the project.
