# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007. 
- Sample coverage expanded from 256 squares (1978/1998) to all 591 CS squares (2007). 
- Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sampling design
- Each CS square contains 5 x-plots; x-plots are not replicates due to varying land use, soils, etc.
- Over time, some x-plots are relocated or removed (e.g., due to land use changes or access issues); each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Sampling occurs within a permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plot in each location; exact sampling points may shift by ~2–3 m.

## Sampling procedure
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample). 
- 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the ground; 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
- Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; cores have different measurements (Table 1) and are not all measured identically.
- Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements; bulk density measured in 2007 (not via ISO bulk density method).
- 2007 measurements include: pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals; some measurements are only for all 591 squares (or only for original 256 squares); some are restricted to a subset of x-plots.
- Some data released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).

## Data structure and handling
- Data available via the Countryside Survey (CS) framework; tables and measurements are linked to specific cores and x-plots.
- Not all measurements are available for all squares/plots in every year; cross-year comparability requires careful harmonisation.

## Statistical analysis considerations
- Analyses should account for land class structure; failing to do so yields stock/change of the population rather than national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; CS design emphasizes the need to reflect spatial structure.
- A mixed-model approach is advised, with square treated as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within a square.
- For regions where spatial structure is not central, a dispersed sampling design can improve precision and regional coverage.
- For CS soils data analysis, consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing CS publications for context and methods.

## Data value, access, and use
- Challenge: increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data rather than using datasets in isolation.
- Challenge: enabling access to underlying data used to produce final outputs, facilitating broader reuse and validation.
- Important practice: align analyses with standardized CS methods and reference publications; use CS website for available publications and datasets.
