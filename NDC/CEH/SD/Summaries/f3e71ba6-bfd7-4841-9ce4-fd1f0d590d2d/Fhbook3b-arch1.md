# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The CS2000 Field Handbook standardizes field data collection for land-use, vegetation, and landscape monitoring, detailing taxonomic coding, sampling design, plot layout, data capture (FABs), GPS procedures, photography, and post-survey procedures to support time-series analyses and policy reporting.

## Taxonomic coding and species dictionaries
- Provides standardized abbreviations and codes for plant taxa (e.g., ferns, forbs/woody species, mosses/lichens) to ensure consistent data entry across years and observers.
- Examples show mappings such as Athyrium filix-femina to codes and related species pairings, with conventions for coding boundaries, vegetation components, and changes.

## Sampling types and scope
- Three sampling types within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling (field surveyors)
  - Calluna sampling (field surveyors)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Freshwater sampling coordinated with IFE within the square timing.

## Soil sampling protocol
- Rationale: establish soil quality baselines and indices of soil biological activity and diversity; five replicate samples per 1 km square.
- Targets: pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals; processed at ITE Merlewood.
- Sampling design:
  - Five replicate cores per square in X-plots (centered on 2 x 2 m plots); three cores per sampling set: two short white pipes, one long black pipe.
  - Location within each centre plot: first core 15 cm north of the north corner; second core 15 cm east; third core 15 cm west; all within the 2 x 2 m centre plot.
  - Post-sampling handling: cores bagged with caps and envelopes; two shortest cores shipped first by post; longest kept for regional collection.
  - Repeat per centre plot across all squares, totaling five soil sampling locations per square.
- Equipment and logistics:
  - Distributed items include cool box, trowel, knives, measuring tape, lump hammer, aluminium plate, pipes of specified sizes, and labeled envelopes/bags prepared for shipping to ITE Merlewood.

## Calluna sampling protocol
- Purpose: collect foliar nitrogen data to identify regions with nitrogen deposition exceeding critical loads for Calluna vulgaris.
- Procedure:
  - In every square with Calluna vulgaris, select current year's growth (CYG) randomly from several plants.
  - Collect 30–50 g fresh weight of CYG shoots; place in provided bags; keep samples slightly aired if wet.
  - Label and despatch promptly to ITE Merlewood via station or mail; receipts claimed on T&S forms.

## Freshwater sampling coordination
- Specialised field surveyors from IFE may operate in the same square; IFE to coordinate with CS2000 regional coordinators to schedule work suitably.

## Photography guidelines
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot with films supplied.
- Reference features to be obvious, permanent, and within view; include square/plot numbers on a visible reference board at the plot edge.
- Composition: aim for plots occupying up to half the frame; minimize sky; ensure legibility of identifiers.

## Procedures after survey
- Immediately review data sheets daily to ensure no features are omitted.
- Transcription onto fresh maps/forms should be avoided unless necessary due to damage; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

## Annex: collecting GPS data
- Step-by-step GPS protocol to ensure accurate plot relocation:
  - Check power, satellite count (minimum four), and PDOP (preferably below 6 for good 3D fix).
  - Record stationary positions (plots) or moving features (boundaries) with defined data logging modes.
  - Create unique file names per plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4); include feature descriptors (e.g., 501F1.MOB) when adding new features.
  - Use attribute lists to quickly select plot IDs; follow the logging prompts to start/stop data capture.
  - Include guidance on handling obstructions, using antenna extensions, and battery charging.
  - Almanac updates are automatic; allow time for downloads as needed.

## Equipment and distribution
- Field equipment is categorized by requirement (asterisk items, hash items distributed by region, and standard CS2000 equipment).
- Includes ground-penetrating and sampling tools, sample envelopes, pipes, and labeled bags to ensure traceability and proper shipment.

## Data quality, governance, and applicability for analysts
- Emphasizes standardization to minimize observer variation and enhance statistical reliability for change analyses.
- Defines clear data provenance, metadata capture, and documented QA processes.
- Supports rigorous time-series analyses, change detection, and habitat-specific trend assessments with reproducible data handling and reporting suitable for policy-relevant outputs.
