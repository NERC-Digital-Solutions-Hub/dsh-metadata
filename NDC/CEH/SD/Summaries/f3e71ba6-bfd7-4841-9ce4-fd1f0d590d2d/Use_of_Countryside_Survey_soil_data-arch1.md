# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Sampling design
- Soils were sampled in three periods: 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- Sampling intensity changed over time: 256 squares in 1978 and 1998; all 591 CS squares in 2007.
- Power analyses were performed to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location
- Soils are taken from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to potential differences in land use and soil type.
- Over time, some x-plots are relocated due to land-use changes or access issues; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
- Samples from the same unique identifier are from the same location but may be 2–3 m apart, sampled around a 2 m × 2 m permanently marked plot corner.

## Sampling
- Top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples) were collected; 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil, then extracted; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores per location.

## Measurements
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; various measurements were made on different cores (not all measurements on all samples).
- 2007 measurements (examples): pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals; mineralisable N; and measurements for invertebrates (mainly collembola and mites) on select x-plots.
- Some measurements were limited to all 591 squares or to the original 256 squares, and some measurements were available only on a subset (e.g., 2 of the 5 x-plots in original 256 squares).
- A note indicates that data released for certain measurements occurred after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for structural design features (land class structure) to avoid biased estimates of stock and change; ignoring land class can misrepresent national estimates.
- Bootstrapping was not always employed; the CS design should be considered, with a mixed model recommended.
- A mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to account for multiple x-plots (up to 5) within each CS square.
- For design-based analyses (where spatial structure is not the main interest), a dispersed set of observations can improve regional precision and coverage.
- Analysts are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation, and to review existing CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

## Data availability and notes
- The CS dataset includes multiple measurements per x-plot core, with several measurements limited to specific subsets of samples or years.
- Metadata clarifies which measurements were made on which samples and in which squares, and notes that some data were released only after 2009.
- The document provides guidance on using and interpreting the CS soils data, emphasizing the need to consider the sampling design and hierarchical structure in analyses.
