# CS2000 Field Handbook

- Provides standardized guidelines for countryside survey data collection, recording, mapping, and analysis to support time-series monitoring and policy context.
- Covers sampling design (soil, vegetation, freshwater), data capture (FABs, maps, plots), data coding, QA, GPS data, photography, and post-survey procedures.
- Emphasises integration with external datasets and organisations (e.g., ITE Merlewood, Institute of Freshwater Ecology) and documentation for transparency and reproducibility.

## Aim and scope of data collection

- Standardised, scalable workflow for collecting data across 1 km square units and multiple plot types.
- Data support for long-term change detection, biodiversity indicators, and policy/reporting needs.
- Coordination with other bodies (e.g., freshwater sampling by IFE) to align timing and logistics.

## Survey design and square-level framework

- Core design uses 1 x 1 km squares, with time-series re-surveys to maintain comparability.
- Within each square, multiple plot types (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W, R, V) capture vegetation, boundaries, crops, hedgerows, streams, and other features.
- Five soil sampling locations per square center plot; Calluna sampling and freshwater biota sampling conducted as specified.
- Outputs linked to broader land use, biodiversity indicators, and policy frameworks.

## Data recording, mapping and plot-based approaches

- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) paired with enlarged 1:10,000 maps; core elements: mapping, species recording, and sampling.
- Broad Habitats framework:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (dominant vegetation types, boundaries, arable, grassland, etc.).
  - Plottable Broad Habitats for upland/unenclosed areas with additional plotting.
- Plot-based strategies include upland/unenclosed plots (U plots) to monitor mosaics with diffuse boundaries.

## Plot types and vegetation recording

- Plot types include X (large/main), Y (small/targeted), U (unenclosed, 2 x 2 m, up to 10 per square), B (boundaries), A (arable field margins), H (hedgerows), D (hedgerow diversity), S/W (streams/watersides), R/V (roadsides/verges).
- Standardised species presence and percent cover data collected in 5% intervals; nested plotting within large plots; permanent markers and GPS locations used; photographs required.

## Data coding, quality, and change detection

- CS1990–CS2000 code framework uses primary codes for dominant land cover and secondary codes for mosaics, sub-types, and management; cover percentages recorded (25–100%).
- Special handling for certain taxa (e.g., bracken) and capacity to create sub-parcels for new delineations (e.g., A1, A2).
- Change detection focuses on distinguishing genuine change from recording error; QA and observer consistency stressed.

## Sampling protocols

- Soil sampling (Section 10.6–10.7):
  - In each X-plot: three soil cores collected (5 cm+ depth) using black long pipe (center), and two short white pipes for additional samples, located at specified offsets.
  - Samples packaged in labeled bags and envelopes; two short samples posted promptly; longest core collected for later laboratory processing.
  - Detailed step-by-step field procedure ensures consistent sampling and transport to ITE Merlewood.
- Calluna sampling (Section 10.9–10.10):
  - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) from Calluna vulgaris plants; random selection across plants; 30–50 g fresh weight per sample.
  - Pack in labeled bags, allow for drying if wet, and dispatch to ITE Merlewood (either via research station or direct post with receipt).
- Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11):
  - Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff; coordinated with CS2000 field teams to align timing.

## Equipment, logistics, and sample handling

- Field equipment provided and distributed by regional coordinators; standardized items include sampling pipes, bags, envelopes, and transport packaging.
- Detailed packaging and labeling requirements to ensure traceability (square number, X-plot, etc.) and safe transport of samples to processing laboratories.
- Clear guidelines for post-collection handling, posting, and documentation to support tracking and data integrity.

## GPS data collection and Annex details

- Annex 1 provides step-by-step GPS data collection procedures, including:
  - Checking satellite availability and PDOP (target PDOP < 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Recording stationary vs. moving features with specific data files named to include square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Setting data sampling rate, logging controls, and stopping logging when appropriate.
  - Battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions.
- Emphasises clear, consistent file naming, data file management, and documentation of new features or boundaries.
- Guidance on entering data via Magellan keypad, and ensuring accurate plot identification to speed data entry.

## Photography and documentation

- Photography required for every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and relation to reference features.
- Photos must reference square and plot numbers and include visible markers; composition should balance plot content and key reference features.

## Procedures after survey and data handling

- Post-survey checks to ensure all features are captured on data sheets; re-mapping or re-entry only as a last resort to prevent data loss.
- Clear procedures for transporting FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing and storage.

## Annex and methodological details

- Annexes emphasize documentation, definitions, and flexibility to record atypical or doubtful categories with notes to ensure transparency and reproducibility.
- Overall emphasis on data-rich field workflows that support robust time-series analyses and policy-relevant insights.

- In summary, the CS2000 Field Handbook outlines a rigorous, standardized data collection and management system spanning design, field procedures, data coding, GPS data capture, sampling protocols, and post-survey processes to enable robust, policy-relevant biodiversity and landscape change analyses.
