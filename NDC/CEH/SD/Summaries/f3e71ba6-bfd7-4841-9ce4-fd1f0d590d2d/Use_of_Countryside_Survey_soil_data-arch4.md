# Sampling design

- Overview of sampling timeline
  - Soils sampled in CS in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled soils from all 591 CS squares.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples in 2007.
  - Power analyses determined the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; 5 x-plots per CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates (diverse land uses and soils).
  - Some x-plots relocated over time due to land-use changes, access, or uncertainty in location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1: square 2, repeat plot 1).
  - Within a sampling location, exact soil sample positions are about 2–3 m apart at the corners of a 2 m x 2 m plot.
  - Sampling focuses on the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples in 1998/2007).

- Sampling methods
  - 1998 and 2007: soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out.
  - 1978: soil pit dug, samples from the top 15 cm of the profile from pit side.
  - Stone or shallow soils can prevent full-core collection.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory methods
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990s onward: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores had different measurements (as per Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO whole-core method).
  - Extensive documentation of methods and implications available (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Data structure and measurements across cores
  - Different cores within x-plots may carry different measurements (Table 1).
  - Data cover both 256 original squares and the full 591 squares in 2007.
  - Measurements include: LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other soil properties.
  - Some measurements recorded only for a subset of x-plots or squares (noted with asterisks; data released after Soils Report Nov 2009).

- Statistical analysis guidance and data use
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it may bias estimates toward stock and change of the population.
  - When land classes are used, estimates are weighted to produce national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used in CS soil analyses.
  - Mixed models with square as a random factor are recommended to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - Design-based approaches (dispersed observations) can improve regional precision and coverage if spatial structure is not the focus.
  - Only one core per location is typical; consult CEH before analysis and interpretation.
  - Review existing CS publications for prior analyses and results (CS website).
