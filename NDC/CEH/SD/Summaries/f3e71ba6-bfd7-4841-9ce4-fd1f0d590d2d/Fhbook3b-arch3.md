# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - National field handbook guiding countryside environmental monitoring field work in GB.
  - Aims to build time-series data to evaluate policy, monitor habitat change, and inform future decisions.
  - Emphasises standardised data collection, quality control, data governance, and transparent data sharing to support monitoring and governance.

- Key monitoring framework elements
  - Three main sampling streams integrated into a single monitoring framework:
    - Soil sampling for soil quality baselines and biodiversity indicators.
    - Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling to assess nitrogen deposition impacts.
    - Freshwater biota sampling conducted by accredited IFE staff, coordinated with field survey teams.
  - Field photography and rigorous data recording accompany biological sampling to ensure contextual evidence and repeatability.
  - GPS data collection is integral, with specific protocols and metadata requirements to support spatial analysis and data integration.

- Section 10: Sampling
  - 10.2–10.3 Background and goals
    - Establishes soil health baselines as a priority for monitoring soil quality, biology, and microbiological status.
    - Uses a national, spatially referenced soil sampling programme across 1 km squares, with representation across Land Class and Land Cover types.
  - 10.3 Sampling design
    - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals) and soil biology.
    - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage; aims to build a nationally comparable dataset.
  - 10.4–10.7 Sampling procedure for soils
    - In each X-plot (centre 2 x 2 m plot within a square), three soil cores are taken using three pipes (one long black pipe; two short white pipes) at defined positions (e.g., 15 cm north, east, and west of the centre corner).
    - Detailed step-by-step protocol for core extraction, handling, labeling, sealing, packaging, and despatch to ITE Merlewood.
    - Emphasis on careful documentation and the ability to relocate sampling points; sample integrity and shipping timeliness are critical.
  - 10.8–10.10 Calluna sampling
    - Collect Calluna vulgaris foliar samples (current year’s growth) within each square where Calluna occurs.
    - Sampling protocol requires random selection from multiple plants, 30–50 g fresh weight, dry conditions if necessary, and proper labelling and despatch to ITE Merlewood.
  - 10.11 Freshwater sampling
    - Freshwater sampling is conducted by IFE staff; coordination with field survey teams to align timing within squares.

- Section 11: Photography
  - Each team has a camera; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and location relative to landmarks.
  - Use clear, permanent reference features; include square and plot identifiers on a visible board in each shot.
  - Photograph composition should balance plot coverage and reference features; avoid excessive sky.

- Section 12: Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks: review data sheets to ensure completeness; avoid reworking maps unless necessary.
  - Transferring FABs (Field Assessment Books) and samples to ITE stations should be arranged promptly to maintain data integrity.

- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step GPS data collection protocol:
    - Ensure sufficient satellite visibility and PDOP (preferably below 6 for 3D fixes).
    - Record stationary positions for plots and moving features for boundaries.
    - Create unique file names for each plot/feature (for example, square 501, plot X4 → 501X4.PSE) and document mobile features with appropriate codes.
    - Set data sampling rate and logging controls; manage start/stop of logging sessions.
  - Operational details include handling battery power, almanac updates, obstructions, and using the Magellan keypad for data entry.

- Data capture, codes, and taxonomic references
  - The handbook utilises extensive standardized code sets to describe land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, horticultural features, and taxa.
  - Mosses, lichens, and a broad range of vascular plants are catalogued with a structured, hierarchical code system (including dedicated sections for mosses/lichens and a long list of vascular plant species and vernacular groupings).
  - An attribute reference list and sheet provide quick access to plot identifiers and feature coding to streamline field data entry.

- Outputs and policy relevance
  - Data collected under CS2000 supports habitat monitoring, landscape change detection, and trend analysis across upland and lowland habitats.
  - The methodology aligns with broader policy frameworks and environmental monitoring needs, enabling rigorous assessment and informing management decisions.

- Scope and ongoing development
  - CS2000 represents iterative refinement of sampling, mapping, and plot-based monitoring to enhance detectability of habitat change and improve data quality.
  - Emphasises metadata, data sharing, and governance to support transparent, repeatable environmental monitoring.
