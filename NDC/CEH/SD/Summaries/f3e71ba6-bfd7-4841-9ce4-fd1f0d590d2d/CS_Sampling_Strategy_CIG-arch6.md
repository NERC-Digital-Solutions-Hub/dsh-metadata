# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Describe the sampling framework and land classification system underpinning Countryside Survey field work up to 2007, linking current methods to 30 years of time-series data and explaining how national and country-specific estimates are derived.

## Key concepts

- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain (GB) landscapes.
- ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical environmental stratification of GB used to divide the landscape into discrete classes for sampling.
- Use of centre squares (1 km x 1 km) with surrounding squares to classify land areas, enabling efficient field surveys across diverse habitats.
- Evolution of classifications and sampling to support policy needs and country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland, Isle of Man).

## Evolution by survey

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (32 classes)
  - Center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified (1228 squares classified; plus 4 surrounding squares each).
  - 256 field sample squares (8 per class) surveyed in a single field season.
  - National estimates of habitat areas derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class times the land area of that class.

- 1984 – Second field survey
  - 12 squares per Land Class (total 384) surveyed.
  - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; all features from 1984 plus repeat vegetation quadrats.
  - Land Cover Map of GB linked to the program.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (for CS1990 updates)
  - GB-wide extension to classify all squares; 40 Land Classes introduced.
  - Results enabling separate Scottish reporting; methodological notes on representativeness.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey CS2000
  - Separate country estimates introduced: England & Wales vs Scotland.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata adjusted to 40+ through sub-division/aggregation.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands module introduced for better upland habitat estimates.
  - Wales emphasized: sampling increased to improve Wales-only reporting.
  - Outputs include revised Land Class maps and enhanced country-specific reporting.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey CS2007
  - Wales-only reporting further refined; sub-division created five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata increased to 45; additional 43 Welsh squares added to ensure representation.
  - England adjustments to balance removal of Welsh squares; some classes in England reduced to minimal counts, with overall precision deemed acceptable.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; total Welsh squares increased significantly.
  - GB sample sizes reported at class/stratum levels; country-unit reporting formalized for policy relevance.

## Country-specific estimation and upland module

- Separate country estimates concept introduced to deliver England with Wales and Scotland-specific results, with adjustments to classify and sample accordingly.
- Wales-focused sub-classes and additional upland habitat module (CS2000) to improve accuracy for upland regions.
- The Wales sampling expansion continued into CS2007 to support Wales-only environmental policy and legislation needs.

## Outputs and data products

- Land Classification maps illustrating the current GB-wide and country-specific strata (e.g., figures showing revised class maps for England with Wales and Scotland).
- Sample square maps showing the distribution of survey sites across Land Classes (CS1990–CS2007 visualizations).
- Tables detailing sample sizes, strata areas, and sampling rates by survey year and country (e.g., CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
- Final survey reports for each period (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990 main report; CS2000 outputs; CS2007 UK results).

## National estimates and data consistency

- National estimates are derived from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land area of that class.
- Changing Land Classification across surveys affects consistency of national estimates; preferred approach is to use the latest classification for country estimates while maintaining consistency with historical reporting where appropriate.
- The appendix provides a detailed cross-year comparison of sample sizes per class under the original 1990 classification, illustrating how methodological shifts impact time-series comparability.
