# Estimation of the deposition of 137 Cs from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the UK prior to the Chernobyl accident uses the approach outlined in Wright et al. (1999)

- Objective
  - Estimate the deposition of 137 Cs from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the UK before the Chernobyl accident (1955-1985) using the approach described by Wright et al. (1999).

- Data sources
  - 137 Cs deposition records from the UK Atomic Energy Authority / AERE (1955-1997): 19 UK stations and 20 international stations.
  - Milford Haven (Wales, UK): chosen as representative for the UK due to complete quarterly deposition records (1955-1985).
  - Milford Haven quarterly 137 Cs deposition and quarterly total precipitation data (1955-1985).
  - UK precipitation data: UK Met Office gridded baseline climate variables (5 × 5 km resolution) derived from 30-year period 1961-1990.
  - UKCIP monthly total precipitation data to capture spatial variability in UK precipitation.

- Methodology
  - Calculate quarterly 137 Cs deposition to precipitation ratio at Milford Haven (1955-1985).
  - Apply this ratio to the UK’s average total quarterly precipitation to derive the spatial variability of 137 Cs input across the UK at 5 × 5 km resolution.
  - Combine quarterly 137 Cs deposition with pre-existing predicted 137 Cs deposition, then correct for physical decay (half-life = 30.2 years) to produce cumulative, decay-corrected 137 Cs deposition for the UK at 5 × 5 km resolution (1955-1985).

- Key outputs
  - A spatially resolved (5 × 5 km) estimate of cumulative 137 Cs deposition in the UK for 1955-1985.

- Assumptions and considerations
  - Milford Haven deposition/precipitation ratio is representative of UK-wide patterns.
  - Deposition scales with precipitation and can be extrapolated using UK precipitation data.
  - Decay correction uses a fixed 30.2-year half-life for 137 Cs.
  - Uses historical radioecological data to fill spatial gaps across the UK.
