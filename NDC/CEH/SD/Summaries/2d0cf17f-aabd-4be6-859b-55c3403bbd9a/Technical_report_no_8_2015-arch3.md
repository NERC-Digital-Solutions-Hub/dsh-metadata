# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

- This report documents internal and external quality assessment measures applied to three CLC2012 UK datasets: CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK-wide), CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands: Guernsey and Alderney), and CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).

## Internal quality control

- All work units (WUs) underwent a two-person interpretation workflow.
- An independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) rechecked each WU using the same imagery and ancillary data with InterCheck, providing feedback as exported shapefiles.
- Interpreters revised the WUs based on feedback; every WU was interpreted twice.

## External quality control results

- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) occurred: July 2013 and September 2014.
- Purpose: ensure UK production met standards for harmonised European CLC2012.
- Sampling: 3 WUs checked in 2013 (early work), and 4 WUs checked in 2014 (intervening work); total 7 WUs, representing 19% of UK coverage.
- Method: similar to internal checks, with detailed visual verification of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers using InterCheck; errors recorded as points in a shapefile and accompanied by verification reports.
- Outcome ratings for each WU: A (Accepted), CA (Conditionally Accepted), or R (Rejected) with explanations.

## Typical issues identified and lessons

- Revisions highlighted ongoing concerns with the CLC2006 layer, including:
  - Omissions of small/discontinuous built-up areas.
  - Missing infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Confusion between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121).
  - Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132).
  - Misclassifications in green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
  - Problems distinguishing arable (211) vs. pasture (231), and pasture (231) vs. natural grasslands (321).
  - Forest patches, boundaries, and mixed forest accuracy.
  - Unclear boundaries for moors/heathland (322) vs. natural grassland (321) and peatland (412).
  - Bare rocks (332) often needing reclassification as sparse vegetation (333).
  - Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) needing revisits.
- For change layers, key issues included missed changes and constraints due to imagery availability.
- Specific notes for the UK context:
  - Must use the latest IMAGE2012 imagery to map changes accurately.
  - Complex changes exceeding 5 hectares should be separated within polygons.

## Actions taken and improvements

- All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
- Two WUs that were rejected were re-interpreted by different interpreters after receiving additional IMAGE2012 imagery and verification feedback.
- General advice and remarks from verification were applied to subsequent WUs to ensure higher final data quality.

## Conclusions and implications for data governance

- The verification process underscored the importance of thorough revision of prior layers (CLC2006) and ensuring high-quality inputs (latest imagery) for accurate change detection.
- The combination of internal double-interpretation and external verification supports harmonisation and quality assurance across datasets, aligning with governance standards for data accuracy, transparency, and traceability.
- The project emphasized clear documentation of errors, correction workflows, and iterative re-interpretation to maintain dataset reliability.
