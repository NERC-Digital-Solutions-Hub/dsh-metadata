# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Executive Summary (key points)

- Report documents internal and external quality assessment for datasets: 
  - CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man)
  - CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Isles, Guernsey)
  - CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey)
- Purpose: ensure high-quality, harmonised CLC2012 data across Europe.

## Internal Quality Control

- Work Units (WUs) were interpreted twice by two different people.
- An independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) performed checks using InterCheck software with the same imagery and ancillary data as the initial interpreter.
- Feedback via exported shapefiles; interpreters revised accordingly before finalising each WU.

## External Quality Control

- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014.
- Verification covered 7 WUs initially (19% of UK coverage) and included 4 additional WUs later.
- Process mirrored internal checks: detailed visual verification of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers; errors recorded as points with attributes and fed back with verification reports.

## External Verification Results and Typical Issues

- Errors commonly involved in CLC2006 layer, including:
  - Omissions of discontinuous built-up areas (especially smaller towns)
  - Omissions of infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines)
  - Confusion between urban fabric (111) and Industry (121)
  - Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132)
  - Inaccuracies in green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142)
  - Misclassifications between arable (211) and pasture (231); between pasture (231) and natural grasslands (321)
  - Forest patches, boundaries, and mixed forest delineation
  - Boundaries of moors/heathland (322) with natural grassland (321) and peatland (412)
  - Bare rocks (332) often misclassified as sparse vegetation (333)
  - Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522)
- Changes mapping generally correct but some missed changes due to limitations in imagery; need to use IMAGE2012 imagery for change mapping and separate >5 ha changes in complex polygons.
- Details and specific failures reported in verification reports Büttner (2013, 2014).

## Actions Taken and Implications

- All identified errors were addressed; two WUs rejected were reinterpreted by different interpreters using updated IMAGE2012 imagery.
- Feedback and best-practice remarks applied to all subsequent WUs to ensure high-quality final database.
