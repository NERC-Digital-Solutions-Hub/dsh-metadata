# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 7

## Executive overview
- Metadata summary for three Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets covering the UK, Guernsey, and Jersey, focusing on the 2012 reference year and 2006–2012 changes.
- Datasets include three layers per region: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, and CLC2012.
- Metadata adheres to European and INSPIRE-aligned guidelines, with details on spatial reference systems, data provenance, and access conditions.
- Emphasizes provenance, data quality, and dissemination constraints to support governance, sharing, and reuse.

## Copernicus CORINE metadata (2012) and standards
- Abstract: CLC 2012 and 2006-2012 changes are produced under the Copernicus GMES programme for land monitoring; aims to provide consistent land cover information across Europe.
- Context: Part of the evolving 3-level Corine nomenclature (44 classes); minimum mapping units (MMU) for status layers 25 ha; LCC MMU 5 ha.
- Purpose: Supports environmental indicators, policy monitoring, and EU directives (e.g., biodiversity, climate, water directives).
- Metadata language and standards: Metadata language is English; complies with the EEA Metadata Profile and INSPIRE with some extended elements.
- Online metadata and identifiers: Metadata accessible at specified COPERNICUS/EEA links; File identifier CLC_metadata_UK; UTF-8 encoding.

## Metadata language, access, and governance
- Metadata language: eng; Character set: UTF-8
- Resource constraints and access:
  - Access governed by EU Regulation 1159/2013 (GMES) with licensing conditions; regulation updated by 377/2014 but legacy provisions apply.
  - Free, full, and open access is provided with conditions:
    - Users must acknowledge data source when distributing or communicating the data.
    - Users should not imply EU endorsement of their activities.
    - Modifications must be clearly stated.
- Purposeful openness within regulatory bounds facilitates reuse by data stewards and researchers.

## Provenance, lineage, and data quality
- Lineage: Update to UK CLC for reference year 2012; basis includes satellite imagery from 2011–2013 and supporting aerial imagery (e.g., Google Earth); previous national LCM updated in 2007; methodology follows EEA guidelines using InterChange for mapping CLC changes.
- Data quality considerations for governance:
  - No up-to-date national land cover map available at update; relies on 2011–2013 imagery for change detection.
  - Changes detection focuses on areas above 5 ha.
- Documentation of data work: Metadata and lineage provide traceability for auditing and reuse.

## Spatial and technical details
- Geographic extent: UK (including NI and Isle of Man); Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey)
- Spatial resolution: 1:100,000 denominator
- Coordinate systems vary by region (UK, Guernsey, Jersey) to support local GIS workflows
- Datum/CRS details captured for each dataset to ensure accurate georeferencing and interoperability

## Roles, contact, and acknowledgment
- Originator: University of Leicester (Centre for Landscape and Climate Research)
- Custodian: Defra
- Owner: European Commission - DG ENTR
- Point of contact: Involved organisations include University of Leicester, Defra, EEA, and EU institutions
- Acknowledgment: Funded by Defra and EEA under EU Copernicus programme grant; collaboration with Specto Natura

## Date and file-level metadata
- Metadata date stamp: 2015-01-09
- File identifiers and language: CLC_metadata_UK; eng; UTF-8

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Adheres to INSPIRE and EEA metadata guidelines, supporting discoverability and interoperability across regions.
- Provides clear governance signals: ownership, custodianship, licensing, and provenance.
- Highlights data availability constraints and the need for ongoing synchronization with up-to-date imagery.
- Demonstrates how to document multi-region datasets with varying projections and CRSs while maintaining consistent metadata quality.
