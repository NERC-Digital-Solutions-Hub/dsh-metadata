    - Filename: CLC2012_UK.mdb
    - Layers: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, CLC2012
    - Projection/System: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum: D_OSGB_1936
  - Dataset 2: Corine Land Cover 2006 (revised), 2012 and changes (2006-2012) for Guernsey
    - Filename: CLC2012_UK.mdb
    - Layers: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, CLC2012
    - Projection/System: Guernsey Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_WGS_1984; Datum: D_WGS_1984
  - Dataset 3: Corine Land Cover 2006 (revised), 2012 and changes (2006-2012) for Jersey

- Copernicus metadata context:
  - Date: 2015-01-09
  - Abstract: CLC 2012 and 2006-2012 change data; photointerpretation of satellite images (2011-2013) with supporting aerial imagery; 44 classes; MMU 25 ha for status layers; LCC change MMU 5 ha.
  - Purpose: Supports land monitoring, environmental indicators, policy evaluation, and EU-related reporting.

- Metadata and standards:
  - Metadata language: eng; metadata compliance with INSPIRE/EEA guidelines
  - Online resource references and contact points provided

- Data production and lineage:
  - Produced under Copernicus GMES framework; no up-to-date national land cover map available for 2012 UK update; uses InterChange for CLC mapping; UK LCM2007 used as reference for status data
  - Satellite data from 2011-2013; Google Earth imagery used to support interpretation

- Access, licensing, and restrictions:
  - Access governed by Regulation EU 1159/13 (and related adjustments). Free, full, and open access with attribution and clear statements if modified; EU ownership considerations apply for Copernicus data

- Geographic and technical details:
  - Extent: UK bounding box; Guernsey and Jersey regional extents
  - Spatial resolution: Denominator 100000 (map scale context)
  - Attribute schema: Includes CLC classification codes (level 3), area/hectares, length, and remarks/ID

- Data quality and usage notes:
  - Change detection emphasizes >5 ha changes
  - Standardized methodology aligned with EEA guidelines; dataset integration across the UK and Channel Islands
