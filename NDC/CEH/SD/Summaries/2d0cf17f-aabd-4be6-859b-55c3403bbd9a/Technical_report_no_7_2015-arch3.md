# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides metadata for Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets updated for the UK (including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man), Guernsey, and Jersey.
  - Documents the CLC 2012 dataset and changes from 2006–2012 to support environmental monitoring and policy analysis under the Copernicus framework.
  - Emphasizes metadata standards, data provenance, access conditions, and dataset lineage to support data governance in monitoring frameworks.

- Datasets covered
  - CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK, incl. NI and Isle of Man)
  - CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Guernsey) [Note: Guernsey dataset described; same three layers]
  - CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey) [Note: Jersey dataset described; same three layers]
  - All datasets include three layers:
    - CLC-Changes (2006–2012)
    - CLC2006revised
    - CLC2012

- Metadata standards and language
  - Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile; INSPIRE-compliant metadata with some extended elements.
  - Metadata language: English (eng), character set UTF-8.

- Data lineage and production
  - Updated for reference year 2012; objective to detect, identify, and map land cover changes above 5 ha.
  - Basis: satellite imagery from 2011–2013; aerial imagery (Google Earth) used to support interpretation.
  - Acknowledges absence of a fully up-to-date national land cover map prior to 2012 (last update 2007, LCM2007).

- Content parameters and coverage
  - Corine Land Cover (CLC) with 44 classes; MMU for status layers = 25 ha; MMU for land cover changes = 5 ha.
  - Minimum mapping unit for linear elements: 100 m.
  - European-scale integration into a seamless Europe-wide land cover map; supports monitoring of ecosystems, biodiversity, climate impacts, agriculture, and Water Framework Directive indicators.

- Geographic extent and resolution
  - Extent: West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84
  - Spatial reference: 1:100000 scale (denominator)

- Access, licensing, and data governance
  - Data access governed by EU Regulation No 1159/2013 (supplementing Regulation No 911/2010); aims to establish registration and licensing for GMES data.
  - Free, full, open data access under conditions:
    - Acknowledge the data source when distributing or communicating.
    - Do not imply official Union endorsement of user activities.
    - State clearly if data or information has been adapted or modified.
  - EU Copernicus ownership and publication considerations apply.

- Metadata authorship and contact
  - Metadata language: eng; contact points include University of Leicester (Originator), Defra (Custodian), European Environment Agency (Owner/Point of contact).
