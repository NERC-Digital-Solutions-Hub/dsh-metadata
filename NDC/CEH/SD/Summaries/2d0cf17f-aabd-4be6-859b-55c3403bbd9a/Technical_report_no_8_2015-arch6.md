# Technical Report No. 8

## Executive Summary
- The report documents internal and external quality assessment (QA) for three CLC2012 UK datasets: CLC2012_UK.mdb, CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb, and CLC2012_UK_JE.
- UK coverage includes England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, and the Isle of Man; Channel Islands, Guernsey, and Jersey are covered separately in two datasets.
- QA aimed to ensure data quality for harmonised European CLC2012 production and to support data quality culture across the UK project team.

## Internal quality control
- All mapping work units (WUs) underwent internal QA.
- Finishing checks were performed by an independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) using InterCheck software with the same imagery and ancillary data.
- Interpreters received and acted on feedback via exported shapefiles; each WU was interpreted twice by two different people.

## External quality control results
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) occurred in 2013 and 2014 to ensure UK outputs met European harmonisation standards.
- External checks covered 7 WUs in total (3 in 2013, 4 in 2014), representing about 19% of UK coverage.
- Verification followed a process similar to internal QA, using InterCheck for detailed visual checks against CLC2006 revisions and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers, with errors recorded and returned to interpreters.
- External findings highlighted that the main issues related to the CLC2006 layer (inheritance from earlier work) and guided subsequent revisions.

## Typical errors identified (CLC2006 and related layers)
- Omissions of discontinuous built-up areas, especially smaller towns.
- Omission of infrastructure elements (industries, airports, wind turbines).
- Confusion between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121).
- Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132).
- Inaccuracies in green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
- Misclassifications between arable (211) and pasture (231), and between pasture (231) and natural grasslands (321).
- Missing forest patches; imprecise forest boundaries; misclassification of mixed forest.
- Unclear boundaries among moors/heathlands (322), natural grassland (321), and peatland (412).
- Bare rocks (332) often reclassified as sparse vegetation (333).
- Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) required revisiting.

## Change mapping considerations
- Emphasis on using the latest IMAGE2012 imagery to map changes accurately.
- Ensure that changes greater than 5 hectares are separated from complex change polygons.

## Actions and outcomes
- All identified external errors were addressed and corrected.
- Two WUs initially rejected were re-interpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE2012 data.
- Feedback and remarks were applied to subsequent WUs to improve overall data quality.
