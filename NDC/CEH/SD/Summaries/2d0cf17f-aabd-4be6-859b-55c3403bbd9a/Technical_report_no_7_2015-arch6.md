# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

- Executive scope: Metadata for CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012 and the 2006-2012 changes, focusing on the UK (including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man) and Channel Islands (Guernsey and Jersey). Datasets include classification codes, area, length, and remarks/IDs in the attribute tables.

  - Abstract: CLC 2012 and 2006-2012 changes produced under the Copernicus GMES framework; 44 hierarchical classes; minimum mapping units; purpose includes land cover monitoring, environmental indicators, and EU policy support (e.g., biodiversity, climate change, Water Framework Directive).
  - Metadata standards: INSPIRE-compliant metadata with extended elements
  - Online resources and contact points: metadata language and hierarchy references available; primary contact and ownership details provided
- Key data characteristics
  - Attribute content: CLC classification codes (level 3), area (hectares), length, area of features, remarks, and ID
  - Extent and resolution: Geographic bounding box (-8.62 to 1.76 W/E; 49.88 to 60.84 S/N); spatial resolution nominally 1:100,000
  - Lineage: Uses 2011–2013 satellite imagery for interpretation; Google Earth imagery used to support interpretation; no up-to-date national map for 2012; previous update stems from 2007 (LCM2007); EEA guidelines followed; InterChange used for mapping CLC changes
- Access, licensing, and use constraints
  - Access limitations governed by EU Regulation (initial GMES licensing framework) with open access under conditions
  - Conditions for distribution to the public:
    1) Acknowledge data source
    2) Do not imply official Union endorsement of user activities
    3) State if data has been modified
  - Regulation references: 1159/13 (supplementing 911/2010; now repealed by 377/2014) and related articles; ownership and attribution requirements apply

- Practical implications for data support
  - Outputs include organized, self-describing datasets with multiple layers per region, suitable for integration into GIS workflows
  - Metadata provides essential context for data provenance, usage constraints, and harmonized standards guiding data discovery and reuse
