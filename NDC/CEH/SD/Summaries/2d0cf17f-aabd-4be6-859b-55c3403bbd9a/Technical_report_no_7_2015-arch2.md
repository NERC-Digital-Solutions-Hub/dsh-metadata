Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

## Overview
- Metadata for Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 and CLC change (2006-2012) datasets covering the UK and Crown dependencies (Guernsey and Jersey).
- Produced within the Copernicus (formerly GMES) land monitoring framework to provide consistent land cover information and change detection for environmental monitoring and policy support.
- Time series context: ongoing since 1990 with updates in 2000, 2006, and reference year 2012; designed to support environmental indicators and EU policy reporting.

## Dataset Content and Standards
- Attribute data include Corine Land Cover (CLC) level-3 classification codes, area (hectares), geometry length/area, remarks, and IDs.
- CLC characteristics:
  - 44 land cover classes, hierarchical three-level nomenclature
  - Minimum mapping unit (MMU): 25 ha for status layers; 5 ha for change layers
  - Change detection targets areas above 5 ha
- Purpose: generate consistent land cover and change inventories to support environmental monitoring, indicators, and EU policy reporting (e.g., biodiversity, climate, Water Framework Directive).

## Methodology and Data Sources
- Change detection for 2016-2012 reference year based on satellite imagery (2011-2013) and supported interpretation with aerial imagery (Google Earth).
- No up-to-date national land cover map available during this update; prior LCM from 2007 (LCM2007) used as a reference for revision.
- Followed EEA technical guidelines; used InterChange for mapping CLC changes.
