# Technical Report No. 8

## Executive Summary
- Datasets covered: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Isles and Guernsey), and (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Internal quality control: all work units (WUs) underwent internal QC; finished units were reviewed by independent photo-interpreter Geoff Smith using InterCheck with the same imagery/ancillary data; each WU interpreted twice by two different interpreters; feedback provided as exported shapefiles and implemented before finalisation.
- External quality control results: two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014; 7 WUs checked (3 in 2013, 4 in 2014), representing 19% of UK coverage; verification used the InterCheck software to compare CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers; errors were logged as points and sent back with verification reports.
- External verification findings (summary): table-based results identified typical errors, including omissions of small built-up areas, missing infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines), misclassification between urban fabric and industry, inaccuracies in mineral extraction and dumpsites, green urban areas and recreation areas, confusion between arable and pasture, pasture vs natural grasslands, forest boundary issues, and incorrect or unclear boundaries for moors/heathlands and peatlands; some issues in intertidal flats and estuaries; the need for thorough revision of the CLC2006 layer was emphasized.
- Change mapping notes: generally correct, but some missed changes due to imagery limitations; when mapping changes, ensure use of latest IMAGE2012 imagery and separate changes >5 ha from complex polygons; full details are available in Büttner (2013, 2014).
- Corrections and lessons: all identified errors were addressed; two WUs that were rejected were re-interpreted by a different interpreter after verification; remarks and general advice were applied to subsequent WUs to maintain high-quality outputs.
