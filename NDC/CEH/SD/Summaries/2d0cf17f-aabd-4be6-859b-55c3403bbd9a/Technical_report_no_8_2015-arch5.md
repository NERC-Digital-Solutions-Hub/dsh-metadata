# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Overview
- Reports internal and external quality assessment measures for datasets: 
  - CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man)
  - CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Isles)
  - CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey)
- Focus on ensuring data quality and harmonisation to support usable, discoverable datasets across Europe.

## Internal quality control
- All Working Units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
- Finished units sent to independent photo-interpreter Geoff Smith using InterCheck with the same imagery/ancillary data.
- Each WU was interpreted twice by two different interpreters; feedback returned as shapefiles and incorporated before finalisation.

## External quality control
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014.
- Checked 7 WUs (about 19% of UK coverage); included checks of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers.
- Verification process mirrored internal QC: detailed visual checks, errors recorded as points in a shapefile with attributes, plus a verification report.

## Findings and typical issues
- Common problems identified (in the CLC2006 layer) included:
  - Omissions of small built-up areas and infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines)
  - Confusion between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121)
  - Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132)
  - Issues with green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142)
  - Misclassification between arable (211) and pasture (231); between pasture (231) and natural grasslands (321)
  - Partial omissions of forest patches; imprecise forest boundaries; mixed forest classifications
  - Unclear boundaries for moors/heathland (322) vs natural grassland (321) and peatland (412)
  - Bare rocks (332) often misclassified as sparse vegetation (333)
  - Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) needing revisits
- Main takeaway: previous revision (CLC2006) contained inaccuracies requiring thorough revision.
- Change mapping generally correct, but a few missed changes due to limited imagery in early interpretations.
- Important methodological notes:
  - Use latest IMAGE2012 imagery for change mapping
  - Separate greater than 5 ha of change from complex change polygons
- Revisions:
  - All identified errors were addressed.
  - Two working units rejected and re-interpreted by a different interpreter using added IMAGE2012 imagery.
  - Feedback applied to subsequent work to ensure high-quality final dataset.

## Implications for data governance and sharing
- Demonstrates rigorous, auditable QC processes (internal and external) with traceable feedback loops.
- Highlights the importance of updating historical layers (e.g., CLC2006) to improve accuracy and harmonisation.
- Emphasises version control, update workflows, and documentation of validation results to support dataset discoverability and trustworthy reuse.
- Underlines need for consistent use of up-to-date imagery and clear criteria for handling complex changes and minor class distinctions.
