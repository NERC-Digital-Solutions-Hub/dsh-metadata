# Data Overview

- Project objectives: MERLIN aims to upscale and transform restoration of freshwater ecosystems in Europe by creating a framework for nature-based solutions. This dataset presents the first two years of water quality data from Hare Moss (peatland, Forth catchment) to implement a control–intervention approach and characterize baseline differences before restoration.

- Sampling locations and design:
  - Fortnightly sampling Dec 2021–May 2022 at two sites: Hare Burn downstream of restoration area (monitoring site) and Black Burn near Auchencorth Research Facility as control (monitored since 2006).
  - May 2022 added two more Hare Burn sites (upstream and downstream), total four sites.
  - Upstream peat extraction influences discuss erosion and bank collapse observed during the period.
  - Aug 2022 Hare Burn site discontinued; remaining: Hare Burn Upstream, Hare Burn Downstream, Black Burn.
  - Precise site coordinates provided; sites linked to Case Study 17 (Merlin dataset).

- In-field collection and parameters:
  - Water samples for total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved organic carbon/total dissolved nitrogen (DOC/TdN) collected mid-stream; multiple bottle types and filtration steps described.
  - Dissolved greenhouse gas samples collected in duplicate via headspace method.
  - In-field measurements: pH, electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature using a portable multimeter; in-situ calibration procedures noted.
  - Majority of field collection conducted by specified researchers.

- Sample storage:
  - TP, SRP, and spare filtered samples frozen at -18°C.
  - DOC and POC stored at 4°C and analyzed within a week.
  - Greenhouse gas samples stored at room temperature until batch analysis.

- Sample analysis and methods:
  - DOC and TdN: Shimadzu TOC-LCPH with NPOC/TN method; standards and blanks used; duplicate measurements with outlier handling.
  - UV/Vis and SUVA: Absorbance from 230–800 nm; SUVA254 calculated to indicate DOC aromaticity.
  - Particulate Organic Carbon (POC): Filtration, pre-combustion of filters, LOI-based CO conversion (0.58 factor) for mg/L POC.
  - Total Phosphorus (TP) and SRP: Acid digestion with potassium persulfate; colorimetric molybdenum-blue method; AQ2 analyzer calibrated with standards; blanks and multiple standards.
  - Dissolved greenhouse gases (CH4, CO2, N2O): Analyzed by GC (FID for CH4/CO2, μECD for N2O); concentrations converted to µg/L using Henry’s law.

- Nature and units of recorded values:
  - Data organized with site, date, time, and field measurements (pH, pH temp, DO, DO%, DO temp, conductivity, cond temp, temperature averages).
  - Lab results for DOC, TdN, C:N, Abs254, SUVA, TP, SRP, CH4, CO2, N2O, POC; explicit unit definitions provided for each variable.

- Dataset completeness and data quality:
  - Documented data exclusions due to instrument issues, sampling gaps, or abnormal results (e.g., N2O below LOD, pH probe failures, sample contamination, in-lab measurements).
  - Exclusion table lists dates, sites, determinants, and reasons for removal to ensure traceability.

- Accessibility and metadata:
  - Data are recorded with detailed column descriptions and units (Table 3) and are associated with the MERLIN project (Horizon 2020 grant No 101036337).
  - Dataset notes acknowledge potential limitations due to local-scale variation, peat extraction influence, and IT/lab equipment constraints.
