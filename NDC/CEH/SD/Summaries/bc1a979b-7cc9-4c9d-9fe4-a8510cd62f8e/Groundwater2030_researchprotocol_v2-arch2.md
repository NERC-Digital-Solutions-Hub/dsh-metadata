# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Aim
  - Conduct a follow-up survey to assess groundwater quality and well integrity in Kisumu, Kenya, integrating sanitary risk inspection, water quality testing, and owner/customer interviews.
  - Expand sampling to additional neighbourhoods beyond Manyatta and Migosi to evaluate patterns of groundwater use and safety.

- Study design and scope
  - Collaborative project among University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST, and University of Surrey.
  - Two components: repeat sanitary risk inspection + water quality testing; and questionnaire interviews with well owners and with neighbours who purchase groundwater.
  - Builds on the 2002–2004 baseline study; includes a small pilot expansion to other neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.

- Materials and data collection tools
  - Archived instruments:
    - Groundwater source survey pro-forma.
    - Well owner questionnaire.
    - Well customer questionnaire.
  - Additional data collection elements included in interviews (assets/services, food poverty indicators).

- Sampling strategy
  - Sampling frame based on the earlier 2002–2004 study; extended to new neighbourhoods.
  - Groundwater sources selected by random point in each neighbourhood; closest source chosen.
  - Boreholes selected using groundwater abstraction licence records.
  - Total tested: 73 groundwater sources (up from 51 in the earlier study).
  - Participants: adults aged 18+ who are either well owners or groundwater customers; 137 customer interviews conducted.

- Participants
  - Groundwater source owners and consumers in Kisumu’s peri-urban neighbourhoods (Manyatta, Migosi; with additions in Nyalenda and Bandani).
  - Inclusion: adults (18+), resident in selected neighbourhoods, owner or consumer of a groundwater source.

- Procedures and timeline
  - Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop to communicate objectives and outputs.
  - Dec 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo/Kiswahili.
  - Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and administering questionnaires.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork to identify sources, obtain owner consent, geolocate wells, capture photos, and record depth where feasible.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Sanitary risk assessment conducted; two water samples collected per source (one for on-site conductivity, one for lab analysis).
  - Lab processing performed at VIRED International and University of Surrey; microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants tested.
  - Concurrent owner/customer interviews to describe groundwater use, handling, other water sources, and assets/services access; include an instrument mirroring Demographic Health Survey components and poverty indicators.
  - July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with well owners and community groups.
  - Note: The document includes a versioning reference with a 28 Apr 2015 version.

- Data collection and measurements
  - On-site sanitary risk inspection of each well (hazards at the head and surroundings).
  - Water sampling: two samples per source (conductivity measurement on-site; second sample for laboratory analysis).
  - Laboratory analyses: microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - Geolocation: GPS coordinates; photography; depth measurements where possible.
  - Owner and customer questionnaires to capture groundwater use patterns, handling practices, other water sources, and asset/poverty indicators.

- Data management and archiving
  - Use of standardized forms and checklists archived with the study.
  - Data collected across site visits, laboratory results, and questionnaire responses stored for analysis and reporting.
  - Maps and spatial data referenced from earlier studies to locate wells and compare changes over time.

- Ethical considerations
  - Informed consent obtained from well owners and, where applicable, from groundwater customers.
  - Information sheets provided; translation ensured; participants could decline without consequence.

- Intended outputs and policy relevance
  - Provide standardized environmental health indicators to assess groundwater safety over time.
  - Identify actionable sanitary risk factors at wells (e.g., missing covers) and convey simple remediation recommendations to owners.
  - Generate spatial and household-use datasets suitable for policy review and monitoring of peri-urban groundwater safety.
  - Disseminate findings through stakeholder workshops aimed at communities and local groups, contributing to ongoing environmental health monitoring efforts.
