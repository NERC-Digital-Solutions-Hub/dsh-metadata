# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A multi-institutional study in Kisumu, Kenya, designed as a follow-up to a 2002-2004 water quality and well integrity survey.
- Aims to assess current groundwater safety, patterns of groundwater use, and changes since the baseline, to inform policy and future decisions.

## Aims and Rationale
- Re-survey groundwater sources from the original study and expand to additional neighbourhoods (Manyatta, Migosi, Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.
- Combine sanitary risk inspection, water quality testing, and owner/customer interviews to describe contamination hazards, usage patterns, and socio-economic factors (e.g., food poverty proxies).
- Generate data suitable for informing groundwater management and public health planning.

## Methodology Overview
- Structure: two main components
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing of previously sampled wells; add new wells.
  - Questionnaires with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with customers to describe usage, handling, and alternative water sources.
- Study design: follow-up and expansion of the baseline study; aims to observe changes over roughly a decade.

## Sampling and Study Sites
- Groundwater sources: 73 sources tested in total (expanded from 51 in the baseline study).
- Selection approach:
  - Revisit wells from the 2002-04 study in Manyatta and Migosi.
  - Random point method to select wells in other neighbourhoods; boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority licensing records.
- Participants:
  - Well owners (adults, 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (adults 18+), from households that purchase water or from owners who sell to neighbours.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.

## Data Collection Tools and Procedures
- Tools archived with the protocol:
  - Pro-forma survey for groundwater source.
  - Owner questionnaire.
  - Customer questionnaire.
- Field procedures:
  - Start-up stakeholder workshop (Sept 2013) with owners’ associations and community groups.
  - Translation of questionnaires (Dec 2013) and training for consent and administration (Jan 2014).
  - Site visits (Feb–Mar 2014): identify wells, obtain informed consent, record GPS location, take photos, and measure water depth where feasible.
  - Sanitary risk assessment conducted on-site via a structured checklist.
  - Water sampling: two samples per well (one for on-site EC measurement, one for laboratory testing); samples tested for thermotolerant coliforms (microbiological) and chemical contaminants at VIRED International and University of Surrey labs.
  - Owner interviews: water abstraction rate, usage/handling, other water sources, asset/services access (including some health/poverty-related questions).
  - Customer interviews: usage patterns of purchased groundwater and other sources; asset/services access.
- Documentation: ongoing notes on changes to wells since 2004, including any remedial advice given to owners.

## Timeline and Workplan
- 13 Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop.
- Dec 2013: Sample selection; questionnaire translation.
- Jan 2014: Training on informed consent and instrument administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Field data collection and sample processing; concurrent owner and customer interviews.
- Apr 28, 2015: Version 3 of protocol.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop planned.

## Measurements and Outputs
- Environmental health measures:
  - Sanitary risk indicators at the wellhead and surrounding area.
  - Microbiological contamination (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants in groundwater.
  - On-site electrical conductivity (EC) readings as a quick water quality proxy.
- Usage and exposure indicators:
  - Amount of water abstracted per day.
  - Water handling and use patterns, including alternative water sources (piped utility water, rainwater).
  - Socio-economic indicators through an asset/services questionnaire and poverty-related questions.
- Data integration:
  - Comparison with baseline data from 2002-04 to assess changes over time.
  - Spatial context through GPS coordinates and mapping to neighbourhoods.

## Ethics, Consent, and Engagement
- Informed consent obtained from well owners; information sheets provided in local languages.
- Participation and non-participation recorded; replacement wells or nearby customers engaged if initial participants declined.
- Stakeholder involvement through start-up and final dissemination workshops to ensure findings inform local policy and community action.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates identification of practical, policy-relevant monitoring measures (sanitary risk, microbial/chemical quality, usage patterns).
- Combines repeated measurements with broader socio-economic and usage information to support decision-making.
- Addresses data quality and governance concerns typical for monitoring frameworks:
  - Use of validated checklists, standardized questionnaires, and laboratory analyses.
  - Clear data collection responsibilities across collaborating institutions.
  - Sample frame linked to prior baseline work to enable trend analysis.
- Highlights data access considerations (consent, sharing of underlying data) and the importance of stakeholder engagement for effective monitoring deployments.
