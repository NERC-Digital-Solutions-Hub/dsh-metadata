# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

- A set of field data collection instruments for groundwater surveys, including forms to record well characteristics, water sample results, owner information, and customer information, plus a comprehensive well survey with a sanitary risk inspection component.
- Designed for surveyors to capture current data and compare with past data (e.g., changes since 2004) while ensuring consent and ethical engagement with water source owners.

## Forms Included

- Well characteristics recording form (for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells)
- Water sample results form (for laboratory use)
- Well owner questionnaire
- Well customer questionnaire

## Well Survey Form – Key Fields and Workflow

- Surveyor and timing
  - Surveyor name, date (dd/mm/yy), area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other)
  - Well ID
  - Is the source a borehole? Yes/No
- Source availability and consent
  - If part of the original survey, is it still available for sampling? Yes/No/New well not in 2002 survey/not sure
  - If not available, provide explanatory note
  - If available, capture current owner name and consent to participate (consented / did not consent / not available for interview)
  - If consent given: note changes to the well/groundwater source since 2004
- Measurements and sampling
  - Well depth (m)
  - Electroconductivity (EC) reading (ms)
  - Sample ID number (to be written on bottle)
  - Rain status (today / yesterday / both yesterday and today / neither day)

## Sanitary Risk Inspection – Scope and Indicators

- Applicable to boreholes and shallow dug wells
  - Cement floor proximity to well (within 1.5 m)
  - Ponding on cement floor
  - Cracks in cement floor potentially allowing ingress
  - Pump security at base (loose/secure)
  - Ponding beyond cement floor within 3 m
  - Drainage channel condition (cracked/needs cleaning)
  - Animal access within 10 m (fence present)
  - Latrines within 10 m (number required)
  - Additional latrines within 30 m (number required)
  - Open water sources within 20 m
  - Uncapped wells within 30 m
  - Scattered waste within 30 m
  - Waste dumps within 30 m
- Dug wells only
  - Cover unsanitary? (Yes/No)
  - Walls inadequately sealed below ground level? (Yes/No)
- Coding for responses
  - Yes = 1, No = 0, Not applicable = 8, Not sure = 9
- Quantitative notes
  - How many latrines within specified distances
  - Other numeric fields as applicable

## Data Capture and Documentation

- Sample identifiers and field notes are recorded for traceability
- Date formats and measurement units standardized (e.g., depth in meters, EC in ms)

## Consent, Ethics, and Participation

- Participant information sheet is read prior to consent
- Consent status recorded for water source owners (participate / not participate / not available)

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications

- Standardization and consistency
  - Use uniform coding (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure) and ensure unit consistency across forms
- Metadata and provenance
  - Capture survey date, area, well ID, and changes since prior surveys to enable longitudinal analyses
- Data linkage and traceability
  - Align sample IDs with laboratory results and field observations
- Consent and privacy
  - Document owner consent status and ensure ethical handling of interview data
- Update and governance
  - Facilitate updates to well status, new sampling opportunities, and replacement of unavailable sources
- Interoperability considerations
  - Structured fields and clear definitions to support sharing across portals and data catalogues
- Practical data quality considerations
  - Address potential gaps when sources are unavailable, and document reasons for non-collection or new wells not in prior surveys
