# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A collaborative follow-up study in Kisumu, Kenya, extending a 2002–2004 water quality and sanitary survey to reassess groundwater sources, with additional user perspectives.

## Study design and aims

- Purpose: Repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing for wells from the earlier study, plus questionnaire interviews with well owners and a sample of neighbouring groundwater customers to describe usage patterns.
- Components:
  - Reassessment of existing wells (Manyatta and Migosi) with updated water quality data and sanitary risk observations.
  - Expanded sampling to other Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; inclusion of owner and user interviews.
- Collaborating institutions: University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.
- Data intent: Produce data products (datasets, analyses, dashboards/reports) to support understanding of groundwater safety and usage for decision-making.

## Data collection and measurement tools

- Archived measurement tools:
  - Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source.
  - Owner questionnaire (groundwater source owners).
  - Customer questionnaire (buyers of groundwater).
- Data collection methods:
  - Sanitary risk inspection (field observations of hazards at the well head and surroundings).
  - On-site water quality testing (electro-conductivity) and laboratory analysis for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - GPS location, photo documentation, and depth measurements where feasible.
  - Interviews with well owners about usage, abstraction, handling, alternative water sources, and assets/services access.
  - Interviews with groundwater customers about use, handling, and access, plus household-level assets and food security indicators (following DHS-like instruments).
- Materials and data archiving: Tools and questionnaires are archived alongside the protocol for transparency and reuse.

## Sampling and participants

- Sampling frame and scope:
  - Original wells from 2002–2004 (Manyatta and Migosi) revisited; expanded to include Nyalenda, Bandani, and boreholes.
  - Groundwater sources selected by random point within each neighbourhood; boreholes selected via groundwater abstraction licence records.
  - Total wells tested: 73 (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (adults 18+), sampled from households that purchase water from identified wells.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.
- Inclusion criteria:
  - Adults aged 18+, residents of the selected neighbourhoods, and either owners or consumers of groundwater sources.
- Recruitment: Through home visits; if a customer was present, invited to participate; otherwise replaced by a neighboring customer.

## Procedures and timeline

- September 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and outline objectives.
- December 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and administering questionnaires.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork to locate wells, confirm owner participation, obtain consent, collect GPS data, photos, and depth data; perform sanitary risk inspections; collect two water samples for lab analysis.
- February–March 2014: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and, where groundwater was sold, nearby customers; administer owner and customer questionnaires; collect data on usage, other water sources, and assets/services.
- April 28, 2015 (Version 3): Updates and continued data handling.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with stakeholders.

## Data management, quality, and analysis

- Data types:
  - Field observations (sanitary risk assessments).
  - Environmental water quality data (electro-conductivity on-site; lab results for thermotolerant coliforms and chemicals).
  - Questionnaire responses from well owners and customers.
  - Geospatial data (GPS coordinates) and site imagery.
  - Temporal notes on changes to wells since 2004.
- Sample size considerations:
  - No statistical power calculations for sampling; the study is partly follow-up of existing wells and partly a pilot expansion to new neighbourhoods.
  - Rough power calculations by the study team suggest >0.9 power to detect a 0.5 log change in faecal coliform levels, under assumptions similar to baseline variation.
- Analysis approach (implied):
  - Comparisons over time between baseline (2002–2004) and follow-up data for specific wells.
  - Spatial analysis referenced from related work (e.g., Wright et al., 2013) to examine relationships between pit latrine density, wells, and contamination.
  - Integration of owner-reported usage with water quality data to assess risk and usage patterns.
- Outputs and dissemination:
  - Data products (datasets, maps, summaries) for end-user exploration.
  - Stakeholder workshops and dissemination events to share results and implications.

## Key data variables and outputs (what data enables)

- Well-level data: location, depth, sanitary risk score, ownership status, changes since 2004.
- Water quality: electro-conductivity (field), thermotolerant coliform counts, chemical contaminants.
- Ownership and usage: abstraction rates, handling practices, alternative water sources, sale/export patterns.
- Customer perspectives: consumption patterns, quantity sourced from wells, handling practices, access to assets and services (including food security indicators).
- Data products: dashboards/reports enabling self-serve exploration and policy-relevant insights for groundwater safety and management.

## Relevance to data support

- Demonstrates end-to-end data workflow:
  - Designing data collection instruments, coordinating multi-institution collaboration, and capturing both qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (lab and field measurements) data.
  - Managing data across multiple sources (field forms, lab results, GPS, questionnaires) and linking them at the well and customer level.
  - Producing usable data products for stakeholders to explore groundwater safety, usage patterns, and related socio-economic factors.
- Highlights data challenges common to practice:
  - Linking longitudinal baseline data with follow-up measurements.
  - Ensuring consent, translations, and participant recruitment across communities.
  - Archiving diverse data formats for future reuse.
