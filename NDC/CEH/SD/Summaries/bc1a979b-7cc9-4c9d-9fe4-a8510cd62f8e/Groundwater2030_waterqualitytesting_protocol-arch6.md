# Water Quality Sampling and Laboratory Analyses Methods

## Sample collection and field measurements
- Approximately 500 mL water samples collected from each well using a stainless steel sampling cup rinsed several times in the well-water; transferred to sterile plastic bottles and stored on ice, in the dark, until reaching the laboratory; all samples processed within seven hours.
- Microbiology sample collected before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.
- pH measured with a Hanna Instruments HI-98128 Pocket pHep5 Water Resistant pH Tester; integrated thermometer used for temperature; thermometer not calibrated.
- Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at each well with an accessible dipper probe; measurements adjusted to account for plinth depth; depth to water calculated from the difference between readings.
- Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter, calibrated with appropriate standards.
- Turbidity measured with a Hanna Instruments HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; sample cell rinsed between samples and with the sample three times prior to reading.

## Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods
- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) isolated and quantified using the membrane filtration method with Membrane Lauryl Sulphate Broth (MLSB); 100 mL of sample or suitable dilution filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardised to 100 mL; no further confirmation tests performed.
- Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured using a Palintest photometer model 7100 with dedicated reagents, following manufacturer instructions.

## Calibration steps and values
- Incubator temperature of the DelAgua Water Test Kit checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign; checked every two days during the campaign using a liquid thermometer; the thermometer used for calibrating the incubator had not itself been calibrated against a reference thermometer.
- pH meter calibrated every morning using standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standard solutions traceable to N.I.S.T.
- Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard solution; checked each morning with the same standard and recalibrated if readings varied.
- Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard supplied by the meter manufacturer.

## Quality control
- Analytical quality control was challenging given available facilities.
- Sample blanks run for each analytical method (including microbiological tests); where batch size allowed (DelAgua kit max 16 samples), duplicate analyses were performed for repeatability.
- All tests conducted by the same analyst during a campaign to reduce inter-analyst variation.
