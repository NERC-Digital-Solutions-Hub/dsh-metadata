# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Objective and collaboration
- Follow-up study to the 2002–2004 groundwater quality and well-structural integrity survey in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Two components: repeat sanitary risk inspection and water quality testing; interviews with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with neighboring customers.
- Collaborating institutions: University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.
- Funders: Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.

## Data collection instruments and metadata
- Archived measurement tools:
  - Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source.
  - Owner interview questionnaire.
  - Customer interview questionnaire.
- Data elements and measurements:
  - Groundwater source location (GPS), photograph, and depth (where feasible).
  - Sanitary risk inspection results (observational checklist at the wellhead and surroundings).
  - Water samples: two per source (electro-conductivity on-site; chemical and microbiological analyses in the laboratory).
- Documentation of changes since 2004 (by the same field team when revisiting sites).
- Translation and data capture in local languages (Luo and Kiswahili).

## Sampling frame and participants
- Sampling frame extended from 51 sources in 2002–2004 to 73 sources in total, including new neighbourhoods (Nyalenda and Bandani) and boreholes.
- Source selection:
  - Random point method within each neighbourhood; nearest groundwater source chosen.
  - Boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction licence records.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners and adult consumers (18+ years).
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed; some participants from the 2002–2004 study re-enrolled; others newly recruited due to ownership changes.

## Procedures and ethical considerations
- Start-up stakeholder workshop (Sept 2013) to communicate objectives and outputs.
- Sample selection (Dec 2013); questionnaires translated and back-translated.
- Informed consent:
  - JOOUST-led team obtained consent; participant information sheets provided and signed.
  - If a well owner declined or the source no longer existed, a neighboring source was approached.
- Field procedures (Feb–Mar 2014):
  - Randomly identify owner, confirm consent, record GPS, capture photos, measure depth, perform sanitary risk assessment.
  - Collect two water samples per source for laboratory analysis.
  - Interview well owners about water use, other water sources, assets/services, and food poverty indicators.
  - Interview neighbouring customers about water use, handling, and access to assets/services.
- Subsequent steps:
  - Return to previously studied sources to verify changes and repeat data collection where possible.
  - Final dissemination workshop organized (July 2014).

## Data management, quality assurance, and archiving
- Materials and instruments archived alongside the protocol (Version 3 dated 28 Apr 2015).
- Data collection and processing workflow:
  - Data gathered by VIRED International and University of Surrey; JOOUST-led team conducted owner/customer interviews.
  - On-site data (GPS, depth, photos, sanitary risk) merged with laboratory results (microbiological and chemical contaminants) and questionnaire data.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Consistent use of standardized instruments across sites and timepoints.
  - Documentation of changes over time to support longitudinal interpretation.
  - Translations and cultural considerations addressed to ensure accurate data capture.

## Timeline and dissemination
- Sept 2013: Start-up workshop.
- Dec 2013–Jan 2014: Sample selection, instrument translation, and training of JOOUST students for consent and interview administration.
- Feb–Mar 2014: Field data collection and initial data processing; owner and customer interviews conducted.
- Apr 2015: Version 3 of protocol released.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with communities and stakeholders.

## Key data points and variables (for stewardship and reuse)
- Location and physical characteristics:
  - Source coordinates, site photos, depth measurements.
- Sanitary and contamination risk:
  - Sanitary risk inspection results (headwork and surroundings).
- Water quality data:
  - On-site electro-conductivity; laboratory results for microbiological and chemical contaminants.
- Q&A data:
  - Well owner questionnaire (water use, abstraction rates, other water sources, assets/services).
  - Well customer questionnaire (water handling, other sources, assets/services, food poverty indicators).
- Temporal and provenance context:
  - Changes since 2004, field team identity, and cross-site consistency (re-visited sources vs. new neighbourhoods).
- Ethical and linguistic considerations:
  - Informed consent, participant information sheets, translation into Luo and Kiswahili.
