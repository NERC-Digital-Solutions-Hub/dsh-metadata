# Sample collection and fieldwork:

## Field sampling and sample handling
- Approximately 500 mL water samples collected from each well using a rinsed stainless steel cup; transferred to sterile bottles; stored on ice in the dark; processed within 7 hours.
- Microbiology sample taken before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.

## Measurements and instrumentation (field)
- pH measured with a Hanna HI-98128 Pocket pHep5; calibrated with standard solutions; integrated digital thermometer used for water temperature (thermometer was not calibrated).
- Depth to water below ground level (bgl) measured at an accessible dipper point; probe lowered until alarm; depth recorded from calibrated tape and adjusted for plinth height; water depth calculated as difference between surface and bottom readings.
- Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter calibrated with standard solutions.
- Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; sample cell rinsed with distilled water between samples and three times with the sample before reading.

## Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods
- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 mL sample (or dilution) filtered and incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardised to 100 mL; no further confirmation tests.
- Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured with a Palintest photometer 7100 using dedicated reagents, following manufacturer instructions.

## Calibration steps and values
- Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign; checked every two days with a liquid thermometer (thermometer used for incubator calibration was not itself calibrated against a reference thermometer).
- pH meter calibrated every morning with standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; standards traceable to NIST.
- Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked each morning; recalibrated if readings varied.
- Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard.

## Quality control
- Analytical QC challenging given facilities; blanks run for each method; where possible, duplicate analyses conducted on the first and last sample of a batch to assess repeatability.
- Tests conducted by the same analyst throughout a campaign to reduce variation.

## GIS considerations and data quality implications
- Data are linked to wells and include spatially relevant measurements (location implied by wells), timestamps, field measurements (pH, temperature, depth, conductivity, turbidity), and lab results (TTC counts, nitrate, chloride, etc.), enabling map-based visualization of groundwater quality.
- Calibration and QA metadata (e.g., thermometer calibration status, daily instrument calibration, blanks, replicates) are essential for GIS data quality and traceability.
- Potential data integration challenges for GIS workflows include inconsistent data standards, missing values, varying resolutions, and the need for consistent units and metadata across campaigns.
