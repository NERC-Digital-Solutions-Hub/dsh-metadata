# Sample collection and fieldwork

- Approximately 500 ml water samples were collected from each well using a rinsed stainless steel sampling cup and transferred to sterile bottles on ice, kept in the dark, and processed within seven hours.
- Microbiology samples were taken before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.
- pH was measured with a Hanna HI-98128 pH tester; water temperature was recorded using an integrated thermometer (not calibrated).
- Depth to water (bgl) was measured at each well with a dipper probe on a calibrated tape, adjusted for plinth height, and depth of water calculated as the difference between surface and bottom readings.
- Conductivity was measured with a COND3110 handheld meter, calibrated with standard solutions.
- Turbidity was measured with a Hanna HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; the sample cell was rinsed with distilled water between samples and then three times with the sample before reading.

## Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods

- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) were isolated and quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours, then colonies counted and standardised to 100 ml. No additional confirmation tests were performed.
- Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations were measured with a Palintest photometer model 7100 using dedicated reagents and manufacturer instructions.

## Calibration steps and values

- Incubator temperature for the DelAgua kit was checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign and rechecked every two days; the thermometer used for incubator calibration had not itself been calibrated against a reference thermometer.
- pH meter was calibrated every morning with fresh standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0, with solutions traceable to NIST.
- Conductivity meter calibration occurred before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard solution and daily checks; recalibration was performed if readings varied from the standard.
- Turbidity meter was calibrated each morning using a formazin standard provided by the manufacturer.

## Quality control

- Analytical quality control was challenging due to facility limitations.
- Blanks were run for each method, including microbiological analyses; when possible (kit capacity up to 16 samples), duplicates were analyzed for repeatability.
- During campaigns, the same analyst performed the tests to reduce intra-campaign variation.
