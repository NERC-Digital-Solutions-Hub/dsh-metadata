# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Aim and context
- Follow-up study to a 2002–2004 water quality and well integrity survey in Kisumu, Kenya.
- Objectives: reassess sanitary risk at wells, test water quality, and describe groundwater use patterns through owner and neighbouring customer interviews.
- Collaboration: University of Southampton (coordinating), VIRED International (Kenya), JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey (UK); funders: NERC/DFID.

## Study design and scope
- Two-component design:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspection and water quality testing at wells from the earlier study.
  - Questionnaire interviews with well owners and with adults who buy groundwater from these wells.
- Expanded sampling beyond the initial two neighbourhoods (Manyatta and Migosi) to Nyalenda and Bandani, including boreholes.
- Follow-up/pilot nature for broader Kisumu support rather than fully powered survey.

## Sampling frame and participants
- Sampling: groundwater sources revisited from 2002–2004; new sources selected via random points within each neighbourhood; boreholes chosen from Water Resource Management Authority records.
- Coverage: 73 groundwater sources tested (up from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults, 18+).
  - Groundwater customers (neighbouring households purchasing well water; 137 customers interviewed in total).

## Data collection tools and materials
- Pro-forma survey for groundwater sources.
- Owner questionnaire (interviews with well owners).
- Customer questionnaire (interviews with water purchasers).
- Supporting field forms: GPS location, depth measurement, safety photography.
- Measurement of on-site electro-conductivity; laboratory analysis for microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Questionnaires aligned with prior tools (e.g., Demographic and Health Survey style) and poverty indicators (food poverty instrument).

## Procedures and timeline
- 13 September 2013: Stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and engagement.
- December 2013: Sample selection; translations to Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and questionnaire administration.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork to locate sources, obtain consent, record GPS/photos, perform sanitary risk inspections, collect and transport water samples for lab analysis; owners interviewed about usage, abstraction, and assets; customers interviewed about consumption and handling.
- 28 April 2015: Version 3 of the protocol released; July 2014: Final dissemination workshop.
  
## Data collection and analyses (data types and variables)
- Sanitary risk data: contamination hazards at well head and surroundings.
- Water quality data: two samples per source.
  - On-site measurement: electro-conductivity.
  - Lab analyses: thermotolerant coliforms (microbiological indicators) and chemical contaminants.
- Usage and management data: volume abstracted per day, methods of use, other water sources (piped, rainwater).
- Asset and service indicators: access to assets and services (including food poverty indicators).
- Customer data: patterns of water use, handling, and relationship to owners; demographics of households.

## Location, scale, and data quality considerations
- Setting: Kisumu, Kenya, peri-urban context.
- Scale: follow-up to previous dataset with expanded neighbourhood coverage; inclusion of boreholes increases representativeness.
- Data quality measures: standardized pro-forma and questionnaires; GPS tagging; consistency with earlier study to enable temporal comparisons; consent procedures and translation to local languages to support reliable responses.

## Ethical and governance notes
- Informed consent obtained from all study participants; access to and confidentiality of owner/customer data ensured.
- Field activities conducted with local community engagement and dissemination events to share findings.

## Outputs and references
- Data collected to enable spatial and temporal analyses of groundwater contamination risk and usage patterns.
- References underpinning methods and instruments include Wright et al. (2013) and Zeller et al. (2003).
