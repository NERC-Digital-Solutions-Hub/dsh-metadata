# Sample collection and fieldwork:

- Approximately 500 ml water samples collected from each well using a stainless steel sampling cup rinsed multiple times in well-water; transferred to sterile plastic bottles and stored on ice, in the dark; samples processed within seven hours; microbiology samples taken before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.
- pH and water temperature measured with a Hanna HI-98128 Pocket pHep5 meter; integrated thermometer present but not calibrated.
- Depth to water level (bgl) measured at each well using a dipper probe and calibrated tape; readings adjusted for plinth depth; bottom depth determined from the difference between surface and bottom readings.
- Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter, calibrated with appropriate standard solutions.
- Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; sample cell rinsed with distilled water between samples and three times with sample before reading.

## Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods

- Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) isolated and quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml (or appropriate dilution) filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane; membranes incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted within 15 minutes and standardised to 100 ml; no confirmatory tests performed.
- Nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured with a Palintest photometer model 7100 using dedicated reagents, following manufacturer instructions.

## Calibration steps and values

- Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each sampling campaign; checked every two days during the campaign; the thermometer used for incubator calibration had not itself been calibrated against a reference thermometer.
- pH meter calibrated every morning with fresh buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; buffers traceable to NIST.
- Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked each morning with the same standard; recalibrated if readings varied.
- Turbidity meter calibrated each morning against a formazin standard provided by the meter manufacturer.

## Quality control

- Analytical quality control was challenging due to available facilities.
- Sample blanks run for each method, including microbiological tests.
- When batch size allowed (DelAgua kit supports up to 16 samples), duplicate analyses performed on the first and last samples to assess repeatability.
- During each campaign, all tests performed by the same analyst to reduce inter-operator variation.
