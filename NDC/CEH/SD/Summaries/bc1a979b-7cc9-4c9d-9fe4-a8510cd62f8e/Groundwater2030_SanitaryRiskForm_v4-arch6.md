# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

- Purpose and scope
  - Collection of field data for groundwater assessment, including well characteristics, sanitary risk inspection, water sampling, and owner/custodian information.
  - Supports identification of sanitary risks, sampling decisions, and data-driven decisions for groundwater management.

- Forms included
  - Well characteristics recording form (for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells)
  - Water sample results form (for laboratory use)
  - Well owner questionnaire
  - Well customer questionnaire

- Surveyor and sampling workflow
  - Surveyor details: surveyor name and date (dd/mm/yy)
  - Area and location: area (Manyatta, Migosi, or Other) and Well ID
  - Source type: borehole? Yes/No
  - Availability for sampling: if part of original survey or new/other status; note if not available and explain
  - If available for sampling: capture current owner name, consent status, and, if consented, proceed with consent documentation
  - Changes since 2004: note any changes to the well or groundwater source
  - Measurements and samples: Well depth, electroconductivity (EC) reading, Sample ID number (written on bottle)
  - Weather context: whether it rained (today, yesterday, both, neither)

- Sanitary risk inspection (Boreholes and shallow dug wells)
  - 15 indicators assessing structural integrity, drainage, and contamination risk, including:
    - Cement floor distance from well (within 1.5 m)
    - Ponding on cement floor
    - Cracks in cement floor
    - Pump loose at base
    - Ponding beyond cement floor within 3 m
    - Drainage channel condition (cracked/need cleaning)
    - Animal access within 10 m (fence presence)
    - Latrines within 10 m; count
    - Additional latrines within 30 m; count
    - Open water sources within 20 m
    - Uncapped wells within 30 m
    - Scattered waste within 30 m
    - Waste dumps within 30 m
  - Dug wells-specific:
    - Cover unsanitary
    - Walls inadequately sealed below ground level

- Data collection and response coding
  - Most sanitary risk items use Yes/No coding with numeric representations (e.g., Yes = 1, No = 0, with additional codes for Not applicable, Not sure)
  - Explanatory notes allowed for unavailable sites or special circumstances

- Consent and ethics handling
  - Use participant information sheet; record water source owner’s consent status
  - If consented, conduct interview and document as consent given
  - If not available for interview or if consent is not given, annotate accordingly

- Data quality and usage
  - Independent data capture per field forms to enable combination with other datasets
  - Structured data to support self-service analysis (dashboards, pivot-style exploration)
  - Facilitates tracking of changes over time (since 2004) and identification of high-risk wells for remediation or targeted sampling
