# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

- A set of field data collection tools for assessing groundwater sources, including well surveys, sanitary risk inspections, water sampling, and owner/customer questionnaires.
- Designed to support data-driven understanding of groundwater quality, safety, and management at local scales, with linkages to lab results and participant consent.

## Forms and data collected

- Well survey form
  - Surveyor name, date, area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other), Well ID
  - Source type: borehole? (Yes/No)
  - Availability for sampling: if part of original 2002 survey, current availability, or new/not in 2002 survey
  - If unavailable: explanatory note
  - If available: current well/owner name, consent to participate (consent / not consent / not available)
  - Changes since 2004 (e.g., new cover)
  - Well depth (m), Electroconductivity (EC) reading (ms), Sample ID number
  - Rainfall status (today / yesterday / both / neither)

- Sanitary Risk Inspection (boreholes and shallow dug wells)
  - 15 indicators assessing contamination risk and condition
    - Cement floor distance (<1.5 m), ponding on cement floor, cracks in cement floor, loose pump, ponding within 3 m, drainage channel condition, animal access within 10 m, proximity to latrines within 10 m, additional latrines within 30 m, open water sources within 20 m, uncapped wells within 30 m, scattered waste within 30 m, waste dumps within 30 m
    - Dug wells: sanitary condition of cover and sealing of walls below ground
  - Each item captured as Yes/No with coded responses (including Not applicable / not sure)

- Water sample results form
  - Intended for laboratory use to record water analytical results (structure implied by field and sample identifiers)

- Well owner questionnaire
  - Captures owner details, ownership, consent status, and changes to the water source

- Well customer questionnaire
  - Gathers user-related information and expectations related to the water source

## Data integration and workflow

- Links between survey data, sample IDs, and lab results via the Sample ID number provided on the well survey form.
- Includes documentation of consent status and changes to wells since 2004 for longitudinal tracking.
- Enables tracking of weather context (rainfall) at sampling time to support interpretation of water quality.

## Use for analysts

- Compile and compare sanitary risk indicators across wells to identify high-risk sources.
- Analyze correlations between well characteristics (depth, EC) and sanitary risk scores.
- Assess changes over time by comparing current surveys with 2002/2004 references.
- Integrate field data with laboratory results for comprehensive groundwater quality assessment.
- Support decision-making on which wells require upgrades, treatment, or further sampling.

## Data quality and governance considerations

- Consent status and availability for sampling are recorded to inform ethical and logistical constraints.
- Notable potential data gaps: unavailability of wells for sampling, missing responses on risk items, and changes since 2004 not fully captured.
- Clear field definitions and standardized questions aid cross-site comparability and reproducibility.
