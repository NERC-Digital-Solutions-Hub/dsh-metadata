# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Overview
  - Follow-up study to 2002–2004 water quality and well-structure survey in Kisumu, Kenya.
  - Two main components: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing, plus interviews with well owners and some neighboring customers to describe groundwater use patterns.
  - Expanded sampling to additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; sample size up to 73 groundwater sources and 137 customers.

- Data assets and data types
  - Data collection instruments
    - Pro-forma survey for groundwater sources
    - Owner interview questionnaire
    - Customer (buyer) interview questionnaire
  - Sensed and observed data
    - GPS coordinates of wells, photographs, well depth measurements
    - Sanitary risk inspection results (wellhead and surroundings)
  - Laboratory data
    - On-site electro-conductivity
    - Laboratory analyses for microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants
  - Questionnaire data
    - Owner-use data (abstraction, usage, handling)
    - Ownership assets and services (aligned with Demographic and Health Survey-style questions)
    - Food poverty indicators
  - Population data
    - Groundwater source owners and customers (adults 18+), including neighbours who purchase water

- Sampling design and participants
  - Population: groundwater source owners and consumers in Kisumu’s neighbourhoods
  - Frame: revisits to wells tested in 2002–2004; expansion to new neighbourhoods and boreholes
  - Sampling method
    - Groundwater sources selected by random point in each neighbourhood (closest source to the point)
    - Boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction licence records
  - Sample size: 73 groundwater sources; 137 groundwater customers
  - Inclusion criteria: adults 18+, resident in chosen neighbourhoods, owner or consumer of groundwater

- Procedures and data collection workflow
  - Timeline
    - Sept 2013: stakeholder workshop
    - Dec 2013: sampling plan and questionnaire translation
    - Jan 2014: JOOUST training on consent and instrument administration
    - Feb–Mar 2014: field data collection and follow-up interviews
    - Apr 2015: version 3 of protocol (ongoing refinements)
    - Jul 2014: dissemination workshop
  - Field activities
    - Identify well owners via local maps and community talk
    - Obtain informed consent (information sheets, translations)
    - Record GPS location, capture photos, measure water depth where feasible
    - Conduct sanitary risk assessment
    - Collect two water samples per source (on-site conductivity; lab analyses later)
  - Data collection at labs and in the field
    - ViRED International and University of Surrey process water samples
    - JOOUST-led teams interview owners and, when applicable, neighboring customers
  - Data maintenance
    - Use of prior study maps to locate sources
    - Translation and back-translation of instruments to Luo and Kiswahili

- Data management, quality, and governance
  - Data archiving: measurement tools and questionnaires archived alongside the protocol
  - Data integration: linking owner and customer questionnaires with environmental chemistry and microbiology results
  - Data quality controls: standardized sanitary risk inspections; consistent sampling and lab procedures
  - Metadata and discoverability: explicit documentation of instruments, translations, and field procedures
  - Power and inference notes: no formal power calculations; the study is a follow-up and pilot in additional neighbourhoods

- Ethics and participant protection
  - Informed consent procedures implemented; participant information sheets provided
  - Multilingual data collection to ensure understanding and voluntary participation

- Collaboration, governance, and dissemination
  - Collaborating institutions: University of Southampton, VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey
  - Stakeholder engagement and dissemination: startup workshop, final dissemination workshop, and community group involvement

- Data considerations for data leaders
  - End-to-end data lifecycle: from field collection to laboratory analysis and questionnaire-based socio-economic data
  - Geospatial and temporal data integration: location data and changes over a decade (2004–2014) to assess trends
  - Multimodal data governance: coordinating data across institutions, languages, and data types (qualitative, quantitative, environmental)
  - Usability for policy and planning: data designed to inform groundwater safety, usage patterns, and potential risk management in peri-urban settings
  - Potential limitations: follow-up sampling not fully powered; reliance on locally available data and maps; need for careful metadata to maintain comparability across time and sites
