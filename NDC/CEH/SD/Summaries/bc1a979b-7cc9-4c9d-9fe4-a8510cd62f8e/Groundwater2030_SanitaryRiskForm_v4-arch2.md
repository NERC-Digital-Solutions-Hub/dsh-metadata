# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

- Purpose and scope
  - Field tools for groundwater monitoring, enabling recording of well characteristics, sampling data, and owner/custodian information.
  - Supports comparison with prior surveys (e.g., 2002 survey) and notes changes since 2004.
  - Data collected can feed laboratory analyses and be used in broader environmental health assessments.

- Included forms
  - Well characteristics recording form (for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells)
  - Water sample results form (for laboratory use)
  - Well owner questionnaire
  - Well customer questionnaire

- Well survey form: key fields
  - Surveyor name; date; area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other)
  - Well ID; borehole status (YES/NO)
  - Availability for sampling (Yes / No / New well not in 2002 survey / not sure)
  - If not available, explanatory note
  - If available: current well owner name
  - Participant consent for participation (consent / not consent / not available for interview)
  - If consented: record changes to the well/groundwater source since 2004
  - Well depth (m); Electroconductivity (EC) reading (ms)
  - Sample ID number (to be written on bottle)
  - Rainfall today/yesterday/both/neither

- Sanitary Risk Inspection: boreholes and shallow dug wells
  - 15 Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure questions covering:
    - Cement floor distance from well (<1.5 m)
    - Ponding on cement floor
    - Cracks in cement floor potential water entry
    - Loose pump at base
    - Ponding beyond cement floor within 3 m
    - Drainage channel condition
    - Animal access within 10 m (fence)
    - Latrines within 10 m (counting)
    - Additional latrines within 30 m (count)
    - Open water sources within 20 m
    - Uncapped wells within 30 m
    - Scattered waste within 30 m
    - Waste dumps within 30 m
  - Dug wells: additional checks
    - Cover sanitary? (Yes/No)
    - Walls inadequately sealed below ground level? (Yes/No)
  - Coding: Yes = 1, No = 0, Not applicable = 8, Not sure = 9

- Consent and ethics
  - Read participant information sheet; obtain consent via the consent form
  - Record participant response: consent / non-consent / not available for interview
  - If consented: note any changes since 2004 and proceed with data collection accordingly

- Data handling and storage
  - Data should be verified, cleaned, and transformed as part of standardised analysis
  - Created datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals
  - Outputs may include reports, maps, and charts, facilitating consistent environmental health assessments over time

- Context and usage for analysts
  - Supports consistent monitoring of groundwater sources across identified areas
  - Enables integration with other data sources to enhance dataset value and enable broader accessibility and reuse
  - Aligns with standardised approaches for environmental monitoring and policy performance tracking
