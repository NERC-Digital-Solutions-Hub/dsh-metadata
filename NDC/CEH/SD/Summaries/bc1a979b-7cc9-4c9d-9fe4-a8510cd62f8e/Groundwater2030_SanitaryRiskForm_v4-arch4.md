# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

## Overview
- Sets of forms and questionnaires for field data collection on groundwater wells and related water sources.
- Aims to capture well characteristics, water sample results, and owner/user perspectives to assess sanitary risk and water quality.
- Designed for standardized data capture to support tracking changes over time and integration with broader groundwater programs.

## Forms and What They Capture
- Well characteristics recording form (for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells)
- Water sample results form (for laboratory use)
- Well owner questionnaire
- Well customer questionnaire
- Well survey form (core field data collection)
  - Surveyor name, date, area, Well ID, borehole status
  - Availability for sampling (Yes/No/New well not in 2002 survey/not sure)
  - Consent: water source owner consent to participate, with notes if declined or not available
  - Changes since 2004 (e.g., new cover)
  - Well depth, electroconductivity (EC) reading, Sample ID, rain status
- Sanitary Risk Inspection
  - For boreholes and shallow dug wells: 15+ indicators evaluating structural integrity, drainage, animal access, latrines proximity, waste sources, and nearby water hazards
  - Includes Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure responses
- Dug wells special section
  - Focus on sanitary cover and wall sealing for dug wells
  - Specific questions on cover sanitation and sealing

## Data Elements and Encoding
- Quantitative: well depth (m), electroconductivity (ms), rainfall timing
- Qualitative/Checklist: surveyor details, area, borehole status, consent status, availability for sampling, changes since 2004
- Sanitary risk indicators: standardized Yes/No (with Not applicable/Not sure options)
- Sample identifiers: recorded on bottles to link field and laboratory data

## Data Collection Workflow
- Engage water source owner: read information sheet and obtain consent via consent form
- Document current status and any changes since 2004
- Record basic well metrics (depth, EC) and contextual data (date, area, rain)
- Conduct sanitary risk inspection using standardized questions
- Manage sample logistics: generate and record Sample ID; note whether sampling occurs
- Ensure data are captured consistently across wells and areas for comparability

## Data Governance and Access
- Emphasis on standardized metadata and data dictionary to enable discoverability and interoperability
- Consent status and data availability clearly tracked to respect privacy and access constraints
- Potential for data integration with earlier surveys (e.g., 2002, 2004) to support longitudinal analyses
- Data suitable for sharing with wider groundwater programs and partner networks, promoting co-ownership of data products

## Challenges and Opportunities for Data Leaders
- Data availability and recency: some wells may be unavailable for sampling or newly introduced since prior surveys
- Consent and privacy: handling consent status and access restrictions across stakeholders
- Data quality and standards: ensuring uniform interpretation of responses and consistent unit usage
- Sector coordination: avoiding duplication and enabling collaboration across areas and partners
- Data discovery and lineage: linking field data with lab results and historical survey data for comprehensive insight
