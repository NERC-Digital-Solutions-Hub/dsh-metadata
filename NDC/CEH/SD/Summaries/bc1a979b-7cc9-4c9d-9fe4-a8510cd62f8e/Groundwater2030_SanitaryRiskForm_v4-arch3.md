# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

## Overview
- A set of field data collection instruments designed to capture well characteristics, sanitary risk, water sample results, and owner/customer information to support groundwater monitoring and decision-making.
- Includes procedures for consent, recording changes since a 2004 baseline, and notes on sampling conditions.

## Forms Included
- Well characteristics recording form (for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells)
- Water sample results form (for laboratory use)
- Well owner questionnaire
- Well customer questionnaire

## Key Data Elements Captured
- Survey details:
  - Surveyor name
  - Date (dd/mm/yy)
  - Area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other)
  - Well ID
  - Is the source a borehole? Yes/No
  - Availability for sampling if part of original survey (Yes/No/New well not in 2002 survey/not sure)
  - Notes if water source not available for sampling
- Participation and consent:
  - Water source owner consent to participate / does not consent / not available for interview
- Well and sampling metadata (if participant agrees):
  - Changes to the well/groundwater source since 2004 (e.g., new cover)
  - Well depth (m)
  - Electroconductivity reading (ms)
  - Sample ID number
  - Rain occurrence (today/yesterday/both/neither)
- Sanitary risk inspection data (Boreholes and shallow dug wells):
  - 15 indicators assessing structural integrity, drainage, animal access, latrines, waste proximity, water sources nearby, and related risk factors
  - Response options per item: Yes / No / Not applicable / Not sure (coded)
  - For latrines: quantity within specified distances (how many)
  - For other hazards: presence of open water sources, uncapped wells, scattered waste, waste dumps within defined radii
- Dug wells specific:
  - Is the cover of the well unsanitary? Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure
  - Are the walls inadequately sealed below ground level? Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure

## Sanitary Risk Inspection Details
- Boreholes and shallow dug wells assessment includes:
  - Cement floor distance to well
  - Ponding on cement floor
  - Cracks in cement floor
  - Loose pump at base
  - Ponding beyond cement floor within 3 m
  - Drainage channel condition
  - Animal access within 10 m (fence)
  - Latrines within 10 m (count)
  - Additional latrines within 30 m (count)
  - Open water sources within 20 m
  - Uncapped wells within 30 m
  - Scattered waste within 30 m
  - Waste dumps within 30 m
- Dug wells:
  - Cover sanitary condition
  - Walls inadequately sealed at any point below ground

## Consent, Changes, and Baseline Context
- Includes verification of consent to participate and adherence to baseline data from 2004, with notes on any changes to the well or groundwater source since that time.

## Data Governance and Practical Considerations
- Emphasizes the need for clear data provenance (survey details, consent, sample IDs).
- Data sharing and openness: underlying data and metadata should be shared appropriately, with attention to governance and privacy constraints.
- Metadata completeness and quality: field notes on changes since 2004 and sanitary risk indicators require careful recording to ensure verifiability.
- Data integration and usability: standardized tags (areas, well IDs, sample IDs, EC units) facilitate later analysis, dashboards, and reporting for policy scrutiny and decision-making.
