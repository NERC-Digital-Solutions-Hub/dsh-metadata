# Sample collection and fieldwork

- Study context: Data collected in baseline and follow-up campaigns to assess well water quality using standardized procedures.

- Field sampling procedure:
  - Approximately 500 ml water samples collected from each well with a rinsed stainless steel sampling cup.
  - Samples transferred into sterile bottles, stored on ice and kept in the dark; laboratory processing occurred within seven hours.
  - Microbiology samples collected before any physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.

- In situ measurements:
  - pH measured with a calibrated pH tester (HI-98128) and a digital thermometer for water temperature (thermometer not separately calibrated).
  - Depth to water (bgl) measured at an accessible point, using a dipper probe and calibrated tape; depth of water calculated from the difference between surface and bottom readings.
  - Conductivity measured with a handheld meter (COND3110) calibrated with standard solutions.
  - Turbidity measured with a portable turbidity meter; sample cell rinsed between samples and before readings.

- Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods:
  - Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) isolated and quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml sample or appropriate dilution filtered, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours, and colonies counted after incubation and standardised to 100 ml.
  - Nitrate, sulphate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured with a Palintest Photometer 7100 using dedicated reagents.

- Calibration steps and values:
  - Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before sampling and every two days thereafter; incubator thermometer not calibrated against a reference thermometer.
  - pH meter calibrated daily with buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; buffers traceable to NIST.
  - Conductivity meter calibrated daily with a 1413 µS standard; recalibrated if readings varied from standard.
  - Turbidity meter calibrated daily against a formazin standard.

- Quality control:
  - Analytical QC limited by available facilities; blanks run for each method (including microbiological tests).
  - When feasible (DelAgua kit max 16 samples), duplicate analyses conducted on the first and last samples to assess repeatability.
  - Consistent analyst across a sampling campaign to reduce intra-campaign variation.
