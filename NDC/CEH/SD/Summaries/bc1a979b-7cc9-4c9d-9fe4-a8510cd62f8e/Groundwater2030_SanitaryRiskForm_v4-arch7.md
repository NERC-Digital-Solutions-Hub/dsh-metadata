# Groundwater2030 Field Survey Forms and Questionnaires

## Overview
- A set of field data collection instruments for groundwater surveys intended to support GIS-based mapping and analysis.
- Includes four forms (Well characteristics recording form, Water sample results form, Well owner questionnaire, Well customer questionnaire) and a detailed Well survey form with both sampling and sanitary risk components.
- Designed to capture survey metadata, consent, well characteristics, sampling details, and sanitary risk indicators for boreholes and dug wells, enabling integration into map-based data products.

## Forms Included
- Well characteristics recording form [for sanitary risk inspection and sampling wells]
- Water sample results form [for laboratory use]
- Well owner questionnaire
- Well customer questionnaire

## Well Survey Form: Key Fields
- Surveyor name
- Date (dd/mm/yy)
- Area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other; specify)
- Well ID
- Is this source a borehole? Yes/No
- If part of the original 2002 survey and still available for sampling (Yes/No/New well not in 2002 survey/not sure)
- If not available for sampling, explanatory note
- If available for sampling: current well/source owner name
- Consent process: owner consents to participate / does not consent / not available for interview
- If consent given: note changes to the well/groundwater source since 2004
- Well depth (m)
- Electroconductivity reading (ms)
- Sample ID number
- Rain status: today / yesterday / both / neither

## Sanitary Risk Inspection: Boreholes and Shallow Dug Wells
- 1. Cement floor extends less than 1.5 m from the well? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 2. Ponding of water on the cement floor? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 3. Cracks in the cement floor that could permit water entry? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 4. Pump loose from base allowing water entry into casing? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 5. Ponding beyond the cement floor within 3 m of the well? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 6. Drainage channel cracked, broken or in need of cleaning? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 7. Animals have access within 10 m of the well (is there a fence)? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 8. Latrines within 10 m of the well? If yes, how many?
- 9. Additional latrines within 30 m of the well? If yes, how many?
- 10. Open water sources within 20 m of the borehole? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 11. Uncapped wells within 30 m of the borehole? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 12. Scattered waste within 30 m of the well? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 13. Waste dumps within 30 m of the well? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 14. Dug wells only: Is the cover of the well unsanitary? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)
- 15. Dug wells only: Are the walls of the well inadequately sealed at any point below ground level? (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure)

## Data and GIS Considerations for GIS Specialists
- The forms collect structured, map-relevant attributes (area, well ID, borehole status, depth, EC, consent status, and sanitary risk indicators) that support spatial analysis and risk mapping.
- Data quality and standards: expect data to come from multiple sources and field teams; ensure consistent coding (Yes/No/Not applicable/Not sure, numeric counts for latrines/waste, etc.).
- Data integration: fields are designed to be combined with other spatial datasets (e.g., locations, land use, water sources) to produce layered groundwater risk maps.
- Resolution and completeness: anticipate gaps (e.g., missing coordinates or missing consent status) and plan for data cleaning and imputation as needed.
- Workflow alignment: the forms support iterative data capture, verification with end users, and updates to reflect changes since prior surveys (e.g., 2004 changes), aligning with a GIS-driven monitoring program.

## Endnotes for Practical Use
- The instrument set is geared toward enabling creation of map-based outputs that depict well characteristics, sampling data, and sanitary risk indicators to inform policy, client decisions, or public-facing information.
- Properly standardized data entry and consistent field definitions are essential for reliable GIS analyses and comparability across surveys.
