# Sample collection and laboratory analysis methods

- Purpose
  - Document sampling and analytical procedures for water quality assessment across baseline and follow-up studies.

- Sample collection and handling
  - Approximately 500 ml of water collected from each well using a stainless steel sampling cup rinsed in well-water.
  - Water transferred to sterile bottles, stored on ice in the dark, and processed within seven hours.
  - Microbiology sampling performed before physico-chemical tests to avoid cross-contamination.

- Field measurements
  - pH measured with a Hanna HI-98128 Pocket pHep5; temperature recorded with the meter’s integrated digital thermometer (thermometer not calibrated).
  - Depth to water below ground level measured at each well with an accessible dipper point using calibrated tape; depth adjusted for plinth height; depth of water calculated as the difference between surface and bottom readings.
  - Conductivity measured with a COND3110 handheld meter calibrated with standard solutions.
  - Turbidity measured with a Hanna HI 93703 Portable Turbidity Meter; sample cell rinsed between samples and three rinses with sample prior to reading.

- Laboratory instrumentation and analyses
  - Thermotolerant coliforms (TTC) isolated and quantified by membrane filtration using MLSB medium; 100 ml sample (or appropriate dilution) filtered, incubated at 44 ± 0.5°C for 20 ± 2 hours; colonies counted and standardized to 100 ml; no further confirmation tests.

  - Nitrate, sulfate, phosphate, fluoride, and chloride concentrations measured using a Palintest photometer model 7100 with dedicated reagents, following manufacturer instructions.

- Calibration steps and values
  - Incubator temperature checked and adjusted before each campaign; checked every two days during the campaign; incubator thermometer not calibrated against a reference thermometer.
  - pH meter calibrated daily with standard buffers at pH 4.0, 7.01, and 10.0; buffers certified traceable to NIST.
  - Conductivity meter calibrated before each campaign with a 1413 µS standard; checked daily; recalibrated if readings vary.
  - Turbidity meter calibrated daily against a formazin standard.

- Quality control
  - Analytical quality control was challenging given facilities; blanks run for each method; when possible, duplicate analysis of first and last samples to assess repeatability.
  - Each sampling campaign’s tests were performed by the same analyst to reduce variation.
