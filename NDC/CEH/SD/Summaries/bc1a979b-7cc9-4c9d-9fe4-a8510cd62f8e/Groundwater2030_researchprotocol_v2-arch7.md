# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- A follow-up, multi-institution study in Kisumu, Kenya to assess groundwater quality and safety in peri-urban areas.
- Built on a 2002–2004 baseline survey (surveys, sanitary risk inspections, and water quality tests) and expands to additional neighborhoods.
- Components include repeat sanitary risk inspections, water quality testing, and interviews with groundwater owners and customers to describe usage patterns and patient accessibility.

## Aims and GIS-relevant scope
- Map and document groundwater sources (wells and boreholes) and track changes since 2004.
- Combine spatial data (locations, depths, and surroundings) with water quality and sanitary risk data to support interpretation and policy discussions.
- Leverage maps from earlier studies to locate sources and context, enabling spatial analysis of contamination risks.

## Data collection and tools (GIS-focused)
- Location and mapping
  - Use of hand-held GPS to record precise well locations.
  - Photographs of groundwater sources; where possible, depth measured with a tape.
  - Revisit and compare current sites with locations from the 2002–04 study.
- Sanitary risk and sampling
  - Sanitary risk inspection at the well head and surroundings (observational checklist).
  - Two water samples per well: one for on-site electro-conductivity and one for laboratory analysis.
- Questionnaires and ownership/customer data
  - Owner questionnaires to capture usage, handling, and assets/services access.
  - Customer questionnaires for those who buy groundwater (and neighbors who purchase water).
  - Translation of questionnaires into Luo and Kiswahili; informed consent obtained at each site.

## Sampling design and participants
- Sampling frame
  - Revisited wells from 2002–04 in Kisumu’s Manyatta and Migosi neighborhoods; expanded to Nyalenda, Bandani, and boreholes.
- Sample size and sources
  - 73 groundwater sources tested (up from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants
  - Groundwater source owners and consumers (adults 18+).
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed.
- Selection criteria and procedures
  - Sources selected by random point in each neighborhood; the nearest source to that point chosen.
  - Boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority records.
  - If a source or owner declined or no longer existed, the nearest neighboring source was approached.
  - For water sold to neighbors, customers identified randomly from those purchasing water.

## Procedures and timeline
- September 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with well owners and community groups.
- December 2013: Sample selection and questionnaire translation.
- January 2014: JOOUST-trained team prepared to obtain informed consent and administer instruments.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork to locate sources, obtain consent, collect GPS coordinates, take photos, assess sanitary risk, and collect water samples; laboratory analyses conducted at VIRED International and University of Surrey.
- February–March 2014: JOOUST-led interviews with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with neighboring customers; additional questions on water use, other water sources, assets, and food poverty indicators.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop.
- Note: Documentation indicates a version update in April 2015 (Version 3).

## Data collection instruments (archived)
- Pro-forma for surveying groundwater sources.
- Groundwater source owner questionnaire.
- Groundwater customer questionnaire.

## Data quality and outputs
- On-site measurements: electro-conductivity for quick assessment.
- Laboratory analyses: thermotolerant (fecal) coliforms and chemical contaminants.
- Spatial outputs: geolocated well sources, with historical context from prior maps; potential for spatial analyses linking contamination indicators to sanitary risk and usage patterns.
- Linking data: owner and customer data with physical site observations and sample results to create integrated GIS-friendly datasets.
