# Manual for wood specific gravity determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual n°4)

## Purpose and context
- Objective: determine wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (12% MC) to support accurate aboveground and root biomass and carbon accounting in the humid tropical forest.
- Scope: field collection of wood samples and laboratory measurements; data intended for national/international WSG standards.
- Data handling: all datasets generated are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Coordination with local botanists to confirm species presence and align local names with scientific names.
- Tree selection: healthy trees (no hollow or internal decay) identified by botanist; 15 mm-diameter cores collected from each selected tree.
- Sampling design: 10 trees per species, with 5 trees having diameter < 15 cm and 5 trees > 15 cm (to capture intraspecies variation).
- Sampling details: cores taken at 1.3 m above ground; holes filled with branch material to prevent infection.
- Specimen handling: cores preserved in bags; measurePHF index, estimate height, and diameter at breast height (DBH) with a forester’s compass.
- Flora documentation: herbarium samples collected (leaves, flowers, fruits) and stored for species verification by Tsimbazaza Herbarium botanists.

## Lab process: measurement of wood density based on wood cores
- Sample preparation: cut 1 cm long bark-free segments from each core.
- Conditioning: stabilize segments in a climatic chamber at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days to reach 12% MC; stability confirmed when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- Volume measurement at 12% MC: determine V12% by Archimedes water displacement, using a top-loading balance and careful immersion procedure.
- 12% MC weight: measure W12% with a precision balance (0.01 g resolution).
- Drying and dryness verification: oven-dry segments at 103°C for 2 days to reach 0% humidity; ensure weight is constant.
- Oven-dry weight: measure WD (0.01 g resolution) promptly to avoid rewetting.
- Saturation: immerse segments in water for 3 days to achieve saturated state; measure saturated volume VS by Archimedes method.
- Calculations:
  - Density at 12% MC (D12%) = W12% / V12% (relative to water density).
  - Wood specific gravity (WSG) = WD / VS (relative to water density).
- Botanical confirmation: species identities verified by Tsimbazaza Herbarium specialists.

## Data outputs and products
- Primary data produced per segment: W12%, V12%, WD, VS, D12%, and WSG.
- Species-level data refined through botanical verification to ensure correct scientific names.

## Data management and archiving
- All datasets generated during the survey are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Collaboration, funding, and governance
- Lead organization: High School of Agronomy, Department of Forest.
- Co-funding from multiple donors.
- Purposeful collaboration to support national and international biomass and carbon accounting efforts.

## Relevance for data support practice
- Demonstrates end-to-end data handling: field data collection, species verification, standardized laboratory measurements, data calculations, and formal archiving.
- Emphasizes data quality through cross-checks (species verification, moisture conditioning, standardized measurement protocols) and documentation for reproducibility.
- Provides a clear workflow for transforming raw field data into usable density and biomass indicators, suitable for broader data products and dashboards.
