# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) Manual for wood specific gravity determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual n°4)

## Objective
- Determine local wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (MC) to support accurate aboveground and root biomass and carbon accounting in the humid tropical forest.
- Archive all generated datasets for future use and verification.

## Field data collection (Field process)
- Engage with local botanists to confirm local names and species presence; verify scientific names with botanists.
- Select healthy trees (no hollow or trunk decay).
- For each tree: extract 15 mm-diameter wood cores at 1.3 m height using a generator-powered drill (to avoid felling trees).
- Sample plan: 10 trees per species (5 with DBH < 15 cm and 5 with DBH > 15 cm).
- Fill sampling holes with branches to prevent fungal attack; preserve cores in bags.
- Collect auxiliary data: PHF index, estimated height, DBH, and herbarium samples (leaves, flowers, fruits) for species verification by Tsimbazaza Herbarium.

## Laboratory measurement (Lab process)
- Prepare one 1 cm segment (bark removed) from each wood core.
- Stabilize segments in a climatic chamber at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days to reach 12% MC.
- Determine volume at 12% MC (V12%) by Archimedes water displacement with a top-loading balance.
- Determine weight at 12% MC (W12%) with a precision balance (0.01 g).
- Over-dry segments to constant weight at 103°C for 2 days to obtain anhydrous state (WD).
- Measure WD with precision balance (0.01 g) to minimize reabsorption.
- Bring segments to saturated state by immersion in water for 3 days; determine saturated volume (VS) by Archimedes method.
- Calculate density at 12% MC: D12% = W12% / V12% (relative to water density).
- Calculate wood specific gravity (WSG): WSG = WD / VS (relative to water density).

## Data, provenance, and verification
- Botanical identifications confirmed by Tsimbazaza Flora Department botanists.
- All resulting data (measurements, calculations, and species identifications) archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Data intended to support national and international WSG benchmarks for biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
