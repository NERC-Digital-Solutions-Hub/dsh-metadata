# Manual for wood specific gravity determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual n°4)

## Overview
- ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) focuses on wood specific gravity (WSG) and biomass/carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Data outputs are field and lab measurements used to derive density and biomass estimates; datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- The manual describes a two-stage workflow: field collection of wood samples and laboratory measurements to determine density and WSG at 12% moisture content (MC), with subsequent data quality checks and species verification.

## Field data collection (Field process)
- Objective: collect wooden samples to determine local wood density values and support biomass/carbon calculations.
- Steps and considerations:
  - Consult local botanists to confirm species presence locally and align local names with scientific names.
  - Identify trees in the forest with healthy condition (not hollow or decayed; suitable for sampling).
  - Collect 15 mm-diameter wood cores from each selected tree at 1.3 m height.
  - Sample strategy: 10 trees per species (5 trees with DBH < 15 cm and 5 trees with DBH > 15 cm) to capture intra-species variation.
  - Close cores with branch material to deter biological attack; preserve cores in bags.
  - Record additional field data: PHF index, visual height estimation, and diameter at breast height (DBH) using a forester’s compass.
  - Collect herbarium specimens (leaves, flowers, fruits if available) to verify species names with the Flora Department herbarium (Tsimbazaza).
- Outcomes: a documented set of field samples with associated identifications, initial biometric measurements, and voucher specimens for species verification.

## Laboratory measurements (Lab process)
- Objective: determine density at 12% MC (D12%) and wood specific gravity (WSG) for each sample.
- Steps and methods:
  - Cut a 1 cm segment (bark removed) from each core.
  - Stabilize segments in a climatic chamber at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days to reach 12% MC (stable when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days).
  - Determine 12% MC volume (V12%) by Archimedes’ method: water displacement using a top-loading balance and careful immersion; volume is equal to the mass of displaced water.
  - Measure 12% MC weight (W12%) with a precision balance (0.01 g).
  - Over-dry segments to constant weight at 103°C for 2 days to obtain anhydrous state (0% MC); measure oven-dry weight (WD).
  - Re-wet and determine saturated state: immerse segments in water for 3 days and measure saturated volume (VS) by Archimedes’ method.
  - Calculate density at 12% MC: D12% = W12% / V12% (relative to water density).
  - Calculate WSG for each segment: WSG = WD / VS (relative to water density).
  - Botanical samples are identified by botanists at Tsimbazaza Herbarium to confirm scientific names.
- Outputs: per-segment D12% and WSG values, along with associated W12%, V12%, WD, VS, and species identifications.

## Data products and integration (GIS-relevant outputs)
- Primary data outputs:
  - Field attributes: species name (verified), DBH, height (visual estimate), PHF index, sampling location (as recorded in field notes), tree health criteria.
  - Lab attributes: W12%, V12%, WD, VS, D12%, WSG per segment.
- Data linkage:
  - Combine field and lab measurements to derive per-tree and per-species density/biomass estimates.
  - Use environmental and spatial context to scale up to plot, stand, or corridor-level biomass calculations.
- Data storage:
  - All datasets generated by this methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Data quality, standards, and provenance
- Quality assurance:
  - Species identifications validated by botanists via herbarium consultation.
  - Field selection prioritizes healthy trees and consistent sampling across size classes (DBH < 15 cm and > 15 cm).
  - Laboratory procedures include stabilized MC testing, repeated weight checks for stability, and standardized drying and immersion protocols.
- Standards and documentation:
  - Detailed protocol steps ensure reproducibility and comparability across samples and sites.
  - Measurements rely on calibrated balances and controlled environmental conditions; explicit resolutions noted (e.g., 0.01 g).
- Provenance:
  - Methods and datasets are documented and archived; sources and identifiers maintained for traceability.

## Relevance to GIS specialists
- Enables creation of map-based data products showing spatial patterns of wood density and biomass proxies across the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor.
- Data layers and attributes to map:
  - Per-sample: species, DBH, height, PHF, WSG (or D12%), W12%, V12%, WD, VS, sampling location.
  - Aggregated: species-level or site-level mean WSG and biomass estimates.
- Data integration considerations:
  - Align field coordinates with GIS layers; ensure consistent species naming and taxonomic verification.
  - Address potential data gaps due to limited resolution or sampling coverage; consider imputation or stratified extrapolation with documented uncertainty.
- Use cases:
  - Regional biomass/carbon accounting for national/international reporting.
  - Visualization of spatial variation in wood density and its contribution to aboveground biomass.

## Limitations and considerations
- Field data depend on local species identification and access to representative healthy trees.
- Sample size per species is limited (10 trees per species), which may affect species-wide WSG estimates.
- Spatial representation may be constrained by sampling locations; may require extrapolation for larger areas.
- Units and methods (e.g., 12% MC, Archimedes method) must be consistently applied to ensure comparability across datasets.

## Archival and accessibility
- Datasets produced under this methodology are archived at EIDC, supporting long-term accessibility and reproducibility for biomass and carbon analyses.
