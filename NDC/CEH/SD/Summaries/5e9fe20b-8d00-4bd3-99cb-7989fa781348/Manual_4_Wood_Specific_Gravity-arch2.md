# Manual for wood specific gravity determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual n°4)

## Overview
- Documents the field and laboratory procedures to determine wood specific gravity (WSG) and density at 12% moisture content (MC) for biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Part of ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon), 2014–2016; update in February 2017.
- Datasets are archived with Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Purpose and context
- Objective: obtain local WSG values and 12% MC density to improve national/international biomass and carbon assessments (aboveground and root).
- Lead and collaboration: High School of Agronomy – Department of Forest; co-funding from other donors.
- Outputs support standardized, auditable environmental monitoring data.

## Field sampling: collection of wood samples
- Collaborate with local botanists to confirm local names and scientific names.
- Select healthy trees (no hollow or internal decay) for sampling.
- Collect 15 mm-diameter wood cores at 1.3 m height on each selected tree.
- Sampling design: 10 trees per species; 5 trees with diameter <15 cm and 5 trees with diameter >15 cm.
- Procedures: fill holes with branch to prevent decay; preserve cores in bags.
- Record supporting data: PHF index, height estimate, diameter at breast height (DBH) with a forester’s compass.
- Collect herbarium material (leaves, flowers, fruits) when available and verify species identity with Tsimbazaza Herbarium at Parc Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza.

## Laboratory processing: measurement of wood density at 12% MC
- Segment processing: cut 1 cm segment (bark removed) from each core.
- 12% MC stabilization: condition segments at 20°C and 65% RH for 7 days; consider stable at 12% MC when weight is constant for 3 consecutive days.
- Volume at 12% MC (V12%) measurement: Archimedes water displacement method using a top-loading balance; determine volume from mass of displaced water.
- Weight at 12% MC (W12%) measurement: use precision balance (0.01 g).
- Drying to 0% MC: over-dry at 103°C for 2 days; obtain anhydrous weight (WD).
- Saturation step: re-immerse to obtain saturated state; determine saturated volume (VS) by Archimedes method.
- Density calculations: D12% = W12% / V12% (relative to water density); Wood Specific Gravity (WSG) = WD / VS (relative to water density).

## Species verification
- Botanists from Tsimbazaza Herbarium identify collected botanical samples to confirm species names.

## Data management and archiving
- All generated datasets are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Outputs for environmental monitoring
- Standardized measurements of WSG and 12% MC density per sampled trees and species.
- Data contribute to biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting in the humid tropical forest.
- Procedures designed for reproducibility, quality assurance, and compatibility with broader monitoring systems.
