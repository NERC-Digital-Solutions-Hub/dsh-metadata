- Period: 2014–2016; update in February 2017.
- Authors: Tahiana Ramananantoadro, Favo Nantenaina Razafinariivo, Hersintsitohaina Razakamanarivo, Radonirina AndriambeLO.
- Lead: High School of Agronomy – Department of Forest; co-funded by other donors.
- Data outputs: all datasets generated are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Purpose and scope
- Objective: determine local wood density values to improve national/international biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting.
- Focus: standardized wood specific gravity (WSG) and density measurements using wood cores from humid tropical forests.

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Collaboration with local botanists to confirm species presence and local names against scientific nomenclature.
- Selection criteria: healthy trees (no hollow trunks or internal decay).
- Sample collection: 15 mm-diameter wood cores per selected tree, taken at 1.3 m above ground using an electric drill powered by a generator (to avoid harvesting trees).
- Sampling design: 10 trees per species, with 5 trees of DBH < 15 cm and 5 trees of DBH > 15 cm.
- Procedures: fill holes with branch material to reduce fungal attack; preserve cores in bags.
- Field data: record PHF index, estimate height, and measure diameter at breast height with a forester’s compass.
- Botanical verification: collect herbarium samples and verify species names with Tsimbazaza Herbarium.

## Lab process: measurement of wood density at 12% moisture content
- Segment preparation: cut 1 cm long bark-free segments from each core.
- Conditioning: stabilize samples at 20°C and 65% relative humidity for 7 days to reach ~12% moisture content (MC).
- Volume measurement at 12% MC: determine V12% via Archimedes water displacement using a top-loading balance; use a volumeless needle to adjust immersion if needed.
- Mass measurements: measure W12% (weight at 12% MC) with a precision balance (0.01 g resolution).
- Oven drying: over-dry segments at 103°C for 2 days to reach anhydrous state; confirm stability with constant weight over two 24-hour intervals.
- Oven-dried weight: measure WD (0.01 g resolution) quickly to minimize reabsorption of moisture.
- Saturation and volume: re-immerse segments in water for 3 days to achieve saturated state; measure saturated volume VS by water displacement.
- Calculations: for each segment, compute density at 12% MC (D12%) as W12% divided by V12% (relative to water density). Compute wood specific gravity (WSG) as oven-dry weight WD divided by saturated volume VS (relative to water density).

## Species identification and data provenance
- Botanical identifications confirmed by Tsimbazaza Herbarium to ensure correct scientific names.
- Data lineage and sampling details are documented to support reproducibility and future comparisons.

## Data management and governance
- All datasets generated by the described methodology are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- The approach supports data quality, comparability across species and plots, and facilitates biomass and carbon assessments at national/international levels.

## Outputs and relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides standardized wood density and WSG values essential for accurate biomass and carbon accounting in humid tropical forests.
- Methodology supports transparency, metadata traceability, and compatibility with monitoring and reporting frameworks.
- Demonstrates integration of field collection, laboratory measurement, species verification, and data archiving within a single monitoring workflow.
