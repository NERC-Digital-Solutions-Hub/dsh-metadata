# Summary for Data Stewards

## Overview
- Purpose: to complete national and international wood specific gravity (WSG) measurements for accurate biomass and carbon accounting in the humid tropical forest of the Ankeniheny-Zahamena corridor.
- Timeframe: fieldwork 2014–2016; update in February 2017.
- Data handling: all datasets generated by the methodology are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Data Generated and Measurements
- Field data:
  - Species identification and local names validated with local botanists.
  - Tree health criteria (healthy trees, non-decayed trunks) used for sampling.
  - Location and identification of trees by botanist in the forest.
  - 15 mm-diameter wood cores collected per tree; sampling designed to capture variability (10 trees per species: 5 with DBH < 15 cm, 5 with DBH > 15 cm).
  - For each tree: plant material collected, PHF index, estimated height, DBH, and herbarium specimens for species verification.
- Lab data:
  - Segment preparation: 1 cm long bark-free segments cut from cores.
  - Equilibration to 12% moisture content (MC) at 20°C and 65% RH (7 days); stability confirmed when weight constant for 3 days.
  - Volume measurements at 12% MC (V12%) via Archimedes water displacement.
  - 12% MC weight (W12%) recorded with precision balance (0.01 g).
  - Over-drying at 103°C to 0% MC; oven-dried weight (WD) recorded.
  - Saturation and saturated volume (VS) measured via water immersion.
  - Density calculations:
    - D12% = W12% / V12% (relative to water density).
    - WSG = WD / VS (relative to water density).

## Data Standards, Metadata, and Provenance
- Taxonomic verification: botanical samples identified by Tsimbazaza Herbarium (Flora Department) to confirm scientific names.
- Metadata emphasis: explicit documentation of field collection details, sample identifiers, moisture content states, and measurement procedures to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
- Archival standard: datasets are archived in the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term storage and discoverability.

## Data Management and Archiving
- Storage location: Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) with project-specific data archiving.
- Dataset lineage: clearly defined field collection procedures, lab measurement protocols, and subsequent calculations to derive D12% and WSG.
- Access and reuse: datasets prepared to support biomass and carbon accounting; metadata and species identifications supported by herbarium verification to enable correct taxonomic usage.

## Roles and Stakeholders
- Lead organization: High School of Agronomy, Department of Forest.
- Collaborators and funders: co-funded by other donors collaborating with the lead team.
- Taxonomic verification: Tsimbazaza Botanical and Zoological Park Herbarium (Parc Botanique et Zoologique de Tsimbazaza) for species confirmation.

## Data Quality and Reliability
- Standardized sampling and measurement workflow minimizes intra- and inter-tree variability (e.g., multiple trees per species, consistent sampling height at 1.3 m).
- Rigorous moisture-state handling (12% MC) and validated methods (Archimedes displacement) ensure robust density calculations.
- Field and lab procedures documented to support reproducibility and auditability.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Ensure integration between field data (species, locations, tree metrics) and lab data (W12%, V12%, WD, VS) within a stable archival system.
- Maintain links between botanical identifications and herbarium records to preserve taxonomic accuracy.
- Monitor for updates or revisions in species nomenclature and ensure metadata reflects any changes.
- Prepare for interoperability with other datasets in the WSG and carbon accounting workflow, recognizing potential challenges from multiple data systems and large datasets.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Complexity of coordinating field and lab workflows across teams and systems.
- Ensuring timely data capture and synchronization between field collection and laboratory analyses.
- Managing metadata completeness to support long-term usability and cross-project comparability.
- Maintaining interoperability with broader datasets and evolving standards in biomass and carbon accounting.
