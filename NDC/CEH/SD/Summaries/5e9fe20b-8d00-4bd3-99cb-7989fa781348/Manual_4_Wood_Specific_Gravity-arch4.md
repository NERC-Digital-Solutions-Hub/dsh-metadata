# Manual for wood specific gravity determination within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (Manual n°4)

## Overview
- Purpose: to determine local wood specific gravity (WSG) values for accurate biomass (aboveground and root) and carbon accounting in humid tropical forest.
- Scope: generates datasets for national and international WSG benchmarks; datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Timeline and leadership: 2014–2016 fieldwork; update in February 2017; led by the High School of Agronomy - Department of Forest; co-funded by collaborating donors.

## Field process: collection of wood samples
- Collaboration with botanists to confirm local species names and local-scientific name alignment.
- Tree selection: healthy trees (undamaged trunks); 15 mm-diameter cores sampled at 1.3 m height.
- Sampling design: 10 trees per species (5 with DBH < 15 cm, 5 with DBH > 15 cm).
- Procedures: fill holes with branches to prevent biotic attack; preserve cores in bags; collect PHF index, estimate height and DBH with forester’s compass.
- Botanical verification: herbarium collection (leaves, flowers, fruits) stored for species verification at Tsimbazaza Herbarium.

## Lab process: measurement of wood density based on wood cores
- Objective: determine density at 12% moisture content (D12%) and wood specific gravity (WSG).
- Steps:
  - Cut 1 cm segment (bark removed) from each core.
  - Stabilize segments at 20°C and 65% RH until 12% moisture content is reached (constant weight for 3 days).
  - Determine 12% MC volume (V12%) by Archimedes water displacement.
  - Measure 12% MC weight (W12%).
  - Over-dry segments at 103°C for 2 days to constant anhydrous weight (WD).
  - Weigh WD (to avoid rewetting).
  - Re-saturate segments and measure saturated volume (VS) by Archimedes displacement.
- Calculations:
  - D12% = W12% / V12% (relative to water density).
  - WSG = WD / VS (relative to water density).
- Botanical validation: species names confirmed by Tsimbazaza Herbarium staff.

## Data management, quality, and governance
- Data products: per-segment density (D12%), WSG, and related measurements feeding biomass and carbon calculations.
- Data archiving: all datasets stored at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for traceability and reuse.
- Documentation and provenance: explicit recording of sampling and measurement procedures to support reproducibility and comparability across species and sites.

## Collaboration and context
- Lead institutions: High School of Agronomy - Department of Forest.
- Funding: co-funded by multiple donors.
- Purpose within ESPA WP4-Carbon: contributes to robust biomass and carbon accounting in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor.
