# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2019 to 2020.

## Overview
- Fortnightly monitoring dataset from the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Time period: January 2019 to end of 2020.
- Measurements include: surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, Secchi depth (water clarity), water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

## Data Available and Variables
- Data downloadable as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include:
  - Date: date of measurement.
  - Variable (Description): label for each parameter and its units.
  - Value: measurement value.
  - Sign (if < LOD): indicates values below detection limit with a < sign.
- Variables and units:
  - TEMP: surface temperature, in degrees Celsius (°C)
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation, in % air-saturation
  - SECC: Secchi depth (water clarity), in metres
  - ALKA: alkalinity, in µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: acidity/alkalinity, unitless
  - NH4N: ammonium, in µg N per litre
  - NO3N: nitrate, in µg N per litre

  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a, in µg per litre

## Sampling Regime and Methods
- Part of an ongoing monitoring dataset with fortnightly sampling.
- Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 m.
- Collected from a boat at the deepest part of the lake, at a marked buoy.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data explained by weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data Structure
- CSV data file with:
  - Date: measurement date
  - Description (Variable): name and unit of each variable
  - Value: measurement value
  - Sign (if < LOD): indicator for values below detection limit

## Data Provenance and Funding
- Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1.
- Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
