# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2019 to 2020

## Overview
- Part of an ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset for the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Measured variables (with units): 
  - surface temperature (TEMP, °C)
  - surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation)
  - Secchi depth (SECC, m)
  - alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3 per L)
  - pH
  - ammonium (NH4N, µg N per L)
  - nitrate (NO3N, µg N per L)
  - soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P per L)
  - total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P per L)
  - dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg per L)
  - phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg per L)
- Data cover January 2019 to end of 2020 and are available to download.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling from a boat at a buoy located at the deepest part of the lake.
- Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 meters.
- Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Data quality and status
- The dataset consists of raw data that have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
- Double entry and visual checks have been performed.
- Missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and variables
- Data provided as a CSV with columns:
  - Date, Description (Date of measurement)
  - Variable, Description (variable name)
  - Value, Description (numeric value)
  - Sign (if <LOD), Description (indicator for values below detection limit)

## Data provenance and access
- Collected at the South Basin of Windermere; funded under NERC grant NE/R016429/1 as part of UK-SCaPE.
- Available to download, including measurements for TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, and TOCA.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Importance of robust metadata, clear handling of detection limits, and planned quality control/calibration workflows.
- Need for transparent data provenance (funding, programme) to aid future reuse and integration with broader datasets.
- Potential data gaps to address in governance (e.g., ongoing collection, standardization of units, and documentation of methods to support cross-site comparability).
