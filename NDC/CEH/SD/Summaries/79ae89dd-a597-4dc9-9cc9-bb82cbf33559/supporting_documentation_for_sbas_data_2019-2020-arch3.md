Feuchtmayr, H., Carter, H.T., Clarke, M.A., De Ville, M.M., Dodd, B.A., James, J.B., Keenan, P.O., Mackay, E.B., McShane, G., Rhodes, G., Thackeray, S.J., Maberly, S.C. (2024)

## Purpose and scope
- Part of an ongoing fortnightly monitoring dataset for South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Aims to support environmental health monitoring, policy scrutiny, and informing future decisions.

## Variables and units (downloadable data)
- Surface temperature (TEMP): degrees Celsius (°C)
- Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG): % air-saturation
- Secchi depth (SECC): metres (m)
- Alkalinity (ALKA): µg CaCO3 per litre
- pH
- Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per litre
- Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per litre
- Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per litre
- Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per litre
- Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg SiO2 per litre
- Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling at the South Basin of Windermere.
- Water sample collected from 0 to 7 m depth as an integrated sample.
- Measurements taken from a boat at a buoy located in the deepest part of the lake.

## Data quality and limitations
- Data are raw and have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
- Double entry and visual checks performed; some missing data attributed to weather, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns include: Date, Variable Description, Value, Sign (if <LOD).
- “Sign” indicates values below detection limit with a < sign.
- Data are available to download.

## Timeframe and funding provenance
- Time period: January 2019 through end of 2020.
- Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
