# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from South Basin of Windermere 2019 to 2020.

- Overview
  - Part of an ongoing monitoring dataset for Windermere (South Basin) in Cumbria, England.
  - Fortnightly sampling from January 2019 to end of 2020.
  - Measured parameters: surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).
  - Sampled from integrated 0–7 m water column; measurements taken from a boat at the deepest-site buoy.
  - Data available in a CSV with specified units for each variable.

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Fortnightly sampling at the South Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
  - Date range: January 2019 – end 2020.
  - Variables and units:
    - TEMP: surface temperature in °C
    - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation in % air-saturation
    - SECC: Secchi depth in metres
    - ALKA: alkalinity in µg CaCO3 per L
    - pH: unitless
    - NH4N: ammonium in µg N per L
    - NO3N: nitrate in µg N per L
    - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate in µg P per L
    - TOTP: total phosphorus in µg P per L
    - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon in µg per L
    - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a in µg per L
  - Data collection site: deepest part of the lake, at a buoy.
  - Data are recorded as raw values (0–7 m integrated sample).

- Data quality and limitations
  - Data presented are raw and have not yet undergone quality control or calibration.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data attributed to weather conditions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.
  - <LOD values are indicated with a < sign in the Sign (if<LOD) column.

- Data structure and format
  - Composed as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
  - Columns include:
    - Date: measurement date
    - Variable, Description: parameter name and description (e.g., TEMP, surface temperature)
    - Value, Description: measured value with units
    - Sign (if<LOD), Description: indicator if value is below detection limit

- Data provenance and funding
  - Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1.
  - Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

- Relevance for analysts monitoring the environment
  - Provides a standardised, time-series dataset for surface water properties and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.
  - Suitable for quality-controlled analyses and integration into broader environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
  - Highlights data provenance, measurement methods, and current QC status to inform subsequent data processing and validation steps.
