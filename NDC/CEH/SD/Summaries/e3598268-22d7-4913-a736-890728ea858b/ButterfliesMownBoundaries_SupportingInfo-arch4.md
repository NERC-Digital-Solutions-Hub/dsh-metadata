# raw data sets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape in 2012

## Purpose and Scope
- Documents the raw data sets on Lepidoptera behavior and distribution collected in 2012 at the Stonehenge Landscape.
- Data are raw counts of Lepidoptera individuals, their flight paths, and associated botanical data (flowering units and percent cover in quadrats).
- Includes notes on data quality assurance (checking for outliers/anomalies via pivot tables and exploratory analysis; specific analyses not shown).

## Study Site and Context
- Location: National Trust’s Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, SW UK.
- Context: Long-term landscape-scale grassland restoration and re-creation project ongoing since 2000, aiming to protect archaeological features while restoring ecological value.
- Habitat mosaic: Chalk grassland fragments on barrows and slopes, grassland re-creation fields of varying ages, semi-improved pasture, arable land, and woodland.

## Experimental Design
- Site of experiment: Seven Barrows grassland re-creation field; sown in 2000 with chalk grassland seed from Salisbury Plain.
- Boundaries: Two large grassland areas (40 m × 50 m) with eight 20 m survey boundaries (boundaries 1–8); four boundaries are treatment (edge of a mown area) and four are control (continuous unmown grass with dummy boundaries).
- Blocks and shelter: Two blocks—one sheltered (un-mown side to the west) and one exposed (un-mown side to the east).
- Spatial arrangement: Boundaries within blocks placed to minimize variation and to fit area allocated by a tenant farmer; treatment and control boundaries spaced to manage confounding effects from fences and woodland.
- Survey window: Boundaries surveyed from 24 July to 23 August 2012; mown area area limited to 0.04 ha in total (and fenced-off area to ≤0.01 km across) to reduce grazing impact.
- Limitations: Proximity of boundaries to mown edges, fences, and field features may influence Lepidoptera responses; 2.5 m from perpendicular edge of the mown area; minimum 15 m from boundaries to fences.

## Lepidoptera Survey Protocols
- Survey method: Surveyor at boundary or dummy boundary; track flight paths within 10 m on either side of boundary.
- Session duration: Each Lepidoptera observed for 3 minutes or until stationary >3 minutes or moved >20 m from boundary; boundaries surveyed for 20 minutes per session.
- Survey periods: Three periods over five weeks; random sequence of boundary surveys; equal effort on both sides of boundary; time of day randomized.
- Aim and timing: Conducted during peak adult activity for Maniola jurtina and Zygaena filipendulae (late July to early August; prior transect data indicate peak visit times for these species during this window).
- Data captured per observation: Species, start/finish location (habitat side), flight path, and behavior at boundary.

## Environmental and Contextual Variables
- Vegetation metrics: Eight 0.5 m × 0.5 m quadrats per survey area (four on unmown side, four on mown side and corresponding control sides) to record vegetation height/density (drop-disc method) and nectar flower availability (number of flowering units, by family groups).
- Temporal sampling of vegetation: Measurements on three dates (19 July, 10 August, 23–24 August).
- Weather context: Average wind speed/direction from a nearby meteorological station (Boscombe Down); cloud cover estimated; conditions deemed acceptable for butterfly surveys per standard schemes.
- Habitat and flora context: Field plant community characteristics described to relate to chalk grassland analogs and re-creation success.

## Nomenclature and Data Schemas
- Taxonomic standardization: Plant nomenclature follows Stace (2010); Lepidoptera nomenclature follows Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field identifications use standard field guides.
- Data tables and codes: Detailed keys provided for data columns in the data sheets, including:
  - Lepidoptera data: date, temperature, wind metrics, cloud cover, grid square, plot type (Mown/Chalk/Edge), survey edge, start/end times, species, species code, sex, behavior, start/end habitat types, direction of movement, nectar plant (if any), and notes.
  - Resources data: date, survey edge, habitat, side, quadrat number, drop disc, bare ground, dead vegetation, flowering plant species and codes, coverage or number of flowering units.
- Species and plant reference tables: Comprehensive mapping of Lepidoptera species to codes and common names; plant species with scientific names, common names, and codes.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Limitations
- Data provenance: Raw Lepidoptera and botanical data collected as part of a boundary experiment within the Stonehenge Landscape; adapted from the PhD work Landscape Connectivity: a key to effective habitat restoration in lowland agricultural landscapes (Grace Twiston-Davies, 2014).
- Quality assurance: Outliers and anomalies were investigated using species-appropriate expectations and exploratory checks (details not shown in the document).
- Limitations and interpretive cautions:
  - Possible Lepidoptera responses to the perpendicular edge of the mown area or surrounding fences at control boundaries.
  - Short sampling window may limit representation of full flight season; spacing between survey periods intended to minimize pseudoreplication but still requires careful interpretation of repeated observations.
  - Proximity of survey boundaries and shared environmental features may influence observed flight paths and behaviors.
