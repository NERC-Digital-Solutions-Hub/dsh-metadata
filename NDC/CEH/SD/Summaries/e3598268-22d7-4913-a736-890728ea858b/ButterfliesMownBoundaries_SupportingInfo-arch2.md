# Data collection methods and description of Lepidoptera data from a mown boundary experiment within the Stonehenge landscape, UK-1

- Purpose: Document the raw datasets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape in 2012, including associated botanical data and data quality checks. Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies' PhD work (Landscape Connectivity: a key to effective habitat restoration in lowland agricultural landscapes).

- Context and study site:
  - Location: Stonehenge Landscape within the National Trust Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, SW UK.
  - Habitat project: Long-term landscape-scale grassland restoration initiated around 2000 using chalk grassland seed from Salisbury Plain to re-create target habitats on ex-arable fields.
  - Landscape components: Chalk grassland fragments on slopes, various ages of grassland restoration fields, semi-improved pasture, arable land, and woodland.

- Experimental design (Seven Barrows field):
  - Setup: Two large grassland areas (40 m x 50 m) with eight 20 m survey boundaries (boundaries 1–8).
  - Treatments: Four boundaries adjacent to a mown area (treatment) and four boundaries in continuous unmown grass (control/dummy boundaries).
  - Blocks: Two blocks—one sheltered and one exposed—differing in the un-mown side orientation (west in sheltered; east in exposed for control comparisons).
  - Distances: Boundaries arranged to minimise confounding factors (boundaries close together; treatment and control separated by 25 m; fences and nearby woodland considerations noted).
  - Area limits: Mown area restricted to ≤ 400 m2 in total; experimental area fenced to ≤ 100 m across.

- Lepidoptera survey protocol:
  - Survey method: Observers tracked Lepidoptera flight paths within 10 m on either side of each boundary; each individual’s flight path recorded for three minutes.
  - Survey duration: Each boundary surveyed for 20 minutes per survey period, across three survey periods over five weeks (late July to late August 2012).
  - Boundaries: All eight boundaries surveyed in each period; sampling order randomized; time-of-day randomised to reduce bias.
  - Data captured per insect: species, start and end location (within unmown/mown sides or boundary edge), flight path, and exit behaviour.
  - Behavioural categorisation: Exit from the 20 m x 20 m area classified as crossing, following, or avoiding; a “staying” category used if the insect did not exit or path was too convoluted.
  - Weather and conditions: Surveys conducted under conditions acceptable for similar butterfly monitoring schemes; use of nearest meteorological data when needed.

- Environmental and plant data collection:
  - Vegetation metrics: Eight 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats per boundary (four on unmown side, four on mown side; and corresponding control sides) to measure vegetation height/density (drop-disc method) and bare ground.
  - Nectar resources: Nectar flower availability recorded as the number of flowering units, focusing on Asteraceae, Fabaceae, and Dipsacaceae families; plant identification aligned with a nectar plant database.
  - Timing: Vegetation and nectar measurements conducted on three occasions (19 July, 10 August, 23–24 August 2012).
  - Additional environment: Wind speed/direction from Boscombe Down meteorological station; cloud cover estimated by eye.

- Nomenclature and data coding:
  - Plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature: Based on standard references (Stace 2010; Langmaid et al. 1989; Heath & Emmet 1985), with field identifications guided by Field Studies Council guides.
  - Data tables and keys: Data sheets include detailed keys for Lepidoptera and nectar/plant species (e.g., species codes, habitat type, boundary edge, movement direction, nectaring notes, etc.).

- Data structure and contents (UK-1 data sheet emphasis):
  - Core fields include: date, temperature, wind speed/direction, cloud cover, grid square (control/edge), plot (mown/unmown/edge), survey edge ID (1–8), start/end times, species and species code, sex, behaviour, start/end habitat type, movement direction, notes, nectaring on/off and nectaring plant species.
  - Additional metadata: Labelling and column descriptions to support consistent data entry across boundaries and survey periods.

- Data quality assurance and limitations:
  - QA procedures included checking for outliers and anomalies using pivot tables and exploratory analysis (details not shown in the document).
  - Experimental constraints: Potential edge effects from the mown boundary and fences; proximity of survey boundaries may influence Lepidoptera responses; efforts to minimize these factors noted but interpretation requires careful consideration.

- Data use, sharing, and relevance for environmental monitoring:
  - The dataset exemplifies standardized, site-specific monitoring of insect movement and habitat-edge interactions within a restoration landscape.
  - Emphasizes storing and potentially integrating the dataset with other environmental datasets to enhance value beyond a single-use application.
  - Aims to enable broader access to underlying data used to generate final outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts) for transparency and policy evaluation.
