Data collection methods and description of Lepidoptera data from a mown boundary experiment within the Stonehenge landscape, UK-1

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes raw data sets on Lepidoptera behavior and distribution in the Stonehenge Landscape (2012), adapted from a PhD thesis on landscape connectivity and habitat restoration.
  - Combines Lepidoptera flight-path observations with botanical (flowering units, vegetation cover) data, plus basic QA to identify outliers/anomalies.

- Study site and context
  - National Trust Stonehenge Landscape, within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Long-term landscape-scale grassland restoration using chalk grassland seed reintroduced to ex-arable fields (2000–2012), with mosaic of grassland fragments, restoration fields, pastures, arable land and woodland.

- Experimental design
  - Location: Seven Barrows grassland re-creation field; two large areas (40 m x 50 m) with eight 20 m survey boundaries.
  - Treatments: four boundaries at the edge of a mown area (treatment) and four corresponding dummy boundaries in continuous unmown grass (controls).
  - Blocking: two blocks (sheltered and exposed) to test edge effects relative to windward/leeward conditions.
  - Spatial constraints: boundaries arranged to minimize variation; area limited by tenant farming (mown area ≤ 400 m2; fenced area ≤ 100 m across).

- Survey logistics
  - Boundaries surveyed for 20 minutes total per boundary, across three survey periods within five weeks (late July to late August 2012).
  - Each boundary observed on three occasions; order of boundaries and timing randomized to avoid bias.
  - Environment: surveys conducted under acceptable butterfly monitoring conditions; weather logged via nearest station.

- Lepidoptera observation protocol
  - Observers tracked flight paths from a boundary (or dummy boundary) within a 20 m x 20 m area (10 m either side of boundary).
  - Each Lepidoptera observed for up to three minutes; exit behavior categorized as crossing, following, or avoiding the boundary; or staying if flight path remained within the area.
  - Data captured: species, start/finish location, flight path, behavior, and boundary context (edge vs unmown side).

- Environmental and habitat variables
  - Vegetation characteristics: eight 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats per survey area (four per side of boundary) measuring vegetation height/density (drop-disc method) and nectar flower availability.
  - Nectar resources: counts of flowering units by family (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae), recorded across three dates (mid July, early August, late August).
  - Additional covariates: wind speed and direction from Boscombe Down station; cloud cover estimated visually.

- Nomenclature and data structure
  - Standard plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature and codes used for field data sheets (detailed tables for species and flowering plants).
  - Data columns cover: date, environmental conditions (temperature, wind speed/direction, cloud cover), boundary type, habitat type, side, quadrat details, nectar flowering units, species and behavior codes, movement direction, and notes (including nectar plant and origin of flight path).

- Key data products and codes
  - Data files and table keys describe the Lepidoptera and nectar plant species with codes used in data sheets (e.g., species codes like Man.jur for Maniola jurtina; boundary IDs 1-8; edge vs chalk vs mown habitat statuses).
  - Field notes capture nuances such as double backs, feeding, and whether flight paths originated at boundaries.

- Data quality assurance and limitations
  - QA steps include searching for outliers and anomalies using species occurrence expectations and exploratory checks; some analyses are noted as not shown.
  - Principal limitations acknowledged: proximity to field edges and fences may influence Lepidoptera behavior; treatment boundaries are 2.5 m from mown edge with at least 15 m distance from fences, potentially confounding edge effects; short, three-period sampling windows may limit temporal coverage and increase interpretation complexity.

- Relevance for monitoring and policy evaluation
  - Demonstrates a replicable, boundary-based monitoring design to assess landscape management actions (mowing) on insect movement and local biodiversity.
  - Integrates biotic responses (flight behavior) with habitat structure and nectar resources, enabling evaluation of habitat connectivity and restoration outcomes.
  - Provides a comprehensive metadata and data-management approach (structured data sheets, standardized codes, temporal replication, and reporting formats) that can inform data governance, sharing, and transparency in monitoring frameworks.
