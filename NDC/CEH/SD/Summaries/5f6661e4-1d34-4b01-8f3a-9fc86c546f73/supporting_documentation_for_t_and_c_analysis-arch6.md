# Introduction to the project

- Context and funding: Data are part of the Peru GROWS and PEGASUS projects, funded by NERC (grants NE/S013296/1 and NE/S013318/1) and CONCYTEC through the Newton-Paulet Fund; Peruvian work conducted within call E031-2018-01-NERC "Glacier Research Circles" via FONDECYT (Contract N° 08-2019FONDECYT). Associated with the paper on the energy and mass balance of Peruvian glaciers (accepted in Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres).
- Dataset scope: Outputs and analysis of Tethys-Chloris (T&C) melt and mass balance modelling at the point scale for five Peruvian glaciers: Artesonraju (AG), Shallap (SG), Cuchillacocha (CG), Quisoquipina (QQG), and Quelccaya Ice Cap (QIC). Related input data and model code are available in a linked dataset.
- Data and code producers: Model outputs generated by Catriona Fyffe; analysis code mainly by Fyffe; one subfunction (Incoming_longwave.m) by Simone Fatichi.
- Weather and climate data: NOAA Ocean Niño Index (ONI) data used for climate context; ONI sourced from NOAA CPC (downloaded 29 September 2020). Anomalies >/±0.5 °C define warm/cold phases.
- Purpose of the dataset: To enable cross-site comparison of energy and mass balance from the T&C model and to assess climate sensitivity scenarios (temperature perturbations +1 to +6 °C and precipitation changes −30% to +30%).
- Data products and formats: Outputs of standard T&C runs, climate sensitivity analyses, and associated figures. Outputs are available as MATLAB (.mat) files and CSVs; analysis scripts are provided to reproduce figures and summarize results.
- Documentation and structure: Detailed file descriptions are provided (Tables 2–5) describing contents and variable definitions; comprehensive variable definitions are included in Table 3 for the *_output_data.csv files.
- Data organization (high-level): 
  - Main_runs_for_analysis: Per-site model outputs (e.g., AG_Run_ax.mat, CG_Run_z.mat, QIC_Run_..., QQG_Run_..., SG_Short_k.mat) plus NOAA_ONI.mat.
  - Main_analysis: Energy fluxes and mass balance analyses; outputs as AG_output_data.csv, CG_output_data.csv, QIC_output_data.csv, QQG_output_data.csv, SG_output_data.csv; All_stations_analysis4.mat; T_and_C_Peru_Analysis_EIDC.m (reproduces figures).
  - Climate_sensitivity: Code and results for climate-sensitivity runs; includes per-site difference CSVs (Abl_diff, Imelt_diff, ISWE_diff, Smelt_diff, Sub_diff, Tmelt_diff) and Climate_sensitivity_analysis_EIDC.m; climate_sensitivity_vars_2_ea_change.mat; ISWE_color2.mat.
  - Energy_ablation_change: Sub-folder with Climate_sensitivity_energy.m and outputs comparing standard vs +2 °C perturbation (Energy_compare_vars_2_with_ea_change.mat; SD_all_2.mat; Ta2_all_2.mat). 
- How to use and reproduce analyses: 
  - To run main analyses, adjust pathnames in T_and_C_Peru_Analysis_EIDC.m to point to Main_runs_for_analysis, then execute to generate energy, mass balance, and El Niño-related figures.
  - Climate sensitivity analyses: run Climate_sensitivity_analysis_EIDC.mat to load outputs from climate_sensitivity_vars_2_ea_change.mat and produce corresponding difference grids (mm w.e. h−1; m w.e. yr−1 for surface height changes).
  - Energy ablation comparison: run Climate_sensitivity_energy.m to compare standard vs +2 °C perturbation; view outputs in Energy_compare_vars_2_with_ea_change.mat and SD_all_2.mat / Ta2_all_2.mat.
- Data contents and variable definitions: The dataset includes a comprehensive set of variables related to atmospheric forcing, energy fluxes, melt terms, snow/ice properties, and hydrological state (detailed in Table 3 of the documentation), enabling site-by-site and cross-site comparisons.
- Intended use for data support: Facilitates data discovery, combination of model outputs across sites, assessment of climate perturbations, and creation of data products (plots and dashboards) to support broader data-informed understanding of glacier energy and mass balance dynamics.
