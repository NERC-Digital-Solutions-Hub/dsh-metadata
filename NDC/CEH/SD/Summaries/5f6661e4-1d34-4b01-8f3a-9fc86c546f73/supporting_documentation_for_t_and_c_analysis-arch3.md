# The energy and mass balance of Peruvian glaciers

- Purpose and context
  - Dataset and analysis outputs for melt and mass balance modelling at five Peruvian glaciers (Artesonraju AG, Shallap SG, Cuchillacocha CG, Quisoquipina QQG, Quelccaya Ice Cap QIC) using the Tethys-Chloris model.
  - Part of the Peru GROWS and PEGASUS projects; funded by NERC and CONCYTEC; associated with the paper on energy and mass balance of Peruvian glaciers.
  - Aimed at enabling site-by-site comparison of energy fluxes and melt/mass balance and assessing climate sensitivity scenarios.

- Data sources and inputs
  - Meteorological inputs and glacier input data derived from weather station locations (point-scale modelling).
  - Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) data from NOAA CPC used to characterize ENSO phase (warm/cold) based on 3-month running mean SST anomalies.
  - Climate sensitivity experiments perturb inputs by increasing air temperature (+1 to +6 °C) and altering precipitation (-30% to +30%).

- Analysis scope and outputs
  - Focus on energy fluxes, melt, and mass balance at each site, including ablation, ice melt, snow melt, sublimation, and total melt.
  - Outputs include hourly and summary metrics, enabling comparison across sites and climate scenarios.
  - Analyses include standard T&C model runs and climate sensitivity runs, with differences highlighted between runs.

- Data organization and accessibility
  - Main folders and purpose:
    - Main_runs_for_analysis: standard model outputs for each site plus NOAA ONI data.
    - Main_analysis: code and outputs for energy flux and mass balance analysis; includes All_stations_analysis and site-specific CSV outputs.
    - Climate_sensitivity: code and data for climate sensitivity analyses; contains per-site difference grids and CSVs showing changes in key variables.
    - Energy_ablation_change: sub-folder for direct comparison between standard and +2 °C perturbed runs.
  - Key file types:
    - MATLAB data files (.mat) and CSV files for site outputs (AG, CG, QIC, QQG, SG).
    - Analysis scripts: T_and_C_Peru_Analysis_EIDC.m (main analysis), Climate_sensitivity_analysis_EIDC.m, Climate_sensitivity_energy.m.
    - Climate sensitivity outputs: AG_Abl_diff.csv, AG_Imelt_diff.csv, AG_ISWE_diff.csv, etc., for all five sites.
  - Tabled descriptions provided for file contents, variables, and units (e.g., Ta for air temperature, Pr for precipitation, Tmelt for melt rate, SWE for snow water equivalent, etc.).

- Reproducibility and metadata
  - The dataset includes detailed metadata describing variables and units (Table 2 and Table 3 style descriptions), covering inputs, model outputs, and processed variables.
  - Reproducibility steps:
    - Adjust pathnames in T_and_C_Peru_Analysis_EIDC.m to point to Main_runs_for_analysis data and run to reproduce energy, melt, and El Niño figures.
    - Run Climate_sensitivity_analysis_EIDC.mat to reproduce climate-sensitivity figures; outputs include difference grids and CSVs.
    - Use Climate_sensitivity_energy.m to compare energy and mass balance between standard and +2 °C perturbation runs.
  - Data provenance and credits:
    - Model outputs generated by the Tethys-Chloris (T&C) model; primary analysis by project team; input data and code documented, with subfunctions referenced (e.g., Incoming_Longwave.m).

- Key variables and metrics
  - Energy and mass balance indicators: net radiation (Rn), sensible heat (H), latent heat (QE), shortwave (Rsw) and longwave (Latm) components, ground heat flux (G), surface melt (Tmelt), ablation (Abl), ice melt (Imelt), snow melt (Smelt), sublimation (Sub), snow depth (SND), snow water equivalent (SWE), ice pack depth (ICE, ICE_D), albedo (ALB), air temperature (Ta), precipitation (Pr), wind (Ws), vapor pressure (ea), cloudiness (N), and other related fluxes.
  - Outputs include hourly series and aggregated metrics, plus site-specific and cross-site comparisons.
  - Climate sensitivity outputs quantify differences between standard runs and perturbations in terms of mm water equivalent per hour (for melt-related fluxes) and meters water equivalent per year (for mass balance).

- Climate sensitivity approach and outputs
  - Grid of perturbations: precipitation varied by -30% to +30% by column; air temperature increased by +1 °C to +6 °C by row.
  - Metrics compared: ablation, ice melt, snow melt, total melt, sublimation, and specific mass balance (change in surface height).
  - Outputs include difference CSVs for each variable by site (e.g., AG_Tmelt_diff.csv, CG_Smelt_diff.csv) and an energy ablation change comparison (Energy_ablation_change/Climate_sensitivity_energy.m).

- Practical considerations for use and governance
  - Data formats (MATLAB and CSV) facilitate reuse but may require MATLAB or compatible tools.
  - Comprehensive metadata and variable descriptions support interpretation and governance of data quality and provenance.
  - Clear instructions are provided to reproduce analyses and figures, supporting transparency and traceability.
  - Documentation notes input data sources and processing steps, aiding audit and reporting for monitoring frameworks.

- Limitations and potential barriers (as reflected in the dataset documentation)
  - The documentation emphasizes metadata detail, but actual metadata completeness depends on origin data and dataset upkeep.
  - Reproducibility requires editing code pathnames and access to MATLAB-based workflows; this may pose a barrier for non-MATLAB environments.
  - Data sharing constraints are not explicitly discussed beyond file availability and metadata, but the explicit sharing of inputs/outputs and code supports openness for monitoring purposes.
