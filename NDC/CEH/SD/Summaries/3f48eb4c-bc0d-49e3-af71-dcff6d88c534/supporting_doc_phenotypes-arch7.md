# Daily photographs of paired phenotypic interactions between four strains of Streptomyces bacteria isolated from a nature reserve in Minnesota, USA

## Overview
- A study of intercellular signalling and interaction phenotypes among four sympatric Streptomyces strains.
- Includes daily photographs of four interacting bacteria in paired co-cultures (days 2–6 post inoculation).
- Photographs correspond to, and will be analyzed alongside, mass spectrometry data (submission ongoing).
- Strains isolated from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota; linked to prior work on soilborne Streptomyces (Schlatter et al., 2013).

## Dataset contents
- Image dataset: photographs of the four interacting bacteria in all pairwise configurations, captured daily from day 2 to day 6.
- File format: .jpg; unedited images.
- All images stored in a single folder.

## File naming and organization
- Naming convention: D_L_R_N_I.jpg
  - D = day (2–6)
  - L = left strain (A, B, C, D)
  - R = right strain (A, B, C, D)
  - N = biological replicate number
  - I = technical image replicate number

## Data collection and methods
- Culture preparation:
  - Spores standardized to 1 × 10^9 CFU/mL in 20% glycerol.
  - Diluted 10-fold to 1 × 10^8 CFU/mL in ISP2 broth.
  - 4 μL inoculated 1 cm apart in pairs on ISP2 agar.
  - Each pairing prepared in quadruplicate for each timepoint (n = 20 per pairing for downstream analyses).
- Imaging design:
  - One set of quadruplicate plates photographed daily to capture phenotypes; destructive sampling for metabolite/RNA analyses limits sampling at earlier timepoints.
  - Photos taken daily on days 2–6 from the same four plates (randomly selected set).
  - Photography performed in a class II biosafety cabinet with fixed alignment references.
- ISP2 medium:
  - Composition and preparation details provided; pH 7.2; autoclaved.

## Temporal coverage
- Images aligned to the inoculation timeline: day 1 begins at 24 hours post inoculation.
- Daily photography occurs days 2–6 post inoculation.

## Experimental design and replication
- Biological replication: n = 4 replicates for the photograph dataset (N in naming scheme).
- Technical replication: 4–5 images per timepoint per plate (denoted by I in naming).
- Overall design supports linkage between visual phenotypes and downstream molecular analyses (mass spectrometry, RNA) with destructive sampling accounted for.

## Quality control and provenance
- Strain identity verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA (primers 27F and 1492R; Eurofins Genomics, Germany).
- Dataset complete to at least biological triplicate for most timepoints; day 6 may show triplicate biological sampling for some pairings due to destructive LC-MS sampling.
- Documentation includes experimental design, replication details, and photographic protocol to support reproducibility and traceability.

## Reuse and GIS relevance
- Although primarily image-based, the dataset is structured with clear metadata (D, L, R, N, I), enabling potential GIS-informed analyses when linked to environmental context or sampling metadata.
- Useful for creating time-resolved, map-like visualizations of phenotypic interactions or for integrating with related metabolomic data workflows.
- Provenance and naming conventions aid data integration, cross-referencing with mass spectrometry data, and future spatial-temporal analyses.
