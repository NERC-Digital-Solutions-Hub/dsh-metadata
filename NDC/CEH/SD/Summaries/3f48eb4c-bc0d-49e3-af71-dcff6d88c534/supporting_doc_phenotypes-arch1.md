# Daily photographs of paired phenotypic interactions between four strains of Streptomyces bacteria isolated from a nature reserve in Minnesota, USA

## Overview
- Investigates intercellular signaling and interaction phenotypes among four sympatric Streptomyces strains.
- Photographs document four-strain pair interactions in co-culture, across days 2–6 post inoculation; these images accompany mass spectrometry data (submission ongoing).
- Strains were isolated from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota; linked to prior work on soilborne Streptomyces resource use (Schlatter et al. 2013).

## Data and file organization
- File format: .jpg image files.
- Location: all images stored in a single folder.
- Naming convention: D_L_R_N_I.jpg
  - D = day (2–6)
  - L = left strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - R = right strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - N = biological replicate number
  - I = technical image replicate number

## Data content and imaging specifics
- Image characteristics: unedited photographs, 4000 x 3000 resolution, focal length 5 mm.
- Temporal coverage: images taken daily from day 2 to day 6 after inoculation (day 1 defined as 24 h post inoculation).
- Experimental setup for imaging: each pairing prepared in quadruplicate for each timepoint; one set photographed daily to capture phenotypes (destructive sampling for metabolite/RNA analyses means imaging a fixed plate set).

## Experimental design and sampling
- Culture preparation:
  - Spores standardized to 1 × 10^9 CFU/mL in 20% glycerol.
  - Diluted 10-fold to 1 × 10^8 CFU/mL in ISP2 broth.
  - 4 μL inoculated 1 cm apart in pairs on ISP2 agar; quadruplicate plates for each pairing and timepoint (n = 20 plates per pairing for downstream analyses).
  - Metabolite and RNA sampling performed in triplicate daily with one spare plate.
- Imaging sampling regime: one set of quadruplicate plates imaged daily (to maintain consistent phenotypic observation while destructive sampling occurs).
- Temporal replication: technical replicates denoted by I in the naming scheme.

## Quality control and provenance
- Biological replication: dataset imaged for four biological replicates (N = 4) for phenotypes; LC-MS sampling reduces day-6 plates for some pairings, resulting in day-6 phenotypes largely biological quadruplicate but some triplicate.
- Identity confirmation: strains verified by PCR and Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA (primers 27F and 1492R).

## Metadata context and potential analyses
- Data supports cross-referencing observed phenotypes with concurrent metabolomics (mass spectrometry) data.
- Naming conventions and replication details enable reproducible tracking across days, strain pairings, and technical reps.
- The dataset complements existing soil microbiome research and enables exploration of strain-specific interaction dynamics and their biochemical correlates.
