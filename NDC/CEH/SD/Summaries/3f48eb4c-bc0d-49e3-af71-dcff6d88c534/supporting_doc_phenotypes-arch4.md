# Daily photographs of paired phenotypic interactions between four strains of Streptomyces bacteria isolated from a nature reserve in Minnesota, USA

## Overview
- Study of intercellular signaling and interaction phenotypes among four Streptomyces strains, using daily photographs of co-cultured pairs from days 2 to 6 post inoculation.
- Photographs complement ongoing mass spectrometry data collection; origin and prior work cited from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota.

## Data content and format
- File type: .jpg images
- Resolution and optics: 4000 x 3000; focal length 5 mm
- Storage: all files contained in a single folder
- Naming convention: D_L_R_N_I.jpg
  - D = day (2–6 post inoculation)
  - L = left-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - R = right-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - N = biological replicate number
  - I = technical image replicate number

## Experimental design and sampling
- Inoculum preparation: spores standardized to 1 x 10^9 CFU/mL in 20% glycerol; diluted 10-fold to 1 x 10^8 CFU/mL in ISP2 broth; 4 μL inoculated 1 cm apart in pairs on ISP2 agar
- Replicates: each pairing prepared in quadruplicate for each of 5 timepoints (n=20 per pairing) to support metabolite and RNA sampling in triplicate daily
- Imaging set: one subset of quadruplicate plates photographed daily to capture phenotypes; same four plates imaged to ensure consistency
- Technical replication: each timepoint imaged 4–5 times (I)
- Photographs taken in a class II biosafety cabinet with plates aligned to reference markings
- ISP2 medium: specified composition and pH (recipe provided)

## Temporal coverage
- Images captured daily from days 2 through 6 after bacterial inoculation (day 1 defined as 24 hours post inoculation)

## Data quality and provenance
- Strain identities confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (primers 27F and 1492R)
- Phenotype datasets account for destructive sampling, with day 6 photos largely from biological quadruplicates; some plates at day 6 used for LC-MS sampling

## Context and linkage
- Related to prior work on resource use and phylogeny in soilborne Streptomyces (Schlatter et al., 2013)
- Bacteria isolated from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota

## Access and reuse considerations
- Dataset designed to enable examination of phenotype timecourses for interacting strains and to be integrated with ongoing mass spectrometry data submissions
- Detailed experimental conditions and naming scheme facilitate traceability and reuse for downstream analyses of microbial interactions and data integration across platforms
