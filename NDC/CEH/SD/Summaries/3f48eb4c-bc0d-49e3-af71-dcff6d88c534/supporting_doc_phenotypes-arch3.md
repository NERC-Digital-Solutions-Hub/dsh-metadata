# Daily photographs of paired phenotypic interactions between four strains of Streptomyces bacteria isolated from a nature reserve in Minnesota, USA

- The study investigates intercellular signalling and interaction phenotypes among four sympatric Streptomyces strains collected from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota.
- Included dataset comprises daily photographs (days 2–6 post inoculation) of paired bacteria in co-culture, linked to mass spectrometry data that is currently being submitted.
- The work builds on prior isolation and characterization of these strains (see Schlatter et al., 2013).

## Data components

- File format and contents:
  - Image files in .jpg format, unedited
  - Resolution: 4000 x 3000; focal length: 5 mm
  - Stored in a single folder
- Naming convention: D_L_R_N_I.jpg
  - D = day (2–6)
  - L = left-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - R = right-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - N = biological replicate number
  - I = technical image replicate number
- Linked data:
  - Corresponding metabolomics (mass spectrometry) data is being submitted
- Identity verification:
  - Strain identities validated by PCR and Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA genes (primers 27F and 1492R)

## Experimental design and sampling

- Culture preparation:
  - Spores standardized to 1 x 10^9 CFU mL^-1 in 20% glycerol
  - Diluted 10-fold to 1 x 10^8 CFU mL^-1 in ISP2 broth
  - 4 μL inoculated 1 cm apart in pairs on ISP2 agar
- Replicates:
  - Each pairing prepared in quadruplicate for each timepoint (n = 20 total per pairing for MS/RNA sampling)
  - Included photograph dataset sampled from a randomly selected subset of the quadruplicate plates to avoid destructive sampling issues
  - Each pairing has 5 timepoints (days 2–6)
- Image collection:
  - Photographs captured daily on days 2–6 from the same four plates per pairing
  - Plates imaged in a class II biosafety cabinet with fixed positioning marked for consistency
- Additional methods:
  - Mass spectrometry and RNA sampling performed in triplicate daily (with one spare)

## Temporal coverage

- Timeframe relative to inoculation:
  - Day 1 begins at 24 hours post-inoculation
  - Images captured from days 2 through 6 post inoculation (daily)

## Quality control and provenance

- Quality assurance:
  - Identity confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing
  - Photographs aligned to reference positions to ensure comparability across days
  - Destructive sampling for LC-MS means day 6 phenotypes are largely from biological quadruplicates, with some triplicates
- Documentation:
  - Detailed ISP2 formulation provided
  - Inoculation and culture conditions explicitly described
- Data completeness:
  - Dataset for imaging is complete to biological triplicate at final timepoint for some pairings due to destructive sampling

## Data management and sharing considerations

- Data status:
  - Dataset of photographs is provided; associated LC-MS data submission is ongoing
- Metadata and governance:
  - Naming convention encodes key experimental variables (day, strains, biological replicate, technical replicate)
  - Some metadata (beyond naming and basic methods) is not elaborated in detail; potential need for standardized metadata schemas for data sharing
- Accessibility and reuse:
  - While the photograph dataset is organized and traceable, explicit public sharing or repository deposit details are not stated

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates:

  - The importance of clear data provenance, including strain identity verification and standardized culture methods
  - Use of explicit naming conventions to encode essential metadata (day, strains, replicates), facilitating data discovery and reuse
  - The interplay between phenotypic imaging and parallel omics data (LC-MS) for comprehensive interpretation
  - The practical challenges of data sharing when linked datasets (e.g., mass spectrometry) are still in submission
  - The need for robust quality control, replication strategies, and transparent documentation to support data governance and governance processes in monitoring frameworks
