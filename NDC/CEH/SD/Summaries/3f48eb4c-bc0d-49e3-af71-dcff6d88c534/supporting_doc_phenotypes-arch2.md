# Daily photographs of paired phenotypic interactions between four strains of Streptomyces bacteria isolated from a nature reserve in Minnesota, USA

## Overview
- Study of intercellular signalling in four sympatric Streptomyces strains from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota, USA.
- Dataset comprises daily photographs of paired interactions (two-strain co-cultures) from days 2 to 6 post inoculation.
- Photographs accompany mass spectrometry and RNA sampling data (submission of MS data ongoing).
- Builds on prior work re soilborne Streptomyces resource use variability across location, phylogeny, and nitrogen amendment (Schlatter et al., 2013).

## Data and file format
- File format: .jpg images, all in a single folder.
- Naming convention: D_L_R_N_I.jpg
  - D = day (2–6)
  - L = left-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - R = right-hand strain (A, B, C, or D)
  - N = biological replicate number
  - I = technical image replicate number
- Image specifics:
  - Resolution: 4000 x 3000
  - Focal length: 5 mm

## Temporal coverage and sampling
- Images captured daily from days 2 through 6 after inoculation (relative to day 1 = 24 hours post-inoculation).
- Each pairing was prepared in quadruplicate for each timepoint to enable destructive sampling for metabolomics and RNA analyses (n = 20 plates per pairing for MS/RNA; photographs sample a subset).

## Experimental design and sampling
- Bacterial preparation:
  - Spores standardized and aliquoted at 1 x 10^9 CFU/mL in 20% glycerol.
  - Diluted 10-fold to 1 x 10^8 CFU/mL in ISP2 broth.
  - 4 µL inoculated 1 cm apart in pairs on ISP2 agar.
  - Each pairing performed in quadruplicate for each timepoint (five timepoints total; n = 20 plates per pairing for downstream analyses).
- Imaging regime:
  - One set of quadruplicate plates chosen at random for daily photography to capture phenotypes while allowing destructive sampling elsewhere.
  - Plates imaged daily from days 2–6.
  - Imaging performed in a class II biosafety cabinet with consistent plate positioning.
- Media:
  - ISP2 composition: yeast extract, malt extract, glucose, optional agar; pH adjusted to 7.2; media sterilized by autoclaving.

## Quality control and provenance
- Identity verification:
  - Strains confirmed by PCR and Sanger sequencing of 16S rRNA (primers 27F and 1492R).
- Replication and data integrity:
  - Dataset intended to be complete to at least biological triplicate; for day 6, some plates used for LC-MS sampling, resulting in day-6 phenotypes primarily from biological triplicates.
  - Biological replicate number (N) preserved across imaging data; each image set aligns to the same plate across days.
- Documentation:
  - Clear dataset structure and naming to ensure traceability from day, strain pairing, replicate, and image instance.

## Provenance and context
- Strains were isolated from Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve, Minnesota; linking to the foundational work on microbial resource use in soilborne Streptomyces.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and data stewardship
- Demonstrates standardized, traceable data collection of microbial phenotypes with integrated multi-omics potential (phenotypic images + MS + RNA data), suitable for longitudinal environmental health and ecosystem function assessments.
- Emphasizes data quality assurance, replication strategy, and explicit metadata (naming conventions, replication counts), aligning with best practices for environmental data monitoring and dataset interoperability.
- Highlights opportunities to increase dataset value by combining with underlying omics data and ensuring broad accessibility of raw images and associated metadata.
