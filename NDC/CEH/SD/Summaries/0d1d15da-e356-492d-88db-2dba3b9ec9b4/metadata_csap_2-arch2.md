# Half-hourly water level and temperature measurements from seven wetland sites in the Pastaza-Marañón Basin, Amazonian Peru, 2018-2020

- Scope and purpose
  - Automated, half-hourly recordings of water level and temperature across seven wetland sites in the Pastaza-Marañón Basin, Peru, spanning parts of 2018–2020.
  - Data intended to support environmental monitoring and assessment of hydrological conditions over time.

- Methods and data collection
  - Instrumentation: Solinst Leveloggers installed in perforated plastic tube dipwells.
  - Corrections: Barometric pressure variations corrected using nearby barologgers; quality control performed in the field with software.

- Data structure and content
  - File: CSAP_2.1_Dipwell_loggers.csv (UTF-8, CSV)
  - Variables (first row): Plot_code, Date, Time, Level, Temperature
  - Date format: dd/mm/yyyy; Time: decimal fraction of day
  - Level: water level in metres relative to an arbitrary datum (positive = increasing depth)
  - Temperature: degrees Celsius
  - NA indicates missing data
  - Geographic scope: latitude -4.07 to -5.88, longitude -73.27 to -74.83

- Temporal and spatial coverage
  - Seven wetland sites in the Pastaza-Marañón Basin, Peru
  - Time span covers parts of 2018, 2019, and 2020

- Provenance and publication
  - Data collected and corrected as described; analyzed and published by Flores Llampazo et al. (2022) in Hydrological Processes
  - Project/funding: UKRI-NERC, grant NE/R000751/1; Principal Investigator Dr Ian Lawson

- Data management and accessibility
  - Field data downloaded, quality-checked, and corrected; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals
  - Data originally provided as a single dataset (CSAP_2.1_Dipwell_loggers.csv)

- Reuse considerations and challenges
  - Aim to increase dataset value by integrating with other relevant data sources
  - Emphasis on enabling access to underlying data used to produce outputs for broader verification and reuse

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
  - Provides standardized, time-resolved hydro-thermometric data to assess wetland hydrology, inform environmental health indicators, and support policy performance evaluation over time
