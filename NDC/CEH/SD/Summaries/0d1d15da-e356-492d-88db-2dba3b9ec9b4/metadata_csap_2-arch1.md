# Half-hourly water level and temperature measurements from seven wetland sites in the Pastaza-Marañón Basin, Amazonian Peru, 2018-2020

## Summary
- Automated half-hourly measurements of water level and temperature from seven wetland sites in Peru, covering parts of 2018–2020.
- Data collected with Solinst Leveloggers installed in perforated plastic tube dipwells.
- Barometric pressure corrections applied using nearby barologgers.
- Data analyzed and published by Flores Llampazo et al. (2022) in Hydrological Processes.
- Quality control included field download checks and corrections for atmospheric pressure variations using Solinst software.
- Dataset provided as a single UTF-8 CSV file: CSAP_2.1_Dipwell_loggers.csv, with fields Plot_code, Date, Time, Level, Temperature.
- NA indicates missing data; Level is in metres relative to an arbitrary datum (positive indicates rising depth); Time is a decimal fraction of the day; Date format is dd/mm/yyyy.
- Geographic coverage: lat -4.07 to -5.88, lon -73.27 to -74.83.
- Funded by UKRI-NERC (grant NE/R000751/1); Principal Investigator: Dr Ian Lawson.
