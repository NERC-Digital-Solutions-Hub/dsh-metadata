# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim and scope
- Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Laboratories responsible for controlled analyses; must document methodology changes and validation procedures.
- Annual review of procedures by Analytical Working Group with representatives from participating labs.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Each laboratory manages its own analytical resources under controlled conditions.
- Obligation to document methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- Methods and performance reviewed annually by the Analytical Working Group.

## Approved and reference techniques
- Approved techniques cover pH, conductivity, major ions, nitrogen and phosphorus species, DOC, total N, etc.
- Alternative techniques allowed; superscripts reference Notes for compatibility.
- For pH and conductivity, use approaches suitable for low ionic strength waters; separate reference electrodes recommended.
- Primary reference techniques listed (e.g., HMSO references) for comparison and assessment of new methods.
- Some techniques quantify related fractions (not direct species) but are acceptable with comparative testing to confirm lack of bias.
- Typical determinations and methods include:
  - pH and conductivity (with appropriate references)
  - Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al (AAS or Col-PCV/ICP/OES as applicable)
  - NH4+-N (indophenol blue)
  - Cl−, NO3−, SO4(2−) (IC)
  - Alkalinity (HMSO method)
  - PO4(3−) (molybdenum blue)
  - DOC (combustion or colorimetry)
  - Total N (Kjeldahl/indophenol blue or Persulphate/NO3)
- Laboratories should keep detailed method records locally; summary information stored in the ECN database.

## Determinands, detection limits, and data reporting
- Detection limits provided as targets; laboratories may differ in analytical ranges.
- Data must indicate the fraction measured (e.g., SO4 by IC vs ICP/OES) to monitor bias; if alternative techniques are used, monitor both methods to confirm no bias.
- Priority listing for limited sample volumes (soil solution and precipitation waters):
  1. pH, conductivity
  2. Anions and cations in sequence (specific order for Ca/Mg, NO3−, SO4(2−), PO4(3−), Cl−)
  3. NH4+-N
  4. Fe2+, Al3+ (cations needing separate acidified portions)
  5. DOC
  6. Total-N, alkalinity
- Refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling, filtration, pH, and acidification.

## Providing details of methodology (data management)
- Laboratories keep method details for operators; ECN database holds summary methodology per determinand per site/date.
- Example structure for a determinand (nitrate) includes: site, determinand, sample types, typical concentrations, calibration range, detection limit, measurement method, data reported, and QC measures.
- Purpose: enable traceability, interoperability, and assessment of suitability for purpose.

## Validation: accuracy and precision
- Validation achieved via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK).
- Accuracy reflects closeness to true value and agreement across laboratories; record accuracy checks and any corrections.
- An accuracy record example illustrates comparisons against control schemes and relative errors; corrective measures documented if needed.

## Precision and quality control (QC)
- Precision is ensured using synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported to Site Managers with each batch.
- Separate ECN QC system encourages sites to perform independent QC validation and to join interlaboratory proficiency schemes.
- Potential to derive between-site correction factors; monitor long-term trends and rogue batches.
- QC solutions: two concentrated QC concentrates (cation and anion) prepared annually; distributed to sites; analyze QC samples in the same way as samples.
- Data transfer: QC data submitted to ECN CCU in the same format as samples; a single QC record per batch containing both anion and cation results.
- QC data record format: free-format, comma-separated with fields including measurement code, site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis dates, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, and quality codes if applicable.
- Example QC record provided (Moor House) with detailed fields.

## Data management and change control
- Any changes to methodology create a new record in the ECN meta-database with a date stamp.
- Instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training are managed by the laboratory.
- Laboratories should archive methodology details and ensure data suitability for purpose; record and communicate any corrections or changes.

## Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Ensures standardized, quality-assured water analysis across ECN sites.
- Supports data comparability over time through uniform techniques, detection limits, and QC practices.
- Facilitates data sharing, transparency, and the ability to detect biases or analytical trends across sites.
