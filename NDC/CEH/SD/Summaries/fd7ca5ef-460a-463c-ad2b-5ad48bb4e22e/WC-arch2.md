# WC Protocol

- The WC Protocol defines standardized weekly sampling and analysis of surface water chemistry to track how climate, land use, and pollution affect water quality, and to support nutrient budgets and potential acidification concerns.

## Aim and Rationale
- Monitor changes in major ions and nutrients in rivers/streams to indicate biogeochemical responses to environmental drivers.
- Measure ions such as Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4, NO3-N, NH4-N, PO4-P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon, plus trace factors like Fe and Al to assess chemical states and potential acidification.
- Use concentrations combined with water flow to calculate loads/fluxes and inform nutrient budgets and policy-relevant indicators.

## Sampling Location and Frequency
- Collect from flowing river water at at least one representative site above the weir; site location is recorded and used consistently.
- Weekly sampling on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) to align with other ECN collections.
- One 250 ml sample taken from flowing water, at the same upstream location on each occasion.
- Stage height recorded to the nearest 2 mm.

## Sampling Procedure and Analysis
- Conduct conductivity and pH measurements on unfiltered water at the site per the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.
- After initial measurements, filter the sample and analyze for:
  - Major ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl−, SO4 2−, NO3−-N, NH4+-N
  - Nutrients: PO4 3−-P
  - Alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC)
  - Iron (Fe2+) and Aluminum (Al3+) with attention to pH-dependent chemical states (relevant to acidification studies)
- Sample bottle washing and handling follow the WH Protocol.

## Labelling and Metadata
- Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for a specific site)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time where appropriate)
- Labeling information must appear on the bottle and accompany results when transferred to the ECN database.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Plans to implement continuous measurements of:
  - Temperature
  - Conductivity
  - pH
  - Turbidity
- Sensors are being tested; an ECN specification will be prepared once suitable devices are identified.

## Data Recording Conventions and Core Measurements
- Core measurement: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
- Required variables for each sampling event (with data formats defined in ECN data transfer docs):
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time
  - pH (Units: GMT 24-h clock)
  - Conductivity
  - Concentrations for Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO4 2−, PO4 3−-P
  - Alkalinity and DOC
- Recording forms: standardized field recording form available from the ECN CCU; example provided in Appendix II.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Data submitted to the ECN Central Coordination Unit; refer to accompanying Data Transfer documentation for dataset formats.
- If access is needed, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk; data pipelines are designed to store and upload datasets to appropriate portals.

## Practical Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts
- Increase the value of monitoring datasets by integrating with other relevant data rather than keeping outputs as single-use products.
- Enable broad access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs, supporting transparency and secondary analyses.
