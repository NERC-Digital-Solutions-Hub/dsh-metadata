# WC Protocol

## Aim and Rationale
- Purpose: collect weekly surface water samples to analyze major cations and anions; changes in water chemistry reflect climate, land use, and pollution influences.
- Measured variables help understand biogeochemical processes and nutrient budgets; enables calculation of loads and fluxes of ions.

## Location and Sampling Schedule
- Sampling site: at least one representative site above the weir; location recorded and used consistently for all sampling.
- Schedule: weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesday) within a specified one-hour window; use the same sampling location on each occasion.

## Sampling Procedure and Analysis
- Sample collection: one 250 ml river water sample from flowing water; bottle rinsed with river water, replaced and filled to avoid air space; stage height recorded to the nearest 2 mm.
- In-situ measurements: conductivity and pH measured on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- Laboratory analysis (post-filtering): major ions and nutrients analyzed include Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.

## Washing Equipment
- Bottle washing procedures described in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

## Labeling and Documentation
- Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time if applicable)
- This labeling accompanies the sample through all analytical stages and into the ECN database.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Plans to implement continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Sensor testing underway; ECN specification to be developed once satisfactory sensors are identified.

## Recording Conventions and Data Management
- Core dataset requirements: first four parameters (Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time) to uniquely identify each sample.
- Data to be recorded for weekly sampling includes pH, conductivity, and concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3--P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
- Data transfer formats and site-specific documentation are available via ECNCCU, with access via the restricted Site Managers' extranet; for access, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
- Recording forms: standard field recording form available from the CCU; Appendix II provides an example.
