# WC Protocol

- Overview and aim
  - Weekly collection of river water samples to monitor changes in major cations, anions, and nutrients.
  - Changes reflect climate, land use, and pollution; allow calculation of loads/fluxes to inform nutrient budgets.
  - Measures biogeochemical processes and external inputs; supports assessment of water quality and ecosystem health.

- Location and sampling plan
  - Sampling site is a representative point above the weir; site location recorded and used consistently.
  - Sampling cadence: weekly on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) to align with other ECN collections.
  - Sample type and method: one 250 ml sample from flowing water, collected at the same location each time; bottle rinsed with river water, then filled with no air space.
  - Field measurements: stage height recorded to the nearest 2 mm; conductivity and pH measured on unfiltered water according to the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.

- Analysis and target variables
  - After initial filtering, samples analyzed for:
    - Major ions: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Cl-, SO4^2-, alkalinity
    - Nutrients and related species: NH4+-N, NO3--N, PO4^3--P
    - Trace/chemical states: Fe2+, Al3+ (pH-dependent states)
    - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)

- Equipment care and handling
  - Bottle washing and sample handling follow procedures described in the WH Protocol.

- Labeling, coding, and data traceability
  - Samples uniquely identified by ECN codes:
    - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
    - ECN Site Identification Code (Site ID)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date (and time when applicable)
  - The ECN CCU requires these identifiers on the bottle and accompanying the results through all analytical stages to ensure traceability.
  - Data and results should be uploaded to the ECN database with the associated metadata.

- Continuous monitoring
  - Aim to implement continuous measurements for: water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable sites.
  - Sensor technologies are being tested; an ECN specification will be produced once suitable sensors are identified.

- Data specification and transfer
  - Core measurement dataset must include:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time
    - Measurements: pH, conductivity (µS cm^-1), and concentrations for Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4^2-, PO4^3--P, alkalinity, DOC
    - Each parameter with defined units and precision (e.g., time in GMT 24-h clock, specific significant figures)
  - Data formats and transfer procedures are documented in the accompanying ECN Data Transfer documentation; access is available through the ECNCCU data portal.
  - If you need access to documentation, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

- Recording forms
  - A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an example is provided in Appendix II.
