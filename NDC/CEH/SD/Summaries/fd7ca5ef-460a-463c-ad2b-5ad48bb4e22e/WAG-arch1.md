# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for the analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Each laboratory is responsible for its own methods and resources, with documentation of methodology, changes, and validation.
- An Analytical Working Group conducts annual reviews; detection limits serve as targets for laboratories.

## Scope, responsibilities, and oversight
- Laboratories manage resources and must document methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- Annual review by the Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.
- Methods and detection limits are established to ensure consistency across ECN.

## Approved and reference techniques
- Determinands have approved techniques; alternative techniques allowed with notes (superscripts link to Notes).
- Examples of determinations include pH, conductivity, major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg), major anions (NO3, NO3-, SO4, Cl-, PO4), NH4-N, DOC, Total N, Alkalinity, etc.
- Techniques span HMSO-referenced methods, FES/AAS, ICP/OES, ion chromatography, colometric/colorimetric methods, and others.
- Reference techniques are provided to compare and assess alternatives; labs should monitor for bias if the slightly different fraction is quantified by a different method.
- For some measurements, specific fractions are requested (e.g., NO3-, SO4-, PO4- as particular chemical forms).

## Reporting, comparability, and method changes
- Report data for the specified fraction and units; if a different technique is used, monitor bias by comparing with reference methods.
- Analytical ranges will vary by laboratory; when concentrations approach detection limits, reassess suitability or re-analyze with a broader/lower range.
- A uniform guideline on detection limits is required to ensure data comparability.

## Priority listing for limited sample volumes
- When sample volume is constrained, use a predefined priority to determine analytical scope:
  1. pH and conductivity
  2. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) then K+, Na+
  3. Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-)
  4. NH4+-N
  5. DOC
  6. Total N, alkalinity
  - Refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol for handling, filtration, pH, and acidification.

## Methodology documentation and data metadata
- Detailed methods stay at the laboratory; ECN database holds summary data per determinand, site, date, and methodology to indicate precision and approach.
- Example data record includes: substance, sample type, method, calibration, sample volumes, and detection limits.
- When details change, update the ECN data record with a new date stamp.

## Validation, accuracy, and precision
- Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK) is encouraged.
- Accuracy reflects agreement with the wider analytical community; record accuracy checks and corrective actions as needed.
- Precision assessed via QC measures; synthetic QC solutions used to detect batch bias; report QC data with results.

## Quality control and QC data management
- A separate QC system for ECN participants; laboratories should continue independent QC validation and participate in interlaboratory schemes.
- Potential to compute between-site correction factors using common QC solutions; helps detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
- Merlewood hosts annual QC concentrate solutions for cations and anions; QC data should be submitted to the ECN database in a defined format.

## Data transfer, QC data format, and records
- QC data submitted to the ECN Database Manager alongside sample results, with fields for preparation dates, analysis dates, pH, conductivity, determinands, and QC flags.
- Data record format is free-format, comma-separated, including fields for site, determinations, dates, concentrations, and quality codes.
- An example Moor House QC record illustrates the structure and fields (preparation dates, measurement dates, results, and quality code).

## Example record and auditing
- Includes an accuracy example (e.g., SO4 2-) showing measured fraction, method, date, lab, AQUACHECK scheme, and percentage error.
- Records should be traceable with explicit notes on any corrective measures or deviations.

## Author and revision
- A.P. Rowland (with contributors such as C. Woods and M. Lane) authored the protocol; notes indicate ongoing updates and revisions (e.g., August 1998 revision).

## Relationship to other ECN protocols
- Refers to the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol for sample handling specifics.
- Data and methodology details are designed to be compatible with the ECN meta-database and broader QC framework.
