# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water samples and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration control methods: filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and for Al and Fe determinations only, acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, experience, and safety compliance; reference guidance is provided in related documents.

## Initial storage
- If the interval to conductivity and pH measurement is >7 hours, store samples cold (1–4°C).
- If filtering is not completed the same day, return to cold storage.
- If sending to another site, ship on collection day with fastest delivery; use cool boxes with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C, using the HMSO (1978) method.
- Express results to 0.1 µS cm^-1.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; measure conductivity first and do not return the subsample to the main sample).
- Use the HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, follow the prioritised determinands order as per the AG Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature: 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location, minimize time out of cold storage; aim for next-day delivery and avoid Friday despatch.

- WH Protocol; related guidance and background for sample handling and storage.

## Washing bottles
- See Appendix II for bottle and vial washing procedures.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), and a vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first use and between samples; avoid touching filter surfaces; use forceps; each filter single-use.
- Pre-filtering: waters from soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering with a glass fibre filter; wash with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsampling: if >100 ml volume, transfer a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labelling: containers must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler/instrument code to uniquely identify the sample; ensure this reference appears with final data.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Use Decon products (e.g., Decon-90 or equivalent) and rinse: four times with tap water, three times with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and re-cap.
- Dry containers in warm air in a dust-free environment and store for reuse with the same sampler.
- Decon products and procedures are referenced for procurement and use.
