# WC Protocol

## Overview
- Aim: Weekly collection and analysis of river water to monitor major cations/anions and nutrients; changes in chemistry reflect climate, land use, and pollution inputs. Use measurements to calculate ion loads and fluxes for nutrient budgets.
- Data use: Supports data collection, quality assurance, and later data products (e.g., datasets for loads/fluxes, trends, and public or internal reporting).

## Sampling Design and Location
- Location: At least one representative site above the weir; site must be recorded and reused for each sampling occasion.
- Schedule: Weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesday) to align with ECN collections.
- Sample collection: 250 mL from flowing river water, taken from the same location each time; bottle rinsed with river water, filled with upstream water, no air space.
- In situ measurements: Stage height recorded to the nearest 2 mm; conductivity and pH measured on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- Analytes after filtration: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, NO3--N, SO42-, PO4-3-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

## Handling, Labeling, and Documentation
- Equipment washing: Procedures described in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- Sample labeling: Unique coding scheme using ECN Measurement Code (WC), ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04), Location Code (e.g., 01), and Sampling Date; labels must accompany results through all analytical stages and into the ECN database.
- Data transfer: Core dataset specification and formats are documented in the ECN Data Transfer documentation (restricted access; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk to obtain access).  
- Continuous monitoring: Plans to deploy continuous sensors for water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity; sensors are being tested and an ECN specification will be drafted.

## Core Measurements and Recording Conventions
- Core measurement: Surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
- Key identifiers for each record: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/time.
- Recorded variables and format:  
  - pH (GMT, 24-h clock)  
  - Conductivity (µS cm-1)  
  - Concentrations (mg L-1) for major ions and nutrients listed above  
  - Recording precision: 1 minute for sampling time; values with 3 significant figures for measurement fields (as specified in the protocol).
- Data structure: A standard field recording form is provided; an example is in Appendix II of the protocol.

## Outputs and Accessibility
- Data products: Weekly chemistry datasets enabling calculation of loads/fluxes and nutrient budgets; supports broader data use and potential public or internal sharing.
- Documentation: Standard field forms and Appendix II exemplars support consistent data capture and traceability.
- Access: Data transfer and formatting guidance available via the restricted ECNCCU extranet; contact for access as needed.
