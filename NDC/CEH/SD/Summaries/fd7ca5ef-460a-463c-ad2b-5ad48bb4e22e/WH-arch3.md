# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes after collection.
- Deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Provides background and quality control procedures in referenced documents.

## Initial storage method
- Store in cold storage (1–4°C) if more than seven hours pass before measuring conductivity and pH.
- If filtering is not completed the same day, keep samples in cold storage.
- If samples are sent to another site, ship on collection day by fastest method; in transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the method specified (HMSO 1978).
- Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm-1).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; conduct first and do not return subsample to main sample).
- Use the specified method (HMSO 1988) with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC is not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient to measure all determinands, use a defined priority order (chemical analysis documentation provides priorities).

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent elsewhere, minimize the time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Author references
- WH Protocol authorship: J.K. Adamson (HMSO, 1978; 1988 references cited).
- Includes supplier information for protocol materials.

## Washing bottles
- Appendix II provides bottle and vial washing procedures.
- Containers must be cleaned with cleaning agents free of phosphate and hypochlorite; use specific Decon products or equivalent.
- Rinse steps and drying procedures ensure readiness for reuse.
- Re-cap containers immediately after drying.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Handling: rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water; do not touch filters or contact surfaces by hand; use forceps; single-use filters per sample.
- Pre-filtering considerations: SS and WQ samples may need pre-filtering; prefilters require washing with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsample handling: for volumes >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: use a unique reference code including ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; submit with final data to ECN database.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers washed with laboratory cleaning agent prior to first use and approximately every six months or after high contamination (e.g., bird droppings).
- Cleaning agent should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Cleaning products (e.g., Decon, Decon-90) and rinsing steps provided; dry and re-cap after washing.

## Procedure
- Overview of the sequence: sample collection, cold storage, initial measurements (conductivity and pH), filtering, chemical analyses, and data/documentation per sampling event.
- Detailed methods and prioritization for analyses are provided in Appendices I and II and related references.

## Suppliers
- Listed manufacturers and contact points for filters, bottles, and cleaning reagents referenced throughout the protocol.
