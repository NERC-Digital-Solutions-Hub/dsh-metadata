# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor weekly surface water chemistry to identify possible causes and consequences of climate change, land use, and pollution (industrial, urban, agricultural) on rivers and streams.
- Use chemical composition to infer nutrient budgets, biogeochemical processes, and changes in terrestrial/atmospheric inputs.
- Provide data to calculate loads and fluxes of ions and nutrients.

## Rationale
- Major ions establish fundamental chemical baseline; additional ions and nutrients (e.g., NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P) indicate nutrient status.
- Chemical states (e.g., Al3+) of pH-dependent species are relevant for monitoring acidification.
- Frequent, regular measurements enable calculation of ion loads/fluxes and interpretation of environmental drivers.

## Method

### Core measurement
- Surface water chemistry (WC Protocol) is the core measurement.
- Variables to record include: pH (GMT 24-h clock), conductivity (µS cm-1), major cations (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+), anions (Cl-, SO4 2-), alkalinity, nutrients (NH4+-N, NO3--N, PO4 3-P), metals (Al3+, Fe2+), dissolved organic carbon, and related concentrations.

### Location
- Collect from at least one representative site above the weir.
- Record and reuse location information for all sampling occasions.

### Sampling
- Weekly sampling on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) to align with ECN collections.
- Sample type: one 250 ml river water sample from flowing water, taken from a consistent location upstream.
- Procedure: rinse bottle with river water, fill bottle with no air space, record stage height to nearest 2 mm.
- On-site measurements: measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- Post-sampling: filter and analyze for designated ions and nutrients; follow filtering/treatment steps per protocol.
- Stage height and sampling time should be recorded; a time is specified for each site.

### Washing equipment
- Bottle washing and preparation procedures are described in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

### Labelling
- Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code
  - Location Code
  - Sampling Date (and time if applicable)
- Labels must accompany results as they move through analytical stages and into the ECN database.

### Continuous monitoring
- Plan to install and test continuous sensors for water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- An ECN specification will be developed once sensor suitability is established.

### Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data must be formatted to the dataset specifications:
  - Key identifiers: Site Identification Code (e.g., T05), Core Measurement Code (e.g., WC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date/time.
- Core measurement: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
- Recorded variables for each sampling location include sampling date/time, pH (with precision), and a suite of concentration/measurements (units consistent with protocol).
- Data transfer and dataset formats are described in the ECNCCU documentation on the restricted extranet; contact ECNCCU for access.

### Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an example is provided in Appendix II.
