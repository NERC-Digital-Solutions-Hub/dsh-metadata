# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
  - Some tasks require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance; guidance from chemists may be needed.
  - Background quality control procedures are described in referenced documents.

- Initial storage and transport
  - If the interval between collection and measurement is >7 hours, store samples at 1–4°C.
  - If filtering is not completed the same day, return to cold storage.
  - If samples are sent to another site, ship on the collection day; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks for transit.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Use HMSO (1978) method; report to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH, but measure conductivity first and do not return the subsample to the main bottle.
  - Use HMSO (1988) method; report to 0.01 pH units; use separate glass and reference electrodes.

- Filtering
  - Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
  - Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC optional for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is limited, follow prioritization for determinands.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C; ideally analyze within 16 days, but at most within 28 days.
  - If samples are shipped to another location, minimize the time out of cold storage; prefer next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch.

- Author references
  - J.K. Adamson, HMSO (1978, 1988) on conductivity and pH measurement.

- Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedure)
  - Filter funnel assemblies (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (0.45 µm, Whatman WCN), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
  - Rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; use a new filter for each sample.
  - For soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ), pre-filtering with glass fibre may be needed; pre-wash with 250 ml distilled water.
  - If volume >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Container labelling format:
    - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
    - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date
    - Additional sampler code as needed
  - Submit final data with these codes to the ECN database.
  - Suppliers listed for parts and reagents.

- Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
  - Clean with a phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agent; wash schedule every ~6 months or after heavy soiling.
  - Use Decon-Decon or Decon-90 for overnight soaking if no washing machine is available; rinse four times with tap water and three times with deionised/distilled water.
  - After use, rinse containers three times with distilled water, air-dry in a dust-free area, and recap immediately.
  - Decon products available from listed suppliers.

- Procedure and suppliers
  - The protocol includes detailed procedures and supplier contact information for equipment and consumables.
