# WC Protocol

## Overview
- Purpose: Monitor surface water chemistry and quality to infer effects of climate, land use, and pollution on rivers/streams.
- Rationale: Changes in major ions, nutrients, and pH-sensitive species indicate biogeochemical shifts and external inputs.
- Core aim: Measure ions and key parameters regularly to enable calculation of loads and fluxes for nutrient budgets.

## Sampling Design and Data Collection
- Location: Collect from at least one representative site upstream of a weir; site location recorded and used consistently.
- Frequency and timing: Weekly samples, on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) within a specified time window.
- Sample volume and method: 250 ml sample from flowing water, taken from the same location each time; rinse bottle, fill to the top with no air space; record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- In-field measurements: Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- Post-collection processing: After filtering, analyze for a suite of ions and nutrients (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-P), alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
- Washing and handling: Bottle washing and handling follow the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

## Data Recording and Metadata
- Sample identification: Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code
  - Location Code
  - Sampling Date (and time if applicable)
- Labeling and traceability: Information must be marked on the sample bottle and accompany results when transferred to the ECN database.
- Continuous monitoring: Planned ongoing sensing for water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity; sensors are being tested and ECN specifications will be provided once satisfactory.
- Data transfer and formats: Data submitted to ECNCCU follow a defined Data Transfer documentation and dataset formats; access is via the restricted ECN Site Managers’ extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Data Standards, Quality, and Documentation
- Core measurements: Surface water chemistry data comprise a standardized set of variables recorded for each sampling location, including pH, conductivity, and concentrations of major ions and nutrients (as listed above).
- Core identification fields: The combination of Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code (WC), Location Code, and Sampling Date/Time uniquely identifies each record.
- Recording conventions: Data are captured with specified units and precision (e.g., pH, µS cm-1, mg L-1; precise recording times to the minute where applicable).
- Data capture forms: A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an example is provided in Appendix II.
- Documentation: Refer to accompanying Data Transfer documentation for ECN dataset formats and the ECNCCU data submission process.
