# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slowing deterioration via filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, experience, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.

## Data lifecycle and timing (data governance perspective)
- Initial storage
  - Store at 1–4°C if the interval between collection and measurement exceeds seven hours.
  - If filtering isn’t completed on the same day, return to cold storage.
  - If samples are sent to another site, send on the collection day; in transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.
- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).
- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; conductance first).
  - Use separate glass and reference electrodes; report to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).
- Filtering
  - Perform within 60 hours of collection.
  - Record filtering details using unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyse for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻P, alkalinity, and DOC (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient, prioritise determinands (order defined in Appendix I).
- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Storage temperature: 1–4°C.
  - Analysis ideally within 16 days; definitely within 28 days.
  - If samples are sent to another location, minimize the storage period (prefer next-day delivery).

## Data quality, metadata, and standards
- Unique sample identification required for data submission:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler code as needed
- Data should be documented with filtering and storage procedures (Appendix I) and bottle washing procedures (Appendix II).
- Data submission to the ECN database should include the unique reference.

## Documentation of procedures and data provenance
- Appendix I: Filtering
  - Equipment: modern filter assemblies (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 0.45 µm membranes), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
  - Protocol details: hygiene (don’t touch filter surfaces), single-use filters, pre-filtering for soil solution and rivers as needed, pre-washing steps, and transfer of filtered water to a new bottle.
  - If >100 ml sample, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe analysis and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Labeling scheme for samples using ECN identifiers.
  - Supplier information for components.
- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing
  - Cleaning agents must be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
  - Cleaning workflow (machine-assisted or manual soaking), rinsing sequence, and drying/recapping instructions.

## Owners, safety, and training
- Some steps require laboratory training and health and safety compliance (e.g., acid handling, dilution).
- Next-day delivery and minimal in-transit storage recommended to preserve data quality.
