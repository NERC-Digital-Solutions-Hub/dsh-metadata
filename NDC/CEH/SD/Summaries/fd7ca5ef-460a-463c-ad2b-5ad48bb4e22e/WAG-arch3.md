# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Aim
  - Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Laboratories responsible for controlled analyses; require documentation of methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - Analytical Working Group conducts annual review; detection limits set as targets.

- Scope and Roles
  - Each laboratory manages its own analytical resources under controlled conditions.
  - Documentation and traceability of methods, changes, and validation are mandatory.
  - Data management notes: methodologies summarized for the ECN database; one record per determinand per site/date.

- Analytical Techniques (Approved and Reference)
  - Multiple techniques approved per determinand (e.g., pH, conductivity, major ions, nutrients, metals, DOC).
  - Techniques include FES/AAS, IC, ICP/OES, colorimetric methods, and others; some methods do not quantify species directly.
  - Reference techniques provided to benchmark new or innovative methods; maintain comparability and assess bias if alternate fractions are used.

- Priority Determinands and Sample Handling
  - In periods of low rainfall, sample volumes may be limited; a priority ordering guides analysis decisions.
  - Priority:
    - 1: pH, conductivity
    - 2: Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+)
    - 3: Anions (NO3-, SO4^2-, PO4^3-, Cl-)
    - 4: NH4+-N
    - 6: Fe2+, Al3+
    - 5: DOC
    - 7: Total N, alkalinity
  - Follow the Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling, filtration, pH adjustment, and acidification.

- Methodology Documentation and Data Management
  - Detailed methods stay with laboratories; ECN database holds summarized methodology and precision data.
  - Example data record format includes determinand, sample type, concentration range, detection limit, and QC indicators.

- Validation, Accuracy, and Precision
  - Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; participate in interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK).
  - Accuracy: reflects agreement with broader analytical community; requires recording of accuracy checks and corrective procedures when needed.
  - Precision: use of synthetic QC solutions; QC results reported with sample results; monitor for batch bias and trends.
  - Interlaboratory comparisons encouraged; maintain between-site correction factors and monitor for rogue batches.

- Quality Control and Interlaboratory Comparison
  - Dedicated ECN QC system; laboratories to conduct QC, and join external interlaboratory schemes.
  - Possibility to compute between-site correction factors and detect long-term analytical trends.
  - Annual preparation of QC concentrates for cation and anion analyses; QC results submitted with sample data.

- Data Transfer and Reporting Formats
  - QC data submitted to ECN CCU in a machine-readable format, aligned with the sample data structure.
  - QC data record fields cover preparation dates, analysis dates, pH and conductivity measurements, concentrations for all determinands, and quality codes.
  - Example records illustrate standardized reporting and traceability of QC results.

- Governance Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
  - Emphasizes standardized methodologies, metadata, and versioning to ensure data comparability.
  - Highlights need for transparent documentation of changes and validation procedures.
  - Underlines mandatory QC and interlaboratory checks to sustain data quality across sites.
  - Provides a concrete data management framework: meta-database records, uniform detection limits, and structured QC data transfer.
  - Addresses data accessibility and traceability through explicit data formats and reporting requirements.
