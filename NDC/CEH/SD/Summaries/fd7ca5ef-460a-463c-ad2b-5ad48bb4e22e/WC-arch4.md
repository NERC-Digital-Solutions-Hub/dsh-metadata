# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor surface water chemistry to detect potential changes driven by climate, land use, and pollution.
- Use measurements of major ions and nutrients to assess chemical composition, biogeochemical processes, and terrestrial/atmospheric inputs.
- Enable calculation of loads/fluxes for nutrient budgets and track chemical changes over time.

## Rationale
- Changes in water chemistry reflect drivers of change (climate, land use, industrial/urban/agricultural pollution).
- Measuring key ions and nutrients, including pH-dependent species (e.g., Al3+), helps identify acidification effects and overall water quality dynamics.

## Sampling design and location
- Sampling site: at least one representative site above a weir; site location recorded and used consistently.
- Identification: samples labeled with ECN Measurement Code, ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date.

## Sampling procedure
- Frequency: weekly samples on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) to align with other ECN collections.
- Sample size and method: 250 ml river water collected from flowing water, at a consistent upstream location; rinse bottle with river water before sampling; fill bottle to the brim with no air space.
- Documentation: record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- In-situ measurements: measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water using the specified Initial Water Handling (WH) protocol.
- Post-collection processing: after initial filtration, analyze for Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO42-, PO43-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.

## Equipment and lab procedures
- Bottle washing: follow procedures described in the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.
- Continuous monitoring potential: consider installing sensors for temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity; ECN is developing specifications for suitable sensors.

## Labeling and data integrity
- Each sample bottle must bear the unique identifiers (ECN Measurement Code, Site ID, Location Code, Sampling Date).
- Ensures traceability through analytical stages and into the ECN database.

## Continuous monitoring
- Plans to implement continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Instrument tests are ongoing; finalized ECN specifications to be published when sensors are approved.

## Data specification and recording conventions
- Core dataset: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
- Key identifiers required for every dataset entry: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Recorded variables (weekly sampling): pH (with units), conductivity, and concentrations of major ions and nutrients (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3-N, NH4-N, SO4, PO4-P), Al, Fe, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon; time-stamped data in GMT 24-h clock.
- Data formats and transfer: dataset formats and transfer documentation are available via the restricted-access Site Managers' extranet (ECNCCU); contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Recording forms: standard field recording form available from the CCU; examples provided in Appendix II.

## Core measurement and data handling
- Core measurement: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol) with weekly measurements as described.
- Data structure: ensure 4 core identifiers plus time are included to uniquely identify each sample.
- Appendices: Appendix II provides an example of the standard recording form used in the field.
