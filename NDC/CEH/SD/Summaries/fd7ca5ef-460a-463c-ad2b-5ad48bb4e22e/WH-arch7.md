# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Purpose and rationale
  - To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
  - Samples are filtered before chemical analysis to slow deterioration; cold storage and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification are also used.
  - Some activities require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.

- Sampling timeline and measurement windows
  - Initial storage: store at 1–4°C if more than seven hours before measurement; return to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day; send samples on collection day if sent to another site; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks in transit.
  - Conductivity: measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
  - pH: measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; may use the same subsample as conductivity (conductivity measured first; do not return subsample to main sample); report to 0.01 pH unit.
  - Filtering: within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method; record filtering details with unique sample codes; analyze filtered water for specific determinands (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and DOC; DOC optional for precipitation).
  - Storage prior to chemical analysis: keep at 1–4°C; analysis ideally within 16 days, but no later than 28 days; minimize cold-storage breakage if samples are analyzed elsewhere.

- Sample identification, labeling, and metadata
  - If volume >100 mL, retain a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe with acidification (HCl 20 µL).
  - Labels must include: ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06), ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date, and any sampler code; this unique reference must be included in the final ECN database.

- Appendix I – Filtering (equipment and procedures)
  - Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters 0.45 µm (Whatman WCN) or glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar vacuum).
  - Procedures: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; handle filters with forceps; use a new filter per sample; soils solution and river water may require pre-filtering with glass fibre filters (washed with 250 mL distilled water).
  - Sample management: transfer filtered water to a clean bottle; document unique sample codes.
  - Special note: consult the laboratory for appropriate vial volumes and final determinations.

- Appendix II – Bottle and vial washing
  - Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
  - Use Decon products (e.g., Decon-90) or equivalent, with appropriate rinsing sequences (tap water, deionised water) and air-drying; recapped after use and reused with the same sampler when possible.

- Documentation and data quality considerations
  - Filtration and analysis steps are central to data quality; detailed records of times, temperatures, and methods are required.
  - Data packaging includes a clear traceable chain from field collection to ECN database submission.
  - Safety and training requirements may apply to certain procedures.

- GIS and data-product relevance
  - Ensures traceable, time-stamped, and method-described water chemistry data suitable for map-based visualization.
  - Metadata fields align with GIS workflows: site ID, location code, sampling date, measurement code, and determinand results (conductivity, pH, and filtered analytes).
  - Proper labeling and coding enable reliable spatial joins and longitudinal analyses across sites and time.
