# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water samples and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
  - Some protocol activities require laboratory training, experience, and safety compliance.
  - Background and quality control information are provided elsewhere.

- Data collection and timing
  - Initial storage: store samples at 1–4°C if the interval between collection and measurement (>7 hours) is long; return to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day; send samples to another site the same day if possible.
  - Conductivity: measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to 0.1 µS cm-1.
  - pH: measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; use separate glass and reference electrodes; report to 0.01 pH unit.
  - Filtering: perform within 60 hours of collection; record filtering details using unique sample codes; post-filtration analyses target dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).

- Sample processing and determinands
  - After filtration, analyze for specified determinands in a defined priority order if sample volume is limited.
  - DOC is optional for precipitation water.
  - Acidify if needed (for Al and Fe determinations) and aliquot appropriate subsamples (~20 ml) for such analyses.

- Storage and transport before analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C; ideally analyze within 16 days, but no later than 28 days.
  - Minimise time out of cold storage when samples are sent to other locations; use next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch.

- Data management and metadata
  - Use a unique reference system on all containers:
    - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
    - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date
    - Any sampler/instrument code to uniquely identify the sample
  - The unique sample reference must accompany final data submitted to the ECN database.

- Bottle and vial handling, labeling, and cleaning
  - See Appendix II for washing; containers must be cleaned with phosphate- and hypochlorite-free agents; rinse and dry before use; re-capped after use.
  - Appendix I details filtration supplies and single-use policy for filters; pre-filtering may be needed for soil solution and river waters.
  - After washing, containers are prepared for use with the same sampler on subsequent occasions.
  - Use forceps for filters; do not touch filter surfaces that contact water.

- Quality control, safety, and training
  - Some steps require laboratory training and adherence to health and safety guidelines (e.g., handling acids for Al/Fe).
  - Guidance or help from chemists performing analyses may be required.

- Output products and downstream use
  - Generated data enables assessment of water chemistry and supports ECN database integration.
  - Outputs serve as inputs for subsequent chemical analyses and data products, with careful documentation of methods and timing to support data reuse.

- Appendices and equipment overview
  - Appendix I: Filtering
    - Filter funnel assemblies, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters; recommended brands and part numbers.
    - Vacuum pump specifications and contamination-avoidance practices (single-use filters, no hand contact with filter surfaces).
    - Pre-filtering considerations and aliquoting for Al/Fe analyses.
  - Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing
    - Cleaning agents, sequencing of rinses, drying, and re-capping to prevent contamination.
    - Recommended suppliers for Decon products.
