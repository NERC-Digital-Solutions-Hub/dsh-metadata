# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose and scope
  - Document soil thaw depth across multiple sites in subarctic Canada during summer 2013 and 2014 to monitor permafrost conditions.

- Site codes and environments
  - FFU – FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB – FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
  - BLF – BlackFox: black spruce forest
  - TPP – Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
  - MCU – Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB – Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP – White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - BCB – Boundary Creek Birch: birch forest
  - BCS – Boundary Creek Spruce: black spruce forest

- Measurement approach
  - Conducted near collars used for gas flux measurements.
  - Instrument: robust metallic graduated probe; stainless steel rod, 1.5 cm diameter.
  - Procedure: inserted 2–3 times until impeded by frozen soil; depth recorded in centimeters.

- Data management and outputs
  - Data collected and prepared for analysis using standard monitoring practices (verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation).
  - Outputs expected in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).
  - Datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to enable broader access.

- Relevance to environmental monitoring goals
  - Provides standardized, comparable thaw depth measurements to assess environmental health and permafrost dynamics over time.

- Key challenges and opportunities
  - Increase dataset value by integrating thaw depth data with other relevant datasets.
  - Improve accessibility of underlying data for broader use.
