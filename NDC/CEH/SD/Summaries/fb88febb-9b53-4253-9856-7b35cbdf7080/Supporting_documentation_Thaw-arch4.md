# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Measurements of soil thaw depth were conducted in summer 2013 and 2014 across multiple sites in subarctic Canada.

## Sites and codes
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- FFB - FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
- BLF - BlackFox (black spruce forest)
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau (peatland near Teslin)
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt (burnt black spruce forest)
- WTP - White Truck Plateau (peatland near Yellowknife)
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)

## Measurement method
- Measurements taken near collars used for gas flux measurements
- Instrument: robust metallic graduated probe (stainless steel rod, 1.5 cm diameter)
- Procedure: inserted 2–3 times until impeded by frozen soil
- Depth recorded in centimeters (cm)

## Data governance and quality considerations for data leaders
- Data availability and granularity: ensure coverage across sites and years; assess comparability between sites
- Metadata requirements: capture site code, location/context, date, depth, instrument details, and measurement context (gas flux collars)
- Standardization and quality: document and adhere to a consistent measurement protocol; record any deviations or impediments
- Discoverability: maintain clear metadata linking site codes to descriptions and locations; enable data discovery across platforms
- Reusability and collaboration: prepare data for sharing within the wider research community; consider integration with related gas flux datasets and potential data products.
