# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Objective
- Measure soil thaw depth throughout the summer of 2013 and 2014 to characterize permafrost thaw in subarctic Canada.

## Study sites (codes and descriptions)

- MCB — Mosquito Creek Burnt: Burnt black spruce forest
- WTP — White Truck Plateau: Peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB — Boundary Creek Birch: Birch forest
- BCS — Boundary Creek Spruce: Black spruce forest

## Measurement method
- Thaw depth measured near collars used for gas flux measurements.
- Instrument: robust metallic graduated probe.

## Probe details
- Type: stainless steel rod
- Diameter: 1.5 cm
- Insertion: 2 to 3 insertions until impeded by frozen soil
- Depth recording: in centimeters (cm)

## Data collection context
- Measurements aligned with ongoing gas flux studies, conducted during the summers of 2013 and 2014.
