# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Study of soil thaw depth conducted during the summer seasons of 2013 and 2014.
- Measurements taken across multiple sites in subarctic Canada, with specific site codes and descriptions provided.
- Thaw depth data collected near collars used for gas flux measurements, using a robust metallic graduated probe.

## Site codes and descriptions
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: An unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: A black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF - BlackFox: A black spruce forest
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: A peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: An unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: A burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: A peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: A birch forest
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: A black spruce forest

## Measurement instrument and procedure
- Thaw depth measured with a robust metallic graduated probe.
- Probe: graduated stainless steel rod with a diameter of 1.5 cm.
- Insertion: inserted 2 to 3 times to reach the point impeded by frozen soil.
- Depth recording: depth measured and recorded in centimeters (cm).

## Data context and structure
- Data likely organized by site code and year (2013 and 2014), capturing thaw depth values at each location.
- Measurements are tied to the vicinity of collars used for gas flux measurements, suggesting potential for integration with related gas flux data.

## Data quality and considerations
- Measurements depend on encountering the frozen boundary; depth is recorded when the probe is impeded by frozen soil.
- Site diversity includes unburnt, burnt, forest types (birch and spruce), and peatland plateaus, enabling comparisons across vegetation and disturbance regimes.

## Potential uses
- Analyze spatial and temporal variation in soil thaw depth across different site types and disturbance histories.
- Correlate thaw depth with gas flux measurements near collars to explore permafrost-related gas dynamics.
- Support data products such as dashboards or reports that enable cross-site comparisons and trend identification.
