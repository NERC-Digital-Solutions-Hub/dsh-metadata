# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Study on soil thaw depth measured during the summer of 2013 and 2014 in subarctic Canada.
- Measurements were taken near collars used for gas flux measurements, using a robust probing technique.

## Sites and codes
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF - BlackFox: black spruce forest
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: birch forest
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: black spruce forest

## Measurement method
- Thaw depth measured in the vicinity of collars for gas flux measurements.
- Instrument: robust metallic graduated probe consisting of a stainless steel rod.
- Rod diameter: 1.5 cm.
- Depth determined by inserting the rod 2 to 3 times until impeded by frozen soil.
- Depth recorded in centimeters.

## Temporal scope
- Measurements conducted across the summers of 2013 and 2014.

## Data quality, metadata and governance implications for monitoring
- The document lists site codes and measurement approach but provides limited metadata (dates, exact locations, and broader context are not specified here).
- For monitoring framework purposes, essential elements include:
  - Standardized measurement protocol across sites to ensure comparability.
  - Complete metadata (dates, coordinates, measurement depth intervals, surrounding conditions, and data provenance).
  - Clear data sharing and governance to enable reuse in policy evaluation.
  - Documentation of data quality assurance/quality control procedures and any calibration details.

## Relevance for policy evaluation and monitoring
- Provides spatially diverse data on permafrost thaw depth, useful for assessing climate impacts on subsurface processes and informing permafrost vulnerability assessments.
- Could support policy decisions related to land-use planning, infrastructure resilience, and climate adaptation in subarctic regions.
- To maximize utility in governance, data should be openly accessible with robust metadata and standardized formats to overcome common barriers like data silos and access restrictions.
