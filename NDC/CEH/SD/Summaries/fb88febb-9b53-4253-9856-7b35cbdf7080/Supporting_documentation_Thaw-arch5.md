# Soil thaw depth from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Dataset scope and timeframe
- Measurements of soil thaw depth conducted during the summers of 2013 and 2014.

## Site codes and descriptions
- FFU - FireFox Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- FFB - FireFox Burnt: a black spruce forest burnt in 1998
- BLF - BlackFox: a black spruce forest
- TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: a peatland plateau near Teslin
- MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: an unburnt black spruce forest
- MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: a burnt black spruce forest
- WTP - White Truck Plateau: a peatland plateau near Yellowknife
- BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: a birch forest
- BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: a black spruce forest

## Measurement method and data collection
- Measurements were taken in the vicinity of collars used for gas flux measurements.
- Instrument: robust metallic graduated probe (stainless steel rod, 1.5 cm diameter).
- Procedure: rod inserted 2 to 3 times until impeded by frozen soil.
- Depth recorded in centimeters (cm).

## Data attributes and metadata
- Primary measurement: thaw depth in centimeters.
- Associated site code (from the list above).
- Timeframe: summers 2013 and 2014.
- Context: measurements tied to gas flux collar locations.

## Data governance and quality considerations
- Maintain a clear mapping between site codes and their descriptions.
- Document the measurement protocol and units to support consistent reuse.
- Consider data timeliness and coordination with data creators for updates.
- Address interoperability across different systems and formats when integrating with other datasets.
- Be mindful of challenges such as incomplete user needs, data availability, and potential need for bespoke solutions for older or heterogeneous databases.

## Data sharing and discoverability
- Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue data holdings.
- Document work performed on the datasets to support provenance and reuse.
