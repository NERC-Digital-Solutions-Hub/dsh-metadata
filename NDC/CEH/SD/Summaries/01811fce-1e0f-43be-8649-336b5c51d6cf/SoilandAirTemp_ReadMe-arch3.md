# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

## Overview
- The datafile contains soil and air temperature measurements taken at half-hour intervals across studies investigating soil greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine deposited to an unimproved montane grassland.
- Temperature data were collected using HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature/external temperature data loggers installed at the site.

## Measurements and instrumentation
- AirTemp: Air temperature (°C)
- SoilTemp: Soil temperature at 0-5 cm depth (°C)
- Data loggers: HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers

## Temporal resolution
- Measurements are recorded at half-hour intervals.

## Data fields and formats
- Date_time: Date and time of the recorded event; format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm
- AirTemp: Temperature in °C
- SoilTemp: Temperature in °C (0-5 cm)

## Data usage and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Context and scope
- Data derived from studies on soil greenhouse gas emissions related to sheep urine deposition in unimproved montane grassland.
