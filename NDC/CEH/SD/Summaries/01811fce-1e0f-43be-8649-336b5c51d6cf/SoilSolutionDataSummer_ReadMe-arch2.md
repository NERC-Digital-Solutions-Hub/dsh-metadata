## Overview
- Describes soil solution chemistry data from three treatments (control, artificial sheep urine, real sheep urine) applied to a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Location specifics: 556 m above sea level; coordinates 53°22'N, 3°95'W.
- Sheep were excluded from 15/05/2017 to prevent confounding by recent excretal events.
- Data are intended for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time, using standardized collection and analysis methods.

## Experimental Setup
- Samplers: Rhizon® soil solution samplers (2.5 mm diameter, 5 cm porous part, 12 cm tubing) inserted at a 45° angle within urine patches and control treatments inside chambers.
- Treatments:
  - Control: no urine applied.
  - Artificial sheep urine: patches with an N application rate of 920 kg N ha-1 (200 ml urine per 100 cm2 soil surface per patch).
  - Real sheep urine: patches with an N application rate of 930 kg N ha-1 (200 ml urine per 100 cm2 soil surface per patch).
- Application date: 24/07/2017.
- Replication: sampling normally achieved in at least three of the four replicate treatments (minimum n = 3).

## Sampling and Storage
- Soil solutions collected from plots and stored frozen at -20 °C until analysis.
- Samples analyzed against certified reference standards.

## Measurements and Analysis
- Analytes:
  - Nitrate (NO3−)
  - Ammonium (NH4+)
  - Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)
  - Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TN)
- Analytical methods:
  - NO3−: Miranda et al. 2001
  - NH4+: Mulvaney 1996
  - DOC and TN measured on a Multi N/C 2100S analyser (AnalytikJena)
- Quality assurance: analyses conducted against certified reference standards.
