# ReadMe file for SoilSolutionDataSummer.csv

## Purpose and Context
- Represents soil solution chemistry data from three treatments applied to a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Treatments: Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine, Real sheep urine; sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/2017 to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Objective aligned with monitoring of nitrogen dynamics and soil solution chemistry under different urine amendments.

## Experimental Design
- Sampling method: Rhizon® soil solution samplers (2.5 mm diameter, 5 cm porous part, 12 cm tubing) inserted at 45° within urine patches and control chambers.
- Replication: Typically at least three samples per treatment (minimum of n = 3), with successful collection in at least three of the four replicate treatments.
- Sampling timeframe: Treatments applied on 24/07/2017.

## Treatments and Application
- Control: No urine applied.
- Artificial sheep urine: Patches with N application rate of 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm² per patch.
- Real sheep urine: Patches with N application rate of 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm² per patch.

## Sample Collection and Storage
- Soil solutions collected via Rhizon samplers and stored frozen at -20 °C until analysis.
- Samples analyzed to determine inorganic nitrogen species and carbon/nitrogen content.

## Analytical Methods
- Nitrate (NO3−) measured by the method of Miranda et al. (2001).
- Ammonium (NH4+) measured by the method of Mulvaney (1996).
- Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC) and Total Dissolved Nitrogen (TN) measured using a Multi N/C 2100S analyser (AnalytikJena).
- All solutions analysed against certified reference standard solutions.
