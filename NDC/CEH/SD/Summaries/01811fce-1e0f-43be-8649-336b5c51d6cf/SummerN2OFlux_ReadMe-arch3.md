## Overview
- Dataset of N2O fluxes measured from control (no urine), artificial sheep urine patches, and real sheep urine patches applied to a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Treatments (n = 4 total): Control; Artificial urine applied in triplicate patches; Real urine applied in triplicate patches.
- Urine patches: each patch for artificial urine delivered 200 ml over 100 cm2 (N application rate ≈ 920 kg N ha-1); real urine delivered 200 ml over 100 cm2 (N application rate ≈ 930 kg N ha-1).
- Treatment application date: 24/07/17.
- Emissions monitored for 177 days post-treatment using high-frequency automated measurements and subsequently monthly manual flux measurements.

## Experimental design
- Randomised block design across plots.
- Chambers: 0.25 m2 basal area; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
- N2O flux measurements collected across treatments and chambers to assess treatment effects over time.

## Data collection and instruments
- High-frequency data: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT) with a SRI 8610 GC; eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure with four gas samples analyzed per closure; calibration standard analyzed after every fourth sample.
- Manual data: monthly flux measurements from the same chambers using Perkin Elmer 580 GC with Turbo Matrix 110 autosampler; four gas standards spanning measured concentrations for calibration.
- Data scope: processed flux data (not raw gas concentration data) including QA checks.

## Data structure and headers
- Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment.
- Columns B to M: N2O fluxes (µg N2O-N m-2 h-1) for each treatment/chamber/plot.
- Treatment codes: Control = control treatment; ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment; Urine = real urine treatment.

## Quality assurance and data processing
- QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalies as needed (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Data represent quality-assessed flux values (not raw concentration data).

## Data accessibility and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.
- Data are site-specific (Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia NP) and relate to a controlled experimental setup with clearly defined treatments, timing, and QA steps.
