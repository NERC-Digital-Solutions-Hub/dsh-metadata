# ReadMe file for AutumnN2OFlux.csv

- The dataset records N2O fluxes measured under four treatments (Control, artificial sheep urine, and nitrate + glucose) on a humic gleysol in unimproved grazing land within the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W). Sheep were excluded from 15/05/17 to avoid recent excretal confounding effects.
- Treatments and replication: four treatments (Control, ArtUrine, CandN) with n = 4 per treatment in a randomized block design; treatments applied on 25/10/17.
- Experimental site and timing: monitoring lasted 118 days post-treatment; plots located in a randomized block experiment to assess land management and nitrogen inputs on N2O emissions.

- Treatments in detail:
  - Control: no urine or nitrogen inputs.
  - Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine): urine applied as eight discrete patches inside the chamber? (note: description specifies triplicate discrete patches per chamber, each patch with 1120 kg N ha-1 equivalent rate; 200 ml artificial urine per patch over 100 cm2).
  - CandN: nitrate plus glucose applied at 106 kg N ha-1 and 213 kg C ha-1; 1 L of solution spread across a 40 × 40 cm area within the chamber.

- Measurement systems and frequency:
  - High-frequency measurements (autonomous): eight flux measurements per chamber per day, using 1-hour chamber closures with four gas samples per closure; calibration after every fourth sample; automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT) and a SRI 8610 GC.
  - Chamber specifics: basal area 0.25 m2; chamber dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm.
  - Post-high-frequency phase: monthly manual flux measurements from the same chambers using a Perkin Elmer 580 GC with a Turbo Matrix 110 autosampler; four gas standards used for calibration.

- Data content and processing:
  - Data reflect quality-assessed N2O fluxes (not raw gas concentration data).
  - Data headers include: Timestamp (dd/mm/yy hh:mm); Days (time relative to treatment); and N2O flux columns (B–M) labeled by treatment and chamber/plot numbers (Control, ArtUrine, CandN).
  - The dataset integrates both the high-frequency flux data and the later monthly manual measurements.

- Quality assurance and data governance:
  - Quality assurance involved inspecting raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; any anomalies removed as needed (e.g., peak interference).
  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
  - Data transparency emphasis: underlying data are shared with the flux values, not raw concentration data; data provenance is documented via the ReadMe and measurement logs.

- Metadata and utilization:
  - Clear metadata on treatment types, replication, chamber dimensions, and data collection protocols to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
  - Suitable for informing monitoring frameworks focused on greenhouse gas emissions from soils under different nitrogen inputs and for evaluating data quality, transparency, and governance in environmental monitoring datasets.
