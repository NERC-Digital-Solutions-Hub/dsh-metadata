# ReadMe file for SummerSoilWFPS_pH_EC.csv

- The dataset records soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) under different urine treatments.
- Location: unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Soil type: dystric histosol.
- Experimental timeframe: treatments applied on 24/07/17; sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/17 to avoid recent excretal effects.
- Sampling: soils collected from replicated areas adjacent to greenhouse gas sampling chambers using an auger and processed within 24 hours of collection.

## Treatments and experimental design

- Treatments (n = 4 plots per treatment, real urine n = 3):
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine): patches with N application rate of 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
  - Real sheep urine (RealUrine): patches with N application rate of 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
- Application date: 24/07/17.
- Sampling approach: soils sampled from replicated areas adjacent to the greenhouse gas (GHG) sampling chambers in each plot.

## Measurements and calculations

- Measured variables:
  - WFPS: percent soil water-filled pore space.
  - pH: soil pH.
  - EC: soil electrical conductivity (µS cm-1).
- WFPS calculation: ratio of volumetric water content to soil porosity.
- Porosity assumptions: particle densities of 2.65 g cm-3 for mineral fraction and 1.4 g cm-3 for organic fraction (Rowell, 1994).

## Data structure and headers

- Date: date of soil sample collection (dd/mm/yyyy).
- Days: days after treatment application.
- Treatment: category for each plot ('Control', 'ArtUrine', 'RealUrine').
- Plot: plot identifier.
- WFPS: soil water-filled pore space (%).
- pH: soil pH.
- EC: soil electrical conductivity (µS cm-1).
