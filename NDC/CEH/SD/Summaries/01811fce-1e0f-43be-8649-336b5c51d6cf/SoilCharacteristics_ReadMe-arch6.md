# ReadMe file for SoilCharacteristics.csv

- Purpose and scope: Describes soil characteristics from two seasonal field trials (2017–2018) used to monitor greenhouse gas fluxes from sheep urine applied to an unimproved pasture.
- Location: Common grazing land in the Carneddau mountain range, Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, UK (556 m above sea level; coordinates 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Sampling design:
  - Soil samples collected from control plots at 0–10 cm depth.
  - Two seasons: summer and autumn.
  - Sample size: n = 4 per season.
  - Sample dates: 18/07/2017 (summer) and 17/10/2017 (autumn).
- Soil typing: Summer plots identified as Dystric Histosol; Autumn plots as Humic Gleysol.
- Measurements and methods (main analyses):
  - Bulk density (0–5 cm) from intact cores; corrected for stone weight/volume.
  - Gravimetric soil moisture (105 °C, 24 h).
  - Organic matter (loss-on-ignition; 450 °C, 16 h).
  - pH and electrical conductivity (EC) on 1:2.5 soil-to-water suspensions.
  - Total soil carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) and C:N ratio using a TruSpec analyzer.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation rate (Nmin) via incubation with NH4+ measurements before/after anaerobic incubation.
  - N forms and related metrics: NH4+, NO3- (KCl and K2SO4 extractions).
  - Microbial biomass carbon (MicC) and nitrogen (MicN) via CHCl3 fumigation-extraction.
  - Dissolved organic C (DOC) and total dissolved N (TDN) from 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts (pre- and post-fumigation).
  - Phosphate (PO4 3-) and exchangeable cations (Na, K, Ca) via 1.0 M CH3COOH extraction; PO4 determined by Murphy and Riley method; cations by flame photometry.
  - All extractions analyzed against matrix-matched certified reference standards; blanks checked for contamination.
- Data quality and provenance:
  - Visual quality assurance and data flagging/cleaning performed.
  - Methods and references provided to enable reproducibility.
- Data structure and units:
  - Distinct variables for Summer and Autumn (suffixes Summer/Autumn) including:
    - BulkDensity (g cm-3)
    - GravMoist (%) 
    - OrgMatter (% dry weight)
    - pH (dimensionless)
    - EC (µS cm-1)
    - TotC (% dry weight)
    - TotN (% dry weight)
    - CN (ratio)
    - Nmin (mg N kg-1 d-1)
    - DOC (mg C kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - TN (mg N kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - MicC (g C kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - MicN (mg N kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - Nitrate (NO3--N; mg NO3--N kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - Ammonium (NH4+-N; mg NH4+-N kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - Phos (mg P kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - Na (mg Na kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - K (mg K kg-1 soil dry weight)
    - Ca (mg Ca kg-1 soil dry weight)
  - All measurements linked to the two seasonal sampling sets and report units accordingly.
- Usage guidance:
  - Suitable for integrating with greenhouse gas flux data to assess soil characteristics influencing emissions.
  - Can be explored via self-serve tools (e.g., dashboards, pivot tables) to compare Summer vs. Autumn, and to examine relationships among physical, chemical, and biological soil properties.
  - Data can support broader collaboration or policy work requiring soil health indicators and nutrient status in upland pastures.

  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
