# ReadMe file for AutumnCH4Flux.csv

## Overview
- Provides CH4 flux measurements from a grazing land plot under three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and nitrate + glucose (CandN).
- Location: unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Timeline: sheep excluded from 15/05/2017 to reduce confounding, treatments applied on 25/10/2017.
- Data represent quality-assessed CH4 flux values from automated measurements, not raw gas concentrations.
- Data access and reuse require acknowledgment of authors.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Design: randomized block experimental layout.
- Treatments (n = 4): 
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine: urine applied in triplicate discrete patches inside the chamber (N rate of 1120 kg N ha-1 per patch; 200 ml artificial urine per 100 cm2 patch).
  - CandN: nitrate and glucose treatment (106 kg N ha-1; 213 kg C ha-1) applied across a 40 × 40 cm square inside the chamber.
- Treatment application date: 25/10/17.
- Emissions monitored for 45 days following treatment.

## Data collection methods
- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with a SRI 8610 GC (Torrance, USA).
- Measurements: eight CH4 flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; four gas samples per closure; calibration after every fourth sample).
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).
- Data scope: high-frequency data from the automated system; represents quality-assessed flux data (not raw concentration data).

## Quality assurance and processing
- QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalous data as needed (e.g., interference in gas peaks).
- Data processing: data are cleaned and quality assured prior to inclusion in the dataset.

## Data structure and fields
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Days: time relative to treatment (pre- or post-treatment).
- CH4 flux columns: B to M represent CH4 fluxes in µg CH4-C m-2 h-1.
- Column headers encode treatment and chamber/plot identifiers:
  - Control = Control treatment
  - ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment
  - CandN = nitrate and glucose treatment

## Location details
- Site: unimproved grazing land, Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Coordinates and elevation: 53°22'N, 3°95'W; 556 m above sea level.
