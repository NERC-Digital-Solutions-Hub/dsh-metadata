# ReadMe file for SummerCO2Flux.csv

## Overview
- CO2 flux measurements from plots with three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine.
- Field site: unimproved grazing land on a dystric histosol in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Location details: 556 m above sea level; coordinates 53°22'N, 3°95'W.
- Experimental period: urine applications on 24/07/17; emissions monitored for 80 days post-treatment.
- Experimental design: randomized block with four replicates per treatment (n = 4).
- Purpose: analyze CO2 flux responses to urine additions using standardized, high-frequency measurements.

## Treatments and Application Details
- Control: no urine application.
- Artificial urine: applied in triplicate discrete patches inside the chamber; each patch delivers 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml artificial urine over 100 cm2 per patch.
- Real sheep urine: collected from ewes grazing the same vegetation; applied in triplicate discrete patches; each patch delivers 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml real urine over 100 cm2 per patch.
- All patches were applied on 24/07/17.

## Data Collection and Instrumentation
- Monitoring system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with a LI-COR LI-820.
- Measurements: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure with four gas samples analyzed per closure.
- Calibration: calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample entering the GC.
- Chamber specifications: base area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
- Data scope: high-frequency data from the automated system; represents quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentrations).
- Quality assurance: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of anomalous data (e.g., peak interference) as needed.

## Data Structure and Headers
- Timestamp: format dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Days: time relative to treatment (pre- or post-treatment).
- Columns B–M: CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1) for each chamber/plot.
- Headers indicate treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot numbers.

## Location and Environment Details
- Soil type: dystric histosol.
- Site condition: unimproved grazing land.
- Elevation: 556 m a.s.l.
- Area: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
