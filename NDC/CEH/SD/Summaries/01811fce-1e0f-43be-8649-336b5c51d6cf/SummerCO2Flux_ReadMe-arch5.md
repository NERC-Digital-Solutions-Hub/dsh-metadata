# ReadMe file for SummerCO2Flux.csv

- Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced.
- The data represent CO2 fluxes measured from control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine applied to a dystric histosol within unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).

## Experimental setup and scope

- Site and plot: unimproved grazing land in Snowdonia National Park; dystric histosol soil.
- Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine, Real sheep urine. Artificial urine patches were applied in triplicate discrete patches inside each chamber (each patch with 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml per patch over 100 cm2). Real urine patches applied similarly in triplicate (each patch with 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml per patch).
- Timing:
  - Sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/17 to avoid recent excretal effects.
  - Treatments applied on 24/07/17.
  - Emissions monitored for 80 days post-treatment.
- Experimental design: randomized block design.
- Chamber details: basal area 0.25 m2; chambers 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).

## Data collection and content

- Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) using a LI-COR LI-820.
- Measurement frequency: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; 4 gas samples per 1 h closure).
- Calibration: calibration standard analysed after every fourth gas sample.
- Data included: high-frequency flux data derived from the automated system; not raw gas concentration data.
- Data period: data from the high-frequency period analyzed by the automated system.
- Data structure:
  - Chamber flux data with the following headers:
    - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
    - Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment
    - Columns B to M: CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1)
  - Column headers indicate treatment and chamber/plot numbers:
    - Control = Control treatment
    - ArtUrine = artificial urine treatment
    - Urine = real urine treatment

## Data quality assurance and limitations

- QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removing anomalies (e.g., gas peak interferences) as necessary.
- Limitations:
  - Data represent high-frequency flux measurements only; raw gas concentration data are not included.
  - The readme notes the data have undergone quality assessment; processed flux data are provided rather than raw measurements.

## Data governance, usage, and provenance

- Location and provenance: data collected from field plots at the specified Snowdonia site using prescribed chamber methods and patches.
- Usage notes:
  - Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
- Metadata and units:
  - Flux units: mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
  - Timestamp format and day relative to treatment are defined for proper interpretation and discovery.
