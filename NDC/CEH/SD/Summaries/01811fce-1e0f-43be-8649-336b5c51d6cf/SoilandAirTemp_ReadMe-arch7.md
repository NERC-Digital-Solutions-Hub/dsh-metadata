# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

## Overview
- Contains soil and air temperature measurements at half-hour intervals.
- Data collected across studies investigating soil greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine deposited onto unimproved montane grassland.
- Measurements taken at a single site using HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers.

## Data structure and content
- Date_time: Date and time of the recorded event, format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm.
- AirTemp: Air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
- SoilTemp: Soil temperature at 0–5 cm depth in degrees Celsius (°C).

## Measurement details
- Instrument: HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers.
- Sampling interval: Half-hourly measurements.

## Data provenance and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Data quality and usage notes
- The dataset provides temporal resolution at half-hour intervals for analysis of temperature patterns relevant to soil GHG emissions studies.
- Spatial context is at the study site level (unimproved montane grassland); no explicit coordinates are provided in the readme.
