## Overview
- CO2 flux measurements from soil under three treatments: Control (no urine), artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine), and nitrate + glucose (CandN).
- Study conducted on humic gleysol soil within unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Sheep were excluded from 15/05/17 to prevent confounding excretal events.
- Measurements collected for 45 days post-treatment using an automated system.

## Experimental design
- Treatments (n = 4 replicates per treatment):
  - Control: no urine application.
  - ArtUrine: artificial urine applied in three discrete patches per chamber; each patch 200 ml over 100 cm2, total N rate 1120 kg N ha-1.
  - CandN: nitrate and glucose solution applied across a 40 × 40 cm area (1 L total).
- Treatment application date: 25/10/17.
- Experimental layout: randomized block design; four patches per treatment.

## Data collection and processing
- Monitoring system: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with a LI-COR LI-820.
- Sampling regime: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; 4 gas samples per closure; calibration after every fourth sample).
- Chamber specifications: base area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (l × w × h).
- Data scope: high-frequency, quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentrations).
- Units and flux type: CH4 fluxes reported as mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
  
## Data structure and headers
- Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
- Days: time relative to treatment (pre- or post-treatment)
- Columns B–M: CH4 flux measurements for each chamber/plot and treatment
- Column headers encode treatment (Control, ArtUrine, CandN) and chamber/plot identifiers

## Quality assurance and data handling
- QA steps: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of data where issues detected (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Data available represents processed, quality-assured flux values rather than raw gas concentrations.

## Data storage and attribution
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals per standard practice.
- Authorship: authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring analysts
- Provides standardized, high-frequency CO2 flux data across multiple soil treatments, suitable for evaluating greenhouse gas responses to amendments.
- Facilitates cross-study comparisons by using a consistent data structure, QA procedures, and metadata.
- Supports data integration with other environmental datasets to enhance assessment of soil–atmosphere carbon exchanges.
