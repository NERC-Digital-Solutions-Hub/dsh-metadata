# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

## Overview
- Contains soil and air temperature data collected at half-hour intervals.
- Derived from studies investigating soil greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine deposited on unimproved montane grassland.
- Measurements taken with HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers installed at the site.
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Data content
- Variables recorded:
  - Date_time: Date and time of the recorded event (format: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm).
  - AirTemp: Air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
  - SoilTemp: Soil temperature at 0–5 cm depth in degrees Celsius (°C).

## Data structure and instrumentation
- Sampling interval: 30 minutes (half-hourly).
- Instrumentation: HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers.
- Location context: unimproved montane grassland environment.

## Units and formats
- Date_time: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm

## Usage notes for Data Leaders
- Useful for analyzing temperature patterns relevant to soil GHG emissions and cross-study comparisons.
- Assess data suitability and gaps across studies; verify compatibility with other datasets.
- Ensure proper attribution to authors when reusing the data.

## Data quality and limitations
- Time zone and any calibration details are not specified in the readme.
- Data are aggregated across multiple studies, which may introduce variability in context or measurement conditions.
