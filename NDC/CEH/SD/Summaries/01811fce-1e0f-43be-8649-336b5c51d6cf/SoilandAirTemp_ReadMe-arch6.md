# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

- The dataset contains soil and air temperature measurements collected across studies investigating soil greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine deposited to an unimproved montane grassland.
- Measurements are taken at half-hour intervals using HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers installed at the study site (soil at 5 cm depth; air temperature measured at the same location). 

## Data Description
- Records include:
  - Date_time: Date and time of the recorded event (format: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm).
  - AirTemp: Air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
  - SoilTemp: Soil temperature at 0–5 cm depth in degrees Celsius (°C).

## Variables and Units
- Date_time: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm
- AirTemp: °C
- SoilTemp: °C (0–5 cm)

## Instrumentation and Sampling
- Instrument: HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers
- Depth for soil temperature: 5 cm
- Sampling interval: 30 minutes (half-hourly)

## Attribution and Usage
- Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
- The data are intended to support exploration of temperature patterns related to soil GHG studies in montane grassland environments.
