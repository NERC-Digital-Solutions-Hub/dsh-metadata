# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

## Overview
- Contains soil and air temperature data collected at half-hour intervals.
- Collected across studies investigating soil greenhouse gas emissions from sheep urine deposited on an unimproved montane grassland.
- Measurements taken with HOBO® U23-004 ProV2 temperature data loggers installed at the site.

## Data content and structure
- Variables:
  - AirTemp: Air temperature (°C)
  - SoilTemp: Soil temperature at 0–5 cm depth (°C)
- Timestamp:
  - Date_time: Date and time of recording in dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm
- Sampling interval: 30 minutes

## Data collection specifics
- Instrumentation: HOBO® U23-004 ProV2 data loggers
- Location: Montane grassland site (unimproved)

## Usage, attribution, and metadata
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Notes and context
- Data pertain to environmental monitoring related to soil GHG emissions from sheep urine.
- Format and units standardized to facilitate integration with broader environmental health analyses.

## Opportunities and considerations for analysts
- Value enhancement: combining these datasets with other relevant environmental data beyond the original studies.
- Data accessibility: ensuring the underlying data used to produce outputs are accessible to others.
