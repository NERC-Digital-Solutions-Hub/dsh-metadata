## Data context and study site
- N2O flux measurements from soil under four treatments in an unimproved grazing area in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Plot conditions: humic gleysol; sheep excluded from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding recent excretal events.
- Treatments (n = 4): 
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine: patches within the chamber with 1120 kg N ha-1 equivalent; 200 ml artificial urine per patch over 100 cm2 soil surface.
  - C and N: nitrate and glucose treatment at 106 kg N ha-1 and 213 kg C ha-1; 1 L solution applied across a 40 × 40 cm square inside the chamber.
- Treatment application date: 25/10/17.

## Experimental design
- Randomised block design with four treatments (n = 4 per treatment).

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Monitoring period: emissions tracked for 118 days post-treatment.
- High-frequency data collected with an automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) using an SRI 8610 GC.
  - Eight N2O flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; 4 gas samples per closure; calibration after every fourth sample).
- Post high-frequency phase: monthly manual flux measurements from the same chambers.
  - Manual sampling analyzed on a Perkin Elmer 580 Gas Chromatograph with Turbo Matrix 110 autosampler; calibrated with four gas standards.
- Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (l × w × h).

## Data content and structure
- Data represent quality-assessed flux data, not raw gas concentration data.
- Flux units: µg N2O-N m-2 h-1.
- Data include both high-frequency automated period and subsequent monthly manual measurements.
- Data headers:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment
  - Columns B to M: N2O fluxes for each treatment and chamber/plot (names include Control, ArtUrine, CandN).

## Data processing and quality assurance
- QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removals performed if necessary (e.g., interference in gas peaks).
- Data are described as quality-assessed flux data rather than raw concentrations.

## Data provenance and attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Temporal coverage and key dates
- Treatment applied on 25/10/17.
- 118-day measurement window following treatment.
