# ReadMe file for SummerSoilWFPS_pH_EC.csv

- The dataset records soil % water-filled pore space (WFPS), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) from three treatments: control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine.
- Location: a dystric histosol within an unimproved grazing area in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Experimental context: sheep excluded from 15/05/17 to avoid recent excretal events confounding measurements; plots sampled near greenhouse gas sampling chambers.
- Treatments and replication: Control (n=4), Artificial urine (n=4), Real urine (n=3). Artificial urine patches applied at 920 kg N ha-1 per patch; real sheep urine patches at 930 kg N ha-1 per patch; each patch corresponds to 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 soil surface. Treatments applied on 24/07/17.
- Sampling and processing: soils sampled from replicated areas adjacent to the sampling chambers using an auger and processed within 24 h of collection.

## Site, soil type, and treatment details

- Soil type: dystric histosol.
- Area: unimproved grazing land.
- Environment: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Sampling context: soil samples collected from plots near GHG chambers.

## Experimental design and sampling

- Treatments applied on: 24/07/17.
- Replication: Control and ArtUrine have 4 replicates each; RealUrine has 3 replicates.
- Sampling approach: replicated areas adjacent to greenhouse gas sampling chambers; samples processed within 24 h.

## Data variables and units

- Date: date of soil sample collection (dd/mm/yyyy).
- Days: days after treatment application.
- Treatment: one of Control, ArtUrine (Artificial urine), RealUrine (Real sheep urine).
- Plot: plot identifier.
- WFPS: soil water-filled pore space (%).
- pH: soil pH (measured in 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspension).
- EC: soil electrical conductivity (µS cm-1).

## Measurements, calculations, and methods

- WFPS calculation: WFPS = volumetric water content / soil porosity.
- Porosity assumption: based on Rowell (1994) using particle densities 2.65 g cm-3 for mineral fraction and 1.4 g cm-3 for organic fraction.
- pH and EC determination: measured in 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions with standard electrodes.

## Data provenance and references

- Reference for methods: Rowell, D.L., 1994. Soil Science: Methods and Applications. Longman.
- Data attribution: authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Usage notes and considerations

- The data are at plot level with specific replication and site characteristics; local-scale interpretation is appropriate.
- RealUrine treatment has one fewer replicate than the other treatments, which may affect statistical comparisons.
- Data capture aligns with standard soil physicochemical measurements and can be used to explore relations between urine treatments and soil moisture (WFPS), acidity (pH), and salinity (EC).
