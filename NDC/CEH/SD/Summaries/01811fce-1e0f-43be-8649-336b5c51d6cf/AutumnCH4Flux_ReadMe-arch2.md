# ReadMe file for AutumnCH4Flux.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides CH4 flux measurements under three treatments (Control, artificial sheep urine, nitrate + glucose) on an unimproved grazing area.
  - Intended for monitoring environmental health and policy performance via standardized, quality-assured data.

- Study site and context
  - Humic gleysol soil in an unimproved grazing area, Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
  - Elevation: 556 m above sea level; coordinates: 53°22'N, 3°95'W.
  - Sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/17 to avoid recent excretal effects confounding results.

- Experimental design
  - Treatments (n = 4 replicates per treatment): 
    - Control: no urine application.
    - Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine): applied in triplicate patches inside the chamber; each patch delivers 1120 kg N ha-1 as 200 ml artificial urine over 100 cm2.
    - Nitrate and glucose (CandN): 106 kg N ha-1 and 213 kg C ha-1; 1 L applied across a 40 × 40 cm square inside the chamber.
  - Randomised block design with multiple chambers; treatments observed for 45 days post-application.
  - Chamber details: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm × 50 cm × 15 cm (L × W × H).

- Data collection and instrumentation
  - High-frequency CH4 flux measurements using an automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with a SRI 8610 GC.
  - Measurement cadence: eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure periods; four gas samples analysed per closure; calibration after every fourth sample.

- Data content and structure
  - Data represent quality-assessed CH4 flux data (not raw gas concentrations).
  - Data headers:
    - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
    - Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment
    - Columns B–M: CH4 fluxes (µg CH4-C m-2 h-1)
  - Column headers indicate treatment and chamber/plot identifiers; treatments coded as Control, ArtUrine, CandN.

- Quality assurance and limitations
  - QA procedures included inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; anomalous data removed as needed (e.g., interference in gas peaks).
  - Data reflect emissions during the high-frequency measurement period post-treatment; are not raw concentration data.

- Usage notes and authorship
  - Data are suitable for environmental monitoring analyses and cross-dataset integration to assess environmental health and policy performance.
  - Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
  - Emphasizes standardised data handling: verification, quality assurance, data cleaning, and storage in appropriate data portals.
