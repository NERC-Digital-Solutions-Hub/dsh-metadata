# ReadMe file for SummerCO2Flux.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Provides CO2 flux measurements from plots with different urine treatments (control, artificial sheep urine, real sheep urine) applied to a dystric histosol on unimproved grazing land.
- Study location: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Treatments applied on 24/07/17; emissions monitored for 80 days post-treatment.
- Data intended for reuse with appropriate authorship acknowledgment.

## Study site and conditions
- Site: Unimproved grazing land in Snowdonia National Park; soil type dystric histosol.
- Elevation: 556 m above sea level.
- Coordinates: 53°22'N, 3°95'W (as recorded).
- Sheep exclusion: From 15/05/17 to prevent recent excretal events confounding data.
- Experimental design: Randomised block layout.

## Experimental design
- Treatments (n = 4): 
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial urine: patches receiving artificial urine.
  - Real sheep urine: patches receiving real urine.
- Patch details: Triplicate discrete patches per treatment within each plot/chamber.
- Application rates per patch: ~920 kg N ha-1 for artificial urine; ~930 kg N ha-1 for real urine; 200 ml urine solution over 100 cm2 soil surface per patch.
- Timing: Treatments applied 24/07/17.
- Monitoring duration: 80 days post-treatment.

## Data collection and instruments
- Monitoring system: Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with LI-COR LI-820.
- Measurement frequency: Eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure period; 4 gas samples analyzed per 1 h period).
- Calibration: Standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
- Chamber specifications: 0.25 m2 basal area; chambers sized 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (l x w x h).
- Data scope: High-frequency data from the automated system; does not include raw gas concentration data.
  
## Data structure and metadata
- Timestamp format: dd/mm/yy hh:mm.
- Days: Time in days relative to treatment (pre- or post-treatment).
- Flux data: Columns B to M represent CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
- Column headers: Indicate treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot identifiers.

## Quality assurance and data processing
- QA procedures: Inspect raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; remove anomalies when identified (e.g., gas peak interference).
- Data included reflects quality-assessed flux values, not raw gas concentrations.

## Access, attribution, and use
- Attribution: Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data governance: Underlying dataset is prepared with quality checks; sharing of data is contingent on appropriate acknowledgment and data handling standards.
