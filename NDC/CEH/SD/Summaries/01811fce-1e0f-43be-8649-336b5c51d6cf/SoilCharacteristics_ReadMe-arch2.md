# ReadMe file for SoilCharacteristics.csv

- Purpose: Describes soil characteristics from two seasonal field trials (2017-2018) used to monitor greenhouse gas fluxes from sheep urine applied to unimproved pasture.
- Location: Common grazing land on the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Authors: Acknowledgement requested if data are reused or reproduced.

## Study design and sampling
- Sampling frames: Control plots from each seasonal study.
- Depth and replication: 0-10 cm soil; n = 4 per season.
- Sampling dates: 18/07/17 (summer) and 17/10/17 (autumn).
- Soil types (seasonal): Summer plots identified as Dystric Histosol; Autumn plots as Humic Gleysol.

## Measured parameters and methods
- Bulk density: 0-5 cm, using 100 cm3 rings; corrected for stones; oven-dried at 105 °C; expressed on a dry soil weight basis.
- Gravimetric soil moisture: oven-dried at 105 °C for 24 h; expressed as % of dry soil weight.
- Organic matter: loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964) at 450 °C for 16 h.
- pH and electrical conductivity (EC): 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions; measured with standard electrodes after calibration.
- Total carbon (TotC) and total nitrogen (TotN) and C:N: measured on dried, ground soils with a TruSpec analyzer against reference standards.
- N mineralisation rate (Nmin): on upland soil using the Waring & Bremner (1964) method; NH4+ measured before and after 7-day anaerobic incubation at 40 °C; using 1.0 M KCl extracts.
- Inorganic N and P: NH4+ and NO3- via 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts; NO3- via Miranda et al. (2001) method.
- Microbial biomass and dissolved organic C/N: CHCl3 fumigation-extraction; 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts measured (pre/post fumigation) using a Multi N/C 2100S; KEC and KEN correction factors (0.35 and 0.5).
- Phosphorus and cations: 1.0 M CH3COOH extraction for PO4- and exchangeable Na, K, Ca; PO4- by Murphy & Riley (1962); cations by flame photometry (Sherwood 410).
- Quality control: all solutions analysed against matrix-matched certified standards; procedural blanks checked for contamination; data visually QA’d.

## Data provenance and quality assurance
- Data were visually checked for quality assurance.
- Measurements employed established, peer-reviewed methods with referenced sources.
- Use of certified reference standards and blanks to check for contamination.

## Context and potential uses for environmental monitoring
- The dataset provides standardized soil chemical and biological properties related to pasture soils in a highland UK site.
- Can be integrated with greenhouse gas flux data from the same trials to evaluate environmental health and policy-related outcomes over time.
- Aligns with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment aim of documenting environmental condition through verifiable, comparable data.
- Encourages linking this soil data with other environmental datasets to enhance value beyond single-use analyses and to facilitate broader data access.
