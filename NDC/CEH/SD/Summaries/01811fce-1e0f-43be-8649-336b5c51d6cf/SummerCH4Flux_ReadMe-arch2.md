# ReadMe file for SummerCH4Flux.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents methane (CH4) flux measurements from a study assessing the effect of urine inputs on soil CH4 emissions.
  - Treatments include a control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine applied to a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land.
  - Excludes recent excretal events by sheep from 15/05/17; monitoring covers 80 days after treatment.

- Location and site details
  - Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK
  - Elevation: 556 m above sea level
  - Coordinates: 53°22'N, 3°95'W

- Experimental design
  - Randomised block experimental design
  - Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine, and Real sheep urine
  - Artificial urine: applied in triplicate discrete patches inside chambers; 920 kg N ha-1 per patch; 200 ml urine per patch over 100 cm2
  - Real urine: collected from ewes grazing the site; applied in triplicate patches; 930 kg N ha-1 per patch; 200 ml urine per patch over 100 cm2
  - Treatment application date: 24/07/17
  - Patches applied within chambers; replication described as triplicate patches per treatment

- Data collection and instrumentation
  - High-frequency CH4 flux monitoring over 80 days post-treatment
  - Instrumentation: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queensland University of Technology) with SRI 8610 GC (Torrance, USA)
  - Measurements: eight flux measurements per chamber per day
  - Chamber specifics: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm
  - Sampling: 1 hour chamber closure per measurement; 4 gas samples analysed per hour
  - Calibration: standard analysed after every fourth gas sample

- Data content and structure
  - Data included represent quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentrations)
  - High-frequency data only
  - Data headers:
    - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
    - Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment
    - Columns B to M: CH4 fluxes in µg CH4-C m-2 h-1
  - Treatment and chamber/plot identifiers included in headers (Control, ArtUrine, Urine)

- Quality assurance and data processing
  - QA procedures: inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of data as needed (e.g., gas peak interference)
  - Emphasizes data standardization and quality assurance to support environmental monitoring and evaluation

- reuse and attribution
  - Authors must be acknowledged if data are re-used or reproduced

- Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Provides standardized, high-frequency CH4 flux data to evaluate environmental health and policy-relevant performance related to grazing management and urine deposition
  - Demonstrates typical monitoring workflow: data understanding, verification, quality assurance, transformation, and clear presentation in outputs (e.g., tables, charts)
  - Highlights challenges around data value and accessibility by emphasizing reuse-ready data and transparent QA processes
