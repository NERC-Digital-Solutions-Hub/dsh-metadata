# ReadMe file for SummerSoilWFPS_pH_EC.csv

## Overview
- Data describe soil water-filled pore space (WFPS), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) under three treatments: control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and real sheep urine.
- Location: a dystric histosol within unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Conditions: sampling occurred after treatment applications; sheep were excluded from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Sampling and processing: soils sampled from replicated areas near greenhouse gas sampling chambers using an auger and processed within 24 hours of collection.

## Experimental design
- Treatments and replication:
  - Control: n = 4 plots
  - Artificial sheep urine: n = 4 plots
  - Real sheep urine: n = 3 plots
- Application details:
  - Artificial urine: patches with 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
  - Real urine: patches with 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
- Timing:
  - Treatments applied on 24/07/17.
- Sampling context:
  - Soils sampled from replicated areas adjacent to greenhouse gas sampling chambers in each plot.

## Measurements and methods
- WFPS: calculated as the ratio of volumetric water content to soil porosity.
- Porosity calculation: based on particle densities of 2.65 g cm-3 for mineral fraction and 1.4 g cm-3 for organic fraction (Rowell, 1994).
- pH and EC: measured in 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions using standard electrodes.

## Data structure and headers
