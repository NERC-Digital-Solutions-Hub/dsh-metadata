## Overview
- Data describe soil solution chemistry from a field experiment in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Treatments: Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine patches, Real sheep urine patches.
- Location: Dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land; sampling season and conditions specified.
- Experiment design includes discrete patches with nitrogen application rates around 920–930 kg N ha-1.
- Sampling aimed to compare urine effects on soil solution across treatments; minimum of three replicates per dataset.

## Experimental design
- Treatments:
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine: patches with N application rate of 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml urine-equivalent over 100 cm2 per patch.
  - Real sheep urine: patches with N application rate of 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml urine-equivalent over 100 cm2 per patch.
- Application date: 24/07/17.
- Replication: normally at least three replicates (n ≥ 3) across treatments.

## Sample collection and storage
- Sampling method: Rhizon® soil solution samplers (2.5 mm diameter, 5 cm porous section, 12 cm tubing) inserted at a 45° angle, inside chambers, within urine patches and controls.
- Successful sampling: minimum of three out of four replicate treatments achieved per subset.
- Storage: collected soil solutions stored frozen at -20 °C until analysis.

## Analytical methods
- Analytes measured:
  - Nitrate (NO3–) by method of Miranda et al. (2001).
  - Ammonium (NH4+) by method of Mulvaney (1996).
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TN) using a Multi N/C 2100S analyser.
- Quality control: all solutions analysed against certified reference standard solutions.

## Data structure and headers
- Date: date of soil sample collection (dd/mm/yyyy).
- Days: days after treatment application.
- Treatment: coding—Control, ArtUrine (Artificial urine), RealUrine (Real urine).
- Chamber: plot and chamber number from which samples were taken.
- Nitrate: mg NO3–-N L-1.
- Ammonium: mg NH4+-N L-1.
- DOC: mg C L-1.
- TN: mg N L-1.

## Data governance and reuse
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Data provenance includes experimental location, treatment details, sampling procedure, storage, and analytical methods, enabling reproducibility and proper contextual interpretation.
