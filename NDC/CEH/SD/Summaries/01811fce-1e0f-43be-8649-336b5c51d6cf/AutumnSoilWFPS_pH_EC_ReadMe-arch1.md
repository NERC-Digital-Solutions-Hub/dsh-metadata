# ReadMe file for AutumnSoilWFPS_pH_EC.csv

## Overview
- Dataset provides soil % water-filled pore space (WFPS), pH, and electrical conductivity (EC) from different treatments applied to a humic gleysol in Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Treatments include control (no urine), artificial sheep urine, and nitrate + glucose.
- Samples collected from unimproved grazing land near greenhouse gas sampling chambers; sheep excluded during a specified period to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Data are organized with sampling dates, days after treatment, treatment type, plot, and measured soil properties.

## Experimental site and context
- Location: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Elevation: 556 m above sea level.
- Coordinates: 53°22'N, 3°95'W (as provided).
- Soil type: Humic gleysol.
- Plot treatment logistics: Replicated areas adjacent to greenhouse gas sampling chambers in each experimental plot; soils processed within 24 hours of collection.
- Sheep were excluded from 15/05/17 to prevent recent excretal events confounding the data.

## Treatments and application details
- Control: No urine application.
- Artificial sheep urine (ArtUrine): Applied in triplicate discrete patches within each plot; each patch delivers 1120 kg N ha-1; 200 mL of artificial urine applied over 100 cm2 soil surface per patch.
- Nitrate and glucose (CandN): 106 kg N ha-1 and 213 kg C ha-1 applied; 1 liter of nitrate + glucose solution applied to a 40 × 40 cm square adjacent to the chamber.
- Treatment timing: 25/10/17 (dd/mm/yy).

## Measurements and methods
- WFPS calculation: Ratio of volumetric water content to soil porosity.
- Porosity estimation: Based on particle densities 2.65 g cm-3 for mineral fraction and 1.4 g cm-3 for organic fraction (Rowell, 1994).
- pH and EC measurement: 1:2.5 soil-to-distilled water suspensions using standard electrodes.

## Data structure and headers

- Treatment: Coded as Control, ArtUrine, or CandN.
- Plot: Plot identifier.
- WFPS: Percentage soil water-filled pore space.
