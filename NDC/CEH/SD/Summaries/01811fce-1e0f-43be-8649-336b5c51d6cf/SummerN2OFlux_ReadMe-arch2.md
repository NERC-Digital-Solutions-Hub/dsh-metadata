## Overview
- Dataset of N2O fluxes measured from soil under three treatments: Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine, and Real sheep urine.
- Focused on a dystric histosol in an unimproved grazing area in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Treatments applied in triplicate patches within plots; monitoring spanned 177 days post-treatment.

## Site and Conditions
- Location: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m above sea level; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Vegetation and soil context: unimproved grazing land on a dystric histosol.
- Management: Sheep excluded from plots from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding excretal events.

## Experimental Design
- Design: randomised block experimental design with four blocks (n = 4).
- Treatments (applied in triplicate patches within each block): 
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine: patches receiving 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml artificial urine applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
  - Real sheep urine: patches receiving 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml real sheep urine applied over 100 cm2 per patch.

## Treatment Application
- Treatments applied on 24/07/17.
- For each treatment, patches were discrete within chambers.

## Data Collection and Monitoring
- Monitoring regime: emissions tracked for 177 days after treatment.
- High-frequency data: automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT) producing eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; four gas samples per closure; calibration after every fourth sample).
- Manual data: monthly flux measurements collected after the high-frequency period, using the same chambers.
- Chamber dimensions: 0.25 m2 basal area; chambers 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).

## Analytical Methods
- Automated system: calibrated with standards; data reflect flux measurements rather than raw gas concentrations.
- Manual analysis: Perkin Elmer 580 Gas Chromatograph with Turbo Matrix 110 auto sampler; calibration with four gas standards (BOC gases, Liverpool).

## Data Quality Assurance
- QA steps included inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; data with issues were removed as necessary (e.g., peak interference).

## Data Content and Structure
- Data are quality-assessed N2O flux values (not raw concentrations).
- Data headers include:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Days: days pre- or post-treatment
  - Columns B–M: N2O fluxes in µg N2O-N m-2 h-1
  - Column headers indicate treatment and chamber/plot numbers (e.g., Control, ArtUrine, Urine).

## Usage and Attribution
- Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring
- Demonstrates standardized data collection and QA for long-term environmental gas flux monitoring.
- Provides clearly structured, decision-ready flux datasets suitable for integration with other environmental datasets and policy-relevant analyses.
