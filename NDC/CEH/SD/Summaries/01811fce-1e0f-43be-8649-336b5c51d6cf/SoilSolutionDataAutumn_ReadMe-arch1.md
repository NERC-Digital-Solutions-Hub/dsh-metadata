# ReadMe file for SoilSolutionDataAutumn.csv

- The dataset records soil solution chemistry from plots in a humic gleysol on unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Treatments include control (no urine), artificial sheep urine patches, real urine (as indicated in the data headers), and a nitrate plus glucose treatment; patches were applied on 25/10/17.
- Exclusion of sheep occurred from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding recent excretal inputs.
- Rhizon soil solution samplers (2.5 mm dia, 5 cm porous portion, 12 cm tubing) were inserted at a 45° angle within the plots’ chambers.
- Successful sampling was achieved in at least three of the four replicate treatments (minimum sample size n ≥ 3 per treatment).

## Experimental design and treatments

- Control: no urine application.
- Artificial sheep urine patches: N application of 1120 kg N ha-1 per patch (200 ml artificial urine per 100 cm2 soil surface).
- Nitrate and glucose treatment: 106 kg N ha-1 and 213 kg C ha-1 applied in a 40 cm × 40 cm square inside plots.
- Treatments documented in the data headers include Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), and RealUrine (as per header labeling); a separate Nitrate and glucose treatment is described in the methods.

## Sampling and storage

- Soil solution samples collected and stored frozen at -20 °C until analysis.
- Sampling date and day relative to treatment (days after application) are recorded.

## Data fields and units

- Date: Date of soil sample collection (dd/mm/yyyy).
- Day: Days after treatment application.
- Treatment: Categorical treatment label (Control, ArtUrine, RealUrine, etc.).
- Chamber: Plot and chamber identifier.
- Nitrate: Nitrate concentration in mg NO3--N L-1.
- Ammonium: Ammonium concentration in mg NH4+-N L-1.
- DOC: Dissolved organic carbon in mg C L-1.
- TN: Total dissolved nitrogen in mg N L-1.

## Analytical methods

- NH4+: Mulvaney (1996).
- NO3-: Miranda et al. (2001).
- DOC and total dissolved N (TN): Measured with a Multi N/C 2100S analyser (AnalytikJena).
- All solutions measured against certified reference standards.

## Data provenance and usage notes

- Data authors should be acknowledged if reused or reproduced.
- Measurements are standardized against certified references; ensure consistency with the stated methods when reusing.
- Be aware of potential discrepancies in treatment labeling between the narrative (three main treatments) and the data headers (which may show a RealUrine category).
