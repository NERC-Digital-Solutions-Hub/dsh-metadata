# ReadMe file for SoilCharacteristics.csv

## Overview
- Describes soil characteristics from two seasonal field trials (2017-2018) used to monitor greenhouse gas fluxes from sheep urine applied to an unimproved pasture.
- Location: common grazing land in the Carneddau mountain range, Snowdonia National Park, North Wales, UK (556 m a.s.l.; 53°22'N, 3°95'W).
- Sampling: 0-10 cm depth; n = 4 per season; control plots from each seasonal study.
- Seasons and dates: Summer (18/07/17) and Autumn (17/10/17).
- Soils identified: Dystric Histosol (summer) and Humic Gleysol (autumn).

## Data Collection and Measurements
- Comprehensive suite of soil properties measured on the control plots:
  - Bulk density (0-5 cm) and gravimetric moisture
  - Organic matter content
  - pH and electrical conductivity (EC)
  - Total carbon (TotC) and total nitrogen (TotN); carbon-to-nitrogen ratio (CN)
  - Nitrogen mineralisation rate (Nmin)
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN)
  - Microbial biomass carbon (MicC) and nitrogen (MicN)
  - Extractable nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+)
  - Extractable phosphorus (PO4-)
  - Exchangeable cations (Na, K, Ca)
- Methods are referenced to standard soil analysis protocols with appropriate calibration:
  - NH4+/NO3- analysis, exchange procedures, microbial biomass analyses, and nutrient extractions
- Quality assurance:
  - All solutions analyzed against matrix-matched certified reference standards
  - Procedural blanks checked for contamination
  - Data visually checked for quality assurance
  - Stone mass/volume corrections applied to bulk density
