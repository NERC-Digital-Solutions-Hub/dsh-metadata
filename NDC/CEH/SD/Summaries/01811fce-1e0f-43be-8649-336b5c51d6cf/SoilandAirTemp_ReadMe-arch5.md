# ReadMe file for SoilandAirTemp.csv

## Overview
- Provides soil and air temperature data at half-hour intervals from studies on soil greenhouse gas emissions following sheep urine deposition to an unimproved montane grassland.
- Measurements were taken at 5 cm soil depth and in the ambient air using HOBO U23-004 ProV2 data loggers installed at the site.

## Data content and schema
- Date_time: date and time of each recorded event; format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm.
- AirTemp: ambient air temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
- SoilTemp: soil temperature at 0–5 cm depth in degrees Celsius (°C).
- Sampling interval: every 30 minutes (half-hourly).

## Instrumentation and site context
- Instrumentation: HOBO U23-004 ProV2 temperature/data loggers.
- Depth measurement: soil temperature at 5 cm depth.
- Study context: data collected across studies examining soil GHG emissions related to sheep urine deposition on unimproved montane grassland.
  
## Data quality, provenance, and authorship
- Authors must be acknowledged if the data are reused or reproduced.
- The readme notes basic metadata and provenance tied to multiple studies; ensure authorship and study context are retained in any reuse.

## Data management, sharing, and reuse
- Data format: CSV file (SoilandAirTemp.csv) with accompanying metadata described in the readme.
- Guidance for sharing: authorship acknowledgment is required; consider cataloguing and discovery-friendly metadata when uploading to portals.
- Update considerations: not explicitly specified; plan for potential future additions or updates and maintain metadata consistency.

## Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Verify and capture additional metadata to improve interoperability:
  - Study identifiers, exact site location (GPS), data collection period, and study-specific methods.
  - Calibration or maintenance records for HOBO loggers; data quality flags if available.
  - Time zone information and any data transformation applied.
- Ensure clear attribution in any data sharing and downstream use.
- Align this dataset’s metadata with other related datasets to support discoverability and reuse across portals.
