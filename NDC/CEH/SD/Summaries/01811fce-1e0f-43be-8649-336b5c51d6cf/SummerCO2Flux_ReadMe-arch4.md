# ReadMe file for SummerCO2Flux.csv

- Purpose: Describes CO2 flux measurements from control (no urine) and urine-treated plots on a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land in the Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK.
- Site and conditions: Field site at 556 m a.s.l.; coordinates 53°22'N, 3°95'W; sheep excluded from 15/05/17 to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Authors acknowledgment: Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Treatments (n = 4): Control (no urine), Artificial sheep urine, Real sheep urine. Triplicate patches per treatment within chambers.
- Application details:
  - Artificial urine: N rate 920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
  - Real urine: N rate 930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml applied over 100 cm2 per patch.
- Patch design: Discrete patches inside chambers; each treatment applied in triplicate patches.
- Treatment timing: Applications on 24/07/17.
- Experimental layout: Randomised block design; data collected for 80 days after treatment.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Monitoring system: Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (Queenland University of Technology) with a LI-COR LI-820.
- Measurement cadence: Eight flux measurements per chamber per day; 1-hour chamber closure; four gas samples analyzed per closure period.
- Calibration: Calibration standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample entering the GC.
- Chamber specifications: Base area 0.25 m2; chambers sized 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm (L x W x H).
- Data scope: Includes high-frequency data from the automated system; represents quality-assessed flux data (not raw gas concentration data).

## Data structure and content
- Data included: Flux data across time (Days relative to treatment) for each chamber/plot.
- Data headers:
  - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
  - Days: time in days pre- or post-treatment
  - Columns B–M: CO2 fluxes (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1)
- Treatment coding in headers: Control, ArtUrine (artificial urine), Urine (real urine)
- Units: CO2 flux expressed as mg CO2-C m-2 h-1

## Quality assurance and data provenance
- QA procedures: Inspection of raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; removal of data as needed (e.g., gas peak interferences).
- Data integrity: Only quality-assessed flux data included; not raw gas concentration data.

## Notes for data reuse and governance
- Data accessibility: SummerCO2Flux.csv accompanying ReadMe with full methodological context.
- Reuse acknowledgment: Authors must be acknowledged if data are reused or reproduced.
- Metadata utility: Detailed site, treatment, timing, and measurement metadata support cross-study comparability and data integration across networks.
