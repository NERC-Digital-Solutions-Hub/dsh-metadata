# ReadMe file for SummerCO2Flux.csv

- Purpose: Contains CO2 flux measurements following urine treatments on a dystric histosol in unimproved grazing land in Snowdonia, Wales. Sheep were excluded from 15/05/2017 to avoid confounding excretal events.
- Study site: Carneddau mountains, Snowdonia National Park, Wales, UK; 556 m above sea level; coordinates 53°22'N, 3°95'W.

- Treatments (n = 4)
  - Control: no urine application.
  - Artificial sheep urine: applied in triplicate discrete patches; N application rate ~920 kg N ha-1; 200 ml per patch over 100 cm2.
  - Real sheep urine: collected from ewes grazing the same vegetation; applied in triplicate discrete patches; N application rate ~930 kg N ha-1; 200 ml per patch over 100 cm2.
  - Application date: 24/07/2017.

- Experimental design
  - Randomised block design; 80 days of emissions monitoring post-treatment.
  - Chamber specifications: basal area 0.25 m2; dimensions 50 cm x 50 cm x 15 cm.
  - Chamber setup used for high-frequency flux measurements.

- Data collection method
  - Automated greenhouse gas monitoring system (QUT LI-820).
  - Measurements: eight flux measurements per chamber per day (1 h chamber closure; four gas samples per closure).
  - Calibration: standard analyzed after every fourth gas sample.
  - Data period: high-frequency data from the automated system only (not raw gas concentrations).

- Data content and format
  - Represent quality-assessed CO2 flux data (mg CO2-C m-2 h-1); not raw gas concentration data.
  - Headers include:
    - Timestamp: dd/mm/yy hh:mm
    - Days: days relative to treatment (pre/post)
    - Columns B–M: CO2 fluxes for each treatment and chamber/plot
  - Column headers indicate treatment (Control, ArtUrine, Urine) and chamber/plot numbers.

- Data quality and QA
  - Quality assurance included inspecting raw data files and GC chromatograms for anomalies; problematic data removed (e.g., gas peak interference).

- Use and sharing notes
  - Outputs are suitable for comparing treatment effects and temporal dynamics of CO2 flux.
  - Outputs may be used to build dashboards or data products enabling analysis and self-service exploration.
