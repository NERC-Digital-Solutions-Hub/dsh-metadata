# Study sites

- Study setup
  - Data were collected at three plots, each 50 x 50 m, near Andasibe village in Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
  - Sites are described using three land-use categories: Forest (SMF), Reforested tree fallow (YSF), and Degraded land (DL).

- Site 1: Forest (SMF)
  - Elevation: 950 m a.m.s.l.
  - Coordinates: Latitude 18.9317°S, Longitude 48.4117°E
  - Aspect: NE (80°)
  - Average slope: 18°
  - Diameter at Breast Height (DBH): 9.3 cm (±4)
  - Basal Area: 35.5 m2 ha-1
  - Stem density: 5233 stems ha-1
  - Average canopy height: 19 cm (±8.0)
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI): 3.39 (range 3.11–3.58)
  - Dominant species: Abarahania ditimena, Brachylaena ramiflora, Cryptocaria spp., Ocotea samosa, Eugenia sp., Leptolaena
  - Land use history: Mostly resprouted after illegal logging ceased in 1995; protected forest managed by Mitsinjo Association; trees ~20 years old in Oct 2014; a few remnant trees

- Site 2: Reforested tree fallow (YSF)
  - Elevation: 990 m a.m.s.l.

  - Dominant species: Primarily Psiadia altissima (≈95% of stems); Cassinopsis madagascariensis and Harungana madagascariensis <5% each
  - Land use history: Cut and burned for rice cultivation in 1990; ~10 years of slash-and-burn; no slash-and-burn since 2000; forest restoration program in place; native species attempt outcompeted by Psiadia altissima

- Site 3: Degraded land (DL)
  - Elevation: 970 m a.m.s.l.
  - Coordinates: Latitude 18.9462°S, Longitude 48.4069°E

  - Dominant species: Imperata cylindrica, Helichrysum sp., Lodetia sp.
  - Land use history: Degraded land abandoned in 2000 after ~15 years of slash-and-burn agriculture

- Additional context
  - The table notes provide alternative descriptions corresponding to each site category (Forest, Reforested tree fallow, Degraded land) and summarizes key physical, structural, and historical attributes useful for GIS-based mapping and analysis.
