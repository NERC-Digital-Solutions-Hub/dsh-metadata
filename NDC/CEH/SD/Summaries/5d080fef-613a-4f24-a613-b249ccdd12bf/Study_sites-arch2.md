# Study sites

- Data were collected at three 50 x 50 m plots near Andasibe village, Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), eastern Madagascar, during a one-year study period (October 2014). Plots represent three land-use states: Forest (semi-mature forest), Reforested tree fallow (young secondary forest), and Degraded land (degraded grassland).

- Common parameters measured across plots include elevation, coordinates, aspect, slope, diameter at breast height (DBH), basal area, stem density, average canopy height, and leaf area index (LAI), plus dominant species and land-use history.

Forest (Semi-mature Forest - SMF)
- Elevation: 950 m above mean sea level
- Coordinates: Latitude 18.9317 S, Longitude 48.4117 E
- Aspect: NE (80°)
- Average slope: 18°
- DBH (mean ± SD): 9.3 cm (±4)
- Basal area: 35.5 m2 ha-1
- Stem density: 5233 stems ha-1
- Canopy height (mean ± SD): 19 cm (±8.0)
- Leaf Area Index (LAI): 3.39 (range 3.11–3.58)
- Dominant species: Abarahania ditimena, Brachylaena ramiflora, Cryptocaria spp., Ocotea samosa, Eugenia sp., Leptolaena
- Land-use history: Forest resprouted after selective illegal logging ceased in 1995; not cleared/burned/cultivated in living memory; currently protected by Mitsinjo Association; majority of trees ~20 years old at Oct 2014; a few remnant trees present

Reforested tree fallow (Young secondary forest - YSF)
- Elevation: 990 m
- Coordinates: Latitude 18.9472 S, Longitude 48.3953 E
- Aspect: NW (350°)
- Average slope: 16°
- DBH (mean ± SD): 6.1 cm (±1.3)
- Basal area: 6.3 m2 ha-1
- Stem density: 2133 stems ha-1
- Canopy height (mean ± SD): 5 cm (±0.31)
- LAI: 1.83 (range 1.75–2.14)
- Dominant species: Primarily Psiadia altissima trees (≈95% of stems); few Cassinopsis madagascariensis and Harungana madagascariensis (<5%)
- Land-use history: Cleared and burned for rice cultivation in 1990; ~10 years of slash-and-burn; no slash-and-burn since 2000 when a forest restoration program began; restoration attempts to introduce native species, but Psiadia altissima outcompeted them

Degraded land (Degraded grassland - DL)
- Elevation: 970 m
- Coordinates: Latitude 18.9462 S, Longitude 48.4069 E
- Aspect: NE (80°)
- Average slope: 17°
- DBH (approx.): ~1.2 cm
- Basal area: Not reported
- Stem density: Not reported
- Canopy height: Not reported
- LAI: Not reported
- Dominant species: Imperata cylindrica, Helichrysum sp., Lodetia sp.
- Land-use history: Degraded land abandoned in 2000 after ~15 years of slash-and-burn agriculture

Notes for monitoring and data use
- The dataset provides standardized, plot-level measurements across three distinct land-use states, enabling comparisons of structure, productivity (LAI, canopy height), and composition under different disturbance histories.
- Some metrics are missing for the degraded land plot (basal area, stem density, DBH not fully documented) indicating incomplete data for that site.
- Land-use histories illustrate contrasting recovery trajectories: mature forest with long-term protection vs. active restoration vs. degraded lands in recovery, useful for temporal monitoring and policy evaluation within CAZ.
- All plots are within a consistent 50 x 50 m sampling framework, facilitating integration with broader environmental monitoring datasets and portals for data sharing.
