# Study sites

## Overview
- Three 50 x 50 m plots near Andasibe village, Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
- Land-use types: Forest (semi-mature forest, SMF), Reforested tree fallow (young secondary forest, YSF), Degraded land (degraded grassland, DL).
- Site data include elevation, coordinates, climate-related variables, structure (DBH, basal area, stem density, canopy height), foliage (LAI), dominant species, and land-use history.
- LAI values are presented as averages with range during a one-year study period; other structural metrics are point measurements with means and, where provided, standard deviations.

## Site characteristics by land-use type

- Forest (SMF)
  - Elevation: 950 m above mean sea level
  - Coordinates: 18.9317°S, 48.4117°E
  - Aspect: NE (80°)
  - Average slope: 18°
  - DBH: 9.3 cm (±4)
  - Basal area: 35.5 m2 ha-1
  - Stem density: 5233 stems ha-1
  - Canopy height: 19 cm (±8.0)
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI): 3.39 (range 3.11–3.58)
  - Dominant species: Abarahania ditimena, Brachylaena ramiflora, Cryptocaria spp., Ocotea samosa, Eugenia sp., Leptolaena
  - Land-use history: Forest largely resprouted after illegal logging ceased in 1995; protected by Mitsinjo Association; trees estimated ~20 years old at time of study (Oct 2014)

- Reforested tree fallow (YSF)
  - Elevation: 990 m
  - Coordinates: 18.9472°S, 48.3953°E
  - Aspect: NW (350°)
  - Average slope: 16°
  - DBH: 6.1 cm (±1.3)
  - Basal area: 6.3 m2 ha-1
  - Stem density: 2133 stems ha-1
  - Canopy height: 5 cm (±0.31)
  - LAI: 1.83 (1.75–2.14)
  - Dominant species: Psiadia altissima accounts for ~95% of stems; few Cassinopsis madagascariensis and Harungana madagascariensis (<5%)
  - Land-use history: Cleared and burned for rice cultivation in 1990; ~10 years of slash-and-burn; no slash-and-burn since 2000; restoration program attempted native species introduction but Pisidia altissima outcompeted

- Degraded land (DL)
  - Elevation: 970 m
  - Coordinates: 18.9462°S, 48.4069°E
  - Aspect: NE (80°)
  - Average slope: 17°
  - DBH: ~1.2 cm
  - Basal area: data not available (-)
  - Stem density: data not available (-)
  - Canopy height: data not available (-)
  - LAI: data not available (-)
  - Dominant species: Imperata cylindrica, Helichrysum sp., Lodetia sp.
  - Land-use history: Degraded land abandoned in 2000 after ~15 years of slash-and-burn

## Data quality and gaps
- Comprehensive metrics exist for the Forest and YSF plots, including structure, LAI, and species composition.
- Degraded land lacks several key structural measurements (basal area, stem density, canopy height, LAI), indicating data gaps for monitoring and comparability.
- Some minor spelling inconsistencies (e.g., “cylidrica”) and potential typographical ambiguities in species names.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- The three plots provide a gradient of disturbance and recovery, useful for testing monitoring indicators and baselines:
  - Structural metrics: DBH distribution, basal area, stem density, canopy height
  - Canopy processes: LAI as a proxy for photosynthetic capacity and closure
  - Composition indicators: dominance shifts and species turnover (e.g., Psiadia altissima dominance in YSF)
  - Disturbance history: timing and duration of slash-and-burn, logging cessation, restoration interventions
- Data gaps in the degraded site highlight the need for consistent metadata standards and complete measurements to enable robust comparisons and trend analyses.
- The management context (Forest under NGO stewardship; historical restoration efforts) provides a framework for linking monitoring outputs to policy and program effectiveness.
