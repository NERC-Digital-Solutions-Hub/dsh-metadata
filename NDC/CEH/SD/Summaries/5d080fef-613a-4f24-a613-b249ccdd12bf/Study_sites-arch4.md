## Dominant species

- Forest: Abarahania ditimena, Brachylaena ramiflora, Cryptocaria spp., Ocotea samosa, Eugenia sp., Leptolaena
- Reforested tree fallow: Primarily Psiadia altissima (95% of density); few Cassinopsis madagascariensis and Harungana madagascariensis (<5%)
- Degraded land: Imperata cylindrica, Helichrysum sp., Lodetia sp.

## Land-use history

- Forest: Largely resprouted after illegal logging ceased in 1995; not cleared/burned/cultivated in living memory; protected by local NGO (Mitsinjo Association); trees ~20 years old in Oct 2014; some remnant trees present.
- Reforested tree fallow: Cleared and burned for rice cultivation in 1990; slash-and-burn for ~10 years; no slash-and-burn since 2000 when forest restoration began; restoration attempted native species but outcompeted by Psiadia altissima.
- Degraded land: Abandoned in 2000 after ~15 years of slash-and-burn agriculture.

Note: Some variable values for degraded land are not reported in the provided data.
