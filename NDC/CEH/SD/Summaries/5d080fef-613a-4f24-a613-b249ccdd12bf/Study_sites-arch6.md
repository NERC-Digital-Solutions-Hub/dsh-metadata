# Study sites

## Overview
- Data collected at three plots (each 50 x 50 m) near Andasibe village, within the Corridor Ankeniheny-Zahamena (CAZ) in eastern Madagascar.
- Each plot represents a different land-use type: Forest, Reforested tree fallow, and Degraded land.
- One-year study period referenced for certain metrics (e.g., Leaf Area Index).

## Forest
- Elevation: 950 m above mean sea level.
- Location: Latitude 18.9317 S, Longitude 48.4117 E; Aspect NE (80°); Average slope 18°.
- Structural metrics:
  - Diameter at Breast Height (DBH): 9.3 cm (±4).
  - Basal Area: 35.5 m² ha⁻¹.
  - Stem density: 5,233 stems ha⁻¹.
  - Average canopy height: 19 cm (±8.0).
  - Leaf Area Index (LAI): 3.39 (range 3.11–3.58) m² m⁻².
- Dominant species: Abarahania ditimena, Brachylaena ramiflora, Cryptocaria spp., Ocotea samosa, Eugenia sp., Leptolaena.
- Land use history: Forest resprouted after illegal logging ceased in 1995; not cleared, burned, or cultivated in living memory; protected by Mitsinjo Association; most trees ~20 years old as of Oct 2014.

## Reforested tree fallow
- Elevation: 990 m a.m.s.l.
- Location: Latitude 18.9472 S, Longitude 48.3953 E; Aspect NW (350°); Average slope 16°.
- Structural metrics:
  - DBH: 6.1 cm (±1.3).
  - Basal Area: 6.3 m² ha⁻¹.
  - Stem density: 2,133 stems ha⁻¹.
  - Average canopy height: 5 cm (±0.31).
  - LAI: 1.83 (range 1.75–2.14) m² m⁻².
- Dominant species: Primarily Psiadia altissima trees (95% of stem density); few Cassinopsis madagascariensis and Harungana madagascariensis ( <5% collectively).
- Land use history: Cleared and burned for rice cultivation in 1990; about 10 years of slash-and-burn farming; no slash-and-burn since 2000 when a forest restoration program began; native species introduced but outcompeted by Psiadia altissima.

## Degraded land
- Elevation: 970 m a.m.s.l.
- Location: Latitude 18.9462 S, Longitude 48.4069 E; Aspect NE (80°); Average slope 17°.
- Structural metrics:
  - DBH: ~1.2 cm.
  - Basal Area: not reported (-).
  - Stem density: not reported (-).
  - Average canopy height: not reported (-).
  - LAI: not reported (-).
- Dominant species: Imperata cylindrica, Helichrysum sp., Lodetia sp.
- Land use history: Degraded land abandoned in 2000 after ~15 years of slash-and-burn agriculture.
