# Weekly physical and chemical monitoring data for the River Thames and its tributaries (2009-2017) - Supporting Information

- Scope and coverage
  - Weekly water quality monitoring data at seven sites along the River Thames and sixteen major tributaries.
  - Time period: March 2009 to September 2017.
  - Parameters include: phosphorus (total, dissolved/soluble reactive), dissolved reactive silicon, water temperature, pH, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, major dissolved anions (fluoride, chloride, bromide, sulfate) and cations (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron).
  - Metals data: dissolved and total iron, manganese, zinc, copper (July 2010 – February 2013).
  - Accompanying daily mean river flow data is provided.
  - Missing data are shown as blanks.

- Monitoring and sampling context
  - Samples collected weekly from the main flow on Mondays or Tuesdays.
  - Field measurements (March 2013–present): water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential (Myron Ultrameter).
  - Subsamples filtered in the field through 0.45 μm filters; samples stored in the dark at 4°C upon return to the lab.
  - Most analyses done in laboratory with standard reference QC.

- Analytical procedures (selected highlights)
  - pH measured in the lab with a calibrated pH meter (NIST-traceable buffers 4, 7, 10).
  - Gran alkalinity determined by acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3.
  - Suspended solids: gravimetric method using pre-dried filter papers.
  - Chlorophyll a: filtered samples extracted in acetone/water and measured spectrophotometrically.
  - Phosphorus: TP and TDP digested with acidified potassium persulphate; SRP measured by colorimetry (Murphy & Riley, 1962) with modifications; SRSi measured by molybdate-blue method; ammonium by indophenol-blue method.
  - Organic carbon and total nitrogen: Thermal oxidation (Thermalox) through Dec 2010, then Elementar Vario Cube (June 2011 onward).
  - Major ions: ions measured by ion chromatography.
  - Metals: total and dissolved metal concentrations determined after appropriate acidification; most analyses aligned with Aquacheck QC standards.

- Data structure and units
  - Date/time recorded as day/month/year; sampling time in hour:minute.
  - Concentration data expressed in: micrograms or milligrams per litre as appropriate (e.g., SRP, TP, TDP, dissolved metals, major ions); temperature in °C; pH (no units); alkalinity in micro-equivalents per litre; conductivity in μS/cm; flow in cubic metres per second.
  - Distinction between dissolved (filtered) and total (unfiltered) measurements where applicable.

- Spatial, temporal and data provenance considerations
  - River Thames sites near or at Environment Agency gauging stations; most data co-located with flow data from the National River Flow Archive (NRFA).
  - Notable gaps or adjustments:
    - Jubilee River data not available.
    - Flows at Hannington Wick, Wallingford, and Sonning interpolated based on catchment data.
    - Some gauging data for Cut, Colne at Staines and River Kennet are upstream of the monitoring site.
  - Sampling and data handling aligned with the CEH Thames Initiative monitoring programme.

- Data quality and usage notes for GIS
  - Data are rich for spatial-temporal GIS analyses, enabling map-based visualization of water quality across sites and over time.
  - Expect heterogeneity in resolution and potential gaps due to site-specific issues and interpolations in flow data.
  - QC practices referenced (Aquacheck QC standards) support cross-site data reliability; temporal coverage allows trend analysis and integration with hydroclimatic data (NRFA).
  
- References and methodological sources
  - Key analytical method references for phosphorus, silica, chlorophyll, and related analyses (e.g., Murphy & Riley, Mullin & Riley, Eisenreich et al., Leeks et al., Neal et al., Marker et al.).
