# Weekly physical and chemical monitoring data for the River Thames and its tributaries (2009-2017) - Supporting Information

- The dataset provides weekly water quality data from seven Thames sites and sixteen major tributaries from March 2009 to September 2017, alongside mean daily river flow data.
- Missing data are indicated as blanks.

## Coverage and structure
- Spatial: seven River Thames sites plus sixteen major tributaries.
- Temporal: March 2009 to September 2017.
- Flow data: mean daily flow (cubic metres per second) accompanying the water quality measurements.
- Data context: collected as part of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology's Thames Initiative monitoring programme.

## Parameters measured
- Physical/chemical water quality indicators: water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll a.
- Nutrients and related species:
  - Phosphorus: total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP).
  - Nitrogen: total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), ammonium (NH4), nitrite (NO2), nitrate (NO3).
  - Dissolved silicon (DSi).
- Major dissolved constituents: fluoride (F), chloride (Cl), bromide (Br), sulfate (SO4), ammonium, and a suite of major dissolved cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg) and boron (B).
- Metals: dissolved and total iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu).
- Organic/inorganic carbon: dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
- All measurements include both dissolved and total forms where applicable.

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Sampling: bulk samples collected weekly from the main river flow on Monday or Tuesday.
- Field measurements (2013–present): water temperature, pH, conductivity, and redox potential measured with a Myron Ultrameter.
- Filtration: field filtration through 0.45 μm membranes; samples stored at 4°C in darkness before analysis.
- Laboratory analyses (representative methods):
  - pH with Radiometer PHM210, calibrated to NIST buffers.
  - Alkalinity by acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3 using 0.5N H2SO4.
  - Suspended solids by filtration and drying to determine mass.
  - Chlorophyll a by filtration, acetone extraction, and spectrophotometric measurement.
  - TP/TDP by digestion with acidified potassium persulphate and spectrophotometric detection.
  - SRP by filtration and colorimetric phosphomolybdate method.
  - DSi by molybdate reduction method with spectrophotometric readout.
  - Ammonium by indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
  - DOC/TDN by thermal oxidation (and later an Elementar Vario Cube).
  - Major anions by ion chromatography; major cations by IC-OES after acidification.
- Quality control: all analyses performed alongside reference Aquacheck QC standards.

## Data format and quality notes
- Time format: date/time recorded as day/month/year with sampling time in hour:minute.
- Units specified for each parameter (e.g., μg/L, mg/L, μS/cm, °C, etc.).
- Data quality caveats: data gaps exist due to instrument/method issues; missing data appear as blanks.
- Site-specific notes: river flow data are linked to closest gauging stations; some sites have interpolated flows or upstream gauging data due to availability constraints.

## Site/flow data considerations
- Jubilee River: data not available.
- Thames sites Hannington Wick, Wallingford, and Sonning: flows interpolated based on catchment-area relationships and multiple gauging data along the Thames.
- The Cut, Colne at Staines, and River Kennet sites: gauging data provided upstream of monitoring sites.
