# Weekly physical and chemical monitoring data for the River Thames and its tributaries (2009-2017)

- Overview
  - Weekly water quality data from seven River Thames sites and sixteen major tributaries, collected from March 2009 to September 2017.
  - Measured parameters include phosphorus species (TP, TDP, SRP), dissolved reactive silicon, water temperature, pH, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll a, major dissolved anions (fluoride, chloride, bromide, sulphate) and cations (sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, boron), plus dissolved and total metals (iron, manganese, zinc, copper) for a subset (Aug 2010–Feb 2013).
  - Accompanied by mean daily flow data from the National River Flow Archive.
  - Missing data are represented as blanks.

- Scope and Timeframe
  - Data cover seven Thames sites and sixteen tributaries along with daily river flow data.
  - Some metal data available only for a defined period (August 2010–February 2013).

- Sampling and Analytical Methods
  - Bulk samples collected from the main river flow on Monday or Tuesday each week.
  - Field measurements (water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential) taken with a Myron Ultrameter (Mar 2013–present).
  - Immediate field filtration of subsamples through 0.45 μm membranes; samples stored at 4°C in darkness before analysis.
  - Laboratory analyses include:
    - pH with Radiometer PHM210 (calibrated to NIST buffers 4, 7, 10).
    - Gran alkalinity by acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3 using 0.5N H2SO4.
    - Suspended solids by gravimetric filtration and drying.
    - Chlorophyll a via filtration, acetone extraction, and spectrophotometric quantification.
    - Total and dissolved phosphorus via digestion and colorimetric assays.
    - Soluble reactive phosphorus by filtration and colorimetry (Murphy & Riley method, modified by Neal et al.).
    - Dissolved reactive silicon via molybdate reduction to form silicomolybdenum blues.
    - Ammonium by indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
    - Dissolved organic carbon and total dissolved nitrogen by thermal oxidation (through 2010) and Elementar system thereafter.
    - Major dissolved anions and cations by ion chromatography and ICP-OES after acidification.
  - All analyses (except suspended solids) conducted with reference Aquacheck QC standards.

- Data Quality and Handling
  - Data blanks indicate missing measurements due to instrument failures, lost samples, or inaccessible sites.
  - SRP analyzed within 48 hours to minimize instability effects.
  - Consistent documentation of sample handling and storage conditions.

- Data Format and Units
  - Date/time given as day/month/year; sampling time in hour:minute.
  - Concentration measurements expressed in:
    - Phosphorus: micrograms P per liter (for TP, TDP, SRP)
    - Dissolved silica: milligrams Si per liter
    - Ammonium: milligrams NH4+ per liter
    - Chlorophyll a: micrograms per liter
    - Major ions and metals: mg/L or μg/L as specified
    - Temperature: degrees Celsius
    - pH, conductivity (μS/cm), Gran alkalinity (μEq/L), redox (mV)
    - Suspended solids: mg/L
  - Flow data: mean daily flow in cubic meters per second.

- Site Details and Flow Data
  - Most sites located at or near Environment Agency gauging stations; several exceptions noted:
    - Jubilee River: data not available.
    - Hannington Wick, Wallingford, Sonning: flows interpolated from catchment-area-based estimates.
    - Cut, Colne at Staines, and River Kennet sites: upstream gauging data used.
  - Gauging stations used for each site are documented in the CEH Thames Initiative Sampling Site Locations.

- Usage and Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Provides a standardized, quality-assured dataset suitable for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Enables cross-site and temporal comparisons of nutrient status, metals, and other water quality indicators.
  - Suitable for integration with other datasets to enhance environmental monitoring value, in line with goals of increasing dataset utility and facilitating data access.
