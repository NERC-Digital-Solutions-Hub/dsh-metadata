# Weekly physical and chemical monitoring data for the River Thames and its tributaries (2009-2017) - Supporting Information

## Overview
- Weekly water quality dataset for the River Thames and 16 major tributaries from March 2009 to September 2017.
- Seven monitoring sites along the Thames; parameters include phosphorus and nitrogen species, dissolved reactive silicon, temperature, pH, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll, major dissolved anions and cations.
- Metals (dissolved and total iron, manganese, zinc, copper) measured 2010–2013.
- Daily river flow data accompany the chemical/physical measurements.
- Missing data shown as blanks; part of the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Thames Initiative monitoring programme.

## Monitoring and analytical methods
- Sampling: bulk samples collected from the main river flow on Mondays or Tuesdays each week.
- Field measurements (2013–present): water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential measured in situ with a Myron Ultrameter.
- Sample handling: field filtration through 0.45 μm membranes; samples stored in the dark at 4°C before analysis.
- Laboratory analyses:
  - pH measured with Radiometer Analytical pH meter; calibrated with NIST-traceable buffers.
  - Gran alkalinity determined by acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3 with 0.5N H2SO4.
  - Suspended solids via filtration and gravimetric mass.
  - Chlorophyll determined after filtration and acetone extraction; quantified spectrophotometrically.
  - Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) by digestion and colorimetry; soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) by colorimetry after filtration.
  - Dissolved reactive silicon by molybdate colorimetric method with reduction to blue species.
  - Ammonium by indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
  - DOC and TDN by thermal oxidation (1997–2010) and Elementar Vario Cube (from 2011).
  - Major dissolved cations/anions by ion chromatography; metals by ICP-OES after acid digestion (for total) or filtration (for dissolved).
- Quality control: analyses performed alongside Aquacheck reference standards; calibration and method references noted.

## Data format, scope and units
- Date/time format: day/month/year; sampling time: hour:minute.
- Concentration conventions:
  - TP, TDP (μg P/L); SRP (μg P/L); DRSi (mg Si/L); ammonium (mg NH4+/L); chlorophyll a (μg/L).
  - Major ions (F, Cl, Br, SO4, Na, K, Ca, Mg, B) in mg/L or μg/L as specified.
  - Dissolved/total metals (Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu) in μg/L.
  - Temperature (°C); pH (unitless); Gran alkalinity (μEq/L); conductivity (μS/cm); redox potential (mV).
  - Suspended solids (mg/L); DOC (mg/L); TDN (mg N/L).
- Flow data: mean daily river flow in m³/s.
- Data accompany daily flow data from the National River Flow Archive; most sites near Environment Agency gauging stations; some sites have interpolated or upstream-gauged data.

## Coverage and data structure
- Timeframe: 2009–2017 (weekly measurements).
- Spatial coverage: seven Thames sites + 16 major tributaries.
- Data types: physical, chemical, nutrient, dissolved metals, chlorophyll, and flow data.
- Supporting information and methodological references provided to enable reproducibility and data reuse.

## Data quality, metadata and governance (implications for monitoring frameworks)
- Metadata is embedded in the dataset description; detailed methods and QA standards are cited via references.
- Data transparency: notes on sampling timeframe, handling, and QA practices; use of reference standards.
- Gaps and caveats: some sites missing flow data (e.g., Jubilee River); certain sites use interpolated gauging data; missing data represented as blanks.
- Data interoperability: standardized methodologies (calibration, digestion, colorimetry, IC, ICP-OES) support cross-study comparability.
- Relevance for policy: high-resolution, multi-parameter water quality time series aligned with hydrological data; suitable for trend analysis, assessment of nutrient dynamics, and evaluation of management interventions.
