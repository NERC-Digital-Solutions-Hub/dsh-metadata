# Weekly physical and chemical monitoring data for the River Thames and its tributaries (2009-2017)

- Scope and coverage
  - Weekly water quality monitoring data from seven sites along the River Thames and sixteen major tributaries.
  - Time span: March 2009 to September 2017 (dataset notes span 2009–2017).
  - Data include a comprehensive suite of chemical, physical, and biological/optical parameters.

- Parameters measured
  - Nutrients and carbon: total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), dissolved reactive silicon (Si), ammonium (NH4), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN).
  - Inorganic chemistry: major dissolved cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg) and anions (F, Cl, Br, SO4, NO2, NO3, plus nitrite, nitrate, bromide, etc.); boron; dissolved iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu).
  - Physical/optical: water temperature, pH, field pH, conductivity, redox potential, Gran alkalinity, suspended solids, chlorophyll a.
  - Flow: mean daily river flow (cubic metres per second).

- Sampling and analytical methods
  - Sampling: bulk samples collected from the main flow on Monday or Tuesday each week.
  - Field measurements: water temperature, pH, conductivity, redox potential measured in the field (2013–present) using a Myron Ultrameter.
  - Filtration: subsamples filtered in the field through 0.45 μm Whatman WCN membranes.
  - Sample handling: samples stored in the dark at 4°C on return to the laboratory.
  - Lab analyses and standards:
    - pH: measured in the lab with Radiometer PHM210; calibrated with pH 4, 7, 10 buffers traceable to NIST.
    - Gran alkalinity: acidimetric titration to pH 4 and 3 with 0.5N H2SO4.
    - Suspended solids: gravimetric method on dried pre-weighed filters.
    - Chlorophyll a: extraction in acetone/water, colorimetric measurement (Beckman 750 DU).
    - TP/TDP: digestion with acidified persulphate; spectrophotometric quantification.
    - SRP: filtered sample analyzed by phosphomolybdate-blue method (modified Murphy and Riley); SRP analyzed within 48 h.
    - SRSi: molybdate reaction, reduction to form silicomolybdenum blue; spectrophotometric quantification.
    - Ammonium: indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
    - DOC/TDN: thermal oxidation (2009–2010) and then Elementar Vario Cube (from 2011).
    - Major dissolved ions: ion chromatography for anions; ICPOES (ICP-OES) after acidification for cations.
  - Quality control: all analyses conducted alongside reference Aquacheck QC standards.

- Data format and documentation
  - Date/time: day/month/year; sampling time in hour:minute.
  - Concentration units specified for each parameter (e.g., μg/L, mg/L, μS/cm, °C, mg/L, etc.).
  - Meaning of measurements:
    - TP includes dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered samples.
    - SRP corresponds to filterable reactive phosphorus.
    - Total and dissolved metal concentrations derived from unfiltered and filtered samples, respectively.
  - Flow data: mean daily flow in cubic metres per second.

- Data provenance and availability
  - Data originate from the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology’s Thames Initiative monitoring programme.
  - Mean daily flow data linked to National River Flow Archive (nrfa.ceh.ac.uk).
  - Some site-specific flow data adjustments:
    - Jubilee River data not available.
    - Hannington Wick, Wallingford, Sonning flows interpolated based on catchment-area relationships.
    - Cut, Colne at Staines and River Kennet data supplied upstream of monitoring sites.
  - Related documentation: CEH Thames Initiative Sampling Site Locations document.

- Governance, metadata, and stewardship considerations
  - Completeness: note that missing data are represented as blanks.
  - Dataset scope implies need for consistent metadata about site locations, gauging station proximity, and any interpolations applied to flows.
  - Method evolution: instrument changes and method updates (e.g., TOC/TDN instruments) may affect temporal comparability; document versioning and method alignment for long-term analyses.
  - Use and reuse: dataset supports benchmarking river water quality and trend analyses; ensure proper citation of methods and references.

- Limitations and considerations for use
  - Some sites have gaps or interpolated data for flow, potentially affecting hydrological context.
  - SRP, TP, and other phosphorus measurements rely on specific digestion and colorimetric methods; users should consider method reference dates when comparing across the time span.
  - Storage and handling conditions (4°C, dark) are specified to preserve sample integrity; deviations may impact results if data are reused.
