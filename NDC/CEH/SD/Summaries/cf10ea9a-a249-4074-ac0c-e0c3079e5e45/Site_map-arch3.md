- Relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Provides a concrete set of locations for developing environmental health measures, data collection plans, and indicators (e.g., flow, water quality, ecological status).
  - Serves as a basis to assess data availability, metadata quality, and governance needs across a river-catchment monitoring network.

- Practical steps for applying this list
  - Align each site with specific monitoring measures and data requirements.
  - Verify data accessibility and metadata completeness from data originators.
  - Identify data gaps or underrepresented areas to inform future data collection.
  - Establish data sharing and governance practices to enable transparent reporting and stewardship.
