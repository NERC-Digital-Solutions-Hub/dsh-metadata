## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Provides a standardized reference mapping to support data integration, discoverability, and governance.
- Enables consistent referencing of river monitoring data across datasets and dashboards.

## Data governance and quality considerations
- Document metadata for each site (coordinates, river/sub-catchment, measurement types, units, data owner).
- Ensure consistency and clear provenance for codes and names.
- Track data availability, access policies, and any restrictions or barriers.

## Recommendations for action
- Establish an authoritative data dictionary/master list of site codes with links to data streams.
- Link site codes to relevant real-time or historical datasets and analytics dashboards.
- Promote cross-team ownership of site data products to maintain accuracy and usability.
