# Thames and Tributaries Environmental Monitoring Site Codes

## Aim
- Use data to demonstrate the condition of the environment in a consistent format, enabling scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Focus on organisations with defined monitoring responsibilities, applying topic expertise and standardised analytical approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Work with required data from established sources; perform verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation.
- Analyse data using standardised methods to produce outputs such as categorising environmental health against standards.
- Present findings in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).
- Ensure created datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## What this document lists
- A catalog of monitoring sites with short codes and site names, spanning the River Thames and its tributaries and associated channels or rivers.

- Site catalog (code = site name)
  - Tm = Thame at Wheatley
  - Ra = Ray at Islip
  - Ch = Cherwell at Hampton Poyle
  - Ev = Evenlode at Cassington Mill
  - TS = Thames at Swinford
  - TN = Thames at Newbridge
  - Wi = Windrush at Newbridge
  - Le = Leach at Lechlade (Mill Lane)
  - Cl = Cole at Lynt Bridge
  - Cn = Coln at Whelford
  - Oc = Ock at Abingdon
  - Pa = Pang at Tidmarsh
  - Tso = Thames at Sonning
  - Lo = Lodden at Charvil
  - Cu = The Cut at Paley Street
  - TR = Thames at Runnymede
  - Wy = Wye at Bourne End
  - TW = Thames at Wallingford
  - TH = Thames at Hannington Wick
  - Ke = Kennet at Woolhampton
  - En = Emborne at Brimpton
  - Ju = Jubilee River at Pocock's Bridge
  - Cs = Colne at Staines

## Key challenges
- Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with additional relevant data (avoiding single-use).
- Enabling access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
