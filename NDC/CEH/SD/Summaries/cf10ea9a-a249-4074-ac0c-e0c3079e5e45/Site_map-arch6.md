- Context:
  - The list provides a mapping of short site codes to full site names for a river monitoring network, primarily around the Thames and its tributaries.
  - This mapping supports data discovery, cross-referencing, and the creation of data products (dashboards, reports) by enabling quick translation from codes to human-readable site descriptions.
