# Land Classification of Shetland (1974)

- Purpose and scope
  - A survey of terrestrial habitats and vegetation in the Shetland Isles (1974) to stratify the landscape for sampling and assess the status/value of plant and animal species and communities.
  - Part of a larger project on environmental status, using stratified sampling to inform ecological surveys and monitoring.

- Geographic coverage and period
  - Geography: Shetland Islands, Scotland.
  - Time period: 1974 (datasets and field methods described from the 1970s).

- Sampling design and stratification
  - Stratified random sampling across Shetland to yield 16 environmental strata (grouped into four broad strata with four variations each).
  - Sampling unit: 1 km grid squares; 2046 1 km squares contain land.
  - Stratification based on physical geography using maps and aerial photographs (maps used for landform classification; aerial photos used later to check and refine classifications).
  - Initial data collection focused on physical geography to produce interpretable landform-based strata; addresses the interaction of sea and land, shelter effects, and how these influence vegetation.

- Data formats and structure
  - Data format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coordinate system: OSGB 1936 (British National Grid).
  - Resolution: 1 km grid.
  - Dataset features: OBJECTID (unique row ID), Shape (geometry), STRATA (values 1–16).

- Attributes and metadata
  - Full list of 150 attributes used to produce the stratification (e.g., coastlines, rivers, distances to sea, coast orientation and exposure, landforms like bays, cliffs, lochs, peat areas, rock types, elevation-related measures, and other physical-geographic characteristics).
  - Table 1 (attributes) provides the detailed attribute set used for map-based analysis.

- Methodology and analysis
  - Data collection methods aligned with standardized ecological survey procedures (Bunce & Shaw 1973; Bunce 1974; Milner 1975).
  - Analysis employed indicator species analysis methods (Hill et al., 1975; Hill, 1973) to define and validate the stratification.
  - Aerial photography complemented map-based stratification to support later vegetation mapping and cross-check predictions.

- Outputs and interpretation
  - Output: map showing the distribution of the final 16 strata.
  - Major finding: sea interactions dominate the broad geography, but the relationship between stratification variables and vegetation is complex and not directly predictive in a simple way.
  - Strata descriptions (four groups with 16 total strata):
    - Strata 1–4: Coastal, gentle terrain with few rivers.
    - Strata 5–8: Coastal, steeper, with more headlands and sea cliffs; more rivers entering the sea.
    - Strata 9–12: Inland high-altitude group (600–900 ft), few water bodies, major rock type often gneiss.
    - Strata 13–16: Lower, undulating with peat and many freshwater lochans; hills around 300 ft; Old Red Sandstone common.

- Background and provenance
  - Originator: R.G.H. Bunce, Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Merlewood Research Station.
  - Background context: nearly 1000 vegetation plots (each ~200 m2) collected across Shetland; stratified sampling designed to capture environmental variation and support a broader program to evaluate plant and animal communities. Specialist surveys for bryophytes and lichens complemented general vegetation work.

- Data governance and accessibility notes
  - Data management emphasizes data quality, standardized methods, and sharing of outputs; staff faced typical monitoring challenges such as integrating data from maps and aerial imagery, ensuring metadata completeness, and coordinating across datasets and time.
