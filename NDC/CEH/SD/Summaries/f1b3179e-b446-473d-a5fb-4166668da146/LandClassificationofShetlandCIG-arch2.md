# Land Classification of Shetland (1974)

- Purpose and scope
  - Stratification used as the basis for sampling across Shetland for a 1974 survey employing Bunce & Shaw's standardized ecological survey methods.
  - Aimed to classify landforms and environmental characteristics to support subsequent vegetation, soils, habitat, and biota assessments.
- Geographic and temporal coverage
  - Region: Shetland, Scotland
  - Time period: 1974
- Stratification and strata
  - 16 environmental strata (four groups: coastal with low rivers; coastal with more sea/steeper slopes; high inland; lower undulating with peat and lochans)
  - Groups described as: 
    - Strata 1-4: Coastal, gentle terrain, limited river input
    - Strata 5-8: Coastal, more sea exposure, steeper slopes, more rivers
    - Strata 9-12: High altitude inland, dominated by gneiss
    - Strata 13-16: Lower, undulating, peat-rich with freshwater lochans
  - Stratification built from maps and aerial photographs to yield a landform-based classification; ground survey conducted within fixed 1 km grid squares.
- Sampling design and data collection
  - Sampling unit: fixed 1 km grid square (covering 2046 land-containing squares in Shetland)
  - Data sources: maps and aerial photographs (aerials used to supplement stratification once available)
  - Attributes: about 150 geographical attributes (physical geography) plus 18 geological attributes from the quarter-inch geological map
  - Field methods: standardized procedures for ecological surveys; extensive vegetation surveys (nearly 1000 plots) plus specialist surveys for bryophytes, lichens, and key habitats
  - Analysis: indicator species analysis and related ordination methods to define strata
- Data format, projection, and access
  - Format: ESRI Shapefile
  - Projection: OSGB 1936
  - Resolution: 1 km grid
  - Dataset structure: objects with STRATA values (1–16) and standard GIS geometry fields (OBJECTID, Shape)
- Outputs and interpretation
  - Map showing distribution of the final 16 strata
  - Stratification framework intended to support subsequent vegetation, habitat, and ecological surveys
  - Relationship between geology and geography highlighted; and interactions with coastal exposure and shelter affecting vegetation patterns

- Origin and provenance
  - Originator: R.G.H. Bunce, Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, Merlewood Research Station
  - Part of Shetland project monitoring; implementations detailed in ITE contract reports (Project 315)
- Data management and reuse considerations
  - Data verification, quality assurance, and standardization emphasized; supports integration with other environmental datasets
  - Potential for combining with other environmental data to increase dataset value and enable broader accessibility of underlying data for analysis and policy monitoring
