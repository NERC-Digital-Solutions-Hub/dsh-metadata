# Land Classification of Shetland (1974)

## Overview
- A 1974 ecological survey of Shetland aimed at stratifying land by environmental characteristics to support sampling and analysis of habitats, vegetation, soils, and biota.
- Part of a larger project to assess status and value of Shetland’s species and communities.
- Demonstrates a map- and photograph-based stratification approach linked to standardized survey methods.

## Dataset details
- Geographic coverage: Shetland, Scotland
- Time period: 1974
- Data format: ESRI Shapefile
- Projection: OSGB 1936
- Spatial resolution: 1 km grid squares used as sampling units
- Coverage: 2046 1 km squares containing land
- Attributes: 16 environmental strata (Strata 1–16) derived from map and habitat classification; numerous physical-geography attributes (approximately 150) used for stratification
- Dataset columns: OBJECTID (unique row ID), STRATA (stratum number 1–16), Shape (geometry)

## Stratification and sampling design
- Initial stratification based on maps and aerial photographs to establish landform-based strata; aerials were used when available to enhance habitat classification.
- Stratification informed field sampling within fixed 1 km grid squares.
- Focus on physical geography to yield interpretable landform classifications; human geography features were largely excluded from stratification.

## Methods and analysis
- Data collected: plant species, soils, habitat types, and major biota using standardized procedures (Bunce & Shaw framework).
- Stratification relied on 150+ attributes describing coast, elevation, drainage, coastline features, geologies, and other landform characteristics.
- Geological and geographical variables were analyzed to classify land into 16 strata, using indicator species analysis methods (Hill et al. 1975).

## Strata overview (group descriptions)
- Strata 1–4: Coastal, few rivers, >80% land area, relatively gentle terrain.
- Strata 5–8: Coastal with more sea exposure and steeper slopes; more headlands and sea cliffs; more rivers entering sea.
- Strata 9–12: High inland group with 600–900 ft hills; limited water bodies; major rock type often gneiss.
- Strata 13–16: Lower, undulating with peat and many freshwater lochans; hills around 300 ft; rock types more often Old Red Sandstone.
