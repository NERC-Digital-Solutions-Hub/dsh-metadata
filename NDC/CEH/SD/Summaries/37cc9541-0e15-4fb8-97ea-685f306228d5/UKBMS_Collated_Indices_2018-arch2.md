# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Aim and scope
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; gratitude to volunteers.
  - Provides annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring program plus randomly sampled 1km squares.
  - Sampling framework includes: (1) weekly Pollard butterfly transect walks; (2) reduced-effort surveys of habitat specialist species; (3) the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS).
  - UKBMS has monitored butterfly abundance across the UK since 1976, with over 2500 active sites annually.
  - Outputs from components are analyzed together to inform biodiversity status and policy questions.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), 5 m wide, recording all species weekly from April to September (about 26 counts/year), at ~2000 sites.
  - Reduced-effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts; focus on specific species or alternative methods.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect methodology on stratified random 1km squares; two parallel 1-km transects divided into 10 sections; 2–4 visits/year (spring and July/Aug); ~750 squares/year; targets common habitats like farmland.
  - Foundational references: Pollard & Yates (1993) and related WCBS methodology.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices: relative measures based on counts from transect sections/sites, acknowledging detectability differences among species.
  - Indices relate to other population measures (e.g., mark-release-recapture).
  - Collated indices are produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) and site-weighting by observed flight-period coverage; uses all seasonal counts to model patterns and extrapolate gaps, prioritizing observed data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusual counts, out-of-flight-period records).
  - Regional coordinators validate records; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-distribution records, out-of-period records, first-time site records, or extreme values; edits made as needed.

- Details of this data download
  - Annual collated abundance indices for species with sufficient data, covering 1976–2018 (earlier years may be incomplete).
  - Data provided as CSV with columns:
    - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (scientific name), COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (Log10), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - Indices are log-transformed and scaled so the average index over the series equals 2, enabling relative population comparisons over time.

- Key considerations for analysts
  - Challenges:
    - Increasing the value of datasets by combining UKBMS data with other relevant data sources to avoid single-use applications.
    - Improving accessibility of underlying data to external users.
