# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) provides annual data on butterfly population status across the UK to inform biodiversity policy and decision-making.
  - Managed and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Initiated in 1976; now supports data from over 2,500 active sites each year.

- Sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide, ~26 counts per year from April to September.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for targeted focal species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares with two parallel 1-km transects, 2–4 visits per year (plus spring visits), ~750 squares annually.
  - All components are analyzed together to produce species-level indices.

- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Collated indices constructed via the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed 2016), with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - Counts from all data streams are combined to estimate seasonal patterns and to extrapolate gaps; observed data are given more weight than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and governance
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker; automated checks flag anomalies.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records and monitor data quality throughout the season.
  - Additional automated and manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, unusual flight periods, first-time site records, and abnormal abundances.
  - Edits to the main UKBMS dataset are made in consultation with coordinators or recorders as needed.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2018 (earlier years may be incomplete).
  - Data provided as a CSV with columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - Indices are log-scaled and standardized so the average across the series equals 2 for relative comparison.

- Licence and attribution
  - Data are available under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Must include proper citation with DOI in publications and include the attribution: “Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.”

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation.
  - Potential for co-authorship and intellectual input on publications arising from UKBMS data.
