# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and governance
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteers; long-running program since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Purpose: monitor butterfly population status and trends to inform biodiversity policy questions.
- Data integrated from multiple components (standard transects, reduced effort surveys, WCBS).

## Data collection methods
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m width, 26 counts per year, Apr–Sept; ~2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, Timed counts, egg/larval web counts.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–4 visits per year; ~750 squares.

## Data processing and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices weighted to reflect the proportion of the species flight period surveyed; collated indices produced via Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with year-site weighting.
- All seasonal counts inform the trend estimation; extrapolation accounts for recording gaps while giving more weight to observed data.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker before uploading to a central database.
- Automated checks flag unusual counts or sightings outside known flight periods.
- Regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation; data undergo automated and manual validation (range checks, distribution, first appearances, aberrant values).
- Edits to the main UKBMS dataset are made following queries and coordinator input.

## Data download details
- Contains annual collated indices for species with sufficient data (1976–2018; some early years not calculated due to data gaps).
- Delivered as CSV with columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.

## Licensing and attribution
- Open Government Licence (OGL); allows free use with few conditions.
- Must include the dataset citation with DOI in any publications/reports.
- Attribution statement required:Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.

## Collaboration and contact details
- UKBMS Partners offer advisory support and interpretation of outputs.
- Potential for co-authorship and intellectual input in publications or presentations.

## Data stewardship implications for practice
- Clear governance, standardized data collection, and robust QA processes support reliable data sharing and reuse.
- Metadata and data lineage are well-documented (from field collection to validated, collated indices).
- Open licensing with explicit attribution ensures traceability and responsible reuse in policy and research contexts.
- Provides a structured, machine-readable dataset (CSV) suitable for integration into data portals and other datasets.
