# FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022.

## Overview and Study Design
- Investigates the impact of Storm Arwen (Nov 2021) on forest structure and biodiversity in Kielder Forest, using a paired design with 12 windblown (impact) and 12 control patches (24 sites total).
- Within each site, data were collected along a single 100-meter transect, plus three 10×10 m plots and three 2×2 m quadrats, and 2–4 bird point counts depending on site size.
- Sites were selected to balance accessibility, researcher safety, and environmental representativeness.

## Data Collected and Spatial-Temporal Scope
- Fallen trees: counted along the 100 m transect; perimeter measured three times for volume estimation; recorded as flat on ground or leaning, and dead or alive.
- Vegetation structure: three 10×10 m plots along each transect for diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements of trees.
- Ground and understory cover: three 2×2 m quadrats per transect for visual estimation of cover (Braun-Blanquet scale) of grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens; plant species inventories within these quadrats.
- Birds: 2–4 bird point counts per site.
- Plant identification: guided by field guides/keys, with occasional photographic aid via iNaturalist.

## Sampling Design and Randomization
- Plots and quadrats placed randomly on the left or right side of the transect to ensure representativeness; subsequent placements alternate sides.
- Braun-Blanquet cover categories defined to standardize semi-quantitative estimates.

## Data Standards and Provenance Considerations
- Data types include structural measurements (DBH, transect metrics), biodiversity inventories (plant species, cover categories), and bird counts.
- Taxonomic identification supported by field guides, keys, and iNaturalist, implying need for consistent taxonomic references in metadata.
- Temporal scope: May–July 2022; storm event context essential for interpreting structure and biodiversity changes.
- Volume estimation derived from measured tree perimeters (with three measurements per tree).

## Data Quality, Documentation, and Use
- Standardized measurement protocols and replicates (three perimeter measurements per fallen tree) support data quality and comparability.
- Clear definitions of measurement units and categories (e.g., Braun-Blanquet scale) facilitate consistent data interpretation.
- Documentation of field methods and identification approaches helps with reproducibility and re-use by data users.

## Data Management, Sharing, and Governance
- Towards integration into data portals and catalogues; explicit aim to upload datasets and catalogue holdings.
- Considerations for updates and versioning as datasets evolve; documentation of work performed on datasets recommended.
- Awareness of data availability and limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes) to guide sharing policies.

## Challenges and Implications for Data Stewards
- Potential gaps between user needs and data outputs (e.g., capturing all nuances of storm impact vs. standard plots).
- Timely data submission from field teams and ensuring adherence to standards across different systems or formats.
- Managing large, multi-scalar datasets (transect, plots, quadrats, and bird counts) and reconciling legacy or incompatible data from prior work.
- Handling legacy databases or non-interoperable formats that may require bespoke solutions for integration.

## Recommendations for Metadata and Governance
- Capture comprehensive metadata: site IDs, pair IDs, transect IDs, plot/quadrat IDs, coordinates, observer IDs, dates/times, weather conditions, and equipment used.
- Standardize taxonomic references and maintain a clear link to iNaturalist records where used.
- Document data processing steps (e.g., volume estimation from perimeters, Braun-Blanquet coding) for transparent re-use.
- Establish a data sharing plan with clear embargo/licensing terms, data quality checks, and version control.
- Ensure long-term preservation by aligning with relevant data portals and catalogue schemas, including explicit provenance and update workflows.
