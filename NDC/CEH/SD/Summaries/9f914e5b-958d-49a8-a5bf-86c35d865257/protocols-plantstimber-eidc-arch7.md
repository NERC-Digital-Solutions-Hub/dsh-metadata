FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022.

## Purpose and Study Design
- Investigates the impact of Storm Arwen (Nov 2021) on forest structure and biodiversity using a paired control–impact design.
- 12 windblown (impact) and 12 corresponding control sites, forming 12 control–impact pairs (24 sites total).
- Site selection aimed to balance accessibility, researcher risk, and environmental representativeness.

## Spatial and Sampling Design
- Each site includes a single 100-meter transect.
- Along each transect:
  - Three 10×10-meter plots located at 0–10 m, 50–60 m, and 90–100 m.
  - Three 2×2-meter quadrats located at 0–2 m, 50–52 m, and 90–92 m.
  - Bird point counts: 2–4 counts depending on site size.
- Plots and quadrats are randomly placed on the left or right side of the transect, with sequential alternation to ensure representativeness.

## Measurements and Observations
- Fallen trees along the 100 m transect are counted and measured; perimeter is measured three times for volume estimation.
- Recorded whether each fallen tree is flat on the ground or leaning, and whether it is dead or alive.
- Vegetation cover in 2×2 m quadrats estimated visually for grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens using the Braun-Blanquet scale.
- Plant species inventories compiled within the 2×2 m quadrats.
- Plant and tree identification aided by field guides, keys, and iNaturalist as needed.

## Data Structure and GIS Relevance
- Spatially explicit sampling units (transects, plots, quadrats) suitable for GIS mapping and analysis.
- Attributes likely include: transect geometry, plot/quadrat locations, fallen-tree metrics (presence, status, volume estimates), vegetation cover categories, and species inventories (plants and trees).
- Braun-Blanquet cover categories provide standardized coding for vegetation abundance.

## Braun-Blanquet Scale (Cover Estimates)
- +: < 1% cover
- 1: 1–5% cover
- 2: 6–25% cover
- 3: 26–50% cover
- 4: 51–75% cover
- 5: 76–100% cover

## Temporal Context and Data Sources
- Fieldwork conducted May–July 2022.
- Storm Arwen occurred in November 2021; study designed to compare windblown versus control patches.
- Data collection incorporated field guides, identification keys, and iNaturalist for corroboration.
