# FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022

- Objective
  - Assess the impact of Storm Arwen (November 2021) on forest structure and biodiversity in Kielder, using a paired windblown vs control design.

- Experimental design
  - 12 control–impact pairs (24 sites total).
  - Within each site: one 100-meter transect, three 10×10-meter plots, three 2×2-meter quadrats, and 2–4 bird point counts (size-dependent).

- Site selection rationale
  - Pairs chosen to balance accessibility, researcher safety, and environmental representativeness.

- Survey protocols and measurements
  - Fallen trees: counted along the 100 m transect; perimeter measured three times for volume estimation; recorded whether trees were flat on the ground or leaning; noted dead or alive status.
  - Vegetation plots: three 10×10 m plots along the transect at 0–10 m, 50–60 m, and 90–100 m.
  - Ground cover: visually estimated for grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens using Braun-Blanquet scale inside three 2×2-meter quadrats at 0–2 m, 50–52 m, and 90–92 m.

- Plot and quadrat placement
  - 10×10 m plots and 2×2 m quadrats randomly placed on the right or left side of the transect to ensure randomness and representativeness.
  - Within each transect, plotting sequence alternated sides (left, then right, then left).

- Plant identification and data collection
  - Plants (including trees) identified using field guides and keys; supported by photos via iNaturalist when needed.

- Species inventory and data recording
  - Within each 2×2 m quadrat: plant species inventories conducted.
  - iNaturalist used as an optional aid for photographic-aided identification.

- Braun-Blanquet scale details
  - +: < 1% cover
  - 1: 1–5% cover
  - 2: 6–25% cover
  - 3: 26–50% cover
  - 4: 51–75% cover
  - 5: 76–100% cover

- Bird data
  - Bird counts conducted per site (2–4 point counts, depending on site size), integrated with the vegetation and forest structure data to assess biodiversity responses to windthrow.
