# FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022.

## Study Context and Objective
- Investigates the impact of Storm Arwen (November 2021) on forest structure and biodiversity in Kielder Forest, UK.
- Uses a paired control–impact design with 12 close pairs (24 sites total): windblown (impact) patches and nearby control patches.
- Survey design includes transects, plots, quadrats, and bird point counts to compare structure and biodiversity between windblown and control areas.

## Experimental Design
- 12 control–impact pairs chosen to balance accessibility, researcher safety, and environmental representativeness.
- Within each site pair: one 100-meter transect, three 10×10-meter plots, three 2×2-meter quadrats, and 2–4 bird point counts depending on site size.
- Sites selected to reflect variation while ensuring comparability between windblown and control conditions.

## Field Protocols and Data Collected
- Fallen trees along the 100 m transect are counted and measured; the perimeter of each fallen tree is measured three times for volume estimation.
- Each fallen tree is recorded as flat on the ground or leaning, and as dead or alive.
- Vegetation sampling along the transect includes three 10×10 m plots for tree counts and diameter at breast height (DBH).

## Vegetation Sampling Details
- 10×10 m plots placed at 0–10, 50–60, and 90–100 m along the transect.
- Inside each plot, DBH of trees is measured; plots are randomly placed to either the left or right of the transect to ensure randomness.
- Three 2×2 m quadrats are used per transect section (placed at 0–2, 50–52, 90–92 m along the transect) for cover assessments and species inventories.
- Visual cover estimates are recorded for grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens using the Braun-Blanquet scale within each 2×2 m quadrat.
- Plant species present within quadrats are identified using field guides/keys, with occasional photographic aid via iNaturalist.

## Randomisation and Sampling Layout
- 10×10 m plots and 2×2 m quadrats are randomly placed on the left or right side of the transect.
- Within each transect, locations are sequenced (e.g., left, then right, then left) to maintain randomness and representativeness.

## Data Coding Scale
- Braun-Blanquet cover scale used to estimate vegetation cover:
  - +: <1% cover
  - 1: 1–5% cover
  - 2: 6–25% cover
  - 3: 26–50% cover
  - 4: 51–75% cover
  - 5: 76–100% cover

## Bird Counts
- 2–4 bird point counts conducted per site, depending on site size, to assess avian biodiversity alongside vegetation and structure data.
