# FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022

## Purpose and study design
- Investigates the impact of Storm Arwen (Nov 2021) on forest structure and biodiversity in Kielder Forest using a paired design.
- 12 windblown (impact) and 12 control sites, forming 12 close control–impact pairs (24 sites total).
- Pairs chosen to balance accessibility, researcher safety, and environmental representativeness.

## Data types and collection scope
- Tree and forest structure: fallen trees along a 100 m transect; diameter at breast height (DBH) measurements from three 10×10 m plots; assessment of tree status (flat/grounded, dead/alive).
- Vegetation cover and composition: Braun-Blanquet cover estimates (for grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, lichens) in three 2×2 m quadrats per transect; plant species inventories within those quadrats.
- Biodiversity observations: bird counts conducted as 2–4 point counts per site (depending on site size).
- Species identifications: guided by field guides/keys with occasional iNaturalist support.

## Sampling design and layout
- Within each site: one 100 m transect with three 10×10 m plots positioned at 0–10, 50–60, and 90–100 m along the transect.
- 2×2 m quadrats placed randomly on the left or right side of the transect; subsequent plots/quadrats alternate sides to ensure representative coverage.
- Random placement of plots/quadrats aims to reduce bias and improve representativeness.

## Data standards and measurement details
- Perimeter of fallen trees measured three times for accurate volume estimation; documentation of whether trees are flat on the ground or leaning.
- Braun-Blanquet categories defined as: + (<1%), 1 (1–5%), 2 (6–25%), 3 (26–50%), 4 (51–75%), 5 (76–100%).

## Timing, context, and representativeness
- Fieldwork conducted May–July 2022.
- Site selection emphasized representativeness of windthrow impacts and maintainable comparability between paired sites.

## Data governance considerations for data leaders
- Clear, repeatable protocols and randomization facilitate data discoverability, quality control, and future reuse.
- Data encompass multiple data layers (physical structure, ground flora, canopy/understory vegetation, and avifauna), enabling cross-domain analyses of storm impacts on forest ecosystems.
- Documentation includes measurement methods, scales used (Braun-Blanquet), and explicit site pairing, supporting reproducibility and potential integration into broader data systems or networks.
