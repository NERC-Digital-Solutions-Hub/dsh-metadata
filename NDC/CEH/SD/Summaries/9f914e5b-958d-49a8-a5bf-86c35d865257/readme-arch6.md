# Forest structure, composition, and bird counts in windblown and control sites in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, UK, May-July 2022

- Overview
  - Study location: Kielder Forest, Northumberland, UK
  - Timeframe: May–July 2022
  - Research aims: quantify forest structure, tree composition, and bird counts; compare windblown vs. control sites across paired plots
  - Collaborating institutions: University of Aberdeen (Biological Sciences) and CONICET-Universidad Nacional de Tucumán (Argentina)

- Data Collection and Key Variables
  - Bird counts
    - Method: bird point counts at paired windblown and control sites; each site contains 2 or 4 points, with two visits per point
    - Protocol: 5-minute fixed-radius observations per point; birds recorded by species and distance band (0–10 m, 10–20 m, 20–30 m, 30–40 m, 40–50 m)
    - Time window: 6:00–10:30 am
    - Output: coordinates and metadata stored separately; species-level counts per site, point, visit, and distance band
  - Timber and plant surveys
    - Timber: three 10x10 m plots along a 100 m transect; counts and measurements of fallen trees; DBH measurements for volume estimates
    - Plants: three 2x2 m quadrats along transect; cover estimates (Braun-Blanquet scale) for grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, lichens; vascular plant IDs
    - Plots/quadrats positioned at 0–10 m, 50–60 m, and 90–100 m along transects
  - Environmental characterization
    - Buffers: 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m buffers around survey sites
    - Data sources: National Forest Estate Subcompartments England 2019 dataset; features include main tree species, cover, and relational links
    - Spatial processing: QGIS buffers and intersection to extract environmental attributes for each site/buffer
  - Coordinate handling
    - Coordinates provided in multiple formats (Original GPS coordinates, British National Grid references, and converted WGS84 lat/long)
    - SiteID encoding: paired windblown (1) vs. control (2) within a pair; helps compare treatment effects

  - Content note: Some datasets contain only coordinates; results from bird surveys and other measurements are in the associated data files listed above

- Spatial and Analytical Context
  - Geospatial framework
    - Coordinates provided in British National Grid, with converted lat/long in WGS84
    - Buffers and environment data prepared via QGIS (intersection with National Forest Estate Subcompartments England 2019)
  - Data integration
    - SiteID encodes paired windblown/control comparisons; cross-linking across species counts, plot-level measurements, and environmental attributes is supported
  - Temporal scope
    - Data collected within May–July 2022 window; multiple visits per site/point

- Data Use, Reuse, and Documentation
  - Intended uses
    - Compare forest structure, tree composition, and bird abundance across windblown vs. control sites
    - Explore relationships between bird counts, timber/plant metrics, and environmental context
    - Build self-serve dashboards or reports to enable end users to access site-level and plot-level insights
  - Data quality and provenance
    - Data are organized with explicit field protocols, coordinate derivations, and buffer-based environmental attributes
    - Derived datasets (buffers, subcompartment attributes) generated via defined GIS workflows
  - Access and format considerations
    - Primary data in CSVs for easy ingestion; spatial data provided as ESRI shapefiles for GIS analyses
    - Documentation embedded in file headers and dataset descriptions for linking across files

- Practical Considerations for Data Support
  - Data linking
    - Use SiteID, Type, and Plot/Quadrat IDs to join datasets (bird counts, timber, plants, coordinates, buffers)
  - Coordinate handling
    - Be mindful of multiple coordinate systems; prefer Lat/Long (WGS84) for mapping and join keys
  - Temporal alignment
    - Consider Visit/Date fields when analyzing repeated measures or site-level comparisons
  - Reusability and expansion
    - The buffers and subcompartment attributes enable exposure of environmental covariates at multiple spatial scales (100/200/400 m)
    - Shapefiles enable GIS-driven analyses and integration with other geospatial layers
