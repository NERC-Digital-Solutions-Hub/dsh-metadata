# FOREST STRUCTURE, COMPOSITION, AND BIRD COUNTS IN WINDBLOWN AND CONTROL SITES IN KIELDER FOREST, NORTHUMBERLAND, UK, MAYJULY 2022

## Aim
- Assess the impact of Storm Arwen on forest structure and biodiversity in Kielder Forest using a paired windblown vs control design.
- Enable comparison of environmental health across time and space through standardized data collection.

## Study design and site selection
- Paired design with 12 windblown (impact) and 12 control patches, totaling 24 sites.
- Impact sites severely affected by Storm Arwen (November 2021).
- Sites arranged as relatively close windblown–control pairs.
- Survey period: May–July 2022.
- Pairs chosen to balance accessibility, researcher safety, and environmental representativeness.

## Survey protocols and data collection

### Transects and plots
- Within each site: one 100-meter transect.
- Three 10×10-meter plots placed along the transect at 0–10 m, 50–60 m, and 90–100 m.
- Three 2×2-meter quadrats used for vegetation assessments at 0–2 m, 50–52 m, and 90–92 m along the transect.
- Plots and quadrats oriented randomly to the left or right of the transect; alternated side by side to ensure representativeness.

### Fallen trees and standing trees
- All fallen trees along the 100-m transect counted and measured.
- Perimeter of each fallen tree measured three times to estimate volume.
- Recorded whether each fallen tree was flat on the ground or leaning, and whether it was dead or alive.

### Vegetation cover and flora inventory
- Braun-Blanquet scale used to visually estimate cover of grasses, shrubs, ferns, mosses, fungi, and lichens within each 2×2 m quadrat.
- Cover estimates aligned with Braun-Blanquet categories:
  - +: <1% cover
  - 1: 1–5% cover
  - 2: 6–25% cover
  - 3: 26–50% cover
  - 4: 51–75% cover
  - 5: 76–100% cover
- Within-quadrat plant species inventories conducted; identifications supported by field guides/keys and occasionally by iNaturalist photographs.

### Bird surveys
- Bird point counts conducted 2–4 per site, depending on site size.

### Identification and data sources
- Plant and tree species identified using field guides and keys.
- iNaturalist used as a supplementary aid for species identification.

## Timing and data management
- Surveys conducted within May–July 2022 across all 24 sites.
- Data collection designed to support standardized comparisons of forest structure, composition, and avifauna between windblown and control patches.
