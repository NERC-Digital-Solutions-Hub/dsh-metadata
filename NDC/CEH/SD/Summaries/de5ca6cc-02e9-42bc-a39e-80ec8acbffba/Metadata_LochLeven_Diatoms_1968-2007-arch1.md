# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN DIATOM COUNTS 1968-2007' DATASET

- The dataset contains counts of four planktonic diatom taxa from Loch Leven spanning 1968–2007, as part of a long-term lake monitoring program.
- Counts are given as density: cells per millilitre (ml-1) for four taxa:
  - Asterionella formosa
  - Aulacoseira spp
  - Diatoma spp
  - Unicellular centric diatoms

## Data Content and Units

- Data type: phytoplankton counts (diatoms)
- Frequency: weekly to monthly samples
- Sampling station: a single sampling station; weekly to monthly time series with gaps
- Total records: 4,992
- Data fields: date, year, taxon, count, unit

## Sampling Regime and Methods

- Locations:
  - Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m)
  - Outflow
  - GB grid coordinates provided for each site
- Sampling method:
  - Integrated water sample from surface to ~3.5 m using a weighted polyethylene tube (from Reed Bower)
  - When open-water sampling was not possible, sampling from the loch or outflow sluice
- Sample handling:
  - 100 ml sub-samples preserved with Lugol's iodine
  - Sub-samples stored in 1 L bottles prior to laboratory analysis
- Lab analysis:
  - Pre-2001: counts from sub-samples stored and analyzed with Lund chambers
  - 2001 onwards: counting follows UK & CEN standards; ~400 phytoplankton units counted per sub-sample; magnifications from x40 to x400
- Taxon-specific notes:
  - Aulacoseira counts reported as filaments ml-1 pre-2001 and as cells ml-1 from 2001 onward
  - Diatoma spp. and unicellular centric diatoms counted as cells ml-1 throughout

## Timeline and Data Gaps

- Regular monitoring since 1991
- Gaps: six years with limited data (1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991) when sampling was largely not carried out

## Data Structure and Quality Control

- Data structure: five fields - date, year, taxon, count, unit
- Quality control:
  - All three authors involved in Loch Leven long-term monitoring contributed to quality control
  - Pre-2001 data checked and collated by Tony Bailey-Watts and Alex Kirika
  - 2001–2007 data counted and checked by Laurence Carvalho

## Location Details

- Sampling sites described as GB national grid locations with explicit easting and northing coordinates provided in the accompanying Table 1
