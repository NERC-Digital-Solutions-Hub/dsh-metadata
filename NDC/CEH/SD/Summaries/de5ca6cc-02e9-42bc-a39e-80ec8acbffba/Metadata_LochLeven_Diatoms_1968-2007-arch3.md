- Scope and nature of the data
  - Long-term monitoring dataset of four planktonic diatom taxa from Loch Leven (1968–2007).
  - Count units: cells per milliliter (ml^-1).
  - Taxa: Asterionella formosa; Aulacoseira spp; Diatoma spp; unicellular centric diatoms.
  - Sampling frequency: weekly to monthly; single sampling station.

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Sampling location: Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m) and the loch outflow.
  - Sample collection: boat-based, using a weighted polyethylene tube for integrated samples from surface to ~3.5 m.
  - In poor conditions (ice, weather): samples from the loch outflow.
  - Sample handling: 1 L bottles; 100 ml sub-samples preserved with Lugol’s iodine for analysis.

- Sampling sites and coordinates
  - Reed Bower: GB grid references Easting 313568, Northing 701141.
  - Outflow: GB grid references Easting 317004, Northing 699380.

- Data collection and counting methods
  - Phytoplankton counts performed on sub-samples (1–5 ml), possibly concentrated by settling.
  - Pre-2001: counts based on Lund chambers (standard methods Bailey-Watts et al., 1990).
  - From 2001+: counts follow UK & CEN standard guidance (Brierley et al., 2007; CEN, 2004); ~400 phytoplankton units counted per sub-sample; magnifications from x40 to x400.

- Taxon-specific counting notes
  - Aulacoseira counts: recorded as filaments ml^-1 pre-2001; as cells ml^-1 from 2001 onward.
  - Diatoma spp.; unicellular centric diatoms; Asterionella formosa: counts recorded as cells ml^-1 across the entire dataset.

- Temporal coverage and data gaps
  - Regular monitoring from 1991–2007.
  - Six years with limited data: 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991.
  - Overall coverage: 1968–2007 (long-term dataset).

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Quality controlled by three project researchers: Bailey-Watts, Kirika, Carvalho.
  - Pre-2001 QC: Tony Bailey-Watts counted; 2001–2007 QC: Laurence Carvalho counted and checked.

- Data structure and size
  - Structure: columns = date, year, taxon, count, unit.
  - Size: 4,992 records (rows); 5 fields (columns).

  - Methodological and reference framework includes:
