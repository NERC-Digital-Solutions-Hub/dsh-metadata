# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN DIATOM COUNTS 1968-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term phytoplankton monitoring dataset recording four planktonic diatom taxa from Loch Leven (1968–2007).
- Source: CEH Edinburgh and predecessor bodies; part of ongoing lake monitoring program.

## Data Scope and Content
- Taxa: Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira spp, Diatoma spp, unicellular centric diatoms.
- Counts: density in cells per millilitre (ml^-1).
- Records: 4,992 rows, 5 fields (date, year, taxon, count, unit).
- Temporal coverage: 1968–2007; regular monitoring resumed after gaps (six years with limited data: 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991).

## Sampling Regime and Collection Methods
- Sites: Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m) and Outflow.
- Method: integrated surface-to-~3.5 m sample using a weighted polyethylene tube; alternatives when open-water sampling was not possible.
- Grid references: Reed Bower (Easting 313568, Northing 701141); Outflow (Easting 317004, Northing 699380).
- Frequency: weekly to monthly samples.
- Preservation: 100 ml sub-samples preserved with Lugol’s iodine for analysis.

## Analysis and Measurement Techniques
- Pre-2001: sub-samples counted on Lund chambers; standard methods from Bailey-Watts et al. (1990).
- 2001 onward: UK & CEN standard guidance (Brierley et al., 2007; CEN, 2004); ~400 phytoplankton units counted per sub-sample; magnifications from x40 to x400.
- Taxon-specific units:
  - Aulacoseira: reported as filaments ml^-1 (pre-2001) and cells ml^-1 (from 2001).
  - Diatoma spp., unicellular centric diatoms, and Asterionella formosa: cells ml^-1 throughout.

## Quality Control and Provenance
- QA/QC performed by all three authors involved in Loch Leven long-term monitoring since 1968.
- Pre-2001 data counted by Tony Bailey-Watts; compiled/checked by Alex Kirika.
- 2001–2007 data counted and checked by Laurence Carvalho.

## Data Structure and Metadata
- Columns: date, year, taxon, count, unit.
- Dataset size: 4,992 records across 5 fields.
- Data lineage: tied to Loch Leven long-term monitoring project; references to related methodological guidance.
