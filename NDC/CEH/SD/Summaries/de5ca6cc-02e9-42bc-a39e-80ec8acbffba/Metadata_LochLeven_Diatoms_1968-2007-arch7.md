# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN DIATOM COUNTS 1968-2007' DATASET

- Overview
  - Long-term phytoplankton dataset documenting counts of four diatom taxa from Loch Leven (1968–2007) as part of CEH’s monitoring programme.
  - Counts represent density of cells per millilitre for the four taxa.

- Data Content
  - Taxa included: Asterionella formosa; Aulacoseira spp; Diatoma spp; Unicellular centric diatoms.
  - Count units:
    - Asterionella formosa, Diatoma spp., unicellular centric diatoms: cells ml^-1 (throughout dataset).
    - Aulacoseira: filaments ml^-1 prior to 2001; cells ml^-1 from 2001 onward.
  - Dataset size: 4,992 records (rows) and 5 fields (columns).
  - Fields: date, year, taxon, count, unit.

- Sampling Regime & Collection Methods
  - Sampling frequency: weekly to monthly (with some gaps).
  - Main sampling site: Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m); water collected with a weighted polyethylene tube from surface to ~3.5 m.
  - Alternative site: Loch sampling from the outflow sluice when conditions prevented open-water sampling.
  - Sample handling: 100 ml sub-samples preserved with Lugol's iodine; stored in 1 L Nalgene bottles.
  - Analysis: phytoplankton counts performed on sub-samples; pre-2001 counts used Lund chambers; post-2001 counts followed UK & CEN standards with ~400 units counted per sub-sample (magnifications x40 to x400).

- Sampling Locations (Geospatial context)
  - Reed Bower: GB National Grid Reference Easting 313568; Northing 701141.
  - Outflow: GB National Grid Reference Easting 317004; Northing 699380.
  - Location details indicate two sampling stations with spatial context for GIS applications.

- Temporal Coverage
  - Data span: 1968–2007.
  - Gaps: six years with limited data (1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991); regular monitoring resumed from 1991 onward.

- Quality Control
  - Quality control conducted by the three authors ( Bailey-Watts, Kirika, Carvalho ) who have contributed to the Loch Leven long-term monitoring project.
  - Pre-2001 data counted by Bailey-Watts; 2001–2007 data counted/verified by Carvalho, with cross-checking by Kirika.

- Data Structure
  - Structure: date, year, taxon, count, unit.
  - Total of 4,992 records across 5 fields.
