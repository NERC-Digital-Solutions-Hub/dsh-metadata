# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN DIATOM COUNTS 1968-2007' DATASET

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset of four planktonic diatom taxa counts from Loch Leven, 1968–2007.
- Focuses on environmental health assessment through standardized diatom abundance data.
- Data collected as part of CEH Edinburgh and predecessor bodies’ lake monitoring programme.
- Dataset contains 4992 records across 5 fields.

## Data Content
- Taxa and units:
  - Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira spp, Diatoma spp, and unicellular centric diatoms.
  - Counts expressed as cells per millilitre (ml−1); Aulacoseira counts switch from filaments ml−1 (pre-2001) to cells ml−1 (2001 onward).
- Frequency and scope:
  - Weekly to monthly sampling from a single station; integrated samples from surface to about 3.5 m depth.
- Sampling locations:
  - Reed Bower (primary mid-basin; depth ~4 m) and Outflow (secondary/alternative sampling when needed); coordinates provided in GB National Grid.
- Data structure:
  - 5 fields: date, year, taxon, count, unit.
  - 4992 records total.

## Sampling Regime & Methods
- Surface-to-subsurface phytoplankton sampling via boat at Reed Bower; integrated sample collected with a weighted polyethylene tube.
- When conditions prevent boat sampling (ice, weather), samples taken from loch outflow sluice.
- Sample handling: 100 ml sub-samples preserved with Lugol’s iodine; counts performed on 1–5 ml sub-samples; concentration by settling if needed.
- Counting standards:
  - Pre-2001: Lund chamber analysis following Bailey-Watts et al. (1990).
  - 2001 onward: UK & CEN standard guidance (Brierley et al., 2007; CEN, 2004) with ~400 phytoplankton units counted per sub-sample, across magnifications x40–x400.

## Quality Control
- QA conducted by all three longstanding project authors.
- Pre-2001: Tony Bailey-Watts counted; validated by Alex Kirika.
- 2001–2007: Laurence Carvalho counted and checked data.

## Temporal Coverage and Gaps
- Regular monitoring from 1991 to 2007; six years with limited sampling: 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991.

## Data Management and Access
- Data stored and organized in a structured dataset; raw samples preserved in 1 L Nalgene bottles.
