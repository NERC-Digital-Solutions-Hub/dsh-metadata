- Nature and Units of recorded values
  - Counts of four planktonic diatom taxa from Loch Leven (1968–2007) as part of long-term monitoring.
  - Count units: cells per millilitre (ml^-1).
  - Taxa:
    - Asterionella formosa
    - Aulacoseira spp
    - Diatoma spp
    - Unicellular centric diatoms

- Sampling regime & collection methods
  - Sampling sites: Reed Bower (site 1) and Outflow (site 2). GB grid references:
    - Reed Bower: Easting 313568, Northing 701141
    - Outflow: Easting 317004, Northing 699380
  - Sampling method: boat-based sampling from Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m) using a weighted polyethylene tube to obtain integrated surface-to-3.5 m samples; when open water sampling was not possible, samples from the loch outflow were used.
  - Sample handling: water samples stored in 1 L Nalgene bottles; 100 ml sub-samples preserved with 2–3 drops of Lugol's iodine for phytoplankton analysis.
  - Sampling frequency and continuity: weekly to monthly samples; six years with limited sampling in 1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, and 1991; regular monitoring since 1991.

- Counting regime and methodological details
  - Phytoplankton counts conducted on 1–5 ml sub-samples; where needed, samples were concentrated by settling.
  - Pre-2001 counting: sub-samples stored and analyzed using Lund chambers; methods follow Bailey-Watts et al. (1990).
  - From 2001 onward: counting followed UK & CEN standard guidance (Brierley et al., 2007; CEN, 2004) with ~400 phytoplankton units counted per sub-sample; magnifications ranged from x40 to x400.

- Taxon-specific counting notes
  - Aulacoseira counts: recorded as filaments ml^-1 pre-2001; as cells ml^-1 from 2001 onward.
  - Diatoma spp., unicellular centric diatoms, and Asterionella formosa: counts recorded as cells ml^-1 across the entire dataset.

- Quality control
  - Quality controlled by all three authors involved in Loch Leven long-term monitoring since 1968.
  - Pre-2001 counts: Tony Bailey-Watts counted; checked and collated by Alex Kirika.
  - 2001–2007 counts: counted and checked by Laurence Carvalho.
