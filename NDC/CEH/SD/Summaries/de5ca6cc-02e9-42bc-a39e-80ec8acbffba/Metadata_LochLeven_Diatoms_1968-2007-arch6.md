# METADATA FOR 'LOCH LEVEN DIATOM COUNTS 1968-2007' DATASET

- Overview
  - Long-term dataset of counts for four planktonic diatom taxa from Loch Leven (1968–2007).
  - Count units: cells per millilitre; taxa include Asterionella formosa, Aulacoseira spp, Diatoma spp, and unicellular centric diatoms.
  - Frequency: weekly to monthly; based on a single sampling station.

- Data Content and Scope
  - Source: CEH Edinburgh and predecessor bodies as part of a long-term lake monitoring programme.
  - Data structure: 4 taxa counts across 4992 records, with 5 fields: date, year, taxon, count, unit.
  - Count conventions:
    - Aulacoseira: filaments ml-1 pre-2001; cells ml-1 from 2001 onward.
    - Diatoma spp., unicellular centric diatoms, Asterionella formosa: cells ml-1 for the entire dataset.
  - Sampling period gaps: six years with limited data (1983, 1984, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1991); regular monitoring since 1991.

- Sampling Regime and Collection Methods
  - Location: Reed Bower (mid-basin, depth ~4 m); outflow used when necessary (ice, bad weather).
  - Method: integrated water sample from surface to ~3.5 m using a weighted polyethylene tube; 100 ml subsamples preserved with Lugol's iodine.
  - Geospatial references: Reed Bower (Easting 313568, Northing 701141); Outflow (Easting 317004, Northing 699380).
  - Lab processing:
    - Pre-2001: sub-samples stored and analysed with Lund chambers (Bailey-Watts et al., 1990).
    - 2001 onward: UK/CEN standard guidance followed (Brierley et al., 2007; CEN, 2004); ~400 phytoplankton units counted per subsample; magnifications x40–x400.

- Data Quality and Provenance
  - Quality control conducted by the three long-term project authors.
  - Pre-2001 data counted by Tony Bailey-Watts; reviewed by Alex Kirika.
  - 2001–2007 data counted by Dr Laurence Carvalho.
  - Metadata includes references to methodology and standard guidance used for counting.

- Data Structure and Documentation
  - Columns: date, year, taxon, count, unit.
  - Total records: 4992; total fields: 5.

- Potential Uses for Data Support
  - Time-series analysis of diatom populations as part of lake health and eutrophication studies.
  - Integration with environmental covariates from long-term monitoring to explore drivers of phytoplankton dynamics.
  - Creation of user-friendly data products (dashboards, pivot tables) for end users to explore taxa abundances over time.
  - Cross-dataset harmonization and sharing to promote data reuse and transparency in water quality monitoring.
  - Documentation and metadata support to ensure clear understanding of counting methods and unit conventions for downstream analyses.
