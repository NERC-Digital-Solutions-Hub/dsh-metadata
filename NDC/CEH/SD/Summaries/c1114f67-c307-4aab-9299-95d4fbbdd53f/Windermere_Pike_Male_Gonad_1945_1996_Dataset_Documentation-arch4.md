# Windermere Pike Male Gonad Weight Data (1945 to 1996)

## Overview
- Dataset of estimated gonad weight and associated data for male pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Time frame: 1945 to 1996; data collection originally by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- File: Windermere_Pike_Male_Gonad_Data_1945_to_1996.csv; format is CSV (225 KB).
- Rights/ provenance: Database Right/Copyright © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology/ Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); version 1.4 dated 6-2018.
- Purpose: long-term monitoring of pike using standardized netting methods; supports biological analyses (growth, age, condition, gonad development) over time.

## Data Content and Structure
- Columns (variables) and units:
  - Individual: Unique individual number.
  - Weight: Body weight in grams (g).
  - Length: Length at capture in centimeters (cm).
  - Age: Age at capture in years.
  - Year: Year of capture (calendar year).
  - Temp: Annual average water surface temperature in degrees Celsius (°C).
  - GSI: Gonadosomatic Index (dimensionless).
  - Gonad: Estimated gonad weight in grams (g).
- Location data:
  - Sampling site: Windermere lake, with approximate grid reference and orientation in OS Grid and WGS84 coordinates.
- Species: Esox lucius (pike).

## Experimental Design and Sampling Regime
- Population and sampling target: pike monitored in the north and south basins of Windermere Lake via gill netting.
- Historical sampling change:
  - 1940s–1981: varied methodology with larger mesh nets.
  - 1982 onward: standardized protocol implemented.
- Netting details (1982–present standard):
  - Net type: 64 mm bar mesh multifilament gill nets.
  - Net size: 40 m length x 3 m depth; set on the bottom.
  - Timing: late Oct to late Dec; sites fished in daylight over a two-week period per season.
  - Sites: 10 sites in each basin (north and south); five nets deployed per site.
  - Sampling effort: ~348 net days annually (1982–1989); ~240 net days annually (1990–present); efforts distributed roughly evenly between basins.
  - Sampling rotation: sites rotated to ensure systematic lake coverage; two weeks per site per season.
- Pre-1982 methods: larger mesh and different sampling intensity; variability described by Le Cren (2001) and Winfield et al. (2008).

## Analytical Methods
- On-site processing: pike measured (fork length to 1 mm) and weighed (wet weight to 100 g); sex determined via dissection.
- Aging: left opercular bone used to age fish, following Frost & Kipling (1959) with a birth date of 1 April.
- Gonad weight estimation: simple linear function based on body weight:
  - Gonad weight estimated between 2% (lightest) and 4% (heaviest) of body weight, following Craig (1996).
- Supporting references for methods:
  - Frost & Kipling (1959); Le Cren (2001); Winfield et al. (2008); Craig (1996).

## Quality Control
- Measurements are cross-checked by permutations of three individuals to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Data Access, Usage, and Stewardship
- Data are collected through a long-term monitoring program and documented with detailed methodology and provenance.
- Metadata includes sampling design, site locations, methods, and references to foundational literature.
- Data are suitable for analyses of body condition, growth, age structure, temperature relationships, and gonad development over time.
- Users should consider historical methodological changes (pre-1982 vs. post-1982 standardization) when conducting longitudinal analyses.
- The dataset provides a robust, centrally governed data asset with clear lineage to CEH/IFE and FBA, including explicit rights and citation guidance.
