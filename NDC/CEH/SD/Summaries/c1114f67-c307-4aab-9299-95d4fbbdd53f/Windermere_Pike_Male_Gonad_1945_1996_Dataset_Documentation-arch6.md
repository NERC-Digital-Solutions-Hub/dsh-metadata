# Windermere Pike Male Gonad Weight Data (1945 to 1996)

- Overview
  - Dataset of estimated gonad weight and related data for male pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
  - Time span: 1945–1996; initial data collection by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), later by CEH and its predecessor IFE (since 1989).
  - File: Windermere_Pike_Male_Gonad_Data_1945_to_1996.csv (CSV, 225 KB).

- Data schema (columns and meanings)
  - Individual: Unique individual number.
  - Weight: Body weight (grams).
  - Length: Length at capture (centimeters).
  - Age: Age at capture (years).
  - Year: Year of capture (calendar year).
  - Temp: Annual average water surface temperature (degrees Celsius).
  - GSI: Gonadosomatic Index (dimensionless).
  - Gonad: Estimated gonad weight (grams).
  - Description/Units fields provide metadata for each column.

- Sampling site and scope
  - Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
  - Approximate grid reference: OS grid and geographic coordinates provided.
  - Species: Esox lucius (pike).
  - Monitoring scope: Pike tracked in north and south basins via gill netting; sampling sites and effort varied over time.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Netting method: Gill nets; from 1982–1989, standardized approach with 64 mm bar mesh, 40 m nets, 3 m depth, deployed at ~10 sites per basin.
  - Sampling cadence: Nets set during Oct–Dec; rotation across sites; each site fished for two weeks per season.
  - Effort: 1982–1989 total annual sampling ~348 net days; 1990 onward ~240 net days per year, evenly distributed between basins.
  - Netting details: Five nets in water at a time, sites rotated to cover lake-wide sampling.

- Collection and laboratory processing
  - Measurements: Fork length (to 1 mm) and wet weight (to 100 g) recorded for each pike; sex determined in lab.
  - Ageing: Left opercular bone used; birth date nominally 1 April.
  - Gonad weight estimation: Linear relationship assumed; gonad weight estimated as 2–4% of body weight for lightest to heaviest individuals, based on Craig (1996).

- Quality control
  - Measurements verified through permutations involving three individuals to ensure accuracy.

- Data provenance and references
  - Original data collection and curation by FBA; later data handling by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
  - Key methodological references for ageing and gonad estimation cited (e.g., Frost & Kipling 1959; Craig 1996; Winfield et al. 2008).
  - Primary sources for sampling design and historical context documented in accompanying references.

- Potential uses and data products (Data Support perspective)
  - Descriptive analyses: gonad weight, GSI, body size (weight/length), and age relationships; temporal trends across 1945–1996.
  - Relationships to environment: gonad weight and GSI in relation to annual water temperature (Temp) and year.
  - Population insights: reproductive effort over time; age structure and growth in Windermere pike.
  - Data products: dashboards, pivot tables, and self-serve reports enabling end users to explore sex-specific reproductive metrics and related covariates.
  - Outreach: potential to share early prototypes and promote broader data use for policy or management contexts.
