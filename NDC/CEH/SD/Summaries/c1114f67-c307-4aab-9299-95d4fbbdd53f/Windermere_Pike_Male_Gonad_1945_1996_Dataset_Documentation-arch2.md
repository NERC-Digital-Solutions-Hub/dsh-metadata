# Windermere Pike Male Gonad Weight Data (1945 to 1996)

## Overview
- Long-term dataset of estimated gonad weight and related data for male pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, Hope/UK.
- Time span: 1945–1996; originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and continued by CEH/IFE from 1989.
- File: Windermere_Pike_Male_Gonad_Data_1945_to_1996.csv (CSV, about 225 KB).

## Data Content
- Columns and keys:
  - Individual (identifier)
  - Weight (g): body weight
  - Length (cm): length at capture
  - Age (years): age at capture
  - Year (calendar year of capture)
  - Temp (°C): annual average water surface temperature
  - GSI: Gonadosomatic Index
  - Gonad (g): estimated gonad weight
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (approx. grid ref SD393960; OSGB36 339385,496080; coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836)
- Species/Sex: Esox lucius (pike), male

## Sampling Design & Field Methods
- Study area: Windermere Lake, with northern and southern basins monitored by gill-netting.
- Sampling regime (standardised since 1982):
  - Net type: 64 mm bar-mesh multifilament gill nets; 40 m long, 3 m deep
  - Timing: October–December
  - Depth: ~4–5 m
  - Sites: 10 per basin; nets set in two weeks per site
  - Net arrangement: five nets in the water at a time; site rotation ensures broad lake coverage
  - Annual effort: ~348 net days (1982–1989); ~240 net days (1990–present), distributed roughly equally between basins
- Historical variation: early methods (pre-1982) differed; later methods are rigorously standardised

## Analytical Methods
- Biological measurements: fork length (to 1 mm) and wet weight (to 0.1 g); pike sex determined during laboratory processing; age assigned from left opercular bone with a birth date of 1 April
- Gonad weight estimation: linear function estimating gonad weight from body weight
  - Gonad weight uses a range: 2% of body weight for the lightest individuals to 4% for the heaviest (per Craig 1996)
- Laboratory references underpinning methods:
  - Frost & Kipling (1959) for aging by opercular bone
  - Craig (1996) for gonad weight relation
  - Le Cren (2001); Winfield et al. (2008) for long-term pike monitoring context

## Quality Control
- Measurements are validated via permutations involving three individuals to ensure accuracy and reproducibility
- Documentation and cross-referencing with established methodological sources for consistency

## Location, Access & Provenance
- Origin: Windermere Lake monitoring program; maintained by CEH/previous institutes
- Data format: CSV with clearly defined units and descriptions
- Data accessibility: intended for storage, portal upload, and reuse in ongoing environmental monitoring and analyses

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring
- Provides a standardized, long-term record of male pike reproductive condition (gonad weight) linked to environmental variables (notably temperature)
- Supports trend analysis of environmental health and policy performance over time
- The standardized sampling and clear documentation facilitate integration with other datasets to enhance environmental monitoring value and accessibility to users
- Useful for assessing ecological responses to climate warming and prey dynamics in a freshwater lake system
