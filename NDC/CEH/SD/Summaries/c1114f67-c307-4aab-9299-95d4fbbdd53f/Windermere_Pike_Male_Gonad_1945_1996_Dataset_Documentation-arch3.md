# Windermere Pike Male Gonad Weight Data (1945 to 1996)

- Overview
  - Long-term dataset of estimated gonad weight and associated data for male pike (Esox lucius) from Windermere Lake, collected from 1945 to 1996.
  - Initially collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA); since 1989, data have been collected by CEH and its predecessor IFE.

- Data Content
  - Columns and meaning:
    - Individual: unique identifier (no units).
    - Weight: body weight (grams).
    - Length: length at capture (centimeters).
    - Age: age at capture (years).
    - Year: calendar year of capture.
    - Temp: annual average water surface temperature (degrees Celsius).
    - GSI: gonadosomatic index (dimensionless).
    - Gonad: estimated gonad weight (grams).
  - Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain; precise coordinates provided.
  - Species: Esox lucius (pike).
  - Sampling site coverage: northern and southern basins of Windermere; sampling regime maintained to achieve broad lake coverage.

- Sampling Design and Field Methods
  - Sampling method: gill netting; two basins (north and south) with variations in effort over time.
  - Standardization from 1982 onward:
    - Nets: 64 mm bar mesh, multifilament, 40 m long, 3 m deep.
    - Sites: 10 sites per basin; five nets deployed per site simultaneously.
    - Season: mid-October to late December; sites rotated to ensure systematic lake coverage.
    - Schedule: typical cycle—set on Monday, inspect Wednesday, lift Friday; two-week site occupancy.
    - Effort: 1982–1989 ≈ 348 net days annually; 1990 onward ≈ 240 net days annually, distributed roughly equally between basins.
  - Pre-1982 methods varied (earlier larger mesh nets).

- Analytical Methods
  - In the laboratory:
    - Measure fork length (to 1 mm) and wet weight (to 100 g).
    - Determine sex via dissection; aging using left opercular bone with a birth date of 1 April.
  - Gonad weight estimation:
    - Simple linear function: gonad weight ranges from ~2% to ~4% of body weight across individuals, based on relationships described by Craig (1996).
  - Quality control references (data provenance and methods cited).

- Quality Control and Metadata
  - Quality checks involve permutations across measurements from three individuals to validate measurements.
  - Metadata and methodological documentation are provided, including standardization details and references for aging, growth, and gonad estimation methods (e.g., Frost & Kipling 1959; Le Cren 2001; Winfield et al. 2008; Craig 1996).

- Data Access, Use, and Governance Considerations
  - Dataset is documented with explicit variable descriptions, units, and measurement protocols, supporting transparency and reproducibility.
  - The standardized methodology and long-running monitoring enable trend analysis in reproductive indicators (GSI, gonad weight) alongside body condition (weight, length) and environmental context (temperature).

- Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Demonstrates how to structure long-term environmental health monitoring around a biological reproductive metric.
  - Illustrates integration of biological data (gonad weight, GSI), morphometrics (length, weight), age structure, and environmental context (temperature) for policy-relevant indicators.
  - Highlights the importance of standardized methods, explicit sampling regimes, metadata completeness, and quality control to support data sharing and governance.
