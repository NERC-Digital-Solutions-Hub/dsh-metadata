# Dataset title First egg dates for Great Tits and Blue Tits breeding in three deciduous woods in Cambridgeshire, England in 1993 to 2014.

## Aim and Rationale
- Timing of breeding in tits reflects spring phenology and is influenced by daylength, ambient temperature, and the phenology of tree-dwelling caterpillars.
- First-egg date (one egg laid per day) serves as a practical measure of breeding timing.
- Breeding timing is used as an indicator of climate warming and as part of a broader long-term study on habitat, landscape factors, and woodland bird populations.

## Study Details
- Study species: Great Tit (Parus major) and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).
- Data collected from birds breeding in wooden nest boxes (approx. 110 x 130 x 200 mm) at 1–2 m height.
- Boxes mostly accessible to both species; some boxes in Wennington Wood are Blue Tit–specific.
- Part of a larger long-term project examining abundance, distribution, and breeding success in English lowland deciduous woodland.

## Study Sites
- Monks Wood National Nature Reserve (Site 1; 52°24'N, 0°14'W; 157 ha)
  - 1993-2000: 22 boxes; 2001-2014: 35 boxes.
- Brampton Wood (Site 2; 52°19'N, 0°16'W; 132 ha)
  - 1993-2014: 22 boxes.
- Wennington Wood (Site 3; 52°23'N, 0°10'W; 72 ha)
  - 1993-1999: 21 boxes; 2000-2014: 35 boxes.
- Habitat: deciduous with common ash, English oak, field maple; understory hawthorn, hazel, blackthorn; Brampton Wood includes some conifer blocks.

## Data Collection
- Boxes inspected approximately weekly during the laying period (start: last week of March).
- First egg dates computed by counting back from observed eggs (one per day).
- Only active nests included (at least one more egg expected); exclude replacement clutches and second broods.
- Data cover first breeding attempts only.

## Data Structure and File Information
- File format: a single Minitab Worksheet saved as CSV (Unicode).
- File name: GTBTfirsteggdates.CSV
- File size: 39.4 KB

## Variables (Columns)
- Column 1: Species code (1 = Great Tit; 2 = Blue Tit)
- Column 2: Site (1 = Monks Wood; 2 = Brampton Wood; 3 = Wennington Wood)
- Column 3: Year number (1993 = Year 1 through 2014 = Year 22)
- Column 4: Nest box identifier (note: Monks Wood boxes 23–30 do not exist)
- Column 5: First egg date (April 1 = 1); March dates appear as negative values (only 3 negative values, all in Year 5)
- Column 6: Sample size (N) for the number of clutches included per year

## Quality Control
- Field data collected by trained, experienced personnel.
- Egg dates cross-checked against original paper records.
- Data lines and values checked for outliers; egg dates validated against yearly site means.
