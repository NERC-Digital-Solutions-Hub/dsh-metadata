# First egg dates for Great Tits and Blue Tits breeding in three deciduous woods in Cambridgeshire, England in 1993 to 2014.

## Overview
- Long-term dataset on first egg dates for Great Tit (Parus major) and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus) breeding in three Cambridgeshire deciduous woods (1993–2014).
- Aims to support environmental monitoring by providing standardized phenology indicators linked to spring progression and climate warming.

## Scientific context
- Breeding timing in tits is influenced by daylength, ambient temperature, and prey (caterpillar) phenology, which in turn relate to temperature and tree bud burst.
- Timing of breeding serves as a proxy for spring phenology and a climate warming indicator.
- Data contribute to a broader long-term study of habitat/landscape factors affecting woodland birds’ abundance, distribution, and breeding success.

## Study species and nest boxes
- Species: Great Tit (Parus major); Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).
- Nest boxes used for data collection (approx. 110 x 130 x 200 mm) at 1–2 m height; box access varies by hole size to allow both species, with some boxes restricted to Blue Tits in Wennington Wood.
- Boxes present at low density to minimize population impact; Brampton Wood also contains dormouse boxes since the mid-1990s, increasing Blue Tit occupancy in that wood.

## Study sites (Woods)
- Monks Wood National Nature Reserve (52°24'N, 0°14'W): 157 ha; 1993–2000: 22 boxes; 2001–2014: 35 boxes.
- Brampton Wood (Wildlife Trust Nature Reserve) (52°19'N, 0°16'W): 132 ha; 1993–2014: 22 boxes.
- Wennington Wood (private woodland) (52°23'N, 0°10'W): 72 ha; 1993–1999: 21 boxes; 2000–2014: 35 boxes.

## Data collection and processing
- Inspection frequency: approximately weekly during the laying period (from late March), to determine first egg dates by counting backwards from observed eggs (one egg per day).
- Inclusion criteria: nests active at observation (at least one more egg to be laid); only first breeding attempts included (replacement clutches/second broods excluded).
- Data file: GTBTfirsteggdates.CSV (Unicode), 39.4 KB; single Minitab worksheet saved as CSV.

## Data structure and fields
- Column 1: Species code (1 = Great Tit; 2 = Blue Tit)
- Column 2: Site (1 = Monks Wood; 2 = Brampton Wood; 3 = Wennington Wood)
- Column 3: Year number (Year 1 = 1993 to Year 22 = 2014)
- Column 4: Nest box identifier (note: Monks Wood boxes 23–30 do not exist)
- Column 5: First egg date (April 1 = 1); March dates appear as negative values (rare: 3 instances in Year 5)
- Column 6: Sample size (N) for clutches per year

## Quality control
- Field data collected by trained personnel; cross-checked against original paper records.
- Data lines checked; values screened for outliers.
- Individual egg dates validated against yearly means per site to ensure accuracy.

## Data use and monitoring relevance
- Provides standardized, site- and year-comparable phenology data to monitor environmental health and climate-related phenological shifts.
- Part of a larger ongoing study on habitat, landscape factors, and avian breeding success, enabling cross-site and temporal analyses.
- Data management practices aligned with broader monitoring goals: quality assurance, clear documentation, and prepared formats for storage and portal access to support broader data sharing and reuse.
