# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Focus: Soil and vegetation data from the Rigg Foot (Sourhope) site, highlighting Block 4 and Block 5 auger and profile analyses, plus ECOTRON context and associated vegetation surveys.
- Purpose for GIS: Baseline, spatially referenced soil-vegetation observations suitable for map-based data products and cross-site comparisons within the Sourhope ECN framework.

## Overview of datasets and scope

- Datasets cover:
  - Block 4 auger samples (4A–4F) with complete soil-chemistry metrics.
  - Block 5 soil profile and auger sample data (profile horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; horizon-specific chemistry).
  - Block 5 vegetation surveys across plots (5A–5F) and subplots.
  - ECOTRON plots (soil chemistry and vegetation) for long-term context.
- Data are associated with MLURI barcodes and sample identifiers; some profiles include grid references and horizon descriptions.

  - LOI: ~14.60–17.96
  - pH(H2O): ~4.45–4.82
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.64–4.53
- Notes on data quality: Data for Block 4 augers are presented per sub-sample with minor variability; values indicate acidic, organic-rich surface horizons with modest base saturation.

## Block 5: Soil and vegetation data

- Site details and profile description:
  - Site: Rigg Foot, Sourhope; Block 5 coordinates: grid NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; soil drainage: imperfect; major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying.
  - Profile horizons (depths in cm): FH (0–1), H (1–7), Ah (7–25), AB (25–35), Bg (35–49), BCg (49–70), Cg (70–100).
  - Horizon descriptions: from highly organic FH to grey AB and variably mottled Bg/BCg transitioning to Cg.
- Block 5 auger data (5A–5F) — selected chemistry highlights:
  - %N: variable across horizons; FH ~0.58–2.17%; Ah higher in Ah horizons; Na typically low or not detected in deeper horizons.
  - %C: very high in surface FH/H (e.g., FH ~33–34%, Ah ~9–33%), decreasing with depth (Cg ~0.12–0.43%).
  - C:N Ratio: range ~10–16 across horizons and sub-samples.
  - Ca, Na, K, Mg: Measured in meq/100 g with notable horizon- and block-specific variation (e.g., Ca from ~0.35 to ~5.08; Na often near or at zero in several horizons; Mg up to ~5.92).
  - %Moisture loss and %LOI: wide range by horizon (Moisture loss ~2.79–9.43; LOI ~4.83–67.00), indicating variable organic matter content.
  - pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2): generally acidic (pH H2O ~4.3–5.2; CaCl2 ~3.53–4.48), with deeper horizons often more acidic.
- Block 5 auger analyses (5A–5F) — summarized:
  - Across horizons, considerable depth-related changes in C, N, LOI, and exchangeable cations.
  - Notable high LOI in surface horizons (organic-rich layers) and variable Ca/Mg with depth.
- Block 5 vegetation data (plots 5A–5F):
  - Subplots A–F within each plot reported species totals and counts; richness and composition show variation by subplot, reflecting microtopography and soil variability.
  - Data provide counts of species totals per subplot, enabling GIS-based mapping of species presence and richness at plot/subplot resolution.
- Block 5 soil profile (5A–5F) and auger data summary:
  - Presents horizon-by-horizon chemistry aligned with the described soil profile, enabling vertical integration in GIS (3D soil layers by horizon with associated chemistry).

## ECOTRON site context

- ECOTRON SOIL SITE and ECOTRON PLOT data:
  - Soil analyses (Block ECOTRON PLOT 1) include weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, and pH measures.
  - Example: Wt ~6.089 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76 meq/100 g; Mg ~1.7 meq/100 g; LOI ~17.42; pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT) data show subplot-level counts and species totals, with partial data placeholders, supporting cross-site comparison within the Micronet/ECN framework.

## Vegetation data: overview and interpretation

- Block 4 vegetation data (plots 4A–4F) and Block 5 vegetation data (plots 5A–5F) provide species presence totals and abundance indicators at sub-plot scales.
- Dominant and indicator species vary by plot and microhabitat, reflecting moisture gradients, soil chemistry, and organic matter content.
- The ECOTRON vegetation data offer a baseline comparison for long-term monitoring and GIS-based landscape-level analyses.

## Data accessibility and GIS considerations

- Data are organized with sample identifiers (MLURI barcodes), block/plot/subplot designations, and horizon-level measurements, facilitating GIS integration.
- Coordinates, grid references, and horizon descriptions enable the creation of layered map products (soil properties by depth, horizon-based chemistry, and vegetation distribution).
- Limitations and caveats:
  - Some datasets are partial or contain placeholders in the transcription, so users should treat certain subplot totals as indicative.
  - Historical baseline data (circa 1998–2003); for current GIS analyses, integrate with newer site updates where available.
- Appendices and detailed tables (block-level data, soil profiles, and horizon-by-horizon chemistry) support spatial comparisons and GIS-based data products.
