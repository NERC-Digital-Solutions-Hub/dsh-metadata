# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focusing on above-ground biomass, plant community composition, and diversity in relation to soil biodiversity and ecosystem processes.
  - Site designed to link below-ground biodiversity with above-ground plant communities; monitoring ongoing since 1998 with long-term data collection planned.

- Experimental design and data framework
  - Rigg Foot Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots with random treatment allocation, subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used by research groups.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA). Treatments applied annually (spring) or after mowing as specified.
  - Site-level management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide applied post-mowing in relevant plots; nutrient amendments (N and/or lime) added according to scheme.
  - Data collected (since 1999): weather data (on-site Automatic Weather Station), above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 sub-samples, baseline botanical surveys, periodic point analysis (0.5 m2 cell with 25-point grid), soil pH at 5 cm, soil moisture, and broader species lists including bryophytes. Additional field surveys and biomass sampling conducted by various projects.

- Key results and trends (2002 data emphasized)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and lime together yield the highest above-ground biomass; fertilised plots outperform unfertilised ones; biomass across most treatments declined in 2002 relative to 2001, with the strongest declines in Control 2 plots.
    - Across years, productivity generally increased from 1999 baseline, but slope-related (block) effects showed lower productivity at higher elevations on the downslope gradient.
  - Soil properties and their link to productivity
    - Lime raised soil pH markedly toward ~7.0 in treated plots; nitrogen also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Positive correlation between higher soil pH and productivity across treatments, though the relationship varied within treatments (pH–biomass link strongest when considering all plots; more complex when dissected by treatment).
    - Negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH; high pH plots often drier, affecting growth under dry periods.
  - Plant community composition and functional groups
    - Mowing (site management) reduces Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis significantly since 2000, suggesting a site-level factor beyond individual treatments (likely mowing regime and disturbance pattern). Festuca rubra expands in fertile plots.
    - Stress-tolerant species increase across most treatments, especially unfertilised plots, possibly due to reduced disturbance and nutrient dynamics.
    - CSR-based functional shifts: fertilised plots (N and lime) move toward competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) groups; stress-tolerators dominate unimproved plots; SR/CSR groups decline with strong lime/noise-insecticide impacts.
  - Species diversity and abundance
    - Shannon Diversity Index declined in nitrogen-and-lime plots since 1998 (about 15%), while increases of 2–29% occurred in other treatments over the same period.
    - Point analysis shows dominance shifts: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more common in improved plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum dominate unimproved plots; bryophytes (especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increasingly abundant across the site (bryophyte hits rose from 6.5% in 2000 to ~19.9% in 2002).
    - Bryophyte expansion correlated with regular mowing and reduced grazing; mosses increasingly contribute to total vegetation, especially in unimproved plots.
  - Insecticide effects
    - The insecticide (Dursban 4) plots show complex effects on diversity; while evidence hints that herbivore reduction could foster certain palatable species, the data do not allow a definitive causal link between insecticide use and higher diversity.
  - Trampling and plot-specific disturbances
    - 2002 C2 plots (late-phase sampling) showed notable productivity reductions likely due to trampling during intense 13CO2 pulse activities, illustrating a disturbance effect separate from mowing and chemical treatments.

- Data and interpretation in a governance context (for Data Leaders)
  - Longitudinal data integrity: multi-year, multi-plot design with consistent data streams (biomass, soil chemistry, moisture, species presence, bryophytes), enabling cross-year trend analyses and treatment interactions.
  - Data granularity and metadata: detailed treatment schedules, mowing regimes, application dates, and site-specific geography (downslope blocks) documented; extensive appendices listing species and sampling methods support reproducibility and re-use.
  - Cross-functional data integration: linking above-ground plant data with below-ground biodiversity themes, soil chemistry, and microhabitat conditions; potential for cross-project data sharing and harmonization across networks studying soil biota and plant interfaces.
  - Gaps and constraints: some plots (e.g., Control 2) had limited survey coverage in earlier years; insecticide effects are not conclusively causal due to variable application and ecological complexity; environmental disturbances (mowing, trampling) interact with multiple data layers requiring careful attribution.
  - Practical implications for data systems: need for consistent projections of pH, moisture, and biomass data; robust handling of functional-group classifications (CSR framework) across years; codified protocols for bryophyte and moss data in point analysis pipelines; clear documentation of data lineage for cross-project analyses.

- Concluding insights
  - The Sourhope site demonstrates clear, trackable responses of plant productivity and community structure to mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments, with notable shifts toward stress-tolerant and CSR-type species under certain regimes.
  - Regular mowing and nutrient amendments strongly shape both biomass outcomes and species composition, with lime-driven pH increases linked to productivity patterns and potential moisture-stress effects.
  - Bryophyte proliferation and shifts in dominant grasses reflect changes in disturbance regime and nutrient status, underscoring complex above- and below-ground feedbacks that data leaders should consider in planning integrated data strategies and cross-network data sharing.
