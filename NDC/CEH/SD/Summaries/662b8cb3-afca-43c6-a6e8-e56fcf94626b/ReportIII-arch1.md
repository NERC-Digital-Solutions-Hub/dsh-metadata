# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; field experiment at Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Baseline context and broad monitoring described in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Aim: provide a context for detailed studies, enabling cross-year comparisons and linkage with other data.
- 2001 site events:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited access; sampling followed a strict protocol during restrictions.
  - Change of officer in charge (May 2001) but core management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurement, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall for 2001 near long-term average; total radiation similar to previous years.
- Slightly reduced average temperatures and somewhat higher soil moisture content than prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass markedly higher than 2000, likely due to a combination of staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Normalising biomass to the C1 (control) treatment showed: nitrogen and/or lime additions boosted biomass; nitrogen plus lime had the strongest effect.
- ANOVA on 2001 biomass (log-transformed) showed:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences across blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise soil pH (upper 5 cm) to:
  - 6.19 in limed plots.
  - 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots.
- Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots’ mean pH remained close to baseline (1998) values.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 point quadrat surveys showed:
  - 58% more hits in 2001 than 2000, across all treatments, indicating greater sward density (likely from past grazing cessation in 1998).
  - Treatment-specific shifts in dominant species:
    - Agrostis capillaris decreased across all treatments in 2001.
    - Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra increased across treatments, most pronounced in fertilised plots.
    - Fertilised plots (especially N and/or L, and N&L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
    - Less fertile pasture-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots (Control and Biocide).
  - Species richness:
    - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible early biodiversity decline with stronger improvements.
  - Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated:
    - Clear separation between plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime and the control/biocide plots.
    - Improved plots tended to show greater association with Festuca rubra and related species.
  - Biomass vs species abundances:
    - Positive correlation between Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance and biomass.
    - Negative correlation for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, certain bryophytes with increasing biomass.
  - Litter presence increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F (slope-facing, right-hand side) contained more acidic plots than left-side columns, a pattern amplified by the higher proportion of unimproved or biocide-treated plots in those columns.
  - Underlying pH differences associated with treatment columns (notably lower pH in Nitrogen and/or Lime plots in these columns).

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Total biomass per plot shown to vary with location on the site:
  - Outlying plots with lower biomass scattered across treatments.
  - Higher biomass commonly found in more central plots (e.g., Nitrogen and Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (ANOVA).

## Summary of key trends and implications for action
- Fertilisation and liming (especially nitrogen plus lime) reliably increase above-ground biomass and shift plant communities toward species typical of improved pastures; however, this can accompany reduced species richness in heavily fertilised plots.
- Soil pH responds predictably to lime and nitrogen (lime > pH; nitrogen also raises pH modestly; control pH stable).
- 2001 data suggest management changes (staff, shift to mechanical cutting) and possibly reduced grazing pressure influenced biomass outcomes alongside the fertilizer treatments.
- Biodiversity indicators (species richness and composition) show identifiable shifts with treatments, with a potential early move toward less diverse but more productive swards in improved plots.
- Site heterogeneity is a significant factor: pH and biomass correlate with spatial location; robust experimental design should continue to account for this spatial structure (blocking, site columns) when interpreting treatment effects.
- For decision-making, actions increasing soil fertility can boost productivity and alter species composition toward favoured pasture species, but potential biodiversity trade-offs and site-specific responses should be considered. Access to standardized, well-documented datasets and metadata (as in this study) is crucial for cross-year and cross-site analyses.
