# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The report presents multi-year monitoring results from the Sourhope field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on providing context for other groups and enabling year-to-year comparisons.
- It documents the protocol, management, and results for key environmental health measures including weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with attention to site heterogeneity and management constraints.

## Purpose, scope and monitoring design
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope with a baseline data survey and prescribed broad monitoring to contextualize detailed studies.
- Measurements and dates summarized to facilitate cross-year comparisons (References to Table 1 and described measurement programs).
- Monitoring suite includes automatic weather data, above-ground biomass harvesting, soil pH measurements, and Point Quadrat botanical surveys, plus additional vegetation surveys and biomass assessments.
- In 2001, site management and governance changes occurred: government restrictions during Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) limited site access; shift in site officer; some management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) continued under a revised site plan.

## Data collection, methods and analysis
- Weather: Automatic Weather Station continuously monitored; headline measures reported for 1999–2001 (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture).
- Above-ground biomass: Annual biomass estimated through five summer harvests per plot (May–Sept); biomass data log transformed and analyzed (split-plot ANOVA) to test treatment effects; 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, partly attributed to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Soil pH: Soil pH measured in surface 0–5 cm; lime application raised pH notably; nitrogen (N) treatment also increased pH to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline pH.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) used to assess species composition; 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved (N and/or lime) plots; shifts in species abundance observed with treatments (e.g., decline of Agrostis capillaris; rise of Festuca spp, Poa pratensis in fertilised plots); PCA indicates clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; biomass correlates with shifts in species abundances (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis positively correlated; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta less so as biomass increases); increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots implies faster turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterning: Observations of differing soil pH and biomass across site columns; central plots tended to have higher biomass; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; some lateral heterogeneity (e.g., columns E and F more acidic in 2000/2001).

## Key findings by measurement domain
- Weather (2001): rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slight drop in average temperatures; higher soil moisture than previous year.
- Above-ground biomass: consistent treatment hierarchy across years; 2001 showed substantial biomass increases relative to prior years, linked to operational changes; nitrogen and/or lime treatments generally yielded higher biomass, with N+L most effective.
- Soil pH: liming raised pH to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N+L plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less so; control plots remained near baseline since 1998.
- Botanical composition: 2001 shows ongoing shifts consistent with treatment effects; increased density in fertilised/improved plots; diversity slightly reduced in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in N+L); dominant species and their relative abundances shift in response to nutrient and liming treatments; evidence from PCA supporting treatment-driven community composition changes.
- Site heterogeneity: noticeable spatial variation in pH and biomass linked to column location; strong pH–biomass relationship across the site.

## Site management impacts and constraints
- FMD outbreak in early 2001 caused restricted site access (no visitors Feb–May 2001); operational protocol and governance adjustments allowed continued data collection under controlled conditions.
- Change of officer in charge in 2001; some timing adjustments in management activities (e.g., initial biocide application in May 2001 missed, subsequent applications completed).

## Data collection cadence and data management notes
- Table 1 documents the schedule and scale of data collection activities (1998–2001) including soil sampling, measurements, and other inputs.
- Weather data were regularly downloaded and transmitted to CEH Merlewood for data management.
- The report emphasizes standardization of measurements and the aim to facilitate cross-group comparisons across years, reflecting a monitoring framework oriented toward transparency, data quality, and comparability.

## Implications for monitoring practice
- Integrated, multi-parameter monitoring with consistent protocols enables detection of treatment effects on productivity and plant community dynamics across years.
- Clear relationships emerge between soil fertility management (lime and nitrogen), soil pH, biomass production, and plant community composition.
- Spatial heterogeneity within field sites must be accounted for in analysis and interpretation; site-specific factors can influence responses to treatments.
- External management constraints (e.g., disease outbreaks, personnel changes) can impact data collection and require adaptable governance and documentation to maintain data integrity.
- The combination of biomass, soil chemistry, and detailed vegetation surveys provides a robust framework for evaluating environmental health measures and informing policy-relevant decisions.
