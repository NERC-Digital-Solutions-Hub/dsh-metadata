# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

- Four years of intensive study at Sourhope focused on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity within a controlled field experiment.
- Primary management factors driving botanical change: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application; trampling events also noted.
- Data are collected and stored to support monitoring of environmental health and policy relevance, with ongoing efforts to increase data value and accessibility.

## Aims and Scope

- Demonstrate environmental condition in a consistent format over time to scrutinise environmental health and policy performance.
- Track how standardised management practices influence vegetation productivity, composition, and functional structure.
- Use findings to understand how above- and below-ground interactions respond to management and disturbance.

## Site Management and Treatments

- Location: Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders; 5 replicate blocks on downslope gradient with randomized main plots and 0.5 m x 0.5 m sub-plots.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA); site-wide mowing to ~6 cm; lime and/or nitrogen applied in spring; insecticide applied after mowing.
- Timeframe: Treatments applied annually since 1999; baseline 1998; data collected through 2002.

## Data Collection and Monitoring (Methods)

- Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station recording temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture.
- Productivity: Above-ground biomass from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells per subplot; plants harvested, dried, weighed after each mowing.
- Vegetation surveys: Baseline 1998 (25-point quadrat) and annual point analyses (2000–2002) using a 100-point grid; bryophyte identification expanded in 2002.
- Soil and moisture: Regular soil pH measurements (5 cm depth); theta probe for soil moisture in 2002; occasional soil and micro-site surveys.
- Data scale: 11,621 soil samples collected since the start of the programme.
- Data handling: Data organised by plots, blocks, and treatments; Appendix materials provide detailed species lists and treatment summaries.

## Key Findings

- Biomass productivity
  - Overall upward trend in biomass since 1999, with the strongest production in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - 2002 biomass lower than 2001 across several treatments; largest declines in Control 2 plots and in lower slope blocks, with Block 5 showing notable losses.
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or lime) generally more productive; combined N+L still the most productive, but signs of potential peak and moisture-nutrient interactions.

- Effects of soil pH and moisture
  - Lime raised soil pH toward 7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen also increased pH modestly.
  - Strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; drier, limed plots tended to be more productive.
  - Positive overall relationship between higher pH and biomass when aggregating all plots; within individual treatments, the pH–biomass link varied (weaker with N or Lime alone; weaker or inverted with N+L).

- Plant functional composition (CSR framework)
  - Functional groups tracked: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR.
  - Four main functional-group trends:
    - Nitrogen and Lime plots: CSR and SR/CSR species expanded, aided by higher pH and fertility.
    - Unfertilised plots: Stress-tolerant species benefited, with overall disturbance reduction from grazing removal.
    - Overall site: Stress-tolerant species expanded across most plots except where combined N and lime intensified competition.
  - Point-analysis surveys showed shifting dominance among Festuca and Agrostis grasses, with Festuca rubra rising in fertile plots and Agrostis spp. declining.

- Species diversity and bryophytes
  - Shannon diversity index: increases observed after 2000 across most treatments; 2002 shows a notable rise in several treatments but a decline in N&L relative to baseline.
  - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts): significant increase in bryophyte hits across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; bryophytes accounted for ~19.9% of hits in 2002 (up from ~11% in 2001).
  - Point analyses showed reduced relative abundance of some grasses (Agrostis spp.) and increased moss cover with mowing and reduced disturbance.

- Insecticide effects
  - Insecticide-treated plots exhibited the highest plant community diversity in several analyses, though causality with reduced herbivory is interpreted cautiously due to limited direct herbivore data.
  - Some evidence suggests that reduced herbivory allowed palatable species to persist and diversify under relatively infertile conditions.

- Trampling and disturbance
  - 2002 C2 plots (introduced for 13CO2 pulse studies) showed depressed productivity, likely due to trampling during intense sampling and pulse administration.

- Community structure and ordination
  - PCA and treatment-discriminant patterns indicate lime-treated plots form a distinct cluster; some nitrogen-treated plots cluster with limed plots, while others align with controls or insecticide plots.
  - Bryophyte responses and shifts in dominant vascular species underscore the balance between disturbance, fertility, and moisture regimes.

## Implications for Monitoring and Data Use

- The monitoring approach demonstrates how standardised, repeated measurements enable cross-year comparisons of environmental health and management outcomes.
- Challenges remain in increasing the value of datasets by combining site data with external data sources and ensuring broad access to underlying data for reuse by other researchers and stakeholders.
- The Sourhope site data provide a rich, longitudinal resource for evaluating management scenarios (grazing exclusion, mowing, fertilisation, pest control) and their ecological consequences on plant communities and ecosystem function.

## Endnotes and Access

- The dataset includes comprehensive treatment details, species lists, and time-series biomass and biodiversity data (Appendices 1–8).
- For collaborators, the site offers a model framework for long-term environmental monitoring, with explicit documentation of methods and treatment regimes to support reproducibility and comparative analyses.
