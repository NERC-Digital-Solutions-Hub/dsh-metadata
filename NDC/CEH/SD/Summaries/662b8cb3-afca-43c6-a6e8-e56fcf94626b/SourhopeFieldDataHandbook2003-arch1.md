# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Overview of Block 4 profile
  - Horizon sequence from 0 cm to 95 cm: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm)
  - Soils described as fibrous, moist, with no identifiable mineral grains in surface horizons; progressively mineral soil in deeper horizons
  - Notable inclusion of many very fine fibrous roots in upper horizons and abundant igneous stones (andesite) throughout profile
  - Slightly to moderately structured horizons, with boundary transitions described as sharp or wavy

- Block 4 soil profile descriptions (by horizons)

  - H (4–8 cm): Black color; amorphous; moist; weak blocky structure; dense fibrous roots
  - Ah (8–29 cm): Dark reddish-brown, sandy silt loam; strong fibrous root presence; many small igneous stones; sharp smooth boundary
  - Abg (29–40 cm): Pinkish grey with mottling; coarse sandy loam; moderate structure; abundant very fine roots; many igneous stones
  - B sg (40–61 cm): Brown; sandy silt loam; angular blocky to platy structure; many very fine roots; many igneous stones
  - C gx (61–95 cm): Reddish brown to brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; few roots; common medium igneous stones

- Soil chemical and physical characteristics (Block 4 profile)
  - Overall: acidic to slightly acidic pH; high organic content in surface horizons; notable variation by horizon
  - %N: FH 1.88, H 2.14, Ah 0.42, AB 0.12, Bs 0.08, Cx 0.02
  - %C: FH 38.12, H 32.25, Ah 6.41, AB 1.77, Bs 1.04, Cx 0.27
  - C:N ratio: FH 20.24, H 15.10, Ah 15.30, AB 14.73, Bs 12.64, Cx 12.43
  - Ca (meq/100g): FH 10.05, H 7.08, Ah 0.92, AB 0.36, Bs 0.59, Cx 0.34
  - K (meq/100g): FH 3.41, H 2.73, Ah 0.53, AB 0.07, Bs 0.12, Cx 0.19
  - Mg (meq/100g): FH 4.48, H 3.35, Ah 0.33, AB 0.13, Bs 0.25, Cx 0.26
  - %Moisture loss: FH 8.94, H 10.09, Ah 4.77, AB 4.93, Bs 6.80, Cx 4.11
  - %Loss on Ignition (LOI): FH 73.26, H 63.99, Ah 14.59, AB 8.24, Bs 8.00, Cx 4.47
  - pH (H2O): FH 4.76, H 4.94, Ah 4.57, AB 5.05, Bs 4.80, Cx 5.02
  - pH (CaCl2): FH 4.01, H 4.19, Ah 3.95, AB 4.09, Bs 3.94, Cx 3.88
  - Summary: surface horizons are organic-rich and highly acidic; deeper horizons show lower LOI and variable but generally acidic pH with limited Ca and Mg, reflecting soil weathering on igneous bedrock with substantial rock fragments
  
- Auger sampling (Block 4 auger samples)
  - Horizon-scale measures across 4A–4F show: %N ~0.56–0.58; %C ~6.80–8.02; C:N ~12.62–14.26
  - Ca (meq/100g) ~1.11–2.96; Mg (meq/100g) ~0.67–1.59; K (meq/100g) ~0.58–0.81
  - %Moisture loss ~4.46–5.15; LOI ~15–18% for some sub-samples; higher LOI in FH/upper horizons
  - pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.93; pH(CaCl2) ~3.53–4.14
  - Indication of acidic, nutrient-poor mineral horizons beneath organic-rich surface
  
- Vegetation survey (Block 4)
  - 25 species recorded across plots; Agrostis capillaris and Festuca spp. among dominants; Nardus and associated dry grassland communities indicated
  - Species distribution patterns influenced by moisture and micro-topography; edge vs interior plot differences observed; indicator species include Festuca ovina, Ranunculus repens, Deschampsia flexuosa, Holcus mollis

- ECOTRON plot data (Block 4 ECOTRON)
  - Soil: %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100g; Mg 1.7 meq/100g; K 0.62 meq/100g; moisture loss 4.79; LOI 17.42; pH(H2O) 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82
  - Vegetation: diverse herbaceous assemblage with modest shrub presence; Gs Hm Je Lm Lzm Mc among recorded functional groups (plot-level totals shown in data)

- Data provenance and notes
  - Block 4 data include detailed horizon descriptions, chemical analyses, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys
  - MLURI barcodes accompany samples; data intended for long-term biodiversity and soil-vegetation relationship studies
  - Emphasis on reproducibility, metadata, and making datasets discoverable

- Relevance for analysis
  - Clear vertical differentiation in soil chemistry and organic content linked to horizon depth and rock fragment content
  - Strong acidity and high organic matter in surface horizons, with rapid LOI decline with depth
  - Vegetation patterns aligned with micro-topography and soil chemistry, enabling correlations between soil variables (C, N, LOI, Ca, Mg, pH) and species composition
  - Data framework supports comparisons with Block 5 and ECOTRON plots to study spatial variation and long-term soil-vegetation interactions
