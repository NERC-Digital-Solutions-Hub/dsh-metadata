# SUMMARY

- The report documents four years of monitoring at the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme site at Sourhope, focusing on how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments affect above-ground productivity (biomass), plant composition, and diversity within a controlled grassland experiment.
- It integrates above- and below-ground biodiversity themes by tracking productivity, species composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional plant groups (CSR framework).

## Study Context and Aims
- Objective: Understand links between soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities, including feedbacks between management and plant functional traits.
- Baseline site: previously described as Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland (NVC U4d); fenced from grazing in 1998 with a mowing regime and five prescribed treatments (fertilised vs unfertilised, with/without lime) and an insecticide treatment.
- Emphasis on how management (mowing, fertilisation, liming, insecticide) shifts productivity, species composition, and functional traits over time.

## Site and Treatments
- Experimental design: Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots. Treatments allocated randomly.
- Treatments (plot-level): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (NH4NO3)
  - Lime (CaCO3)
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; pesticide)
- Site management: mowing every May–Sept to ≈6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime; detailed annual dates provided.
- Data collection framework: 0.5 m2 sampling cells in sub-plots S, T, U, V for biomass; 0.5 m2 baseline and annual point quadrats; bryophyte identification; soil pH and moisture; weather station data; additional small-scale surveys and biomass sorting.

## Data Collected and Methods
- Weather and environmental data: Continuous measurements from on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture).
- Above-ground biomass: Harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells, dried and weighed; annual totals computed; multi-year trend tracked (1999–2002).
- Vegetation surveys: Baseline (1998) and annual 0.5 m2 point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using a 100-hole grid with 25 points recorded per plot; bryophytes identified to species in 2002; soil moisture measured at the botanical survey cells; soil pH measured yearly (and at point-analysis cells in 2002).
- Additional data: Species lists (Appendix 3), biomass tables (Appendices 6–7), and PCA analyses (Appendix 5–8) to explore community structure and treatment effects.
- Activity notes: Phase I fieldwork largely complete by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with labelled CO2 pulses and gas measurements conducted; data collection impacted by foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001.

## Key Findings: 2002 Results (3.x sections)
- Biomass productivity (3.2)
  - A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments persisted; however, mid-summer biomass declined in several treatments in 2002 versus 2001.
  - Nitrogen and lime (especially in combination) strongly boosted productivity; Control 2 plots underperformed relative to others.
  - An adverse slope effect: Block 5 showed the largest declines in biomass; Block 1 at the bottom of the slope showed the largest percentage reductions in 2002.
  - Long-term trend: overall biomass productivity increased from 1999 to 2002 when compared with initial values, despite 2002 dips.
  - Statistical results indicate significant treatment effects and a strong year-by-treatment interaction.
- Soil-plant relationships (3.3)
  - Lime raised soil pH substantially toward 7.0 in limed plots; nitrogen had smaller positive effects on pH.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; drier plots tended to be less acidic.
  - Overall positive relationship between soil pH and biomass when pooling treatments; within some treatments, the relationship weakens or reverses (notably when both nitrogen and lime are applied).
- Point Analysis and community composition (3.4)
  - Improved pastures (N and/or lime) had higher hits for Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophyte abundance increased across the site, rising from 10.82% of hits in 2001 to 19.92% in 2002, particularly in unimproved plots.
  - Vascular plant hits show three dominant functional groups: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR); these groups accounted for 69–95% of total hits in plots, with treatment shifts over time.
  - CSR and SR/CSR dynamics: nitrogen and lime plots show expansion of C-S-R species; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant species; SR/CSR species are reduced in lime and insecticide plots.
  - Diversity indices (Shannon) increased in most treatments over time, but 2002 saw a 15% decline in Shannon diversity in the N&L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed more modest gains or larger gains (up to 29% in some insecticide-treated plots).
  - Litter and dead vegetation hits varied by year and treatment, with higher litter encounters in 2002 for several treatments.
  - PCA clustering generally separated improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct group; some nitrogen-treated samples showed similarity to limed plots.
- Trampling effect (4.4)
  - First-year sampling on C2 plots in 2002 suggests trampling during 13CO2 pulse applications reduced vegetation growth, contributing to observed productivity declines in those plots.

## Discussion: Interpreting the Patterns
- Mowing effect (4.1)
  - Reduced dominance of certain Agrostis species and increased Festuca rubra across treatments; mowing may favor stress-tolerant and moss-occupying species, leading to moss expansion and reduced vascular diversity in some plots.
  - Uniform disturbance from mowing (vs heterogeneous grazing) may favour less diverse communities and moss proliferation.
- Fertilisation effect (4.2)
  - Nitrogen and lime consistently increase productivity; lime raises pH toward 7.0, which may support faster growth but could also impose moisture stress and chlorosis in some contexts.
  - The N+L combination shows the strongest productivity gains but may be associated with reduced moisture, higher pH, and altered plant functional composition (more CSR-C-S-R species).
- Insecticide effect (4.3)
  - The insecticide (Dursban) could influence plant diversity via herbivore regulation, aligning with literature showing mixed short- vs long-term diversity responses to herbivory manipulation.
  - Although a direct causal link between reduced herbivory and higher diversity isn’t definitively established in this dataset, observed patterns echo prior studies where insect herbivory interacts with plant community composition.
- Trampling effect (4.3)
  - Short-term trampling during CO2 pulse experiments likely suppressed growth in affected plots (notably C2), illustrating how experimental activities can influence productivity measurements.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Data gaps in 2002 due to a weather station malfunction; some measurements during July–August and Oct–Nov were replaced with data from a nearby station (Konza) for specific variables.
- The trampling events and the emergence of bryophytes add complexity to interpreting year-to-year productivity and diversity signals.
- Phase II fieldwork involved additional datasets (e.g., labelled CO2 pulses, trace gas measurements) that extend the data beyond plant biomass alone.

## Implications for Data Use and Outputs
- Data products potential:
  - Time-series biomass by treatment and year, including per-cut harvest data.
  - Biomass normalization against Control plots to visualize relative treatment effects.
  - Point Analysis data by year, treatment, and functional group (S, CSR, SR/CSR); bryophyte vs vascular plant trends.
  - Diversity metrics (Shannon index) by treatment and year, with year-by-treatment comparisons.
  - Soil-plant relationships: pH and moisture vs biomass across treatments; treatment-specific pH–biomass curves.
  - PCA and cluster analyses to explore treatment-group separations and key species driving differentiation (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Agrostis spp., bryophytes).
  - Functional-group shifts mapped over time to understand how management drives CSR and related strategies.
- Key caveats for reuse:
  - Recognize the 2002 data gaps and the使用 of substitute weather data for part of the period.
  - Consider trampling effects when interpreting 2002 C2 plot productivity dips.
  - Biotic interactions (insecticide effects) are complex and not conclusively causal from this dataset alone.
