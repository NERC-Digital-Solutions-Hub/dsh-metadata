# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Presents multi-block environmental data from Sourhope Field Site, focusing on soil chemistry, soil profiles, moisture, loss on ignition, pH, and vegetation surveys.
- Data are organized by blocks (e.g., Block 4, Block 5) and include auger samples, horizon descriptions, and archived samples.
- Aimed at long-term monitoring of soil-plant biodiversity and ecosystem responses to management variables; data are catalogued with MLURI barcodes and archived for reuse.

## Block 4: Auger Samples – Key Soil Chemistry Data
- Samples: Block 4 auger cores labeled 4A–4F with individual measurements.
- Moisture and organic matter indicators:
  - %Moisture loss ranged approximately 4.29–5.15%.
  - %Loss on Ignition (LOI) ranged roughly 14.60–17.96%.
- Nutrient and elemental composition (per sample):
  - %N clustered around 0.51–0.58%.
  - %C ranged from about 6.80–8.02%.
  - C:N ratios generally between 12.6 and 14.3.
  - Calcium (Ca) mostly 1.01–2.96 meq/100g; Sodium (Na) ~0.12–0.15 meq/100g.
  - Potassium (K) ~0.58–0.81 meq/100g; Magnesium (Mg) ~0.58–1.59 meq/100g.
- Acidity and pH:
  - pH(H2O) values generally around 4.45–4.82.
  - pH(CaCl2) values around 3.64–4.05.
- Texture and depth context:
  - Data collected as part of horizon- or plot-scale analyses to relate soil chemistry to vegetation in a limed/nitrogened experimental setup.

## Block 4: Vegetation Data – Plot/Species Totals
- Vegetation surveys for Plot 4A–4F (subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc.) show presence/absence and counts of key species across subplots.
- Dominant taxa repeatedly observed include Festuca, Agrostis, Nardus, Deschampsia, and various mosses/forbs; community composition varies with microtopography and moisture differences within blocks.
- Species totals and per-subplot tallies indicate substantial across-plot biodiversity with block-level patterns linked to microclimate and soil conditions.

## Block 5: Soil and Vegetation Data
- Site details for Block 5 include grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series (Brown forest soil with gleying), parent material, and profile pit data.
- Soil profile (0–100 cm) describes horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with horizon-specific textures, colours, mottling, structure, roots, and stone content.
- Block 5 auger samples (5A–5F) provide comprehensive chemical data:
  - %N ranges ~0.53–0.62%; %C ~7.0–9.0%; C:N ratios ~10.2–14.74.
  - Ca values from ~2.58–5.08 meq/100g; Na values often below detectable limits; K values ~0.53–0.83; Mg values ~1.51–3.50 meq/100g.
  - %Moisture loss varies by horizon, typically ~2.8–9.4%.
  - %LOI around 4–20% depending on horizon and sample.
  - pH(H2O) generally between ~4.34 and ~4.93; pH(CaCl2) between ~3.53 and ~4.14.
- Vegetation data for Block 5 (Plot 5A–5F) shows per-subplot species counts and totals, highlighting diverse upland grassland communities and varying species richness across plots.
- Lot-specific MLURI barcodes accompany each sample for traceability and future re-analysis.

## ECOTRON Soil Site
- ECOTRON PLOT soil analysis (Plot 1):
  - Wt ≈ 6.089 mg; %N 0.59%; %C 8.22%; C:N 13.83.
  - Ca 2.76 meq/100g; Na 0.15; K 0.62; Mg 1.7 meq/100g.
  - %Moisture loss 4.79%; %LOI 17.42%.
  - pH(H2O) 4.79; pH(CaCl2) 3.82.
- ECOTRON vegetation survey records counts of species across subplots A–F, with totals per subplot showing a mix of grasses and forbs typical of upland meadow ecosystems.

## Data Management and Outputs
- Data are collected using standardized methods (auger cores, horizon profiling, vegetation quadrats) and QA processes.
- Outputs include soil chemical profiles by horizon, plot-level vegetation lists, Twinspan/NVC-style classifications, and cross-plot comparisons.
- Datasets are stored within MLURI systems; soil samples archived at CEH Merlewood; accompanying documentation includes site-wide and block-level summaries to support cross-site analysis and policy-relevant reporting.

## Practical Implications for Environmental Analysis
- The Sourhope site provides a multi-block, long-term framework to assess how soil chemistry and vegetation respond to management/influence factors (e.g., liming, nitrogen).
- The combination of detailed horizon-scale soil data with vegetation surveys enables linking soil properties to plant community structure and ecosystem function.
- Data are designed for reuse and cross-site synthesis within environmental monitoring programs, supporting trend detection and policy evaluation.

## Key Takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- The dataset demonstrates rigorous, long-term monitoring of soil-plant biodiversity across multiple blocks with standardized sampling and thorough data management.
- Soil matrices (pH, LOI, C/N, nutrient cations) and moisture metrics are consistently measured across horizons, enabling robust temporal and spatial comparisons.
- Vegetation data provide community- and species-level insights aligned with soil chemistry, supporting interpretation of environmental health and the impact of management practices.
- Archiving and cross-referencing with MLURI CEH resources ensure data accessibility, reuse, and potential cross-site synthesis for policy-informed environmental monitoring.
