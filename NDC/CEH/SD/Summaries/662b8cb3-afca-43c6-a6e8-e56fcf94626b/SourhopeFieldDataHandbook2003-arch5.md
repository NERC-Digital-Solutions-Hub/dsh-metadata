# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Purpose and scope
- Documents the Sourhope field site data used by the Soil Biodiversity Programme and related networks (ECN baseline, SERAD Micronet).
- Data collected from 1998 onward to support long-term ecological studies and cross-project collaborations.
- Includes soil profiles, soil chemistry, auger samples, vegetation surveys, and ecotron-related data, with documentation designed for reproducibility and cross-study integration.

## Data collected and structure (focus areas in this chunk)
- Block 4 and Block 5 soil profiles
  - Horizon descriptions with depths, color, texture, structure, moisture, roots, and boundary types (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx, etc.).
  - Detailed profile pits (depths from 0 to >100 cm) and horizon-specific notes.
- Soil chemical analyses
  - Horizon-level measurements: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (4A–4F, 5A–5F) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Weights of samples (mg) linked to specific horizons or auger samples.
  - MLURI barcodes for traceability and provenance.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot- and subplot-level species presence/absence and totals; coded species abbreviations (Acp, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc.).
  - Block-level summaries (e.g., totals per subplot) and species counts by horizon/plot.
- ECOTRON and related datasets
  - ECOTRON PLOT soil analysis and vegetation survey data as parallel components to near-field data.
- Site details (Block 5)
  - Grid reference, altitude, slope, soil drainage, soil series, parent material, and rock type.
  - Horizon sequences and descriptive notes for Block 5 profiles (Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).

## Data collection methods
- Soil profiles and horizons
  - Field horizon descriptions documented with depth intervals and boundary types.
  - Physical soil descriptions include color, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), structure, moisture, roots, and presence of stones.
- Chemical analyses
  - Horizon-specific laboratory measurements of carbon, nitrogen, cation chemistry, moisture loss, LOI, and pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Auger sampling and separate pit samples with parallel analyses to provide depth-resolved data.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot and subplot level surveys capturing species presence/absence and counts, using standardized codes.
- Provenance and archiving
  - Each sample linked to MLURI barcodes; data recorded in field notebooks and lab analyses; samples archived for long-term storage.

## Provenance, archiving, and data availability
- Data provenance linked through MLURI barcodes (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; 6039XX series).
- Sample weights and chemical values tied to horizon-specific records, enabling traceability from field collection to laboratory results.
- ECOTRON and broader ECN/SERAD Micronet contexts noted, indicating data sharing and integration within larger long-term networks.

## Data quality, completeness, and limitations
- The dataset contains horizon-specific measurements with some missing values in certain horizons or plots (e.g., Na values not always reported for all horizons).
- Some plots/horizons are described in detail while others have partial data, reflecting field-collection realities and the long-term nature of the study.
- Vegetation data show many empty fields or incomplete subplot records, emphasizing baseline/descriptive status and the need for careful cross-block comparisons.
- Overall, data are documentation-rich and designed for reproducibility, but users should be mindful of incomplete coverage and potential variability in management history (e.g., grazing) when performing analyses.

## Data governance, management, and stewardship implications
- Metadata and standardization
  - Use consistent horizon naming conventions, color/mottle descriptions, and texture classifications to ensure interoperability.
  - Maintain comprehensive data dictionaries for species codes, horizon abbreviations, and measurement units.
- Provenance and traceability
  - Preserve MLURI barcodes and ensure end-to-end traceability from field horizons to lab results and final data outputs.
  - Document measurement methods, instruments, and calibration where applicable.
- Data quality assurance
  - Implement data quality checks for missing values, outliers, and horizon-depth consistency.
  - Provide transparent gap handling procedures and indicate baseline/descriptive intent in metadata.
- Archiving and long-term accessibility
  - Ensure long-term storage of both raw and processed data, including soil samples and horizon data.
  - Link data to ECN/SERAD Micronet repositories where appropriate to support cross-study reuse.
- Interoperability and standards
  - Align with broader soil and vegetation datasets by preserving units and methods, and mapping to standard classifications (e.g., soil series, vegetation classifications).
  - Consider persistent identifiers for plots, horizons, and samples to enhance discoverability and reuse.
- Actionable improvements for stewardship
  - Expand complete subplot sampling or document robust imputation/estimation strategies.
  - Curate comprehensive metadata for blocks, plots, horizons, and sampling events; maintain data dictionaries and crosswalks to external repositories.
  - Implement a formal data management plan for ongoing updates, reincorporation of future data, and version control.

## Takeaways for Data Stewards
- The Sourhope dataset embodies rigorous, multi-scale data collection with detailed documentation and archiving, supporting long-term ecological insights.
- It highlights common data governance challenges in field-based long-term datasets: incomplete data coverage, variability in site management, and the critical need for robust metadata, standardized vocabularies, and durable archiving to enable discovery, reuse, and interoperability.
