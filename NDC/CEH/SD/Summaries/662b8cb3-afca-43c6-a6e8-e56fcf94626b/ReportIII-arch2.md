# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment at MLURI Sourhope Farm in the Scottish Borders is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme. It provides a broad monitoring context to accompany more detailed, group-specific studies and to facilitate year-to-year comparisons.
- Timeframe and context: Monitoring spanning 1999–2001 with annual data collection across weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition; the 1998 baseline data survey is referenced for context.
- 2001 management and external factors: Government restrictions during the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak (Feb–May 2001) limited site access; subsequent sampling proceeded under protocol; first biocide application in May 2001 was missed, but other management activities (liming, N application, pH checks, biomass harvests, vegetation cutting) largely continued.

- Data and methods: 
  - Main monitoring activities include Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass harvests (five summer cuts), soil pH measurements (upper 5 cm), and Point Quadrat (July 2001) botanical surveys.
  - Analytical approaches include log-transforming biomass data for ANOVA, and Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on botanical data; surveyors’ results were checked for consistency.

Key Findings by Topic

- Automatic Weather Station (2001)
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average after a very wet prior year (1999–2000); 2001 rainfall 839 mm vs 845 mm (1999) and 1209 mm (2000).
  - Radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content modestly higher in 2001.
  - Overall weather conditions were largely unremarkable for headline measures.

- Above-ground biomass
  - Clear, consistent biomass hierarchy across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass higher than in previous years, attributed in part to personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
  - Normalising biomass against the Control 1 (C1) in each year shows sustained positive impact of nitrogen and/or lime on productivity; nitrogen and lime (N and/or L) treatments most strongly promoted biomass.
  - ANOVA results indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; year-treament interactions were significant, while block effects were not.

- Soil pH
  - Lime addition continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 pH around 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N+L plots.
  - Nitrogen addition alone also raised soil pH, though to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

- Botanical composition
  - July 2001 point quadrat survey: discovery of more 'hits' (density) than 2000 (58% higher overall).
  - No significant difference between the two surveyors in 2001, supporting data reliability.
  - Treatment-specific shifts in species composition:
    - Agrostis capillaris decreased across all treatments (except retained as most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
    - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most common in N and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and N+L (Festuca rubra) plots.
    - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were enriched in fertilised plots, particularly those receiving both nitrogen and lime.
    - Species typical of less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more prevalent in unimproved plots (Control and Biocide).
  - Diversity patterns: 24 species detected in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity loss with higher fertility.
  - PCA shows clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots display more extreme species associations, notably with Festuca rubra and related grasses.
  - Biomass correlations: higher above-ground biomass is positively correlated with relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis tends to decline as biomass increases.
  - Litter frequency increases in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

Site Heterogeneity and Spatial Patterns

- Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (right-hand slope) appeared more acidic than left-side columns; this may be amplified by higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
  - Underlying gradient of low pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots in these columns noted, suggesting interaction between treatment and site position.

- Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Outlying plots exhibit lower biomass across most treatments; central plots tend to show higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen + Lime 2E, Lime 2C, Biocide 2D, Control 1 2B).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass observed.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating limited block-level effects on the overall treatment response.

Appendix and Data Details

- Data collection events and protocols (e.g., mowing regime, 0.5 m2 quadrats, Point Quadrat with 100 cells, and litter/relative cover surveys) are documented, including years and sampling periods.
- Weather and site data (Tables 1–3) and detailed ANOVA results (Tables 4–5) support interpretation of treatment effects and year-to-year changes.
- Species codes and their abbreviations provided, enabling cross-reference of detailed botanical results (Table 6 and figures).

Conclusions and Implications for Monitoring

- Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) drives measurable changes in biomass and shifts in plant communities, with corresponding soil chemistry changes (pH increase) and altered species assemblages toward more productive grasses.
- The study confirms the value of standardized, multi-metric monitoring to discern treatment effects over time and to link above-ground productivity with underlying soil conditions and community composition.
- Site heterogeneity is an important consideration in interpreting treatment effects; spatial patterns (e.g., pH gradients, central vs edge plots) influence biomass outcomes and species distribution.
- Data quality checks (consistency between surveyors, data transformations, and robust statistical analyses) support the reliability of the monitoring outputs.
- The documented dataset offers potential for integration with other environmental datasets to enhance environmental health assessments and policy performance evaluations over time.
