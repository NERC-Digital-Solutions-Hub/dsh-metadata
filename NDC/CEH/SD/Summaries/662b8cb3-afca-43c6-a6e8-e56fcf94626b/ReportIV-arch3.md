# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview: Four years into the Sourhope field experiment at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (Scottish Borders), monitoring focuses on above-ground productivity, species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) under controlled management treatments.
- Purpose for monitoring frameworks: Demonstrates how long-term, multi-factor field experiments can reveal how management actions shape ecosystem function and biodiversity, informing policy decisions and future monitoring designs.

## Study context and design

- Location and layout: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots with 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells.
- Treatments and management: Five main plot-level treatments plus a site-wide mowing regime since 1999; treatments include Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide (Dursban 4). Treatments implemented in spring (and additional mowing cycles) with data collection aligned to mowing events.
- Experimental goals: Assess how mowing (disturbance), fertilisation (nutrient enrichment), and insecticide use (herbivore pressure) influence productivity, plant community composition, and functional plant groups.

## Data collection and indicators (monitoring framework)

- Above-ground productivity: Regular biomass sampling from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots prior to each mowing; samples dried and weighed.
- Botanical surveys:
  - Baseline and repeated point analyses using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid and multiple quadrats to track species presence and frequency.
  - Bryophyte (mosses and liverworts) identification to species level from 2002 onward.
- Soil and micro-environmental data:
  - Soil pH measurements at ~5 cm depth, 1998 baseline and 2002 re-measurement across plots; additional pH data across sub-plot centers.
  - Soil moisture via theta probe in 2002 by corner of each botanical cell; ongoing soil moisture relationships explored.
- Weather data: On-site Automatic Weather Station capturing rainfall, radiation, and temperature since 1999.
- Data management and outputs:
  - Appendices document site activity, treatment maps, species lists, biomass time series, rank analyses, and point-analysis results.
  - Outputs include figures (biomass trends, treatment comparisons), tables (ANOVA results), and PCA plots to differentiate treatment groups.

## Key findings by management treatment

- Mowing effect:
  - Consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across most treatments since 2000.
  - Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertile plots; mosses/bryophytes broadly increase across the site, with moss expansion linked to mowing height (~6 cm) and reduced disturbance from grazing.
- Fertilisation effect (N and/or lime):
  - Productivity increases in fertilised plots, especially where both nitrogen and lime are applied; productivity in these plots may have peaked, potentially due to higher soil pH (near 7.0) and reduced soil moisture.
  - Functional group shifts: stress-tolerant species decline in fertilised plots, with C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups expanding under certain nutrient/limestone conditions, influenced by soil pH and moisture.
- Insecticide effect:
  - Insecticide plots show higher Shannon diversity in some years, with bryophyte and certain vascular plant responses suggesting reduced herbivory may favor more palatable species; however, direct causation remains cautious due to lack of detailed insect control data.
- Trampling/plot-specific observations:
  - New C2 plots (introduced in 2002) show reduced productivity possibly due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments.
- Diversity and functional groups:
  - Shannon Diversity Index increases in several plots with certain treatments (notably insecticide-treated plots), but nitrogen & lime treatments show complex effects with shifts toward C-S-R and SR/C-S-R dominance.
  - PCA of point-analysis data consistently separates improved (fertilised/limed) plots from unimproved plots, with limed plots often clustering with nitrogen-treated samples.

## Data management, governance, and challenges

- Data provenance and sharing:
  - Data are tied to multiple projects within Phase I and Phase II; metadata and provenance are crucial for ensuring reuse and interpretation across studies.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is important but can be a governance barrier; clear data-sharing policies and data-management standards are essential at the data origin stage.
- Metadata and compatibility:
  - Metadata completeness and consistency are critical; some metadata gaps exist (e.g., bryophyte identification depth improved in 2002); ongoing enhancement of dataset metadata is needed for reuse and verification.
- Data quality and transformation:
  - Biomass data require transformation (log transformations for ANOVA); complex multivariate analyses (PCA, ANOVA) are used to interpret treatment effects.
- Data gaps and uncertainties:
  - Missing or degraded data in 2002 due to weather-station issues; some periods used data from nearby stations as substitutes.
  - Treatment interactions (N, Lime, Insecticide) show nuanced responses; disentangling direct vs. indirect effects requires robust, long-term monitoring and standardized protocols.

## Analytical approaches and interpretation

- Statistical methods:
  - Split-plot ANOVA to assess effects of Treatment, Year, and their interaction on above-ground biomass across four years (1999–2002).
  - PCA to explore species-habitat relationships and to separate plots by treatment in point-analysis data.
- Functional classification:
  - Plants categorized into functional groups using the CSR framework (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal) and their combinations (CSR, SR/CSR, etc.) to interpret ecological strategies under different management regimes.
  - Shifts in functional-group composition reflect changes in disturbance and nutrient regimes.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks (policy and practice)

- Long-term, multi-factor monitoring is vital to capture delayed and cumulative responses of plant communities to mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use.
- Monitoring design should ensure:
  - Randomized block structure with replicated plots and consistent mowing/management schedules.
  - Repeated, standardized surveys (biomass, point analyses) to track productivity and community composition over time.
  - Comprehensive metadata management to enable data reuse, cross-study comparisons, and transparent governance.
  - Integration of below-ground processes (soil pH, moisture, nutrient dynamics) with above-ground responses to better understand ecosystem functioning.
- Policy-relevant insights:
  - Disturbance reduction (grazing exclusion) and nutrient enrichment have pronounced and interacting effects on productivity and biodiversity; management choices should balance productivity with maintaining species diversity.
  - Data governance and accessibility barriers should be addressed to facilitate open analysis, replication, and evidence-based decision-making in environmental monitoring programs.
