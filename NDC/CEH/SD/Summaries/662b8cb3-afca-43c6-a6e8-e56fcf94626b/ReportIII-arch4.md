# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders; baseline data from 1998; aims to provide context for broader data studies and enable cross-study comparisons.
- Monitoring was prescribed across years to contextualize detailed studies; 2001 saw two management-related events: (a) FMD restrictions limited site access for several months, with protocol-driven access thereafter; (b) change of the site Officer in Charge.
- Measurement schedule and data types (e.g., weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) were established to track links between treatments and ecosystem responses.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet prior year; total radiation similar to previous years; mean temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across the growing season; peak biomass in July/August.
- 2001 saw a substantial increase in biomass vs. previous years, attributed to a combination of personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass normalized to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects; nitrogen and/or lime treatments most consistently promoted higher biomass.
- ANOVA findings: significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L) vs unimproved; significant Year × Treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Upper 5 cm soil pH increased with lime; October 2001 means: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen & Lime plots ~6.38; Nitrogen alone raised pH to a lesser extent; Control plots showed little change since 1998 baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey showed no significant surveyor-related differences; total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, indicating increased sward density (likely from past grazing removal).
- Treatment differences in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and/or Lime plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or Lime) showed more Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra; unimproved plots retained more Indicator species for poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting diversity decline with greater fertility/altered management.
- Multivariate analyses (PCA) indicated clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; biomass increases correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with higher biomass.
- Litter presence increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed more acidic conditions than columns on the left, partially explained by treatment distribution (more Controls/Biocide in those columns); underlying spatial heterogeneity suggested, particularly lower pH in nitrogen and/or lime plots in certain columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values varied by location; outlying plots tended to have lower biomass across treatments, while central plots often had higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences between blocks.

## Additional Notes
- Data collection followed standardized protocols (e.g., mowing schedules, 0.5 m2 quadrats, Point Quadrat surveys, and periodic full botanical surveys); inter-surveyor comparisons were statistically non-significant, supporting data reliability.
- Evidence supports links among soil fertility (pH via liming), vegetation composition, and above-ground biomass, with increased biomass associated with higher pH and dominance of more fertility-accommodating species.
- The FMD-related access restrictions in 2001 and staff changes are noted as contextual factors affecting site management and data collection.
