# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- A large, multi-year field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme to contextualize detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons of soil, vegetation, and management effects.

- Data types and monitoring
  - Automatic Weather Station: headline meteorological measures (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture) used to interpret site conditions.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular biomass harvests across plots, with five mowing events per year; data normalized to enable cross-year comparisons due to a change in mowing method.
  - Soil pH: upper 0–5 cm pH measurements to track liming and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (2001 protocol mirrored 2000) to track species composition and diversity; 100-cell quadrats with 25 cells sampled per survey.
  - Site management events: FMD-related access restrictions in 2001; change of site Officer in Charge in May 2001; one biocide application missed.

- Data processing and quality
  - Biomass data were log-transformed and analyzed with split-plot ANOVA; results indicate significant biomass differences between treatments and years, with a clear year-by-treatment interaction.
  - Biomass values were normalized to a control (C1) to identify persistent treatment effects despite methodological changes in mowing.
  - Inter-surveyor reliability assessed on the 2001 botanical survey; no significant difference between surveyors (NS).
  - PCA used to explore plant community shifts and to differentiate plots by treatment (improved vs unimproved).

- Key results by data type
  - Weather (2001)
    - Rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slight temperature decrease; soil moisture higher than prior years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions boost biomass; strongest effect with nitrogen plus lime.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, attributed partly to personnel change and switch to mechanical shears.
    - Biomass peaks occurred in July or August each year; significant year-by-treatment differences and a year × treatment interaction.
  - Soil pH
    - Liming raises surface pH, reaching around 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen alone also raises pH, but to a lesser degree; control plots show little pH change since 1998 baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in nitrogen+lime plots; diversity appears to decline in more improved plots.
    - Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. and Poa pratensis increase in fertilized plots.
    - Improved plots (N and/or lime) show more species associated with improved pastures; some bryophyte/drier-soil taxa become less dominant as biomass increases.
    - PCA separates improved vs unimproved plots; biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis and negatively with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
    - More litter observed in plots with N and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
    - 2001 relative abundance patterns indicate shifts in species dominance linked to treatments and biomass levels.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F tend toward more acidic conditions, likely related to slope orientation and plot composition.
    - Biomass shows a strong positive relationship with soil pH; no significant differences in biomass across blocks.

- Data limitations and context
  - 2001 FMD-related access restrictions limited site visits early in the year; subsequent work followed established protocols.
  - Personnel changes influenced data collection methods (e.g., mowing technique) and potentially biomass estimates; normalization against C1 aimed to preserve cross-year comparability.
  - Documentation and replication efforts (Point Analysis protocol, cross-checks between surveyors) support data reliability and reproducibility.

- Implications for data use and product ideas
  - The integrated dataset supports cross-year analyses of how nitrogen, lime, and their combination affect biomass, soil chemistry, and plant communities.
  - Potential data products include: time-series dashboards of biomass by treatment and year; soil pH and biomass correlation maps; PCA-based visuals of plant community shifts by treatment; plot-level metadata linking management events to data continuity.
  - Data curation recommendations: maintain detailed plot metadata (blocks, columns), track changes in measurement methods and personnel, ensure consistent species coding and units across years.
