# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Purpose and scope
  - Detailed soil profile description for Block 4 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope, including horizon-by-horizon observations from LF to Cgx depths.
  - Associated soil chemical data and physical properties collected by horizon, plus tabulated auger and laboratory analyses.
  - Part of a broader field data package that also includes Block 5 data and ECOTRON plots.

- Data types and structure
  - Soil profile descriptions by horizon with depth ranges and qualitative descriptions (grain presence, texture, roots, boundary types, moisture).
  - Horizon-level analytical data (per horizon): %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Auger samples data (Block 4): depth-specific chemical and physical properties, including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey data (per plot) showing species counts and totals for interpretation of land-cover relationships.
  - Barcoding and sample identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) linked to each horizon and auger sample for traceability.

- Sampling and methods
  - Horizon pits and auger sampling across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cxg, Cg, etc. with depths up to ~95 cm in Block 4.
  - Laboratory analyses include element concentrations, LOI, moisture loss, and pH measurements.
  - Vegetation data collected via plot surveys with species tallies and totals, providing community context to soil parameters.

- Data management and metadata
  - Sample-level metadata linked via MLURI barcodes; horizon-specific labeling and per-horizon data tables.
  - Data stored with depth-specific attributes and horizon names to enable cross-horizon comparisons.
  - Part of a broader ECN/SERAD Micronet context, enabling cross-site comparisons and long-term stewardship.

- Key soil characteristics (Block 4)
  - pH: acidity generally around 4.6–4.8 (H2O), slightly higher in CaCl2 where measured.
  - LOI: high in surface horizons (e.g., FH/H/A), indicating organic matter enrichment.
  - Major cations: Ca and Mg dominate exchange sites; Na and K present at lower levels.
  - Nutrient indicators: %N and %C vary by horizon, with C:N ratios in mid-range values; horizon-level C and N generally decrease with depth.
  - Textural and structure notes: varied horizons with micro- to macro-angular blocky structures; presence of igneous stones throughout.

- Block 5 context (summarized)
  - Additional soil profile and auger data across Block 5 with similar horizon designations (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and comprehensive analyses.
  - Detailed soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na), moisture metrics, pH, and LOI documented by horizon and auger samples.
  - Vegetation surveys provided per subplot, indicating community composition alongside soil attributes.

- Vegetation data (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Dominant grasses and forbs identified (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta) with plot-level totals and species richness.
  - Community classification hints (e.g., target grassland types) and indicator species for edge and microhabitat variation.
  - Data show spatial patterns by plot and horizon, enabling linkage between soil chemistry and vegetation.

- Ecotron and ancillary data
  - ECOTRON PLOT includes soil analyses and vegetation surveys to support controlled-condition comparisons and multi-site integration.

- Data quality and challenges (implicit)
  - Complex horizon-level data require careful harmonization to ensure comparability across blocks.
  - Some horizons show distinct boundary types and soil features that may affect sample mixing and interpretation.
  - Integration with Block 5 data and ECOTRON plots necessitates consistent metadata standards and traceability.

- Implications for Data Leaders (archetype perspective)
  - Data system design: need integrated governance for multi-block, multi-domain data (soil, vegetation, depth-specific horizons) with stable identifiers.
  - Metadata and discoverability: horizon-level metadata, barcodes, and cross-linking between soil and vegetation datasets are essential for discoverability and reuse.
  - Data quality and completeness: ensure standardized QA/QC across horizons and blocks; document sampling years, methods, and any anomalies.
  - Data integration and sharing: enable cross-site interoperability (Block 4, Block 5, ECOTRON) to support comparative ecological analyses and policy-relevant insights.
  - Sustainability: establish long-term data stewardship, archival (CEH/Merlewood), and clear data lineage.

- Recommendations for data strategy
  - Develop a unified horizon-level metadata schema and a centralized data repository linking soil profiles, auger samples, and vegetation data.
  - Implement QA/QC protocols for horizon labeling, depth assignments, and laboratory analyses; explicitly capture any block-specific anomalies.
  - Ensure robust data lineage and versioning to support reproducibility across blocks and over time.
  - Create data publication and sharing plans to enable cross-site analyses within ECN and Micronet communities.
  - Align data governance with the Sourhope data ecosystem to support long-term ecological research and cross-site comparisons.
