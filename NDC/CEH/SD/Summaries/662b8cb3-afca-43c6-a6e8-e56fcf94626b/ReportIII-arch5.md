# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large, long-term field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- A Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) described site, rationale, design, methods, and management; this report presents monitoring data to contextualize other groups' work and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Two 2001-site management events affected operations: (i) Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limiting site access Feb–May 2001; (ii) change of the site officer in May 2001. Management activities (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued per the 2001 Site Management Plan; one biocide application in May 2001 was missed.

## Data collected and management
- Data types covered: Automatic Weather Station readings, above-ground biomass, soil pH (top 5 cm), and botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys.
- Data collection scope: main Soil Biodiversity field experiment with repeated measures across plots, sub-plots, and blocks; data collection and timing aligned with Table 1 (1999–2001).
- Data collection methods and quality controls:
  - Above-ground biomass measured via five summer cuts per year; biomass dried and summed per plot.
  - Botanical surveys used standardized point quadrats with independent surveys by two trained surveyors to assess inter-observer consistency.
  - Weather, soil moisture, and temperature recorded by an Automatic Weather Station and transmitted to the data manager.
  - Documentation notes include a shift from manual mowing to mechanical shears in 2001, necessitating data normalization (against a control plot C1) to permit year-to-year comparisons.
- Data quality and governance notes:
  - Inter-surveyor comparison showed no significant differences in 2001 survey results, supporting data consistency.
  - Detailed tables and figures accompany the report to facilitate cross-year comparisons and linkage with other research groups’ datasets.
  - The dataset captures management events, timing, and changes in site operations that may affect data interpretation.

## Key results by topic

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after the very wet prior year.
- Radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture content somewhat higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production; peak biomass generally in July–August.
- Notable 2001 increase in biomass relative to earlier years, likely due to staffing changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- After normalizing to C1, nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently promoted biomass, with nitrogen+lime showing the strongest response.
- ANOVA results indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming increased surface soil pH (up to 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001).
- Nitrogen addition also raised pH (to a lesser extent) in the relevant plots.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat results showed high consistency between surveyors; total hits were 58% higher in 2001 than in 2000 across all treatments, suggesting increased vegetation density (potentially from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ov

ina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in nitrogen-only (F. ovina) and nitrogen+lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were most apparent in fertilized plots (especially N+L).
  - Species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated controls.
- Diversity patterns:
  - unimproved treatments (Control + Biocide) contained 24 species; the Nitrogen & Lime treatment contained 18 species, suggesting potential early declines in diversity with higher soil fertility.
- Multivariate and correlational insights:
  - Principal Components Analysis separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Biomass positively correlates with abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis decline as biomass increases.
  - Litter presence increases with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: right-hand slope columns (E and F) contained more acidic plots, a pattern partly explained by higher proportions of control/biocide plots in those columns.
- Underlying spatial structure supports the presence of inherent site heterogeneity affecting pH and community composition.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Some plots consistently show low biomass (outliers) while centrally located plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime plots 2E, Lime plot 2C).
- Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant differences among blocks.

## Appendix highlights
- Appendix 1 provides annualized above-ground biomass per plot and the mean across five blocks, illustrating year-to-year and plot-level variation.

## Implications for data stewardship
- Documentation of management events and measurement changes (e.g., switch to mechanical cutting) is essential for reliable longitudinal analyses and cross-study comparability.
- Consistent metadata capture on surveyors, mowing methods, plot treatments, and site conditions enhances data provenance and reusability.
- Multi-year, multi-method data (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, plant composition) require careful versioning, normalization, and clear linkage between related datasets to support robust downstream analyses and governance.
