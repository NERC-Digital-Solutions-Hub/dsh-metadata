# Data Support

- Aim
  - Support others in exploring data and obtaining useful insights by finding, combining, analysing data, and creating data products for others to explore readily.
  - Apply data analysis and communication skills across a broad range of topics.
  - Often work for organisations with less specialised remits (e.g., local councils or private companies).

- Who they are
  - Individuals with data analysis and communication skills.
  - Support a broad range of topics rather than specialising deeply.
  - Often work in less specialised organisations, supporting policy work and sometimes communicating data publicly.

- How they meet their aims
  - Understand the ask: figure out what is needed, why, and the best way to meet those needs.
  - Find and verify sufficient data; may seek help from topic experts.
  - Quality assure, clean, and transform data into appropriate formats; combine datasets.
  - Analyse patterns to identify significant features.
  - Create products (e.g., dashboards or pivot tables) to enable end users to self-serve; or create reports and charts; provide guidance on using these tools.
  - Promote outputs and gather feedback to develop products further; potentially share early prototypes.
  - Advocate for better data creation.

- Particular Challenges
  - Time spent understanding the ask due to lack of data consideration in wider teams.
  - Working with patchy data across a wide range of formats.
  - Accessing different systems to find and access data.
  - Difficulty communicating complex information simply.
  - Promoting outputs to ensure they are used; concerns outputs are not being widely shared and re-used as they could be.
