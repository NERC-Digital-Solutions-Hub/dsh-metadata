# Analysts Monitoring the Environment

## Aim
- Use data to demonstrate the condition of the environment in a consistent format that allows scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Who they are
- Work for organisations with set environmental monitoring responsibilities.
- Typically possess topic expertise and analytical skills.
- May not delve as deeply into data as some groups.
- Generally follow broad, standardized approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the required data (often from established sources), verify it, quality assure, clean, and transform it.
- Analyze data using standardized methods to produce outputs such as categorising environmental health against standards.
- Present findings in clear formats like reports, maps, and charts.
- Ensure created datasets are stored and uploaded to the appropriate portals.

## Outputs and formats
- Clear, standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts) that reflect environmental health against standards.
- Datasets stored and accessible through appropriate portals.

## Particular Challenges
- Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by combining them with other relevant data (avoiding 'single use').
- Enabling others to access the underlying data used to create final outputs.
