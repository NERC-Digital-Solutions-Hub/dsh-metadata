## Aim
- Create data products, primarily map-based, that help audiences understand and explore relevant information.
- GIS-focused data analysts who develop map-based visualisations for policy colleagues, clients, or the public.

## Who they are
- Data analysts specialising in Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
- Produce map-based visualisations for varied audiences (policy colleagues, clients, public).

## How they meet their aims
- Work closely with end users to understand audience needs.
- Find and verify data appropriate for purposes.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data; combine datasets, often across different resolutions.
- Analyse data to identify significant features and determine how to present them.
- Present data in map formats using GIS to clearly show spatial features.
- Test early prototypes and iterate based on feedback.

## Particular Challenges
- Reactions to requests that don’t account for data difficulties, rather than proactive prioritisation.
- Data stored in many disparate locations.
- Data gaps, especially at appropriate resolutions.
- Inconsistent data standards.
- Large or complex datasets not packaged into manageable chunks.
- Significant work required to clean and transform data.
- Developing teams with sufficient skills.
