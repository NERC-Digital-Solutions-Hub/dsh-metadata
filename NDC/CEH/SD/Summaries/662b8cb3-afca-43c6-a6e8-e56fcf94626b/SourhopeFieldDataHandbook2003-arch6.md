# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documents soil and vegetation data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4, BLOCK 5, and ECOTRON PLOT data.
- Includes detailed soil profile descriptions by horizon, laboratory soil analyses, auger sample data, vegetation surveys, and associated site details.
- Data support long-term ecological monitoring, pasture/soil management studies, and cross-block comparisons within the ECN Micronet framework.

## Data structure and sampling design

- BLOCK 4
  - Soil profile descriptions by horizon with depth ranges: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Horizons characterized by colour, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, sandy clay loam), structure, moisture, roots, and boundaries.
  - Soil analysis across horizons includes weight (mg) and key chemical properties: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).

- BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES
  - Individual auger samples (4A–4F) with weight (mg) and soil properties (%N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg) plus %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Data capture enables horizon-level comparisons and micro-site variability within Block 4.

- BLOCK 4 VEGETATION SURVEY
  - Plot-level vegetation data (e.g., PLOT 4A) with species presence/absence across subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc).
  - Species totals provided per subplot, enabling calculation of species richness and community patterns by block and plot.

- BLOCK 5
  - SITE DETAILS: Grid reference (NT8544019520), altitude (315 m), slope (5 degrees), imperfect drainage; soil series and parent material described (Brown forest soil with gleying; undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite).
  - BLOCK 5 SOIL PROFILE: Horizon sequence LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with depth intervals and detailed soil descriptions (texture, mottling, structure, roots, stones).
  - BLOCK 5 PROFILE ANALYSIS: Lab measurements per horizon, including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - BLOCK 5 AUGER SAMPLES: 5A–5F with Wt (mg) and soil properties (%N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
  - BLOCK 5 VEGETATION SURVEY: Plot-level presence/absence data across subplots with species totals and counts by subplot.

- ECOTRON PLOT
  - SOIL ANALYSIS: Wt (mg) and key soil properties (%N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
  - VEGETATION SURVEY: Subplot-level species data and totals for Ecotron plots, enabling comparison with standard blocks.

## Data variables and units

- Soil profile data: horizon name, depth (cm), descriptive text (colour, texture, structure, roots, stones), boundary characteristics.
- Chemical analyses (per horizon or auger sample): %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca (meq/100 g), Na (meq/100 g), K (meq/100 g), Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Weights: Wt (mg) for each horizon or auger sample.
- Vegetation data: presence/absence or counts of species per subplot/plot; species totals per plot; coded species abbreviations.
- Site details: grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations

- Subsample coverage: Vegetation data are drawn from a subset of subplots (e.g., five of fifteen per main plot), so some results are indicative rather than exhaustive for Block 4 and Block 5.
- Block-specific variability: Some blocks (e.g., Block 4, Block BCg) show notable anomalies requiring careful interpretation and blocking in analyses.
- Temporal context: Data represent baseline/early-stage observations (circa 1998) within an ongoing ECN/Micronet program; longitudinal analyses will benefit from continued data integration.
- Data fidelity: Rich horizon-level details support nuanced analyses but require careful cross-referencing with site metadata and barcodes for reproducibility.

## Data management, archiving, and accessibility

- Unique MLURI barcodes assigned to each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, and auger samples 4A–4F; 5A–5F; Ecotron plots).
- Soil samples archived for long-term storage and re-analysis (notably at -80°C per block).
- Appendix-like data organization (e.g., site details and horizon descriptions) supports reproducibility and cross-study linking.
- Data are structured to enable end users to link vegetation data with soil chemistry and management context for self-serve analyses and longitudinal monitoring.

## Ecological context and potential applications

- Provides a multi-factorial dataset linking upland grassland soils and vegetation with horizon-scale chemistry and moisture dynamics.
- Supports long-term monitoring of soil fertility, vegetation shifts, and potential responses to management or climatic factors.
- Enables cross-block comparisons, ecological modelling, and integration with ECN Micronet objectives (soil-vegetation interactions, nutrient dynamics).
- Useful for pasture management policy discussions, biodiversity indicators, and soil health assessments in upland environments.

## Key takeaways for data use

- The dataset offers rich, horizon-level soil chemistry and robust vegetation data across multiple blocks and plots, including ECOTRON plots, enabling detailed cross-site analyses.
- When using Block 4 and Block 5 data, account for subplot sampling limitations and block-specific anomalies; apply blocking in statistical analyses.
- Leverage archive-ready samples and standardized barcoding to support reproducibility and future re-analysis.
- Use the integrated soil-vegetation data to explore relationships between soil properties (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, pH, LOI) and plant community composition across moisture and fertility gradients.
