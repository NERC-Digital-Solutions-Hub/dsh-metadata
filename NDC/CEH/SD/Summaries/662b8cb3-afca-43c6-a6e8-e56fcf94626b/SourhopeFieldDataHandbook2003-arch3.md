  - ABg, Bs, Cx: markedly lower %N and %C, lower Ca/Mg, and moderate to low moisture loss; pH values near 4.0–5.0 depending on horizon and method.
- Auger sampling (Block 4):
  - Per-plot sub-samples show variance in %N (0.51–0.58%), %C (6.80–8.02%), C:N (12.4–14.3), Ca (2.0–5.0 meq/100g), Mg (0.58–1.59 meq/100g), moisture loss (4.11–9.43%), LOI (4.12–17.96%), pH H2O (3.64–5.02), pH CaCl2 (3.53–4.19).
  - Block-level patterns indicate surface horizons with higher C and N, and more acidic pH, diminishing with depth and variation across subplots.
- Vegetation survey (Block 4):
  - Plot-level species counts and totals recorded for subplots 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F with presence/absence and tally data.
  - Dominant taxa and species assemblages captured, showing plot-to-plot variation in species richness and composition.
- Ecotron soil site:
  - ECOTRON PLOT shows a discrete soil sample: Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100g; Mg 1.7 meq/100g; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
  - Vegetation survey data aligned with Ecotron plots, detailing species presence and totals.
- Data provenance and archiving:
  - Samples linked to MLURI Barcodes (e.g., FH 603951, H 603952, etc.) and archived for long-term monitoring.
  - Data capture includes detailed horizon-level measurements and associated metadata to support reproducibility and cross-study analyses.

## BLOCK 5 CONTEXT (summary)

- Site details for Block 5 provided (NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage; soil series SH 74714 Sourhope; parent igneous/andesite material; Brown forest soil with gleying).
- Block 5 soil profile:
  - Horizons: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–5 cm), H (5–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm).
  - Ah horizon: very dark brown; sandy silt loam; friable with abundant fine roots; includes many medium to very small igneous stones.
  - Bg/BCg horizons: reddish/brown with mottling; clay loam; prominent mottles; moist and firm.
  - Cg horizon: light reddish brown with yellow-red mottling; clay loam; massive structure; low root presence.
- Soil analysis (Block 5 profile):
  - FH: %N ~2.05–2.17; %C ~33.81–33.06; C:N ~16.46–14.31; Ca ~11.91–12.54 meq/100g; Mg ~5.92–5.50 meq/100g; %Moisture loss ~8.16–9.43%; LOI ~67–70%; pH H2O ~4.45–4.66; pH CaCl2 ~3.64–4.05.
  - H, Ah, AB horizons show progressively lower N and C with depth; Ca and Mg generally high in FH/H horizons, declining in deeper horizons; LOI remains substantial in surface horizons.
  - Bg/BCg: Ca/Mg lower; Na data largely missing; K often low; pH around 4–5 depending on horizon.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - Demonstrates a structured, horizon-resolved approach to soil monitoring combined with plot-level vegetation surveys across multiple blocks.
  - Highlights the value of comprehensive metadata (horizon depth, color, structure, stone content, parent material) coupled with quantitative chemical and physical soil measurements.
  - Shows integration of auger cores and pit-based profiles to capture both micro- and macro-scale variability.
  - Emphasizes long-term data storage and traceability via barcode-based archiving and centralized repositories to support reproducibility and policy-relevant analyses.
