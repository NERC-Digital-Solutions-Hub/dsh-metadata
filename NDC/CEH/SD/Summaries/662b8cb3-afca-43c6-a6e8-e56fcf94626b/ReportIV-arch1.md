# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and diversity.
- Core site management and treatments:
  - Mowing: monthly cuts to ~6 cm from May–September; fencing since 1998 to exclude grazing.
  - Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime applied on designated plots.
  - Insecticide treatment: Dursban 4 (organophosphate) applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Trampling/other effects: noted in plots subjected to intensive sampling/13CO2 pulses (C2).
- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots with randomized treatments; sub-plots used by different research groups; data collected since 1999.

Key findings by topic

- Biomass productivity (above-ground):
  - Long-term: productivity increased across treatments since 1999, despite a 2002 drop relative to 2001.
  - 2002 specifics: biomass in Control 2 plots fell most (up to 31.2%), while fertilised plots (especially nitrogen + lime) remained most productive; overall 2002 declines ranged from ~13.7% to ~31.2% depending on treatment.
  - Spatial pattern: slope location affected productivity, with lower blocks showing larger declines.
  - Interpretation: nitrogen and lime strongly boost productivity; however, potential constraints (soil moisture, high pH) may limit gains in some fertilised plots over time.

- Soil chemistry, moisture, and productivity relationships:
  - Lime raised soil pH to near 7.0 in upper soil layers; nitrogen had smaller positive effects on pH.
  - Soil moisture tended to be inversely correlated with pH (r ≈ -0.68).
  - Overall positive association between higher pH and biomass when considering all plots; within some fertilised plots (N or lime alone) the positive relationship weakens; in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship may become negative (likely due to moisture stress under higher fertility).

- Functional plant groups (CSR framework):
  - Fertilised plots (N and/or lime) shift toward competitive, less stress-tolerant species; C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups rise in nitrogen + lime plots.
  - Unfertilised plots favour stress-tolerant species (S); disturbance removal (grazing exclusion) supports S expansion.
  - Insecticide plots show reductions in SR/CSR relative to fertilised plots, suggesting complex plant-herbivore dynamics influence functional composition.

- Point Analysis surveys and species composition:
  - 2002 point analyses show higher incidence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis (associated with improved pastures) in nitrogen and lime plots; Festuca ovina remains more common in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) increased across the site, accounting for about 19.9% of hits in 2002 (up from ~10.8% in 2001 and 6.5% in 2000), especially in unimproved plots.
  - Dominant species composition shifted: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined since 2000; Festuca rubra increased, particularly underlime/N fertilisation.
  - PCA of 2002 data cleanly separates improved vs unimproved plots; limed plots cluster with nitrogen-treated plots in several respects.
  - Functional group distribution across plots remained dominated by stress-tolerators (S), CSR, and SR/CSR, with clear treatment-driven shifts over time.

- Diversity (Shannon index) and community structure:
  - Baseline differences were not significant; treatment differences emerged from 2000 onward and intensified by 2002.
  - 2002 Shannon diversity indices declined by about 15% in nitrogen + lime plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed modest or larger increases (2–29% depending on treatment).
  - Overall, fertilisation tended to reduce diversity in the long term, while some non-fertilised or insecticide-treated plots maintained higher diversity.

- Mowing effect and bryophyte expansion:
  - Major reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis (>40% decline since 2000) across nearly all treatments, suggesting mowing (and loss of grazing) reduces these grasses regardless of fertility or insecticide regime.
  - Festuca rubra expanded particularly in fertile plots; regular mowing plus absence of grazing likely promotes bryophyte expansion, aided by a consistent 6 cm sward height.
  - Mosses became more abundant with mowing, supporting broader shifts toward bryophyte dominance in less disturbed, unfertilised plots.

- Insecticide effect (Dursban 4):
  - Complex plant–insect dynamics: while direct links to diversity are not definitively established, reductions in herbivory may benefit a broader set of palatable species, potentially contributing to maintained or increased diversity in some plots.
  - Requires cautious interpretation due to limited causal evidence.

- Trampling and sampling effects:
  - 2002 C2 plots experienced productivity declines likely linked to trampling during intensive sampling and 13CO2 pulse activities, illustrating how experimental procedures can confound biomass measurements.

Discussion and implications

- Mowing and disturbance removal (grazing exclusion) consistently favored stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities; Agrostis spp. declined, Festuca rubra and bryophytes increased, especially in more fertilised plots.
- Fertilisation enhances productivity but can reduce plant diversity over time, with pH and moisture interactions playing a key role; high lime input increasing pH toward neutrality may stress certain species and alter moisture balance.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are inconclusive; potential benefits may arise from altered herbivory patterns rather than direct plant diversity increases.
- The CRC-style functional grouping analysis (S, C-S-R, SR-C-S-R) provides a coherent framework to interpret community responses to management; fertilised plots moved toward competitive strategies, unfertilised plots retained or increased stress-tolerant strategies.
- Data limitations and variability:
  - 2002 data include missing periods due to weather-station issues; cross-plot comparisons rely on normalisation against controls and year-to-year trends.
  - Spatial variability across slope blocks indicates local environmental gradients influence treatment effects.

Appendices and resources

- Species lists, treatment summaries, and detailed biomass, PCAs, and rank analyses are provided for deeper examination.
- Data and methods are available via site reports, with additional project details and databases accessible through the Soil Biodiversity programme references.

Overall takeaway for analysts

- Fertility (N and lime) drives productivity and shifts functional composition toward competitive, high-nutrient-tolerant groups, but may reduce short- to mid-term diversity.
- Disturbance removal (grazing exclusion; regular mowing) favors stress-tolerant taxa and bryophyte expansion, reducing dominance by certain grasses.
- Plant–insect interactions and trampling can modify outcomes; careful consideration of management timing and experimental procedures is needed to interpret biomass and diversity metrics accurately.
- The CSR framework provides a robust lens to link abiotic changes (pH, moisture) to biotic responses (functional groups, diversity), aiding prediction of ecosystem responses under different long-term management scenarios.
