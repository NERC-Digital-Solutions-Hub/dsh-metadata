# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Objective
  - Quantify whether two neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) impact honeybee population growth, mortality, and overwintering survival on oilseed rape crops.
  - Test the null hypothesis of no impact, without assuming a priori effects.

- Experimental Design
  - Large-scale field experiment conducted on commercial farms across the UK, Germany, and Hungary in autumn 2014 for 2015 harvesting and monitoring.
  - 36 sites total (UK, Germany, Hungary) with three treatments per site: CONTROL, Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam.
  - UK includes additional untreated control sites to account for potential residual neonicotinoids in soils; overall UK has more sites for residual checks.
  - Spatial layout includes at least 10 km separation between country replicates and at least 3.2 km between sites within a replicate to minimize cross-foraging between treatments.
  - Sites sown with oilseed rape in 2014; measurements span pre-exposure, exposure (flowering), and post-exposure (including overwintering).
  - Crop varieties chosen to reflect widely grown country-specific OSR types; fields managed according to Good Agricultural Practice.

- Treatments and Replication
  - Treatment levels: Control (no neonicotinoids), Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated OSR seed.
  - Replication structure: blocks with three treatments; country-level replication varies (e.g., 4 UK blocks, 3 German blocks, 4 Hungarian blocks). Each site within a block represents a treatment.
  - Field area: 45–70 ha per site, ensuring realistic yet substantial exposure to treated crops.
  - Field operations and pollen beetle control selected to minimize bee harm while enabling NNI exposure assessment; timing coordinated within blocks and countries.

- Measurements and Data Collected
  - Honeybee colony metrics: colony size/weight, growth rate, foraging behavior, reproductive success, pathogen/parasite incidence, overwinter survival.
  - NNI exposure assessment: residues in nectar and pollen from OSR, stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax), soil, and plant tissue; pre-sowing soil checks for residual NNIs.
  - Pollen load composition and foraging resources in the landscape; agronomic inputs and OSR yield data.
  - Disease analysis: pathogens including DWV, Nosema sp., APV-like viruses, Kashmir bee virus; Varroa counts; sampling before exposure, after exposure, and during overwintering (with caveats on sample size/power).
  - Residue sampling: multiple components including nectar/pollen from free-flying bees, crop residues in exposure tunnels, stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax), flowers/leaf material from OSR, and pollen loads from foraging bees.
  - Meteorological data: local climate data at one site per replicate (temperature, humidity, rainfall, sunshine).
  - Photographic documentation and landscape land-cover/resource surveys around each site to contextualize bee foraging.
  - Data management: data collected blind to treatment; labeling standardized; electronic and paper formats; QA checks; data stored in an Oracle database with nightly backups.

- Test Organism and Management
  - Test organism: Apis mellifera L. honeybee colonies (six per site for exposure; additional colonies for residue sampling and backups).
  - Hive management: standardized Varroa control across all hives; honey management designed to maximize pesticide exposure during the exposure phase; overwintering at country-level sites with clusters to minimize inter-hive robbing.
  - Bee health monitoring by professional beekeepers with weekly checks during exposure and continued monitoring through overwintering.

- Data Management and Governance
  - Data Management Plan in place; data collection conducted blind to treatment to minimize bias.
  - Standardized labeling: unique identifiers for sites, treatments, samples, and measured variables; country/hive coding schemes.
  - Data formats: field data in electronic templates and paper records; raw data stored in a central CEH/Eurofins-developed database; QA procedures including 10% data accuracy checks.
  - Data storage: all project data centralized in an Oracle database with nightly backups; raw data and project documentation archived.
  - Datasets: structured formats prepared for sponsor CEH, with explicit mapping of datasets to study components and samples (e.g., hive details, residue analyses, colony assessments, disease results, and data management artifacts).

- Archiving and Retention
  - Post-study archiving: materials remaining at CEH archived for at least 6 months after publication.
  - Raw data and project documents archived at CEH for at least 10 years after publication.

- Roles and Responsibilities
  - Eurofins: management and monitoring of honeybee test colonies and trial crops (Germany and Hungary); field operations and data collection for exposure assessments.
  - CEH: pesticide residue analysis across all countries; management of UK crop aspects; data management and archiving; field site coordination and sample processing.
  - Study Director: overall study management and adherence to scientific principles; deviations documented and communicated.
  - Principal Investigators: execution of field/analytical components; GLP-compliance where applicable; amendments approved by Study Director.
  - Confidentiality: no confidentiality claimed for findings.

- Data Sharing and Access
  - Raw data and analyses are shared with the study sponsor; detailed data formats and templates are agreed between Eurofins and CEH; data management emphasizes traceability, versioning, and QA checks.

- Quality Assurance
  - Measurements and sampling follow standardized protocols (e.g., Liebefeld colony assessment, forager mortality, flight activity observations, and residue analyses); data are blinding-processed to minimize bias; QA and data checks are integrated into the data pipeline.

- Appendices and Glossary
  - Appendix 1 provides glossary terms (Site, Replicate block, Patch, BBCH, Exposure tent, etc.) to ensure consistent interpretation of experimental design and terminology.

- Summary of Key Data Governance Points for Stewardship
  - Clear objectives and null-hypothesis framing for data interpretation.
  - Structured, nation-wide replication with defined treatments and spatial separation to enable robust downstream data discovery.
  - Comprehensive measurement suite spanning biological, chemical, landscape, and agronomic data.
  - Rigorous data management plan, standardized labeling, and blind data collection to ensure reproducibility and minimize bias.
  - Centralized, backed-up data storage (Oracle) with long-term archival commitments and defined data sharing with sponsors.
  - Documented roles, responsibilities, and procedures for deviations, ensuring traceability and accountability.
  - Archiving and retrievability of datasets and raw data for at least a decade post-publication.
