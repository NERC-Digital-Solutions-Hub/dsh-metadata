# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

- Purpose and context
  - Large-scale field study to quantify impacts of two commercial neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) on honeybees and wild bees (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) in commercially grown oilseed rape.
  - Collaborative effort between NERC CEH and Bayer CropScience AG and Syngenta Crop Protection.
  - Budget: approximately $3 million (£1.8 million).
  - Design guided by EFSA risk assessment guidance for plant protection products on bees.

- Aims and scope
  - Assess real-world bee responses to NNIs across three European countries (UK, Germany, Hungary) under moratorium conditions to improve the chances of NNI-free controls.
  - Focus on multiple biological endpoints (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees) and agronomic outcomes to inform policy and management decisions.

- Experimental design and implementation
  - Location and timing
    - Field sites established in autumn 2014 across the UK, Germany, and Hungary; monitoring and harvesting planned for 2015.
    - Selection aims for geographic spread, common oilseed rape production practices, and feasible regulatory permissions.
    - Ideally multi-year study, but current design is one-year due to budget and replication constraints.
  - Replication and power considerations
    - 11 replicate blocks in total across three countries (Germany: 3; UK: 4; Hungary: 4).
    - Experimental unit: triplet of patches (40–70 ha each) per block, comprising CONTROL, NNI-treated clothianidin, and NNI-treated thiamethoxam.
    - Blocks separated by at least 4 km within triplets and 10 km between replicate blocks to minimize confounding effects.
    - Power analysis (EFSA 2013/2014 revision) targets detection of 7–20% effect sizes for key honeybee metrics with 80% power at a 5% significance level. Analyses show varying detectable thresholds by endpoint; some endpoints require larger replication to detect smaller effects.
  - Treatments
    - Three treatments in each country: CONTROL (no NNIs), Clothianidin seed treatment, Thiamethoxam seed treatment.
    - In Germany, soil contamination precluded establishing four blocks; design adjusted accordingly.
  - Field setup and bee model systems
    - Contiguous treatment patches allocated within fields; patches separated to minimize cross-foraging contamination.
    - Bee models: six honeybee hives per field plus one reserve; 12 bumblebee colonies; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons (artificial nesting).
    - Uniform crop variety per country aligned with regional best practice.
  - Measurements overview
    - Chemical analysis: NNI residues in oilseed rape nectar/pollen, foraging bees, hive products, and archived samples (soil, foliage, workers).
    - Honeybees: population size, breeding success, forager mortality, disease/virus sampling, overwintering success; primary endpoints include Liebefeld colony size, hive weight, dead-bee counts, overwintering metrics; secondary endpoints include standardized behavioral observations.
    - Bumblebees: population size and breeding success (12 colonies per field); weights, counts of workers/queens/drones; disease/virus sampling; behavioral observations.
    - Solitary bees: Osmia bicornis breeding population (trap nests), provisioned cells, parasitism and disease assessments.
    - Agronomic measurements: uniform crop management; crop yield and quality; records of cropping history and inputs.
  - Data handling and governance
    - Chemical analyses conducted by an accredited CEH laboratory; sample archiving planned to support QA, audits, and re-analysis if results require verification.
    - Data collected under EFSA-guided protocols; datasets intended for transparency and potential sharing, with QA and metadata practices implied (though not exhaustively described in the text).

- Endpoints and measures (primary and secondary)
  - Honeybees (Apis mellifera)
    - Primary: colony size and success (Liebefeld method, hive weight); forager mortality; overwintering metrics (weight, colony strength); disease/viruses sampling.
    - Secondary: standardized behavioral observations during exposure (pollination/pollen/nectar collection; signs of intoxication; activity levels).
  - Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)
    - Primary: colony weights; counts of workers, queens, drones; disease/viruses sampling.
    - Secondary: standardized activity observations.
  - Solitary bees (Osmia bicornis)
    - Primary: breeding population sizes (provisioned cells), trap-nest dissections; stored product analyses.
    - Secondary: breeding success and parasitism rates; disease/viruses.
  - Agronomy
    - Crop history; inputs (pesticides, fertilizers); yield and quality.

- Data analysis framework and power considerations
  - EFSA-based power analysis (2013, revised 2014) used to estimate replication needs and detectable effect sizes for key honeybee metrics.
  - Variance components used: between-site variance (τ^2) and within-site between-colony variance (σ^2); total variation (τ^2 + σ^2) informs replication and detection limits.
  - Specifics
    - For many honeybee metrics (peak/mean colony strength, rate of increase, overwintering metrics, colony weight measures) 10–20% effect sizes are detectable with 11 replicate blocks.
    - Some endpoints (e.g., average dead bees per hive, transect counts, hive weight gain) require larger replication to detect smaller effects (often around 20% or more).
  - Appendix A covers the EFSA power equation used to determine replication (N) for detecting specified effect sizes, with definitions of inputs (z-scores, α, β, τ^2, σ^2, p, etc.) and the parameterization based on Pilling et al. 2013 data.

- Temporal and policy-relevant considerations
  - Temporal insights are limited by a single-year design; longitudinal effects would require multi-year replication.
  - Cross-country comparability is addressed via standardized protocols, same crop and treatment types, and EFSA-aligned power calculations; however, site-specific factors (geography, landscape, baseline pollinator populations) are acknowledged as sources of variation.
  - Data transparency and governance are emphasized via planned archiving, residue analyses, and adherence to EFSA risk assessment guidelines, aligning with monitoring framework quality standards.

- Key implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Prospective monitoring use: multi-endpoint approach (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees) provides a comprehensive risk picture for NNIs.
  - Standardization: adoption of EFSA guidance and Liebefeld/hive-weight methods enhances cross-study comparability and policy relevance.
  - Data requirements: explicit emphasis on metadata, QA, sample archiving, and sharing to support verification and re-analysis, addressing common monitoring challenges.
  - Limitations and safeguards: awareness of data gaps (e.g., single-year design; some endpoints with limited power) and contingencies for site-specific data quality (e.g., Germany soil contamination).
  - Translation to policy: the study aims to inform bee-risk policy decisions by delivering robust, standardized metrics and transparent analyses that can be communicated to stakeholders.
