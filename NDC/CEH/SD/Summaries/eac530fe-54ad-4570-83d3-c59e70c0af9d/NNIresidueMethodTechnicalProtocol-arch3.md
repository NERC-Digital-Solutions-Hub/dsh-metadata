# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Overview and aims
- Assess the environmental health impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees across the UK, Germany, and Hungary.
- Develop and implement a robust methodology for determining neonicotinoid concentrations in insect pollinator hive products (nectar, honey, wax, pollen) to support monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Sample types and preparation
- Matrixes analyzed: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax from bee colonies.
- Extraction approach:
  - Nectar/honey: homogenised, spiked with labelled internal standards (Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, QMX); solid-liquid extraction with methanol–water; minimal sample handling.
  - Pollen/wax: homogenised, spiked with labelled internal standards; extraction using hexane/isopropanol, followed by methanol–water addition.
- Cleanup and concentration:
  - Oasis HLB cartridges used for solid-phase extraction (SPE) cleanup.
  - Cartridges conditioned with methanol and water, dried, and eluted with acetonitrile.
  - Extracts evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in mobile phase, and prepared for LC-MS/MS analysis.

## Analytical method (LC-MS/MS)
- Instrumentation: Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) with a triple quadrupole, ESI source, operated in positive mode.
- Chromatography:
  - Column: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion (2.5 µm, 50 mm × 2 mm ID).
  - Mobile phases: A = 0.1% acetic acid in water; B = 0.1% acetic acid in methanol.
  - Gradient: start 95% A / 5% B, ramp to 50% B over 15 min, to 100% B in 5 min, back to 5% B, hold, then re-equilibrate.
- Detection and quantification:
  - SRM transitions for each neonicotinoid; two characteristic fragments monitored per compound.
  - Internal standards used for quantification to correct for matrix effects.
  - Data processing with Xcalibur ICIS; quantification based on response factors relative to internal standards.
- Quality control and traceability:
  - Analyzed samples blind to treatment to prevent bias.
  - Confirmed identities by comparing transition ratios with pure standards.

## Calibration, detection and quantification
- Calibration: Linear between the method’s practical range and 2.5 ng/mL using at least 5 standards; 1/X weighting applied.
- Linearity: R2 > 0.99.
- Limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ):
  - LOD: 0.4 ng/g for the entire procedure.
  - LOQ: 0.6 ng/g.
  - LOD determined by signal-to-noise ratio of 3; LOQ based on LOD plus expanded method uncertainty.
- Measurement uncertainty:
  - Expanded uncertainty reported as 40% for TMX and CLO.
- Recoveries:
  - Nectar/honey: ~91.3% (TMX-D4) and ~89.7% (CLO-D3).
  - Pollen: ~83.5% (TMX-D4) and ~82% (CLO-D3).
- Blank and traceability:
  - Matrix-matched blanks and solvent blanks analyzed to check contamination and carryover.
  - In-house QC extracts prepared from neonicotinoid-free honey/pollen/wax spiked with native TMX and CLO (different origin from calibration standards).
  - Traceable NIST-certified standards analyzed periodically to verify retention times and instrument sensitivity.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Routine QC measures:
  - Mobile phase blanks every four samples to monitor carryover.
  - Internal QC with matrix-based controls and deuterated standards.
  - Regular verification of retention times and MRM transition ratios against standards.
- Data integrity:
  - All analyses include internal standards and multiple QC checks to ensure accuracy and comparability across batches and matrices.

## Data governance and monitoring relevance
- The methodology provides a standardized, traceable approach for monitoring neonicotinoid residues in key hive products, enabling cross-site and cross-country comparisons.
- High-quality QA/QC and uncertainty estimates support policy evaluation and decision-making regarding neonicotinoid usage and pollinator protection.
- Use of internal standards, blanks, and certified references enhances transparency and data sharing readiness, aligning with robust data governance practices.
