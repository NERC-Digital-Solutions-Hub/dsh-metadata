# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees across the UK, Germany, and Hungary.
  - Part of a broader methodology to determine neonicotinoid concentrations in pollinator hive products (nectar, honey, wax, pollen) using LC-MS/MS.

- Analytical approach and sample matrixes
  - Target compounds: neonicotinoids Thiamethoxam (TMX) and Clothianidin (CLO).
  - Matrices analyzed: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax from insect pollinators.
  - Extraction methods
    - Nectar/Honey: 0.1 g wet samples spiked with labelled internal standards; extraction with 50:50 methanol:water; vortexing and centrifugation; aqueous layer processed for LC-MS.
    - Pollen/Wax: 0.1 g wet samples spiked with internal standards; extraction with hexane:isopropanol (80:20) followed by methanol:water (50:50); vortexing, heating, centrifugation; aqueous layer processed for LC-MS.
  - Cleanup: Oasis HLB solid-phase extraction cartridges; conditioning with methanol and water; drying; hexane wash; elution with acetonitrile.
  - Concentration and reconstitution: evaporated to dryness, re-dissolved in mobile phase (95% A / 5% B) for LC analysis.

- Instrumentation and chromatographic conditions
  - LC-MS/MS system: Thermo Fisher Quantum Ultra TSQ with ESI, Xcalibur software.
  - Column and gradient: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion; gradient from 95% A to 100% B, then back to starting conditions.
  - Detection: SRM (single reaction monitoring) in positive mode; two characteristic fragments per compound; use of deuterated internal standards for quantification.
  - Internal standards: Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, and QMX.

- Calibration, quantification, and data handling
  - Calibration: linear response with 1/X weighting; at least five standards; R^2 > 0.99; range from non-detect to 2.5 ng/mL.
  - Quantification: response factors relative to internal standards; peaks integrated with ICIS algorithm in Xcalibur.
  - Validation: identities confirmed by comparing MRM transition ratios to pure standards.

- Method performance and quality control
  - Sensitivity: LOD = 0.4 ng/g; LOQ = 0.6 ng/g; based on S/N and expanded uncertainty.
  - Uncertainty: expanded uncertainty of the method ~40%.
  - Recoveries
    - Nectar/Honey: TMX ~91.3% ± 7.2; CLO ~89.7% ± 7.2.
    - Pollen: TMX ~83.5% ± 8.2; CLO ~82% ± 10.1.
  - Quality control measures
    - Blanks: solvent blanks, matrix blanks, and mobile phase blanks to monitor contamination and carryover (injected every four samples).
    - In-house QC: neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO; different origin standards for QC.
    - Reference standards: traceable NIST-certified standards analyzed periodically (every 8–10 samples) to check retention times and instrument sensitivity.
    - Blind analysis: samples analyzed without disclosure of treatment; peak identities confirmed by multiple QA checks.

- Data integrity and provenance
  - Use of internal standards and deuterated analogues ensures reliable quantification across matrices.
  - Comprehensive QC protocol and traceable standards support data reliability and cross-sample comparability.
