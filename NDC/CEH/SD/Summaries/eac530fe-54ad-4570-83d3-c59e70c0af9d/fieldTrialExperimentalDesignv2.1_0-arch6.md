# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

## Aim
- Quantify the impact of two commercial neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) on honeybees and wild bees in oilseed rape crops.
- Use a large-scale, regulatory-like field design to produce robust, real-world exposure data and facilitate data-driven conclusions.

## Experimental design

- Location and timing
  - Field experiment established in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Hungary (autumn 2014) with monitoring in 2015.
  - Designed to improve chances of NNI-free control treatments by leveraging European moratoriums.
  - One-year study due to budget and replication constraints.
- Replication and blocks
  - 11 replicate blocks split across three countries: Germany (3), Hungary (4), UK (4).
  - Each block comprises triplets of contiguous patches (40–70 ha) for three treatments.
  - Patches are isolated (minimum 4 km within blocks; at least 10 km between blocks) to reduce cross-contamination and ensure adequate exposure.
- Treatments
  - Control (no NNIs)
  - Clothianidin seed treatment
  - Thiamethoxam seed treatment
- Experimental units and subjects
  - Each site includes model bee systems: six honeybee hives, 12 Bombus terrestris colonies, and 50 Osmia bicornis solitary bee nests per field.
  - Same crop variety across treatments within country, grown under uniform agronomy.
- Measurements scope
  - Chemical analyses, bee population dynamics, behavior, disease/virus sampling, and agronomic metrics to capture exposure, effects, and crop context.

## Power analysis and expectations

- Guiding framework
  - EFSA (2013, revised 2014) power analysis used to determine replication and detectable effect sizes.
  - Primary focus on honeybee population metrics; limited data for wild bees leads to current focus on honeybees for power planning.
- Detectable effect sizes and replication (honeybee metrics)
  - Many metrics (peak/mean colony strength, rate of increase, weight metrics) detectable with 10–20% effect sizes at the planned replication (11 blocks).
  - Some metrics (dead bees per hive, transect counts, hive weight gain) require larger replication; for these, feasible detectable effects are larger (e.g., around 20% or more depending on metric and variance).
  - Table/Appendix A parameters include site variance (τ^2) and within-site/colony variance (σ^2), derived from Pilling et al. 2013 data.
- Model and variance considerations
  - Power equation accounts for between-site and between-colony variation and the logarithmic treatment effect.
  - Data from year 1 of Pilling et al. (2005) used to parameterize variances; the plan includes re-estimation of power for non-significant outcomes using experiment-derived variance.

## Data collection and measurements

- Chemical analyses (NNI concentrations)
  - Conducted by an accredited CEH laboratory; an archive is established for QA/audit and future analyses.
  - Nectar and pollen concentrations in oilseed rape (via two flowering-period samples with caged honeybees), typical forager nectar/pollen concentrations (free-flying bees), and residues in stored products (honey, beebees, Osmia nests).
  - Additional materials: soil, foliage, foraging workers, pollen/nest samples; archived materials for potential re-analysis.
- Honeybee measurements
  - Primary endpoints: colony size and breeding success (Liebefeld method and hive weight), forager mortality (dead-bee traps), overwintering performance (winter checks, feeding, disease management), overwintering survival and spring strength.
  - Secondary endpoints: standardized behavior observations during exposure (pollination, foraging activity, signs of intoxication).
  - Experimental design uses six hives per field (plus one reserve) with standard Varroa treatment; protocol aligned with EFSA guidance where feasible.
- Bumblebee measurements
  - Primary endpoints: colony weights, counts of workers/queens/drones (dissections).
  - Disease/virus sampling at three points; secondary endpoints include standardized activity observations.
- Solitary bee measurements (Osmia bicornis)
  - Primary endpoints: number of provisioned cells in trap nests, breeding population size, stored-product residues; breeding success and parasitism rates; disease sampling.
- Agronomic measurements
  - Crop history, inputs (pesticides, fertilizer), crop yield, and quality to contextualize bee exposure and production outcomes.
- Protocols and QA
  - Full experimental protocols available online; sample archive and QA/audit framework in place to ensure data integrity and comparability across sites and taxa.

## Data management and outputs

- Data sources and integration
  - Multispecies data (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees) plus chemical residues and agronomic data.
  - Data quality assurance through accredited labs, archived samples, and standardized methods (e.g., Liebefeld, trap nests, hive weight).
- Data products and accessibility
  - Outputs prepared to enable end-user self-service and broader data exploration; outputs to be refined with stakeholder feedback.
  - Protocols and methodologies published/accessibly online to facilitate replication and transparency.

## Budget and scope

- Budget
  - Indicative budget of $3 million (£1.8 million) from industry partners (Bayer and Syngenta).
- Scope
  - Large-scale, cross-European field trial designed to provide robust, real-world assessment of NNIs on bees under practical agricultural conditions.
  - One-year replication due to budgetary constraints, with plans to interpret results within EFSA-relevant risk assessment frameworks.

## Context and references

- Background context on NNIs, regulatory moratoriums, and prior field/lab evidence highlighting the need for robust, replicated field data.
- Key references informing design and power analyses (EFSA guidance, Pilling et al. 2013, Cresswell 2011/2013, and other foundational studies).
