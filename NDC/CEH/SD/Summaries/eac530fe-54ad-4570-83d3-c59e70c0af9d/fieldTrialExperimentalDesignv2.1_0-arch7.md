# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale field trial to quantify effects of two commercial neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) on honeybees and wild bees in oilseed rape.
  - Collaboration with Bayer CropScience AG and Syngenta Crop Protection.
  - Budget: about $3 million (£1.8M).

- Experimental design and geographic layout
  - Location and timing
    - Field experiment established in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Hungary starting autumn 2014; monitoring and harvesting planned for 2015.
    - Aims to leverage an EU moratorium on NNIs to improve chances of NNI-free controls.
  - Replication and blocks
    - 11 replicate blocks across three countries (Germany, Hungary, UK); blocks split across sites within each country (Germany fewer due to soil contamination issues).
    - Each replicate block comprises three contiguous patches (40–70 ha each) representing the three treatments.
    - Patches are separated by at least 4 km; replicate blocks separated by at least 10 km.
  - Experimental unit and layout
    - Treatments within each country: Control (no NNI), Clothianidin, and Thiamethoxam.
    - Landscape and soil types are matched within replicates to minimize confounding differences.
  - Model bee systems
    - At each site: 6 honeybee hives plus 1 reserve; 12 bumblebee colonies; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons (solitary bees) in artificial nests.
  - Species and crop context
    - Treated and untreated oilseed rape are the same widely grown hybrid variety per country.
    - Goal: realistic field exposure with careful patch isolation to minimize cross-contamination.

- Power analysis and detectable effects
  - Based on EFSA guidance (2013, revised 2014) to determine replication and detectable effect sizes.
  - Detectable effect sizes
    - Many honeybee population metrics detectable in the 10–20% range with 11 replicate blocks.
    - Some metrics (e.g., dead bees per hive, transect counts, hive weight gain) require larger detectable effects (around 20% or more) given current replication and variance.
    - For several metrics, 7% to 15% effect sizes are theoretically detectable with the planned replication, depending on metric and variance.
  - Variance components
    - Variance between sites (τ2) and variance between colonies within sites (σ2) derived from Pilling et al. 2013 (oilseed rape bee colonies data).
  - Analysis approach
    - Power calculations follow the revised EFSA formula (2014). Where non-significant results arise, power-based caveats will be provided using experiment-derived variance estimates.

- Measurements and data types
  - Chemical analysis of NNI concentrations
    - Oilseed rape nectar and pollen concentrations (via caged honeybees during flowering).
    - Forager pollen/nectar samples from free-flying honeybees and bumblebees.
    - Stored products from honeybees, Bombus terrestris, and Osmia bicornis; archived samples for QA/audit; additional soil, foliage, and worker samples as needed.
  - Honeybee biological measurements
    - Primary: colony size and breeding success (Liebefeld method), hive weight.
    - Mortality: dead bees in traps; colony size changes during exposure.
    - Disease/viruses: sampled at three time points (start, pre-winter, post-winter).
    - Overwintering: survival and success, feeding and health management.
    - Behavioral observations: standardized activity measures during exposure.
  - Bumblebee biological measurements
    - Primary: colony weights; counts of workers, queens, drones (dissections); disease sampling.
    - Behavior: standardized activity observations during exposure.
  - Solitary bee (Osmia bicornis) measurements
    - Primary: breeding population size from trap nests; provisioned cells; parasitism and disease assessments.
  - Agronomic measurements
    - Cropping history, inputs (pesticide, fertilizer), crop yield and quality, to ensure uniform agronomy across treatments.

- Data collection, QA, and stewardship
  - Analyses conducted in accredited laboratories; comprehensive sample archive for QA and audits.
  - Standardized protocols for all taxa; some measurements scaled for practicality and cost.
  - Documentation and protocols are available online to support replication and auditing.

- Spatial data considerations and GIS relevance
  - Multi-country spatial layout with clearly defined replicate blocks and treatment patches.
  - Patch isolation (minimum distances) and landscape consistency within replicates support geospatial analyses of exposure and effects.
  - Data types include geolocated cultivar plots, field boundaries, soil types, landscape features, and bee monitoring results, enabling map-based visualization of NNI exposure and bee responses across the study area.

- Timeline, scope, and context
  - Autumn 2014 start; field monitoring in 2015; scope is single-year replication due to budget constraints.
  - The study aligns with EFSA risk assessment guidance and leverages prior Pilling et al. data for power and variance estimation.
