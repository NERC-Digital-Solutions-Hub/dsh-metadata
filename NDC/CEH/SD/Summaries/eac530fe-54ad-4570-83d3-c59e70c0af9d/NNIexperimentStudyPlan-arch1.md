# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Study objective
- Quantify whether neonicotinoid seed treatments (Clothianidin and Thiamethoxam) on oilseed rape affect honeybee population growth, mortality, and overwintering survival.
- Test the null hypothesis of no impact, acknowledging no a priori assumption about the pesticide’s effect.

## Experimental design overview
- Large-scale field experiment on commercial OSR farms in the UK, Germany, and Hungary conducted in autumn 2014 with monitoring in 2015.
- Treatments (3) applied at random to sites: Control (no NNIs), Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated.
- UK includes 3 supplementary untreated controls due to potential soil residues; total UK sites: 15.
- Replication: 11 blocks per country across treatments (UK 4, Germany 3, Hungary 4); total of 36 sites.
- Spatial separation: replicates within blocks separated by at least 3.2 km; blocks separated by about 10 km to minimize cross-foraging between treatments.
- Crop varieties and agronomy standardized by country and grown according to GAP; density ~50 seeds/m2; pesticide use history documented.

## Treatments and seed items
- Treatments on each site:
  - CONTROL: untreated seed with fungicide only
  - Clothianidin (Modesto/Elado) treated seed
  - Thiamethoxam (Cruiser OSR) treated seed
- Seed verification: treated/untreated batches analyzed by Bayer Crop Science and Syngenta facilities; seed varieties matched within country.
- Field co-management: pollen beetle control and other agronomic practices coordinated across blocks to minimize bee harm and ensure consistent timing (within three days of each other).

## Site setup and hive design
- Sites: 36 total (UK, Germany, Hungary); OSR planted July–August 2014; 45–70 ha per site.
- Hives: 288 total (6 hives per site × 36 sites; plus reserve/back-up as specified).
- Hive identification: unique codes combining country, site, and hive number (e.g., G01-H065).
- Hive placement: centered in treatment fields where possible; protective measures to avoid spray drift.
- Overwintering: hives clustered by block at overwintering sites with ~200 m separation to reduce robbing; uniform winter feeding within country (fondant in the UK; sugar solution in Germany/Hungary).
- Pest management: Varroa control across all hives using standard practices (formic and/or oxalic acids) with no pre-exposure treatments within 4 weeks prior.

## Test organism
- Apis mellifera L. honeybees (six colonies per site; 8 hives per site planned; 288 total across the study).

## Measurements and data collection
- Timeline: pre-exposure (baseline), exposure (during flowering), post-exposure (pre-overwintering and post-winter).
- Colony metrics (per site, across six hives):
  - Colony strength (Liebefeld method), colony weight, queen presence, brood area, nectar/pollen storage, and overall colony condition.
- Forager mortality:
  - Daily dead-bee counts using dead-bee traps and linen sheets during exposure; archive samples if spikes in mortality occur.
- Flight activity and foraging behavior:
  - Four assessment days during flowering; counts of incoming/outgoing foragers; observation in four 1 m × 1 m quadrats in the crop; weather condition records.
- Landscape resource survey:
  - 1.5 km radius around each treatment field to map land cover, flowering resources, and dominant flowering species (trees, forbs, shrubs).
- Disease analysis:
  - Pathogen screening (DWV, Nosema, APV, KBV, CPV) with pre-exposure and post-exposure sampling; monthly consultations and beekeeper checks; 3-country, 12 sites per country, multiple hive samples per site; approximately 1728 disease samples planned.
- Residue sampling plan (neonicotinoids and matrices):
  - 6.1 Crop residue sampling with caged bees (nectar and pollen) to measure worst-case exposure.
  - 6.2 Nectar and pollen from free-foraging bees (three sampling occasions during flowering).
  - 6.3 Stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax) sampled pre-exposure, post-exposure, and pre-winter.
  - 6.4 Flowers and leaf tissue (oilseed rape) collected during peak flowering for possible residue analysis.
  - 6.5 Residue analysis across matrices with CEH labs (UKAS-aligned QA/QC; data to sponsor).
- Meteorology and documentation:
  - Local weather data from CEH weather stations and national sources; photographic documentation of site conditions, landscape, and bee activity.

## Data management and analysis
- Data handling: blind data collection to treatment identity to minimize bias; chemical analyses may deviate to avoid contamination.
- Data infrastructure: standardized labeling; electronic and paper field templates; data entry with error traps; 10-year archival plan; data stored in an Oracle database with off-site backups.
- Raw data delivery: datasets to sponsor in prescribed formats; a separate data management plan governs dataset structure and QA.
- Analysis plan: pre-registered, with covariates from landscape, disease, and residue data to interpret potential NNIs effects on colonies and foraging; data quality checks on 10% of records.

## Residue analysis specifics
- Sample types: nectar, pollen, honey, wax, plant tissue (flowers/leaves), caged-bee nectar/pollen, pollen traps.
- Analytical approach: CEH laboratories with UKAS accreditation; QA/QC and limit-of-detection details to be provided in amendments.
- Sample transport: deep-freeze storage, temperature monitoring during shipment.

## Archiving and dissemination
- Archiving: post-analysis materials retained at CEH for at least 6 months post-publication; raw paper data archived; main data archive at CEH for 10 years after publication.
- Study plan and raw data: distributed among sponsor and participating institutions; confidential data handling without concealment of findings.

## Roles and governance
- Joint responsibility: Eurofins (hive management, field crops in Germany and Hungary) and CEH (pesticide residue analysis, UK field crop management).
- Study management: Study Director oversees conduct; Principal Investigators carry out field/analytical work per plan; deviations documented and reported.
- Deviations and amendments: requires sign-off; documented with rationale; corrective actions as needed.
- Confidentiality: no confidentiality of findings.

## Timing highlights
- Pre-exposure setup and field site establishment; exposure phase during OSR flowering; post-exposure phase including overwintering; ongoing beekeeping checks and data collection; scheduled sampling windows for residues and disease.
