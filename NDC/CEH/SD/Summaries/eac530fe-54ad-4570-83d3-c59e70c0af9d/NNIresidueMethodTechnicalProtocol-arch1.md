# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Objective
- Quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees across the UK, Germany, and Hungary via analysis of hive products.

## Analytical approach overview
- Determine neonicotinoid concentrations (Thiamethoxam and Clothianidin) in nectar, honey, pollen, and wax.
- Use LC-MS/MS with isotope-labelled internal standards for accurate quantification.
- Employ robust quality control and validation to ensure data reliability.

## Sample preparation and extraction
- Nectar and honey
  - 0.1 g samples; spike with Thiamethoxam-D4 and Clothianidin-D3 (and QMX).
  - Add 2 mL of 50:50 methanol:water; vortex 30 s; centrifuge 3000 rpm 5 min.
  - Take 1 mL aqueous layer; add 4 mL water; mix.
- Pollen and wax
  - 0.1 g samples; spike with Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, QMX.
  - Add 1 mL of 80:20 hexane:isopropanol; vortex; heat at 45°C for 15 min with mixing.
  - Add 1.8 mL of 50:50 methanol:water; vortex 30 s; centrifuge 3000 rpm 5 min.
  - Take 1 mL aqueous layer; add 4 mL water; mix.

## Cleanup and concentration
- Clean extracts using Oasis HLB (60 mg, 3 cc) cartridges.
- Condition with methanol, then water; dry under vacuum.
- Add 2 mL hexane, dry again; elute with 6 mL acetonitrile.
- Dry extracts (Turbovap, 45°C, 10 psi); re-dissolve in 1 mL of mobile phase (95% A, 5% B).

## Chromatography and mass spectrometry
- Instrument: LC-MS/MS on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) with ESI, Xcalibur software.
- Column: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion (2.5 µm, 50 mm × 2 mm ID).
- Mobile phases: A = 0.1% acetic acid in water; B = 0.1% acetic acid in methanol.
- Gradient: start 95% A/5% B; to 50% B in 15 min; to 100% B in 5 min; back to 5% B and hold.
- MS/MS mode: SRM, positive mode, monitoring two characteristic fragments for each analyte.
- Optimized parameters: spray voltage ~3000 V, etc. (specifics as listed).

## Quantification and calibration
- Quantification by response factor relative to corresponding internal standards (deuterated).
- Calibration curves generated with linear regression using 1/X weighting; R^2 > 0.99.
- Linear range up to 2.5 ng/mL with at least 5 standards.

## Validation and performance
- Linearity: ND to 2.5 ng/mL.
- LOD/LOQ for entire procedure: 0.4 ng/g (LOD) and 0.6 ng/g (LOQ).
- Expanded method uncertainty: 40%.
- Method recoveries (current batch data):
  - Nectar/honey: TMX-D4 91.3% ± 7.2; CLO-D3 89.7% ± 7.2.
  - Pollen: TMX-D4 83.5% ± 8.2; CLO-D3 82% ± 10.1.

## Quality control and assurance
- Include solvent blanks, matrix-matched blanks, and mobile phase blanks every ~4 samples to check contamination and carryover.
- In-house QC samples prepared from neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax with known amounts of native TMX and CLO; sourced independently from calibration standards.
- Use a traceable NIST-certified standard (CLO and TMX) analyzed every 8–10 samples to monitor retention times and instrument sensitivity.
- Blind analysis: samples analyzed without treatment labels; identification and quantification double-checked.

## Data handling and documentation
- Traceability of data and QA materials; QA procedures aligned with Nordic guidance for measurement uncertainty (Nordtest).
