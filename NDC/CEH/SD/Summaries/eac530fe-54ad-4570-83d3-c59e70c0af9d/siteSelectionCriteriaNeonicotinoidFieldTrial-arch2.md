# Site selection criteria Draft 1.0; 26 June 2014

## Aim of the site selection process
- Conduct an independent field trial to measure any effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees.
- Compare crops grown with NNI-treated seed to crops with fungicide-only (untreated control).
- Provide free treated/untreated seed to growers under a full experimental licence allowing sale on the open market.
- Growers may be asked to plant one, two, or all three treated rape crops on different parts of the farm, depending on farm size.
- The project team will make frequent visits and place honeybee hives in the centre of the crop.
- Field trial locations will remain anonymous.

## Experimental design and scope
- Field unit: oilseed rape patches of 45-75 ha (per treatment).
- Treatments: 
  - 1) No NNI
  - 2) Clothianidin-treated
  - 3) Thiamethoxam-treated
- Structure: total of 36 treated fields/groups; arranged as 3 treatments across patches.
- Layout: 4 blocks per country, totaling 12 blocks.
- Data collection focus: environmental effects on honeybees; soils sampled for NNI residues; landscape context considered.

## Data collection and analytical considerations
- Soil residue sampling: 20 soil samples per proposed study field, collected to plough depth (~20 cm), bulked to 100 g for analysis; remaining soil stored for re-analysis.
- Sample labeling: site name, coordinates, project code GTZW20140201-01.
- Analysis: NNI residues for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, and clothianidin using PSFSF method; LOQ 0.005 mg/kg.
- Laboratory: samples sent to SOFIA GmbH; express air freight to Berlin; turnaround 2-3 days.
- Data management: underlying data intended to be accessible for evaluation; compliance with reporting/portals as appropriate (implied by monitoring aims).

## Site selection process steps
- Step 1: Search Bayer/Syngenta/Eurofins databases for growers with oilseed rape fields ≥45 ha.
- Step 2: Telephone interview (Annex 1) to assess interest and collect initial details.
- Step 3: Site inspection (Annex 1) to verify field conditions and suitability.
- Step 4: Submit a site assessment form for CEH approval.
- Step 5: Contract with the grower.

## Grower eligibility and commitments (Annex 1)
- Patch eligibility: discrete patches of oilseed rape totaling 45-75 ha.
- Agronomic history: previous use of Imidacloprid seed dressings in the last three years; current or planned use of Clothianidin or Thiamethoxam seed treatments.
- Willingness to establish and manage crops according to a Good Agricultural Practice protocol.
- Willingness to host honeybee hives in the crop centre and to maintain access paths (centre strip left unsown if needed).
- Adequate vehicle access to study field(s).
- Knowledge of crops around the proposed study field(s) within approximately 1 km radius (to exclude nearby oilseed rape and bee-attracting crops).

## Site inspection details
- Detailed field description: patch identifiers, number of fields, total area, field locations (lat/long), current crop and condition.
- Soil assessment: soil type categorized using 13 categories; soil sampling for NNI residues as per guidelines.
- Landscape description: surrounding land use within 1–2 km (emphasis on predominantly arable areas).
- Surrounding crops: attach crop plan for 2014/2015; avoid untreated oilseed rape within 1 km of hive locations.
- Separation distances: confirm ≥4 km separation between treated/untreated study fields; ≥10 km between clusters (blocks).
- Documentation: attach maps, cropping plans; provide CEH recommendations.
- Submission: email Site Assessment Form to Richard Pywell at CEH (rfp@ceh.ac.uk).

## Annex 2: Glossary of terms
- Treatment: a field or group totaling 45-75 ha growing oilseed rape; three treatments (no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam); total of 36 treated fields/groups.
- Block: a replicate of the three treatments situated within a similar landscape; four blocks per country (total 12).
