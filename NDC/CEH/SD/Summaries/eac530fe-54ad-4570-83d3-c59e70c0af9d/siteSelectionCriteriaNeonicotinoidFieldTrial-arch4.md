# Site selection criteria

## Overview
- Independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees.
- Compare oilseed rape treated with Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® seed treatments against an untreated control (fungicide seed treatment only).
- Treated and untreated seed provided free; crop(s) may be 45-75 ha each, potentially across 1-3 patches on a farm.
- Trials run under a full experimental licence; location anonymized; project team will make frequent visits and place honeybee hives in the crop center.
- Growers may have up to 36 treated fields across the study (3 treatments × 12 fields/blocks), with replication to assess effects across landscapes.
- Data collection and management are organized to support analysis of NNI residues and ecological impacts, with coordination among sponsors and the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).

## Selection Process
- Step 1: Search Bayer/Syngenta/Eurofins databases for oilseed rape growers with ≥ 45 ha.
- Step 2: Telephone interview (Annex 1) to gauge interest and collect initial details.
- Step 3: Site inspection (Annex 1) for field assessment and logistics.
- Step 4: Submit site assessment form for approval.
- Step 5: Contract with the grower.

## Field Data Collection and Analysis
- Field trial scope: 45-75 ha patches; 1-3 treated rape crops per farm; treated and untreated seeds supplied; potential premium payments (5-10% of crop value up to €10,000 per treated/untreated crop of 45-75 ha).
- Study crops selected with either NNI-treated or non-treated seeds; central hive placement; adherence to Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) protocols.
- Data to be collected includes precise field locations, agronomic history, and surrounding crop context to minimize confounding factors.

## Site Inspection Details
- Description of study field(s): number of fields, exact location (lat/long), current crop, soil type (13 categories), and general field condition.
- Landscape and surrounding crops: characterize land use within the surrounding area; attach crop plans; avoid nearby untreated oilseed rape within 1 km of study fields when possible.
- Separation and replication: ensure ≥4 km separation between treated/untreated fields and ≥10 km separation between clusters of three treatments (blocks); 4 blocks per country (total 12 blocks).
- Documentation and deliverables: compile site maps, crop plans, and related materials; CEH provides recommendations and validates site suitability.
- Soil sampling for NNI residues: collect 20 soil samples per field to plough depth (~20 cm); create a 100 g composite sample per field for analysis; label and store separately; ship to SOFIA GmbH for PSFSF analysis (imida/clothianidin/thiamethoxam residues) with LOQ 0.005 mg/kg; turnaround 2-3 days.

## Soil Sampling and Laboratory Analysis
- Each field contributes a bulked soil sample and individual samples for QA; samples labeled with site name, coordinates, and project code GTZW20140201-01.
- Turnaround and testing logistics coordinated to ensure timely data delivery for analysis and interpretation.

## Data Management and Access
- Site Assessment Form to be emailed to Richard Pywell (CEH) at rfp@ceh.ac.uk; Annex 2 glossary defines key terms to ensure consistency across sites and treatments.
- Data scope includes field-level treatments, soil residue measurements, landscape context, surrounding crops, and separation metrics.
- Anonymization of trial location is maintained in public reporting; detailed coordinates used internally for supervision and analysis.
- Roles involve collaboration between project team, growers, CEH, and sponsoring organizations to ensure quality and integrity of data.

## Annexes and Glossary (Key Terms)
- Annex 1: Annex contains the detailed telephone interview and site inspection forms to capture grower interest, patch structure, agronomic history, GAP readiness, hive feasibility, and surrounding crop context.
- Annex 2: Glossary
  - Treatment: field(s) 45-75 ha, with three treatment levels (no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam); total of 36 treated fields/groups.
  - Block: replicate of the three treatments within a similar landscape; four blocks per country (12 total).
