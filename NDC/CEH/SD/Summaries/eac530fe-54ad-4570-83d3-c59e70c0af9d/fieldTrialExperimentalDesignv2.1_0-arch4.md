A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

## Aim and Context
- Large-scale field study to quantify impacts of two NNIs (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) on honeybees and wild bees.
- Collaboration: NERC CEH with Bayer CropScience and Syngenta Crop Protection.
- Indicative budget: $3 million (£1.8 million).
- Design guided by EFSA risk assessment guidance; aims to deliver robust, field-realistic data.

## Study Design and Location
- Locations: United Kingdom, Germany, and Hungary; established autumn 2014, monitoring in 2015.
- Replication: 11 replicate blocks total (Germany: 3 blocks; Hungary: 4; UK: 4).
- Experimental units: patches of oilseed rape (40–70 ha) for each treatment, arranged as triplets (Control, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam) with 4+ km separation between triplets; blocks separated by at least 10 km.
- Species modeled: honeybees (six hives per field plus one reserve), Bombus terrestris (12 colonies per field), Osmia bicornis (50 cocoons per site) integrated into artificial nesting setups.
- Rationale: maximize exposure realism, ensure NNI-free controls where possible, and enable cross-country comparability.

## Treatments
- CONTROL: no Neonicotinoid seed treatment.
- Clothianidin seed treatment.
- Thiamethoxam seed treatment.
- Germany faced soil contamination issues that limited replicates.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Chemical analyses: NNI concentrations in oilseed rape nectar/pollen, foraging nectar/pollen, stored products; soil, foliage, and additional archived samples; sample archive and QA via accredited CEH lab.
- Honeybees (primary focus): colony size and breeding success (Liebefeld method and hive weight), forager mortality, disease/viruses sampling, overwintering success, winter survival, and standardized behavioral observations.
- Bumblebees: colony weights, counts of workers/queens/drones, disease sampling, behavioral observations (12 colonies per field).
- Solitary bees (O. bicornis): breeding population sizes via trap nests, parasite/disease assessment, and nest dissections.
- Agronomy: uniform cultivation practices across treatments; crop inputs, yield, and quality data.
- Protocols: full experimental protocols for honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees are available online; QA/audit sample archive is planned.

## Power, Detectable Effects, and Analysis
- Power framework: EFSA (2013, revised 2014) power analysis to determine replication and detectable effect sizes.
- Target: detect around 7% effect in some honeybee metrics with 80% power (one-tailed) per EFSA guidance; however, with 11 replicate blocks, detectable effects for several metrics range from about 10–20%.
- Some endpoints (e.g., average dead bees per hive, transect counts) have lower detectable power (around 20% with current design).
- Final analyses will re-run power estimations on actual data to contextualize non-significant results.
- Variance components: between-site (τ^2) and within-site/among colonies (σ^2) inform power calculations; basis drawn from Pilling et al. 2013 data and mixed-effects modeling.

## Data Management and Governance
- Data handling emphasizes data system-wide view, quality, metadata, and discoverability.
- Data capture includes multi-species biological measurements, chemical residues, and agronomic outcomes.
- Sample archiving and QA processes are in place; protocols are publicly accessible online.
- Data analysis planned with mixed-effects models, incorporating site and block structure; EFSA-based methods guide replication and interpretation.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
- This study presents a multi-country, multi-species field experiment with a clearly defined replication framework (11 blocks) and a triplet treatment design to assess NNIs.
- It integrates diverse data streams (chemical concentrations, bee population metrics, behavior, disease status, and crop yields) with standardized methodologies.
- The project emphasizes robust data governance: archived samples, QA, accessible protocols, and variance-informed power analyses to interpret effect sizes.
- Germany’s limited replication due to contamination highlights practical data constraints and the importance of documenting data limitations for meta-analysis and cross-site comparability.
