# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Objective
  - Quantify whether two neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) affect honeybee population growth, mortality, and overwintering survival on oilseed rape crops.
  - Test the null hypothesis of no impact, with no a priori assumption of effect direction.

- Experimental design and scope
  - Location and scale: large-scale field experiment on commercial OSR farms in the UK, Germany, and Hungary during autumn 2014 for monitoring in 2015.
  - Sites and treatments: 36 sites total, with three treatments per site (CONTROL, Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated). In the UK, an additional 3 untreated control sites may be added as reserve in case of soil residual neonicotinoids.
  - Replication and blocks: replicate blocks organized by country (UK, Germany, Hungary) with random assignment of treatments within each block; attention to landscape and soil type uniformity within replicates.
  - Spatial separation: at least 10 km between replicates; at least 3.2 km between sites within a replicate to minimize cross-foraging between treatments.
  - Crop and agronomy: same OSR hybrids per country; crops managed under Good Agricultural Practice; density checks planned; pest control timing aligned across blocks to minimize bee exposure; pesticide inputs recorded.

- Treatments and verification
  - Treatments on each site: CONTROL (no neonicotinoid), Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated seed.
  - Seed details and lab verification: seed samples analyzed to verify dose; seed varieties seeded at ~50 seeds/m2; seed and treatment details summarized per country.
  - Field verification: seed sowing and pesticide application rates verified; maintenance pesticide use limited to minimize confounding effects.

- Test organism and colony setup
  - Organism: Apis mellifera (honeybee).
  - Colony setup: 6 colonies per site, with random or stratified distribution within blocks; colonies prepared to be disease-free and uniform at start.
  - Hive design and management: country-specific hive designs compatible for cross-site comparisons; Varroa control across all hives; queen and colony health parameters monitored.

- Measurements and data collection
  - Bee health and colony metrics: colony strength, weight, growth rate, foraging behavior, reproductive success, pathogen/parasite incidence, overwinter survival; measurements at pre-exposure, multiple points during exposure, pre-overwintering, and post-winter.
  - Foraging and behavior: flight activity at hive entrance; foraging behavior in crop quadrats; weather conditions recorded during observations.
  - Residue and exposure: residues in nectar/pollen from crops, stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax), soil and plant tissue; use of caged-bee exposure tunnels to simulate worst-case exposure; foraging bee nectar/pollen sampled in real-world conditions.
  - Land cover and floral resources: survey of surrounding land cover and flowering resources within 1.5 km of each site; documentation of dominant flowering species.
  - Disease analysis: sampling for pathogens (DWV, Nosema, APV/KBV/CPV, Varroa loading) at baseline, post-exposure, and around overwinter; acknowledgement of unknown power for disease analyses; samples stored for molecular/microscopy analysis.
  - Data quality and management: data collected blind to treatment identity; standardized labeling; electronic and paper data capture with templates; dedicated data management plan; separate QA steps; 10% data-checks; central Oracle-based data storage with nightly backups.

- Residue sampling plan
  - 6.1 Crop residue sampling using caged bees to determine worst-case exposure via nectar and pollen from treated/untreated crops.
  - 6.2 Nectar and pollen sampling from free-flying bees to assess real-world exposure.
  - 6.3 Stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax) sampling across pre-, post-, and overwinter periods.
  - 6.4 Flower and leaf tissue sampling from oilseed rape for exposure proof (archived; analyzed if necessary).
  - 6.5 Residue analyses conducted by CEH with UKAS-aligned QA; samples kept deep-frozen and tracked with data loggers during transport.

- Data management and datasets
  - Blinding: field data collected without knowledge of treatment identity; chemical analyses exception to minimize contamination.
  - Labeling and data handling: uniform labeling matrix; standardized electronic templates; paper forms scanned and digitized; centralized input into CEH/Oracle-based database; 10% data checks; data validation and anomaly checks.
  - Data sets: multiple data streams including site/hive metadata, hive health and colony assessments, foraging observations, land cover surveys, disease results, residue measurements, field inputs (pesticide/fertilizer, yield), meteorological data, and photographic documentation.

- Analysis and QA
  - UKAS-aligned residue analyses; QA/QC procedures described with plans for accreditation during the study.
  - Statistical considerations: recognition of limited power for disease analyses; analyses designed to investigate exposure and effect patterns across countries and treatments, with caveats about detecting null effects.

- Timing and project lifecycle
  - Timeline spans set-up (pre-exposure) through exposure during flowering, post-exposure, overwintering, and onward reporting.
  - Key phases include hive deployment after BBCH 61, exposure window during flowering (approx. 4 weeks), post-exposure checks, overwintering at centralized sites, and follow-up data collection.

- Archiving and dissemination
  - Archiving: materials remaining at CEH archived for at least 6 months post-publication; raw data archived at CEH for at least 10 years after publication.
  - Data delivery: raw data and data templates provided to sponsor; project management and reporting milestones defined.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - Joint execution by Eurofins and CEH: Eurofins manages hive colonies and crops (Germany/Hungary); CEH manages pesticide residue analyses and UK crop management.
  - Study management: Study Director oversees conduct; Principal Investigators handle country-specific execution; amendments documented and approved.
  - Confidentiality: no confidentiality restrictions on findings.
