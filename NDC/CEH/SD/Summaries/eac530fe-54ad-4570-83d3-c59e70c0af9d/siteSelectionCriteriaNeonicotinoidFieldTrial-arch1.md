# Site selection criteria Draft 1.0; 26 June 2014

## Overview
- Objective: independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees in oilseed rape.
- Treatments: Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® seed treatments (NNI) vs untreated control (fungicide seed treatment).
- Design: crops grown on 45-75 ha patches; 1, 2, or 3 treated rape crops per farm; full experimental license enabling sale on open market.
- Anonymity: trial location remains anonymous.
- Practical arrangements: frequent project-team visits; honeybee hives placed in the crop center.
- Incentives: free seed for 45-75 ha patches; potential premium of 5-10% of crop value per treated/untreated crop up to €10,000 per patch.

## Selection process
1. Search databases for oilseed rape growers ≥ 45 ha.
2. Telephone interview (Annex 1) to gauge interest.
3. Site inspection (Annex 1) for field readiness and suitability.
4. Submit site assessment form for CEH approval.
5. Contract with grower.

## Telephone interview (Annex 1)
- Confirm grower interest based on summary field trial description and offer.
- Summary description: independent trial; treatments as above; free seed; full licence; possible multiple patches; frequent visits; central hive location; anonymity.
- Offer details: free seed (treated vs untreated) for 45-75 ha; potential 5-10% crop value premium up to €10,000 per patch.
- Questions to assess: discrete patches of 45-75 ha; agronomic history with prior imidacloprid seed dressings; current use of clothianidin or thiamethoxam seed treatments; willingness to follow Good Agricultural Practice; ability to host hives and provide access; understanding of surrounding crops within ~1 km radius.

## Site inspection (Annex 1)
- Description of study fields: number, precise location (lat/long), current crop, soil type (13-category scale), and field condition.
- Soil sampling for NNI residues: collect 20 samples per field to plough depth (≈20 cm); create a 100 g composite for analysis; label and preserve remaining soil for re-analysis.
- Sample handling: send to SOFIA GmbH, Berlin with project code GTZW20140201-01; test PSFSF for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin; LOQ 0.005 mg/kg; turnaround 2-3 days.
- Landscape characterization: surrounding land use within 1–2 km.
- Surrounding crops plan: attach crop plans; avoid oilseed rape within 1 km of hive center when possible.
- Separation requirements: treated/untreated fields separated by ≥4 km; blocks (three treatments) separated by ≥10 km.
- Administrative details: capture grower contact details, patch identifiers, area, location, soil type, and condition.
- Submit site assessment to CEH via email (Richard Pywell) with attachments.

## Data collection, handling, and metadata
- Data points collected: patch details (area, number of fields), precise coordinates, soil type categories, landscape context, surrounding crops, and separation distances.
- Documentation and provenance: maintain project code GTZW20140201-01; label soil samples and maintain chain of custody; store maps and crop plans.
- Turnaround and deliverables: soil residue analysis results within a few days; provide site assessment summaries to CEH.

## Annex 2: Glossary (key terms)
- Treatment: field/group totaling 45-75 ha growing oilseed rape; three treatments exist (1) no NNI, (2) Clothianidin, (3) Thiamethoxam; total 36 treated fields across the experiment.
- Block: replicate of the three treatments within a similar landscape; four blocks per country (total 12 blocks).
