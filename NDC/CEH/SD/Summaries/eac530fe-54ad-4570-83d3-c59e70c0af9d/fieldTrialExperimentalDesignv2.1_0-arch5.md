# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

## Purpose and context
- Assess the impact of two commercial neonicotinoid seed treatments (Clothianidin and Thiamethoxam) on honeybees and wild bees in oilseed rape crops.
- Large-scale, regulatory-aligned field study conducted in the UK, Germany, and Hungary (autumn 2014 establishment; monitoring in 2015).
- Budget: approximately $3 million (£1.8 million) from Bayer CropScience AG and Syngenta Crop Protection.
- Informed by EFSA risk assessment guidance for bees; aims to produce robust, field-realistic data to inform risk assessments and policy.

## Experimental design and scope
- Location and timing
  - Field experiment established in the UK, Germany, and Hungary in autumn 2014; monitoring/harvest in 2015.
  - Three-country design chosen for geographic spread, typical landscape in oilseed rape production, and licence feasibility.
  - Ideally >1 year, but current plan is a single-year study due to budget/replication constraints.
- Replication and units
  - 11 replicate blocks in total: Germany (3), Hungary (4), UK (4).
  - Within each country, patches of oilseed rape receive one of three treatments: CONTROL (no NNI), Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated.
  - Each replicate block comprises patches of 40–70 hectares per treatment, separated by at least 4 km; replicate blocks separated by at least 10 km.
- Treatments and crops
  - Treatments applied to commercially grown winter oilseed rape; same variety within country; applied to contiguous patches to balance exposure realism with regulatory constraints.
  - Blocks designed to ensure adequate exposure and minimize cross-contamination in controls.
- Model bee systems and measurement scope
  - Model bee systems established per site: 6 honeybee hives, 12 Bombus terrestris colonies, and 50 Osmia bicornis cocoon nests per site (with some variations by site).
  - Primary objective: compare treated vs. control to quantify impacts across multiple bee taxa.
- Data structure and governance relevance
  - Metadata-rich experimental design with clear separation between sites, blocks, and treatments.
  - Data will be generated from multiple taxa (honeybees, bumblebees, solitary bees) plus agronomic data.

## Measurements and data collected
- Chemical analyses
  - NNI residue concentrations in oilseed rape nectar and pollen (via caged honeybees sampling during flowering).
  - Forager nectar/pollen residues collected from free-flying bees (honeybees and Bombus terrestris), plus stored products (pollen, nectar, wax) from bees and Osmia bicornis.
  - Additional material for archived analyses: soil, foliage, foraging workers.
  - An accredited CEH lab conducts analyses; a sample archive supports QA/audit needs.
- Honeybee measurements
  - Primary endpoints: colony size and breeding success (Liebefeld method and hive weight), forager mortality (dead-bee traps; colony size changes), disease/viruses (three sampling points), overwintering success (weight and survival; spring measurements).
  - Secondary endpoints: standardized behavioural observations (activity, pollen/nectar collection, signs of intoxication).
- Bumblebee measurements
  - Primary endpoints: colony weights; counts of workers, queens, and drones (dissections); disease/viruses (three sampling points).
  - Secondary endpoints: standardized behavioural observations.
- Solitary bee measurements (Osmia bicornis)
  - Primary endpoints: breeding population sizes from trap nests (provisioned cells) and stored product analyses; breeding success; parasitism and disease/viruses.
- Agronomic measurements
  - Crop history, inputs (pesticides, fertilizers), yield, and quality to ensure comparability across treatments.
- Data collection and quality
  - Protocols aligned with EFSA guidance where feasible; full experimental protocols available online for all species groups.
  - Data capture includes trial-specific metrics, site, block, and treatment identifiers; standardized laboratory and field methods to enable cross-site comparability.

## Power analysis and statistical planning
- EFSA-based power analysis (revised 2014) used to determine replication and detectable effect sizes.
- Target: detect about 7% detrimental effect on bee colony strength with 80% power in a one-tailed test (EFSA guidance).
- Findings for current design (11 replicate blocks total)
  - Many honeybee population metrics (peak/mean colony strength, rate of increase, overwintering metrics, etc.) detectable at approximately 10–20% effect sizes.
  - Some metrics (e.g., average dead bees per hive, transect counts on crop, hive weight gain) require larger replication to detect smaller effects; current design may have limited power (<20% detectable for under 20% effects for some metrics).
  - For seven metrics with detectable effects, the study is adequately powered; for other metrics, power is limited and will be revisited in final analysis.
- Variance components and data sources
  - Variance components estimated from Pilling et al. (2013) honeybee data; site-to-site and within-site (colony) variation used to parameterize the power equation.
  - Appendix A details the EFSA power analysis methodology and the underlying data (Table 1 provides replication requirements for different effect sizes and metrics).
- Data interpretation guidance
  - Final analyses will repeat power analysis for non-significant results using directly derived experimental variance estimates to calibrate caveats on non-significant findings.

## Data management, archiving, and governance
- Data management plan (implied)
  - Centralized chemical and biological measurement workflow with standardized protocols across countries.
  - Sample archiving and QA/audit procedures established via CEH laboratory infrastructure and sample repositories.
  - Metadata-rich experimental design (sites, blocks, patches, treatments) to support reproducibility and cross-site synthesis.
- Data provenance and quality assurance
  - Traceable chain-of-custody for all samples and datasets; QA/audit provisions for chemical analyses and biological measurements.
  - Documentation of methodologies (Liebefeld method, colony weight measurement, transect counts) to ensure comparability.
- Data sharing and governance considerations
  - Data generated will support risk assessment and regulatory decision-making; adherence to EFSA guidelines for study design and reporting.
  - Archiving of samples and data supports future re-analysis or methodological refinement.

## Budget, implications, and regulatory context
- Budgeted as a large-scale, industry-funded field trial; designed to align with EU risk assessment frameworks.
- Regulatory relevance
  - Designed to inform bee risk assessments under EFSA guidance; experiments leverage EU moratorium context to enhance control integrity (NNI-free controls where feasible).
  - Licenses for multi-country field work anticipated as part of regulatory alignment.
