# Site selection criteria
Draft 1.0; 26 June 2014

## Overview
- Independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in oilseed rape.
- Treatments: Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® seed-treated crops versus an untreated control (fungicide-only seed treatment).
- Seeds supplied free to growers; crops potentially grown on 45-75 ha patches; may involve one, two, or three treated crops on different parts of a farm.
- Trials run under full experimental licence; crops may be sold on the open market.
- Location anonymized; project team may visit frequently; honeybee hives placed in the center of the crop.

## Spatial design and layout (GIS-relevant)
- Treatments and replication: three treatments across multiple fields; total design comprises 36 treated fields across blocks (see Annex 2 for glossary).
- Blocks: four landscape blocks per country; total of 12 blocks across all countries.
- Separation requirements:
  - Treated vs. untreated field(s) separation: at least 4 km.
  - Separation between blocks (clusters of treatments): at least 10 km.
- Hive placement: central strip through the crop (approx. 3 m wide) may be left unsown to allow access.
- Anonymity: field locations kept confidential in reporting.

## Data collection and GIS data requirements
- Field descriptors (per patch): patch identifier, number of fields, total area (ha), location center (latitude/longitude), current crop and condition.
- Soil data:
  - Soil type categorized into 13 categories.
  - Soil sampling: 20 samples per field across plough depth (~20 cm) using gauge auger; samples pooled to 100 g for analysis; remaining soil bagged for reruns.
  - Sample labeling: site name, coordinates, project ID; submit to specified lab with LOQ details.
- NNI residue analysis: PSFSF method; LOQ 0.005 mg/kg; turnaround 2-3 days; lab address provided.
- Landscape and surrounding crops:
  - Landscape description around study fields (predominantly arable if possible; >50% in surrounding blocks).
  - Surrounding crop plan for 2014/15; aim to avoid oilseed rape within 1 km of hive location.
- Documentation and submission:
  - Attach site maps and cropping plans; email Site Assessment Form to CEH (address provided).
  - Ensure proper separation and field layout documentation is included in the submission.

## Site selection process (procedural steps)
1) Search databases (Bayer, Syngenta, Eurofins) for oilseed rape growers with ≥ 45 ha.
2) Conduct telephone interview (complete Annex 1 form).
3) Perform site inspection (complete Annex 1 form).
4) Submit site assessment form for CEH approval.
5) Contract with grower.

## Telephone interview and site inspection (Annex 1) content
- Grower interest in trial participation; number and area of oilseed rape patches (45-75 ha per patch); total area and crop arrangement.
- Agronomic history: prior seed treatments (e.g., Imidacloprid, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam) on the land in recent years.
- Willingness to implement Good Agricultural Practice protocol; required management details (drilling rate, inputs, records).
- Willingness to have honeybee hives in the middle of the crop; access path maintenance.
- Surrounding crops information for 2014/15.

## Site inspection data fields (Annex 1)
- Detailed field description: patch ID, number of fields, total area, location (lat/long), crop condition, soil type.
- Soil sampling status and method notes.
- General landscape description for 1–2 km radius.
- Surrounding crops: crop plans; ensure no untreated oilseed rape within 1 km of hive center; attach neighbor farmer contact details if available.
- Separation confirmation: 4 km between treated/untreated; 10 km between blocks.
- Administrative details: number of approved sites, proposed compensation, estimated drilling dates, CEH recommendation (where applicable).
- Attachments: site maps and cropping plans.

## Annex 2: Glossary of terms (GIS context)
- Treatment: field or group of fields totaling 45-75 ha growing oilseed rape; three treatments in total (no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam); 36 treated fields/groups across the study.
- Block: a replicate of the three treatments within a similar landscape; four blocks per country (12 total).
