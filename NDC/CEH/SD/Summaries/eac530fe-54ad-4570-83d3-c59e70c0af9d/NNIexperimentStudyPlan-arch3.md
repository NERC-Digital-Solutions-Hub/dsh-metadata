# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Aim: Quantify the impacts of Clothianidin and Thiamethoxam seed treatments on honeybees for oilseed rape, testing the null hypothesis of no effect on population growth, mortality, or overwintering survival.
- Context: Conducted across the UK, Germany, and Hungary in 2014–2015 to provide robust, real-world exposure under varying national farming practices.

## Experimental Design (overview)

- Unit of replication: Site (36 total) with a three-treatment replication structure (control, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam) organized into country blocks.
- Treatments: 
  - CONTROL (no NNIs)
  - Clothianidin seed treatment
  - Thiamethoxam seed treatment
- Site setup: Each site comprises 45–70 ha of oilseed rape; treatments randomly assigned within replicates; exposure quantified directly via residues in pollen/nectar in 2015.
- Spatial separation: Replicates separated by at least 10 km; sites within replicates separated by at least 3.2 km to minimize cross-foraging between treatments; landscape- and soil-type matching to reduce variation.
- Crop agronomy: Same OSR hybrids per country; density target ~50 seeds/m2; GAP-based management; synchronized pollen beetle controls to avoid confounding NNI effects; timing within blocks kept consistent.
- Test organism: Honeybee colonies (Apis mellifera L.) with standardized starting conditions and random distribution within blocks.

## Treatments and Controls (verification)

- Test items verified through seed analysis to confirm dose rates:
  - Clothianidin (Elado Modesto) with fungicide
  - Thiamethoxam (Cruiser OSR) with fungicide
  - Untreated control with fungicide only
- UK includes three additional residual control sites if NNIs appear in control crop pollen/nectar, to maintain clean comparisons.

## Spatial and Field Layout

- Field scale: Large plots (45–70 ha) with blocks containing the three treatments.
- Field set-up: Hives positioned near crop centers within blocks; bee drift and spray drift mitigations implemented with tall markers and field borders.
- Overwintering: All hives overwinter at single sites per country, clustered by block and separated by ~200 m to reduce robbing; consistent winter feeding practices within countries.

## Measurements and Outcomes (exposure and effects)

- Colony metrics (six hives per site): Size, weight, growth, foraging behavior, brood health, pathogen/parasite incidence, overwinter survival; Liebefeld method for colony strength; repeated measures pre-exposure, during flowering (exposure phase), and post-overwinter.
- Forager mortality: Daily counts via dead-bee traps and linen sheets during exposure; sample archiving if spikes occur.
- Flight activity and foraging behavior: Bee entrance counts and in-field quadrat observations during flowering; standardized weather constraints for observations; categories include nectar/pollen collection and other behaviors.
- Landscape resources: 1.5 km radius land-cover and flowering resource survey around each site; identify dominant flowering plants and habitat types to contextualize exposure.
- Disease analysis: Targeted pathogens (DWV, Nosema, APV/KBV/CPV) with pre- and post-exposure sampling; pooling of ~100 bees per hive; cross-country sampling to assess disease dynamics and interactions with NNIs.
- Residue sampling:
  - Caged-bee residue tunnels (worst-case exposure): nectar and pollen from caged bees placed on OSR crops; two sampling times during flowering.
  - Free-flying bees: nectar and pollen loads collected on three occasions during flowering; site-level pooling for residue analysis.
  - Stored hive products: honey, pollen, wax sampled post-exposure and during overwinter to track residue dynamics.
  - Flowers and leaf tissue: collected during peak flowering for supplementary exposure proof.
  - Residue analysis: samples sent for CEH laboratory analysis with QA/QC, UKAS considerations, and data-quality controls.
- Meteorological and photographic data: Local weather data captured; standardized field photography documenting site conditions, crop status, landscape, and bee activity.

## Data Management and Governance

- Blinding: Field data collection conducted blind to treatment identity to reduce bias; chemical analyses treated with minimal contamination risk.
- Metadata and labeling: Uniform, country-specific labeling; unique identifiers for sites, treatments, samples, and measured variables.
- Data capture: Electronic templates and paper forms; data checked for accuracy; paper records scanned and stored; Oracle-based data warehouse with nightly backups.
- Data sharing and openness: Outputs planned with emphasis on open data where appropriate; data governance processes defined to share underlying data while maintaining integrity.
- Raw data and archiving: All raw data archived by CEH for at least 10 years post-publication; residual materials retained for at least 6 months after publication; archiving strategy aligns with project governance.

## Timing and Project Activities

- Set-up and management across three countries with a flowering-season window in 2015; sampling spans pre-exposure, exposure, and overwintering phases; overwintering and post-exposure checks extend into 2015/16.
- Field activities structured around crop phenology (BBCH stages) and standardized timepoints for all measurements.

## Roles and Responsibilities

- Study Director: Overall study management and adherence to good scientific principles.
- Eurofins: Management and monitoring of honeybee colonies and field crops (Germany and Hungary); implementation of field procedures and hive management.
- CEH: Pesticide residue analysis across all countries; data management and crop management coordination in the UK; oversight of QA/QC and cross-country data integration.
- Deviations and amendments: Documented with justification; signed by responsible personnel; immediate reporting to Study Director.

## Archiving and Reporting

- Archiving: Post-analysis materials retained at CEH; long-term raw data archived for at least 10 years; detailed data management plans accompany data releases.
- Reporting: Final study outputs to include raw datasets, methodology, and QA/QC details; adherence to GLP-like principles where applicable and clear documentation of methods and limitations.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks

- Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-country monitoring framework to evaluate environmental health policy outcomes (NNI regulation impacts on pollinators).
- Emphasizes standardized metrics, data governance, metadata practices, data sharing, and transparent QA/QC processes.
- Addresses common monitoring challenges (data gaps, access, silos, metadata quality, data transformation, communicable results) through integrated sampling plans, cross-country harmonization, and centralized data management.
