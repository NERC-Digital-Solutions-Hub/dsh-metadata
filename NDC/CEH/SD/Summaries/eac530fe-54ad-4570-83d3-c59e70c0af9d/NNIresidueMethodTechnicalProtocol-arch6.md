# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Purpose: Quantify neonicotinoid (TMX and CLO) concentrations in honeybee hive products (nectar, honey, wax, pollen) as part of a large-field study across the UK, Germany and Hungary.

- Analytical approach: Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) using solid-liquid extraction followed by solid-phase extraction cleanup.

- Sample preparation by matrix:
  - Nectar and honey: 0.1 g wet samples; spiked with labelled internal standards (Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, QMX); extraction with 50:50 methanol-water; vortexing and centrifugation; aqueous layer processed and diluted for LC-MS analysis.
  - Pollen and wax: 0.1 g wet samples; spiked with labelled internal standards; extraction with 80:20 hexane/isopropanol; heat-assisted extraction; subsequent addition of 50:50 methanol-water; vortexing and centrifugation; aqueous layer prepared similarly.

- Cleanup: Oasis HLB SPE cartridges (60 mg, 3 mL) with conditioning in methanol and water; drying, hexane wash, drying; elution with 6 mL acetonitrile.

- Concentration and reconstitution: Drying with Turbovap; re-dissolve in 1 mL mobile phase (95% A / 5% B, with 0.1% acetic acid) and inject 25 µL.

- Instrumentation: LC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo TSQ) and ESI in positive mode; Chromatography on Phenomenex Synergi Fusion column with water/methanol gradient containing 0.1% acetic acid.

- Quantification strategy: SRM transitions monitored for each compound using two diagnostic fragments; calibration using linear 1/X-weighted curves; internal standards employed to obtain response factors; linear range from limit of detection up to 2.5 ng/mL.

- Performance metrics:
  - Linearity: R^2 > 0.99.
  - LOD/LOQ for the entire procedure: 0.4 ng/g (LOD) and 0.6 ng/g (LOQ).
  - Expanded method uncertainty: 40%.
  - Recoveries (overall procedure) for TMX-D4 and CLO-D3: nectar/honey ~91.3% and 89.7%; pollen ~83.5% and 82%.

- Quality control and assurance:
  - Use of blanks (solvent and matrix-matched) and mobile-phase blanks every ~4 samples to monitor contamination and carryover.
  - In-house QC samples prepared in neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO; sourced from different origins than calibration standards.
  - Traceable NIST-certified standards analysed at intervals (every 8–10 samples) for retention time and instrument sensitivity checks.
  - Identity confirmation by comparing transitions ratios to pure standards; samples analyzed blind to treatment; double-check of identifications.

- Data accuracy and traceability:
  - Quantification based on internal standards and response factors to ensure compensation for matrix effects.
  - Calibration and QA procedures aligned with Nordtest guidance for measurement uncertainty (Nordtest 537).

- Project context:
  - Part of the NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology project NEC05367.
