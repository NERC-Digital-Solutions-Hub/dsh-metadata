# Site selection criteria Draft 1.0; 26 June 2014

## Purpose and trial design
- Independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees.
- Treatments: oilseed rape seeded with Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® (NNI-treated) vs a fungicide-only untreated control.
- Seed provided free; crops may be grown as one, two, or all three treated crops on different parts of the farm.
- Full experimental license allows sale of the crop on the open market.
- Hive placement in the centre of the crop; location of trials remains anonymous.
- Crop size: 45–75 ha per treatment; total of three treatments across patches.
- Structure: 36 treated fields/groups (across treatments) and 12 blocks (across countries) to form a 3-treatment, multi-block design.
- Data/outputs focused on monitoring effects on pollinators; governance and data transparency are implied through standardized processes.

## Selection process
- Step 1: Search databases (Bayer, Syngenta, Eurofins) for oilseed rape growers ≥45 ha.
- Step 2: Telephone interview (Annex 1) to assess interest and basic criteria.
- Step 3: Site inspection (Annex 1) to verify field conditions and logistics.
- Step 4: Submit site assessment form for approval.
- Step 5: Contract with the grower.

## Telephone interview (Annex 1)
- Determine interest in trial based on description and offer.
- Assess patch structure: 45–75 ha per patch; number of discrete patches.
- Gather agronomic history: prior imidacloprid seed dressing use; current clothianidin or thiamethoxam seed treatments.
- Confirm willingness to manage crop under Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) protocol and to have honeybee hives in-crop.
- Assess access arrangements (central hive location and field access).
- Gather information on surrounding crops within 1 km radius and crop plans for 2014/15 to avoid attracting bees to untreated oilseed rape or other blooms.

## Site inspection (Annex 1)
- Detailed field description: number of fields, exact location (lat/long), current crop and condition, soil type (13 categories).
- Soil sampling for NNI residue analysis: collect 20 soil samples per proposed field to plough depth (~20 cm); mix to 100 g for analysis; preserve remainder for re-analysis; label and ship to specified lab with project identifier and test type (PSFSF for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin; LOQ 0.005 mg/kg); turnaround 2–3 days.
- Landscape description: categorize surrounding land use; require predominantly arable surroundings within blocks.
- Surrounding crops plan: attach crop plans for 2014/15; avoid oilseed rape within 1 km of hive center.
- Separation and replication: ensure ≥4 km between treated/untreated fields and ≥10 km between blocks (replicates); record number of sites approved; propose compensation details.
- Documentation: attach site maps and cropping plans; email Site Assessment Form to CEH (Richard Pywell) with all required details.

## Annex 2: Glossary of terms
- Treatment: field or group totaling 45–75 ha growing oilseed rape; three treatments exist: no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam (total of 36 treated fields/groups).
- Block: replicate of the three treatments within similar landscapes; four blocks per country (total of 12 blocks).
