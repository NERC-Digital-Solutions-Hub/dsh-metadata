# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

- Purpose: Conduct a large-scale field trial to quantify effects of two commercial neonicotinoid seed treatments on honeybees and wild bees in real-world crop conditions, informing regulatory risk assessment and policy.
- Context: NNIs widely used since early 2000s; concerns about impacts on bees led to EU moratorium and calls for robust field data due to inconclusive laboratory and previous field results.

## Aim

- Implement a field experiment in oilseed rape to quantify impacts of Clothianidin and Thiamethoxam seed treatments on honeybees, alongside assessments of wild bees (bumblebees and Osmia bicornis).

- Budget: Indicative funding of about $3 million (£1.8 million) from Bayer CropScience and Syngenta Crop Protection.

## Experimental design

- Location and timing
  - Sites established in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Hungary in autumn 2014, with monitoring and harvesting in 2015.
  - Rationale for locations: geographic spread, common oilseed rape production, and licensing feasibility.
  - Study duration: single-year replication due to budget; ideal multi-year timing acknowledged but not feasible here.
  - Trial structure accommodates a moratorium context by enabling NNI-free controls.

- Replication, power, and thresholds
  - Power analysis aligned with EFSA (2013, revised 2014) guidance to detect around 7% detrimental effects on bee colony strength with 80% power in a one-tailed test.
  - For many honeybee metrics, replication of 10–20% effect sizes is detectable; some variables (e.g., dead bees, transect counts, hive weight gain) require larger effect sizes or more replication.
  - Experimental blocks: 11 replicate blocks total, distributed as Germany (N=3), Hungary (N=4), UK (N=4). Within each block, patches are arranged to control for landscape/soil differences.

- Treatments and field layout
  - Three treatments applied to contiguous patches of oilseed rape (40–70 ha per patch):
    - CONTROL (no NNI)
    - Clothianidin seed treatment
    - Thiamethoxam seed treatment
  - Each block contains a triplet of patches (one per treatment), separated by at least 4 km; blocks themselves are separated by at least 10 km.
  - Crop variety: the same widely grown hybrid in each country, managed with uniform best-practice agronomy.
  - In Germany, soil contamination limited the number of complete blocks.

- Experimental units and monitoring plan
  - Model bee systems established at each site: six honeybee hives, 12 bumblebee colonies (Bombus terrestris), and 50 Osmia bicornis trap nests.
  - Biogeographic and agronomic consistency aimed for across sites.

## Measurements and endpoints

- Chemical analysis of NNI concentrations
  - Performed by an accredited CEH laboratory with a tissue sample archive for QA/Audit purposes.
  - Measures include:
    - NNI concentrations in oilseed rape nectar and pollen (sampling via caged honeybees during flowering)
    - Forager nectar/pollen concentrations in wild bees
    - Pollen quantification to determine oilseed rape pollen share
    - Stored products from honeybees, B. terrestris, and Osmia bicornis
    - Archival samples: soil, foliage, foraging workers
  - Archiving enables re-analysis if results warrant it.

- Honeybee biology (colony size and mortality)
  - Primary endpoints:
    - Colony size and breeding success (Liebefeld method; hive weight)
    - Forager mortality (dead-bee traps; comparison of treated vs control)
    - Disease/viruses sampled at start, pre-winter, and post-winter
    - Overwintering success and spring colony strength (Liebefeld and hive weight)

  - Secondary endpoints (behavioral measurements)
    - Standardized bee activity observations during exposure
    - Behavioral indicators (pollination foraging, signs of intoxication, etc.)

- Bumblebee biology
  - Primary endpoints:
    - Colony weights; counts of workers, queens, drones
    - Disease/virus sampling at three time points
  - Secondary endpoints:
    - Standardized activity observations

- Solitary bee biology (Osmia bicornis)
  - Primary endpoints:
    - Breeding population size from trap nests (provisioned cells)
    - Breeding success and parasitism rates
    - Disease/viruses
  - Secondary endpoints:
    - Observations of activity

- Agronomic measurements
  - Crop management: uniform best-practice inputs, crop history, and pesticides/fertilizers
  - Crop yield and quality recorded

## Data quality, management, and transparency

- All assessments conducted in both treated and control sites to ensure exposure and to monitor for cross-contamination.
- Detailed experimental protocols available for honeybees, bumblebees, and solitary bees; validation through QA samples.
- Data archiving and standardized collection methods to support robust cross-site comparisons.

## Key challenges and priorities for analysts

- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating NNI monitoring data with additional relevant environmental data (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Enabling access to underlying data and metadata used to produce final outputs.
- Ensuring standardized, transparent reporting formats (maps, charts, reports) for regulatory review and policy scrutiny.

## References and guiding framework

- EFSA (2013, revised 2014) power analysis and guidance on bee risk assessment, used to determine replication and effect-size detection.
- Prior honeybee and bee diversity field studies informing variance components and sampling approaches (e.g., Pilling et al., 2013; related EFSA guidance; supporting laboratory and field evidence in the literature).

## Summary of the approach

- A large-scale, cross-country field trial to quantify the effects of two NNI seed treatments on honeybees and wild bees in oilseed rape.
- Data collection spans chemical exposure, honeybee colony dynamics, bumblebee colony metrics, solitary bee breeding success, and agronomic outcomes.
- Power analyses guide replication goals to detect modest effect sizes while acknowledging practical constraints.
- A robust QA framework, archival strategy, and standardized reporting plan are built to support interpretation and policy relevance.
