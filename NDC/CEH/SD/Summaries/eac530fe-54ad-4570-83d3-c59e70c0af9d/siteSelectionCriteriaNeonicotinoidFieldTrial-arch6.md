# Site selection criteria Draft 1.0; 26 June 2014

## Overview
- Independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees.
- Experimental design: oilseed rape crops treated with Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® seed treatments vs. fungicide-treated control.
- Free seed provided; trials may use 1–3 treated crops on different farm parts; anonymous field locations.
- Full experimental licence; frequent project team visits; honeybee hives placed in crop centres.
- Data and outputs intended for self-serve use by end users; outputs may be promoted and refined with feedback.
- Data collection and site logistics are central to the process, including detailed soil, landscape, and treatment records.

## Selection process
- Step 1: Search Bayer/Syngenta/Eurofins databases for oilseed rape growers ≥ 45 ha.
- Step 2: Telephone interview (Annex 1) to assess interest and collect key details.
- Step 3: Site inspection (Annex 1) to verify fields, location, soil, and logistics.
- Step 4: Submit site assessment form for CEH approval.
- Step 5: Contract with grower.

## Telephone interview (Annex 1) – key data to capture
- Grower interest in trial based on a summary description and offer.
- Interest in growing discrete patches of 45–75 ha; number of patches and total area.
- Agronomic history: prior Imidacloprid use in last 3 years; current seed treatments (Clothianidin or Thiamethoxam) and timing.
- Willingness to establish/manage crop under Good Agricultural Practice; ability to monitor inputs.
- Willingness to place honeybee hives in the crop centre and provide access paths.
- Surrounding crops around proposed fields for 2014/15.

## Summary field trial description for grower (data fields)
- Independent field trial to measure NNIs’ effects on honeybees.
- Crops: oilseed rape treated with NNI or not treated; comparison with untreated control.
- Treatments: treated/untreated seed supplied free; crop(s) may be 1–3 plots per farm.
- Management: Good Agricultural Practice; frequent project visits; central hive placement.
- Anonymity: field locations remain anonymous.

## Offer to the grower (data elements)
- Free seed for study variety(s) to sow 45–75 ha.
- Possible premium payment: 5–10% of crop value per treated/untreated crop, up to €10,000 per field set (45–75 ha).

## Agronomic history questions (data)
- Have they grown crops treated with Imidacloprid seed dressing on this land in last 3 years? If yes, product and timing.
- Is current crop treated with Clothianidin or Thiamethoxam seed treatment? If yes, product and timing.

## Site readiness and management (data)
- Willingness to establish/manage the crop per Good Agricultural Practice; adherence to specified seed rate, inputs, and record-keeping.

## Bee habitat and access (data)
- Willingness to place honeybee hives in the crop centre; need for a central unsown strip (c. 3 m) for access.
- Evidence of good vehicle access to study field(s).

## Surrounding land use and crop context (data)
- Grower’s crop plan for surrounding land within ~1 km radius (autumn 2014 / spring 2015).
- Explicit aim to exclude other oilseed rape crops and crops attractive to bees within 1 km of the study field centre.

## Site inspection (Annex 1) – data collection
- Description of study field(s): number of fields, precise location (lat/long), current crop and condition.
- Soil type: simple field assessment using 13 categories.
- Soil sampling for NNI residue analysis: collect 20 samples per field across plough depth (~20 cm); bulk and mix to 100 g for analysis; label with site name, coordinates, project code GTZW20140201-01; extra soil reserved for re-analysis; ship to SOFIA GmbH in Berlin with specified labeling and test (PSFSF for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin; LOQ 0.005 mg/kg); turnaround 2–3 days.
- Landscape description: classify surrounding land use within the study area.
- Surrounding crops: attach crop plan; avoid oilseed rape within 1 km of hive location.
- Separation distances: confirm ≥4 km between treated/untreated study fields and ≥10 km between treatment blocks (as defined in Annex 2).
- Site data submission: email Site Assessment Form to Richard Pywell (CEH) with attached maps/plans.

## Site assessment form – required fields (summary)
- Grower contact details; patch identifiers; total area and number of fields per patch.
- Agronomic history details (as above).
- Preparedness to follow Good Agricultural Practice; comments.
- Bee hive logistics and access path comments.
- Surrounding crops and 2014/15 crop context.
- Detailed site description: patch ID, field count, area, location, condition, soil type.
- Soil sample data, landscape description, surrounding crops, separation distances.
- Number of sites approved; proposed compensation; drilling dates; CEH recommendation.

## Annex 2: Glossary and key terms
- Treatment: 45–75 ha of oilseed rape fields, with three treatment categories: no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam; total of 36 treated fields/groups.
- Block: a replicate of the three treatments within a similar landscape; four blocks per country (total 12).

## Data handling and contacts
- All site assessment data, maps, and crop plans to be compiled and shared among project teams.
- Primary contact for data submission: CEH (Richard Pywell) via rfp@ceh.ac.uk.
