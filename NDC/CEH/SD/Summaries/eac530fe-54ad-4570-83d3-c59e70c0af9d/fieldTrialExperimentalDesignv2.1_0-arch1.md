# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoids (NNIs) on honeybees and wild bees.

## Purpose and context
- Large-scale field trial to quantify effects of two commercial NNI seed treatments on bees in oilseed rape: Clothianidin and Thiamethoxam.
- Partners: NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) with Bayer CropScience and Syngenta Crop Protection.
- Budget: indicative funding around $3M (£1.8M).
- Rationale: NNIs linked to bee declines; field data needed due to limitations of lab studies and previous field trials.

## Experimental design and scope
- Location: Field sites in the United Kingdom, Germany, and Hungary established in autumn 2014 for 2015 monitoring/harvesting.
- Replication and layout:
  - 11 replicate blocks in total: Germany (N=3), Hungary (N=4), UK (N=4).
  - Each replicate is a triplet of patches (40–70 ha each) with treatments: Control (no NNI), Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam.
  - Patches within a replicate are contiguous and separated by at least 4 km; replicate blocks separated by at least 10 km.
- Experimental units: Blocks in similar landscapes/soil types to minimize confounding factors.
- Crop and biological systems:
  - Oilseed rape is the same widely grown hybrid per country.
  - Model bee systems established at each site: six honeybee hives, 12 Bombus terrestris colonies, and 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons.
  - Some soil contamination in Germany prevented four replicates there.
- Timeframe: A single-year study due to budget constraints, though planning aims to capture temporal effects where feasible.

## Power, replication, and statistical considerations
- Guiding framework: EFSA (2013) risk assessment guidance on bees, with updates (2014 revision) used for power analysis.
- Target effect sizes: designed to detect around 7–11% changes for key honeybee metrics; capabilities vary by metric.
- Replication and detectable effects (examples from Table 1):
  - Peak colony strength, mean colony strength, rate of increase: detectable around 6–14% with 11 replicate blocks.
  - Some metrics (e.g., dead bees per hive, transect counts) require larger N to detect 7–10% effects; higher effect sizes (15–20%) more readily detectable.
  - For several measures, detecting under 20% effects is challenging given current replication and variance estimates.
- Variance structure: uses site-to-site (τ^2) and within-site/colonies (σ^2) components estimated from Pilling et al. (2013) data; power analysis parameterized accordingly.
- Endpoint scope: power analysis focused on honeybees; where non-significant results occur, plan to re-estimate variance from observed data for caveats.

## Treatments and agricultural design
- Treatments within each country:
  - CONTROL: no NNI.
  - Clothianidin seed treatment.
  - Thiamethoxam seed treatment.
- Patch design: contiguous treatment blocks within sites, with the same crop variety and uniform best-practice agronomy.
- Field scale and exposure: patch size and isolation designed to maximize realistic exposure and minimize untreated neighboring crop contamination.

## Measurements and endpoints
- Chemical analyses (NNI residues):
  - Nectar and pollen from oilseed rape (via caged honeybees during flowering).
  - Forager nectar/pollen from free-flying bees.
  - Stored products from honeybees, Bombus, and Osmia; archived samples for soil, foliage, and workers.
- Honeybee measurements:
  - Primary: colony size (Liebefeld method) and colony weight; mortality (dead bees traps); disease/viruses sampling; overwintering success (weight, survival).
  - Secondary: standardized behavioral observations during exposure (e.g., foraging, pollen/nectar collection, signs of intoxication).
- Bumblebee measurements (Bombus terrestris):
  - Primary: colony weights; counts of workers, queens, drones; disease/viruses sampling.
  - Secondary: standardized activity observations.
- Solitary bees (Osmia bicornis):
  - Primary: breeding population sizes from trap nests; dissections; storage products for residue analysis.
  - Secondary: parasitism rates; disease/viruses.
- Agronomic measurements:
  - Cropping history; crop inputs (pesticides, fertilisers); crop yield and quality.
- Data management and QA:
  - Chemical analyses conducted by accredited CEH lab; sample archive for QA/audit and future analyses.
  - Plans to upload datasets with metadata to portals to improve discoverability.

## Endpoints and interpretation guidance
- Core (Tier 1) endpoints for honeybees emphasized (Liebefeld colony size, overwintering metrics, forager mortality, etc.).
- EFSA-based power analyses used to interpret detectable effects, with caveats for endpoints showing low power at the planned replication.

## Practical notes and considerations
- German site contamination necessitated adjustments in replication.
- The design aligns with EFSA risk assessment guidance and aims to provide robust, policy-relevant data on NNI effects across multiple bee guilds under realistic agricultural conditions.
- Although primarily focused on honeybees, the study explicitly includes wild bees (Bombus and Osmia) to broaden ecological relevance.
