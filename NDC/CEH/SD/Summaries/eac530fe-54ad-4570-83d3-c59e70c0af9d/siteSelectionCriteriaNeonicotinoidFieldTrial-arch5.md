# Site selection criteria

- Purpose and scope
  - Independent field trial to measure effects of commercial neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees.
  - Oilseed rape crops treated with Cruiser OSR® or Modesto® seed treatments compared with fungicide-only control.
  - Seed is provided free; crops may be grown in 1–3 patches (45–75 ha each) on the farm.
  - Trial conducted under full experimental licence; frequent project team visits; honeybee hives placed in the crop center.
  - Field locations remain anonymous.

- Data collection workflow and roles
  - Stepwise process:
    - 1) Database search for eligible growers (≥45 ha).
    - 2) Telephone interview to gauge interest (Annex 1).
    3) Site inspection (Annex 1).
    4) Submit site assessment form for CEH/ sponsor approval.
    5) Contract with grower.
  - Telephone interview focuses on interest, patch details, agronomic history, readiness to follow Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), hive placement, access, and nearby crops within ~1 km.
  - Site inspection collects field descriptions, soil type, landscape context, surrounding crops, and separation distances; soil samples for NNI residue analysis are collected and prepared for lab analysis (PSFSF for imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin).

- Data elements and structure (data to be recorded)
  - Grower information: contact details, consent, willingness to participate, comments.
  - Patch-level details: patch identifier, number of fields, total area (ha), location (lat/long), condition, soil type (13-category system).
  - Agronomic history: prior exposures to Imidacloprid seed dressings; current seed treatments (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) and timing.
  - Management data: readiness to establish/manage crops under GAP; drilling dates; input records; access arrangements for hive placement.
  - Field-level logistics: vehicle access, 1 km radius crop plan to exclude other oilseed rape and bee-attracting crops; 4 km separation between treated/untreated patches; 10 km separation between treatment blocks.
  - Soil sampling data: 20 samples per field, plough depth ~20 cm, mixed to 100 g aliquot for analysis; labeled bags with site name, coordinates, project code GTZW20140201-01; resampling logic kept for re-analysis.
  - Lab and analysis: NNI residue testing with LOQ 0.005 mg/kg; turnaround 2–3 days; sample dispatch details to SOFIA GmbH.
  - Landscape and surrounding context: general landscape description (1–2 km), dominant land uses (primarily arable), surrounding crops plan for 2014/15; buttons to confirm absence of untreated oilseed rape within 1 km of study field centers.
  - Separation and experimental design: confirmation of ≥4 km separation between treated/untreated fields and ≥10 km between blocks; glossary-defined treatments (no NNI, Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam) and blocks (replicates within similar landscapes).
  - Economic/mobilization data: proposed compensation per 45–75 ha patch (up to €10,000 per treated/untreated crop); estimated drilling dates.
  - Documentation: required attachments (site maps, cropping plans); CEH recommendation section completed by CEH.

- Data governance, privacy, and stewardship considerations
  - Anonymization of trial field locations to protect sensitive information and study integrity.
  - Documentation and labeling standards to enable traceability while preserving confidentiality (site identifiers, coordinates stored with access controls).
  - Clear roles for data collection, review, and approval (CEH, sponsor) with formal email routing for site assessment data submission.
  - Explicit consent and readiness of growers to participate under defined GAP protocols and hive placement requirements.

- Data quality, standards, and interoperability
  - Standardized forms (Annex 1) for telephone interview and site inspection to ensure consistency across sites.
  - Consistent soil type categorization (1–13) and standardized lab methodology for NNIs residue analysis.
  - Use of Annex 2 glossary to harmonize terminology (Treatment, Block) and replicate structure (total of 36 treated fields across patches and blocks).
  - Requirement to attach supporting documents (site maps, cropping plans) to aid data interpretation and replication.

- Data availability, sharing, and lifecycle
  - Data collected for site selection and trial setup are intended for broader governance and transparency; anonymized data may be prepared for sharing with relevant stakeholders and data portals.
  - Documentation emphasizes data provenance (site name, coordinates, project code) and the potential for data reuse in future analyses, subject to confidentiality constraints.
  - The workflow culminates in formal approval, contract, and field establishment, after which data collection continues under the project’s governance framework.

- Annexes and terminology
  - Annex 1: Site Assessment Form (telephone interview and site inspection components).
  - Annex 2: Glossary of terms (Treatment, Block) and description of the experimental design (three treatments across multiple blocks per country).
