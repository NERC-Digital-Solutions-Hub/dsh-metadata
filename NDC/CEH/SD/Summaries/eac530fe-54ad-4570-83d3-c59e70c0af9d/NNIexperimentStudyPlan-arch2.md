# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Objective and null hypothesis
- Aim: quantify whether neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin or thiamethoxam) impact honeybee populations for foraging on oilseed rape.
- Null hypothesis: no impact of NNI seed treatments on population growth, mortality, or overwintering survival.
- No a priori assumption of the direction or magnitude of effects.

## Experimental design overview
- Large-scale field experiment on commercial farms across the UK, Germany, and Hungary.
- Year: 2014 sowing with harvesting in 2015; designed to exploit a moratorium on NNIs to improve control treatment contrasts.
- Sites: 36 sites total (country distribution: UK, Germany, Hungary).
- Treatments (randomised at site level): Control (no NNI), Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam.
- Replication: UK 14 control sites + 11 Clothianidin sites + 11 Thiamethoxam sites; Germany and Hungary 3 country-level replicate blocks each (9 and 12 sites respectively) with 3 treatments, totaling 36 sites.
- Hives per site: 8 hives, distributed to form exposure and residue assessment cohorts.
- Overwintering: all hives overwinter at country-specific central sites with clustered groupings to minimize confounding factors.

## Treatments and site layout
- Treatments per site: 
  - CONTROL: OSR seed not treated with NNIs (fungicide-treated seed only in some countries)
  - Clothianidin seed treatment (Elado/Modesto formulations)
  - Thiamethoxam seed treatment (Cruiser OSR)
- Site area: 45–70 ha per site to ensure realistic exposure and reduce cross-visitation from neighboring fields.
- Spatial separation: at least 10 km between country replicates; at least 3.2 km between sites within a replicate; landscape and soil type matched where possible.

## Crop agronomy and pest management coordination
- OSR varieties: UK Harper, Germany Flyer, Hungary Hybrirock; grown under GAP.
- Crop density checks: sampled in spring 2015 at 20 random locations per site.
- Pest control for pollen beetle: coordinated across blocks to minimize bee harm; bee-friendly pesticides selected where possible; all applications within three days in field blocks.
- Pesticide timing: harmonized across blocks within each country; detailed schedules per country for pollen beetle and other pests.
- Recording: all agronomic inputs, timings, and yield estimates captured.

## Test organism and hive management
- Test organism: honeybee, Apis mellifera L.
- Colony attributes: disease-free at start; minimum ~4000 workers; young queens (1–2 years), similar colony strength; races UK Buckfast; Germany/Hungary Carnica; standard two-box hive with queen excluder.
- Hive deployment: within each site block; backup hives available for replacements; hives stationed to maximize exposure within each block.
- Varroa management: standardized across all hives (formic acid and oxalic acid as appropriate per country) with no treatment within four weeks prior to exposure.

## Measurements and endpoints
- Colony health and performance: colony size/weight, growth rate, foraging behavior, reproductive success, pathogen/parasite incidence, overwinter survival.
- Exposure and residues: NNIs in nectar and pollen from OSR, residues in stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax), soil and plant tissue; baseline soil residues measured pre-sowing.
- Pollen resources: composition of honeybee pollen loads to assess exposure to OSR and other floral resources.
- Agronomic outcomes: pesticide/fertilizer inputs and OSR yield/quality (with acknowledgement of confounding management intended to maximize bee exposure).
- Timing: measurements before hive setup (pre-exposure), during flowering (exposure phase), and pre- and post-winter (post-exposure).

## Test item and control details
- Clothianidin seed treatment: formulations with specified rates per country; seed counted and analyzed for AI content.
- Thiamethoxam seed treatment: Cruiser OSR formulations with country-specific rates; seed counted and analyzed for AI content.
- Untreated control: seeds treated with fungicide only (no neonicotinoids); country-specific fungicide formulations noted.
- Seed lot verification: seed samples sent for chemical verification of actual dose rates.

## Drilling, crop maintenance, and field setup
- Sowing: July–August 2014; treated and control plots matched by field size; seeding rate targeted at 50 seeds/m2.
- Field equipment: calibrated to ensure accurate application; non-GLP standards applied.
- Crop management: documented pesticide history for two prior seasons; maintenance pesticide use restricted to minimize NNI confounding effects.
- Field scale: hives placed near the center of treatment fields; spray drift protection measures implemented (markers, tall canes).

## Test sites, hive location, and field layout
- Field sites: 36 total across three countries; all sites mapped with treatment randomization.
- Patch design: per site, two patches per field (hives in one patch; Bombus parasitoid addition and other pollinator studies are separate and require 100 m separation from honeybee patch).
- GPS: hive center locations recorded to ±2 m accuracy.
- Overwintering: hives moved to centralized overwintering sites per country; clusters separated by ~200 m to limit robbing; entrances reduced to minimize cross-colony robbing.

## Overwintering and beekeeping practices
- Honey management: OSR honey removed before overwintering; standardized winter feeding within country (fondant in the UK; sugar solution in Germany/Hungary).
- Beekeeper checks: weekly checks during exposure, plus pre- and post-overwintering checks; queen status, swarming, food stores, and disease measured.
- Disease and treatment consensus: disease control and Varroa treatment aligned with country practices; deviations documented and reported.

## Data management and analytics
- Blinded data collection: field sampling blind to treatment identity to minimize bias (except chemical analyses, which follow a protocol to minimize contamination).
- Data labeling: standardized, country-specific labelling with unique site and hive identifiers; field and lab data integrated in a single data management system.
- Data capture: electronic templates and paper forms; 10% data-sheet accuracy checks; data entry into a central Oracle database with off-site backups.
- Data formats: predefined data sets and templates for all measured variables; raw data delivered to sponsors in agreed formats.
- Data governance: adherence to CEH Data Management Plan; QA/QC and traceability implemented.

## Residue sampling plan
- Integrated residue analysis across multiple matrices and methods:
  - 6.1 – Crop residues via caged bees (worst-case exposure): nectar and pollen from caged bees in 36 tunnels (two sampling times).
  - 6.2 – Nectar and pollen from free-flying bees: three sampling occasions during flowering; site pooled samples for residue analysis.
  - 6.3 – Stored hive products: honey, pollen, and wax sampled across pre-exposure, post-exposure, and overwinter periods.
  - 6.4 – Oilseed rape flowers/leaf material: collected once during peak flowering for supplementary analysis (archived).
  - 6.5 – Residue analysis: CEH laboratories to perform analyses; UKAS accreditation pursued.
- Sample handling: deep-freeze storage, dry ice transport, and temperature data logging to ensure sample integrity.

## Disease analysis
- Purpose: covariate disease loading before exposure and potential changes after NNI exposure; pairwise integration with beekeeper health checks.
- Pathogens prioritized: gut viruses (DWV), Nosema spp., nervous-system viruses (APV, KBV, CPV), Varroa impact.
- Sampling schedule: pre-exposure, post-exposure (two or more points during flowering), and pre-overwintering (with a plan to optimize sampling points due to data gaps).
- Sample size: combination of 3 sites per country, 12 sites per country, 6–8 hives per site, generating 864 bee pools plus Varroa counts for analysis.

## Other measurements
- Meteorological data: one weather station per replicate block; complement with official government stations for broader coverage.
- Photographic documentation: field setup, landscape, crop condition, and bee foraging activity captured with standardized labeling.

## Archiving and data longevity
- Archiving: remaining materials at CEH archived for at least 6 months after publication; raw data archived at CEH for at least 10 years post-publication.
- Data preservation: raw and processed data retained with access controls and traceability for future analyses.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Collaboration: Eurofins and CEH jointly conduct the trial; Eurofins manages honeybee colonies and crop treatment execution; CEH handles residue analyses and UK crop management.
- Study management: Study Director oversees conduct; Principal Investigators ensure GLP-compliance and document deviations.
- Deviations: any amendments documented, signed, and communicated to the Study Director for corrective action.
- Confidentiality: no confidentiality restrictions on findings.

## Timing and deliverables
- Scheduling: stepwise plan aligned with crop phenology (BBCH 61 milestone), flowering period, and overwintering logistics.
