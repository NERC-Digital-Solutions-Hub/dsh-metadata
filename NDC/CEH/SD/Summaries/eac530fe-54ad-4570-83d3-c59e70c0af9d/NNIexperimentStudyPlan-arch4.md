# Study Plan: A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Objective: Quantify whether neonicotinoid seed treatments (clothianidin and thiamethoxam) impact honeybee population growth, mortality, and overwintering survival for honeybees foraging on oilseed rape (OSR). Test the null hypothesis of no impact, with exposure quantified via pollen/nectar residues in 2015.

- Study scope and design:
  - Large-scale field experiment across 36 sites on commercial OSR fields in the UK, Germany, and Hungary (autumn 2014, monitoring in 2015).
  - Treatments applied at random within sites: Control (no NNI), Clothianidin, Thiamethoxam.
  - UK adds up to 3 extra untreated control sites to account for residual soil NNIs; total UK sites = 15 (12 + 3 residuals), Germany = 9, Hungary = 12.
  - Each site represents a treatment, with replication blocks to balance country-level variation.

- Treatments and replication:
  - Three treatments per site: Control, Clothianidin-treated, Thiamethoxam-treated OSR seed.
  - Replication: country-level blocks with varying numbers (UK 4; Germany 3; Hungary 4); total unit of replication per country reflected in design.
  - In-field exposure and residue verification planned for 2015.

- Spatial layout and separation:
  - Each replicate block contains three sites (one per treatment) separated by at least 3.2 km; blocks within a country separated by at least 10 km.
  - Within each site, the treated crop area is 45–70 ha to ensure realistic, but high exposure to NNIs, while minimizing cross-foraging from neighboring untreated OSR.

- Crop agronomy and pest management:
  - OSR varieties chosen to reflect widely grown regional varieties; density verification in spring 2015 (20 random locations per site).
  - Pollen beetle management timed to avoid confounding NNI effects; bee-friendly products preferred; all applications within three days of each other in a block.
  - Additional agronomic inputs and yields recorded; attempts made to minimize pesticide use that could mask NNI effects.

- Test organism and colony setup:
  - Test organism: Apis mellifera L. honeybees.
  - Colonies prepared to be disease-free, with uniform quality: young queens (1–2 years), ~4000 workers per colony, two-deep-hive configurations, random distribution within blocks, and backup hives available.
  - Bee races: Buckfast (UK); Carnica (Germany, Hungary).

- Field setup and hive management:
  - 288 hives in total (8 hives × 36 sites), with unique identifiers and precise GPS localization.
  - Hives placed near centers of treatment fields, protected from spray drift with markers and visual barriers.
  - Overwintering at country-specific central sites with clusters of 24 hives per block, separated by about 200 m to minimize robbing; standardized winter feeding (fondant in the UK; sugar solution in Germany/Hungary).
  - Varroa control standardized across all hives (formic acid + oxalic acid, timing fixed per country).

- Measurements and endpoints (exposure and effects):
  - Colony and brood status: Liebefeld method for colony strength, queen status, brood area, nectar/pollen stores, and colony weight; assessments pre-exposure, weekly during flowering, pre- and post-winter.
  - Forager mortality: daily counts using dead-bee traps and linen sheets; rescue sampling if spikes occur; archiving of bees for pathogen/sublethal analyses.
  - Flight activity and foraging behavior: four assessment days during flowering; hive entrance counts (inbound/outbound bees) and 1 m² quadrat observations in front of hives for color-coded behavior categories (nectar/pollen/other/motionless).
  - Landscape flowering resources: one 1.5 km radius landscape survey per site to record land cover, growth stage, and dominant flowering plants around the site.
  - Disease analyses: baseline and post-exposure sampling for gut pathogens (DWV), Nosema, nervous-system viruses (APV, KBV, CPV), and Varroa counts; four sampling points estimated; RNA-based and microscopy analyses planned; confidentiality not claimed for results.
  - Residue sampling:
    - 6.1: Crop residue sampling from caged bees (nectar and pollen) to estimate worst-case exposure.
    - 6.2: Nectar and pollen from free-flying bees; nectar pooled per site; pollen loads from each hive individually analyzed.
    - 6.3: Stored hive products (honey, pollen, wax) across three time points; additional pre-exposure wax sampling.
    - 6.4: Flowers and leaf material from OSR fields to corroborate plant exposure (archived if no residues detected in nectar/pollen).
    - 6.5: Residue analysis (CEH labs, UKAS accreditation planned); QA/QC and LOD details to be provided in amendments.
  - Meteorology and photography: local weather data recorded; standardized photography to document site, landscape, crop condition, and bee activity.

- Data management and analysis:
  - Data management plan followed; data collected blind to treatment to minimize bias (except for necessary chemical analyses).
  - Standardized labeling and unique identifiers for sites, treatments, samples, and measured variables; both electronic templates and paper forms used.
  - Data entry into an Oracle database with off-site backups; 10% data-sheet accuracy checks; data validation for anomalies.
  - Raw data transfers to sponsor; data formats defined (spreadsheets and paper records); a detailed data management plan governs data storage, access, and archiving.

- Timing and lifecycle:
  - Timeline covers site setup (2014), exposure (oilseed rape flowering 2015), post-exposure monitoring, overwintering, and data archiving.
  - Specific timing for hive setup, exposure periods, sampling points, and overwintering windows defined per country and per block.

- Archiving and dissemination:
  - Post-study, material remaining at CEH archived for at least 6 months post-publication; raw data preserved for at least 10 years after final report/publication.
  - Study plan and raw data to be shared with sponsor and participants; QA and project management documentation maintained.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - Joint project execution by Eurofins GAB GmbH and CEH.
  - Study Director oversees conduct; Principal Investigators manage country-specific aspects; deviations must be documented and approved.
  - No confidentiality applied to findings; GLP principles followed where applicable; deviations, amendments, and data provenance tracked.

- References and glossary:
  - References include methodological sources for colony assessment, entomological sampling, and pollinator monitoring.
  - Appendix glossary clarifies key terms (site, replicate block, patch, exposure tent, BBCH, etc.).

- Key takeaways for data leadership:
  - A comprehensive, multi-country, field-based study designed to quantify real-world bee exposure to NNIs via OSR seed treatments, with rigorous replication, standardized data collection, and extensive residue and disease analyses.
  - Emphasis on data integrity, blinding, metadata standardization, cross-country data compatibility, and long-term archiving to support future reuse and policy-relevant insights.
  - Data architecture supports linking field observations, laboratory analyses, residue data, and environmental context to enable integrated assessments of NNI effects on honeybees.
