# Soil chemical properties from a field experiment in the Conwy Valley, North Wales, UK (20156)

## Overview
- Metadata accompanies Soil_properties.csv and references Plot_locations.csv and Plot_locations_metadata.rtf.
- Focus: soil chemical properties measured from a field experiment conducted in May 2016 in the Conwy Valley, North Wales, UK.
- Data describe transect-based soil sampling and extensive laboratory analyses to characterize soil chemistry and microbial indicators.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Three 75 m transects identified across a hillslope, 20 m apart, running perpendicular to the river.
- Along each transect, intact soil cores were extracted at 2, 12, and 75 m.
- Cores collected in May 2016; total core lengths determined by soil depth or an impermeable boundary (row 1 = 1 m, row 2 = 2 m, row 3 = 3 m; n = 18 × 1 m cores).
- Cores (4 cm diameter) wrapped in thin-walled polyethylene sleeves and stored at 4°C prior to analysis.
- Fieldwork tool: Cobra percussion hammer corer.

## Collection methods
- Intact soil cores collected as 1 m increments up to maximum depth per core row.
- Cores prepared and transported to laboratory under controlled conditions to maintain integrity.

## Analytical methods
- Soil water content determined gravimetrically after 24 h at 105°C.
- Soil organic matter measured by loss-on-ignition (LOI) at 450°C for 16 h.
- pH and electrical conductivity (EC) measured in a 1:2.5 soil-to-deionised water suspension.
- Available nitrogen: NH4-N and NO3-N in 0.5 M K2SO4 extracts via colorimetric (Mulvaney, 1996) and vanadate methods (Miranda et al., 2001), respectively.
- Available phosphate (P) quantified with 0.5 M acetic acid extracts (Murphy & Riley, 1962) using the ascorbic acid–molybdate blue method.
- Total carbon (TC) and total nitrogen (TN) measured with a TruSpec elemental analyzer.
- Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) quantified in 1:5 soil-to-0.5 M K2SO4 extracts using a TOC analyzer.
- Microbial biomass C and N assessed by chloroform fumigation (72 h) with established kec and ken correction factors.
- Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analysis conducted via a 96-well high-throughput method.
- Phosphorus sorption determined by shaking 1.0 g field-moist soil in 0.01 M CaCl2 with known P concentrations plus 33P tracer; after 2 h, supernatant analyzed by liquid scintillation counting to derive sorption; adsorption maxima estimated from Langmuir isotherms (linearized form).
