# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

## Overview
- Metadata for Plot_locations.csv, which holds the locations of sampling sites.

## Experimental design
- Three 75 m long transects, 20 m apart, across a hillslope and running perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
- Along each transect four boreholes were installed to bedrock; in some locations a second borehole was drilled.
- Boreholes labeled 'new' do not differ from those labeled 'old'.

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and longitude recorded in degrees, minutes, and seconds, converted to decimal degrees.
- Coordinates also recorded as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.
- Date represents the date of measurement.
- Time represents the time of measurement (Greenwich Mean Time).

## Data structure
- Plot_locations.csv contains eight columns: Name, Latitude, Longitude, Date, Time, Easting, Northing, ODN.
- ODN denotes elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn.

## Projection, coordinate systems and base map considerations
- Longitude/latitude values use GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID 4326, EPSG).
- Eastings/Northings use OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID 27700, EPSG).
- Users must ensure the correct projection is used and that the base map is in the appropriate projection to display sample sites accurately.

## Additional notes
- An image (courtesy Welsh Government) illustrates the correct locations.
