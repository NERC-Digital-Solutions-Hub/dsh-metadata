# Soil chemical properties from a field experiment in the Conwy Valley, North Wales, UK (20156) Metadata for Soil_properties.csv

## Overview
- Metadata document describing the soil chemical properties dataset (Soil_properties.csv) from a field experiment in the Conwy Valley, North Wales, UK, conducted in 2016.
- Outlines experimental design, sampling regime, laboratory analyses, data structure, quality control, and supporting documentation.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Three 75-meter transects identified across the hillslope, 20 meters apart, perpendicular to the river.
- Along each transect, intact soil cores were extracted at 2, 12, and 75 meters.
- Core lengths were determined by soil profile depth or an impermeable boundary; row 1 = 1 m, row 2 = 2 m, row 3 = 3 m; total cores = 18 × 1 m lengths.
- Intact cores were collected in 1 m lengths (4 cm diameter) and stored at 4°C prior to analysis.
- Field collection used a Cobra percussion hammer corer.

## Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
- Core collection: Cobra percussion hammer corer (Van Walt Ltd, UK).
- Laboratory analyses conducted at Bangor University’s School of Environment, Natural Resources and Geography.

## Analytical methods (key measurements)
- Soil water content: gravimetric (24 h, 105°C).
- Soil organic matter (LOI): loss-on-ignition (450°C, 16 h).
- pH and electrical conductivity (EC): standard electrodes in 1:2.5 soil-to-deionised water suspension.
- Available nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, P): colorimetric methods after specific extractions (NH4-N and NO3-N in 0.5 M K2SO4; P in 0.5 M acetic acid extract with ascorbic acid-molybdate blue method).
- Total C and N (TC, TN): TruSpec elemental analyzer.
- Dissolved organic C (DOC) and total dissolved N (TDN): 1:5 soil-to-0.5 M K2SO4 extracts analyzed by TOC analyzer.
- Microbial biomass C and N: chloroform-fumigation method (72 h incubation; k_ec and k_en values).
- Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA): high-throughput 96-well method.
- Phosphorus sorption: 0.01 M CaCl2 extraction with known P concentrations, spiked with 33P tracer; assessment of adsorption and Langmuir isotherms for Pmax.
- P-sorption details: 1.0 g soil, 2 h shaking at 25°C, followed by scintillation counting; P adsorption inferred from initial vs. remaining 33P.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Data are recorded in columnar form with specific units per column descriptions (e.g., pH, EC in µS/cm, moisture content %, LOI %, TOC mg/g, TDN mg/g, microbial C/N mg/g, PO4_P mg/kg, NH4_N mg/kg, NO3_N mg/kg, TC g/kg, TN g/kg, CtoN_ratio, Pmax mg/kg, NH4Adsorp mg/kg).
- Empty cells indicate no data.

## Data structure and supporting documentation
- Plot_locations.csv: details of plot locations.
- Plot_locations_metadata.rtf: description of Plot_locations.csv.
- Detailed column descriptions provided under “Details of data structure” including Transect, Row, Depth, and all measured variables.

## Quality control
- All samples analyzed in triplicate.
