# Plot_locations_metadata.rtf

- Metadata for Plot_locations.csv, which contains the sampling site locations used in environmental monitoring.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Three transects, each 75 m long, 20 m apart, across a hillslope.
- Transects run perpendicular to the river Hiraethlyn.
- Along each transect, four boreholes were installed to bedrock; some locations have a second borehole labeled 'new' (these do not differ from 'old').

## Collection methods and instrumentation
- Coordinates collected with a handheld Garmin GPS device.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Latitude and Longitude initially collected in degrees, minutes, and seconds, then converted to decimal degrees.
- Coordinates also recorded as six-figure Ordnance Survey National Grid references.

## Details of data structure
- Plot_locations.csv contains 8 columns:
  - Name: Site identifier
  - Latitude: Decimal degrees
  - Longitude: Decimal degrees
  - Date: Date of measurement
  - Time: Time of measurement (GMT)
  - Easting: British National Grid Easting
  - Northing: British National Grid Northing
  - ODN: Elevation in metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn

## Projections and basemap guidance
- Use correct projection to display sample sites accurately.
- Longitude/Latitude: GCS_WGS_1984 (WKID: 4326, EPSG).
- Easting/Northing: OSGB1936 British National Grid (WKID: 27700, EPSG).
