# Survey Overview

- Purpose and timeframe
  - Part of the NERC InSAR ToPS project to monitor the impact of climate on peatlands.
  - Data collection occurred from September 2017 to November 2018.

- Survey Area and Sites
  - Two study sites in the Flow Country, Caithness and Sutherland, Scotland:
    - Knockfin Heights: upland blanket peatland (>300 m a.s.l.), part of the RSPB Forsinard Estate, characterized by peat hags, drains, lochans, and a mixture of Sphagnum, sedge, heather, and grasses.
    - Munsary: lowland blanket peatland (around 100 m a.s.l.), part of Plantlife Munsary Nature Reserve, with pool systems (Dubh Lochans), near-natural conditions despite historic grazing, peat extraction, and burning; recent restoration efforts (drain blocking).
  - Survey included peat cores, peat depth measurements, and teabag index deployments at both sites.

- Coring Locations and Protocols
  - Multiple sub-sites across Munsary and Knockfin Heights were cored using a Russian corer (up to 4 m) with 50 cm sampling intervals; first 50 cm sampled at 5 cm intervals, remainder at 10 cm intervals.
  - On-site descriptions captured texture, air bubbles, etc.; peat volume measured on site at Knockfin Heights due to accessibility.
  - Cores prepared and processed in the lab following Chambers et al. (2011) protocol.

- Peat Depth Protocol
  - November 2018, 1 km² grid covering Knockfin Heights to measure peat depth relative to the surface.
  - Adheres to Peatland Action Peat Depth and Condition Survey Guidance (NatureScot 2021).

- Teabag Index (TBI)
  - 100 pairs installed at all benchmarks at ~5 cm depth in early June 2018; redeployed until early September 2018, aligning with the 2018 European drought.
  - Some losses due to deer damage.
  - Post-burial wet/dry weights used to compute S (litter breakdown) and k (decomposition rate) via specified calculations.

- Von Post Humification
  - Humification assessed in the field following Von Post and Granlund; methods align with FAO 2011 guidelines.

- Bulk Density, Moisture, LOI, OC, and Ash
  - Bulk density measured by water displacement (approx. 2 cm³ peat per sample) with dry/wet weight comparisons.
  - Soil moisture calculated from dry/wet weights.
  - Loss on ignition (LOI), organic carbon (OC), and ash contents calculated from LOI results using standard equations.

- File Naming and Data Fields
  - Structured naming convention for data and sites (e.g., KH = Knockfin Heights, MUN = Munsary; ENV = Environmental Monitoring Data; SITE = SUB SITE A-F; WT = Water Level).
  - Data columns include:
    - Peat Depth: latitude/longitude (OSGB36), peat surface height, peat depth, and site notes.
    - Bulk Density: subsite, interval, mid-point, wet/dry densities, Von Post, ash, LOI, moisture, and observations.
    - Teabag Index (TPI): measurement number, site, coordinate grid, location, S, and K values.
  - References cited for methods include Chambers et al. (2011), FAO (2011), and NatureScot (2021).

- Data Outputs and Management
  - Data are prepared in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals, enabling standardized sharing and reuse.

- Particular Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts
  - Challenge: increase the value of these monitoring datasets by integrating with additional relevant data to avoid single-use outputs.
  - Challenge: enabling broad access to underlying data used to generate final outputs, supporting transparency and downstream analyses.

- Relevance to Environmental Monitoring Aims
  - Provides standardized, QA-enabled measurements of peatland condition and carbon-related properties over time.
  - Supports assessment of climate-related impacts and policy performance through repeatable, comparable datasets and outputs.
