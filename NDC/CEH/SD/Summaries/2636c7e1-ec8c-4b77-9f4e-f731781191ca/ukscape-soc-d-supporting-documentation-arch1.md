SOC-D: Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics data description

- Overview
  - Large UK-SCAPE project (SOC-D) to understand biotic and abiotic controls on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics and identify where UK SOC stocks are at risk or could be increased through land management.
  - Five long-term grassland-to-woodland contrasts across England were surveyed (2018–2021) with co-located aboveground and belowground measurements.
  - Four main data families: Aboveground productivity and litter; soil chemical/physical/biological properties; soil hydraulic conditions; earthworm counts and species IDs. Includes extensive metadata and site coordinates to enable data linking.

- Data description (what is provided)
  - Four datasets covering soil and vegetation measurements across five contrasting sites:
    - ANPP and litter layer depth
    - Soil chemical, physical and biological properties for up to six soil depth increments from 0 to 100 cm
    - Soil hydraulic conditions (soil water release curves and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity)
    - Earthworm counts and species IDs with weights
  - Completeness notes:
    - Most common measurements (e.g., LOI, bulk density, soil moisture, pH, EC) are complete.
    - Less common measurements (e.g., DOC, nitrate, soil texture, enzyme activities) are limited to certain layers or sites and flagged as NA where missing.
  - Site details:
    - Gisburn-1 (grassland x conifer), Gisburn-2 (grassland x broadleaf), Alice Holt (grassland x broadleaf), Wytham Woods (grassland x broadleaf), Kielder Forest (grassland x conifer)
    - Plot design: two plots per site (grassland vs woodland), each plot divided into grids (1–6) with randomized sampling points (n=18 per contrast)
    - Sampling timeline: soil cores collected Nov 2018–Mar 2019; additional measurements in 2020–2021
  - Data availability and linking:
    - Two connector files plus four measurement files to connect samples to locations and plots
    - ENA sequencing data available under PRJEB66294
    - Datasets organized to enable cross-site comparisons within UK-wide soil-vegetation-climate contexts

- Project background and aims
  - Central questions:
    - How sensitive is SOC to local/global climate and land management changes?
    - What feedbacks link SOC with soil structure, chemistry and biota?
    - Which metrics and modelling approaches best reflect SOC dynamics?
    - Which UK areas are most at risk of SOC loss and where can SOC be protected or increased?
  - Focused on land management and process understanding in grassland-to-woodland transitions, given policy relevance for woodland creation and Net Zero targets.
  - Aims to test biological/structural controls on SOC using UKCEH’s long-term soil monitoring and partner experiments, with an emphasis on developing a modular SOC dynamics model for integration into broader soil models.

- Site selection and land-use contrasts
  - Criteria included woodland age, management history, plot size, and transect design to capture proximity to trees and potential confounding factors (e.g., roads, streams).
  - Five sites selected for accessibility and representativeness; contrasts include both conifer and broadleaf woodlands, managed/unmanaged grasslands, and varying landscape contexts.
  - Site-level descriptions include geography, soil types, vegetation, and management histories (e.g., grazing, mowing, afforestation).
