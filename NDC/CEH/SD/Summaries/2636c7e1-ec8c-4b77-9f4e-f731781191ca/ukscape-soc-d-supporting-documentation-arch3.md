# Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics (SOC-D) data description for five grassland-to-woodland contrasts across England

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes co-located aboveground and belowground measurements across five grassland-to-woodland contrasts in England (2018–2021) to understand soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics.
  - Aims to identify biotic and abiotic controls on SOC, quantify where UK soil carbon stocks are at risk, and inform land-management policies to increase SOC.
  - Supports development of a flexible, process-based SOC dynamics model that can be embedded in other soil models.

- What was measured
  - Aboveground and litter
    - Aboveground net primary productivity (ANPP) and litter layer depth; used leaf dry matter content (LDMC) and cover-weighted LDMC (cLDMC) to estimate ANPP.
  - Soil physical, chemical and biological properties (0–100 cm)
    - Common measurements on 0–100 cm cores across up to six depth increments; in some sites, limited to top and bottom layers or grids.
    - Key properties: bulk density (BD), soil moisture, pH (DIW and CaCl2), electrical conductivity (EC), LOI, total carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), total phosphorus (P), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrate (NO3-N), cation exchange capacity (CEC), NO3-N, NH4-N, and related soil chemistry.
  - Soil physical properties and hydrology
    - Soil hydraulic properties: water release curves (HYPROP) and unsaturated hydraulic conductivity (K) from field mini-disk infiltrometer tests.
    - Deep soil cores (0–100 cm) with multiple corer types; field and laboratory measurements of moisture retention and conductivity.
  - Earthworms
    - Hand-sorted earthworm counts and fresh biomass (species-level data where possible).
  - Soil texture and structure
    - Particle size distribution (PSD) and texture via laser diffraction; mineral and organic fractions; aggregate size distribution (ASD).
  - Soil organic matter (SOM) pools
    - Density fractionation to obtain four SOM pools: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), light fraction (LP, i.e., particulate organic matter), occluded particulate (OP), and mineral-associated (MA) fractions; C and N quantified in each fraction; C:N ratios reported.
  - Enzyme activities (selected sites)
    - Extracellular enzyme activities (β-glucosidase, N-acetylglucosaminidase, leucine aminopeptidase, phosphatase, phenol oxidase) for AH, WW, KF sites (not available at Gisburn due to method issues).
  - Microbial communities
    - Prokaryotic and fungal community composition via amplicon sequencing (16S rRNA gene, ITS2) and shotgun metagenomics; data processed to NMDS axes and taxonomic/functional summaries; microbial biomass proxies from sequencing metrics.
  - Additional soil metrics
    - DOM measurements, various soil nutrients, CEC, NO3, inorganic N, enzyme-to-C/N ratios, and other top- and sub-soil metrics as part of the soil metrics datasets.

- Study design and site details
  - Sites and land-use contrasts
    - Gisburn-1: grazed grassland x conifer
    - Gisburn-2: ungrazed grassland x broadleaf
    - Alice Holt: grazed grassland x broadleaf
    - Wytham Woods: grazed grassland x broadleaf
    - Kielder Forest: unmanaged grassland x conifer
  - Plot and grid layout
    - Each contrast has two plots (grassland and woodland). Each plot divided into three grids (grassland grids 1–3; woodland grids 4–6), with nine sampling locations per grid, totaling 18 sampling locations per contrast.
    - Sampling locations randomized within grids; field maps created to relate sampling points to the grassland-woodland boundary and to measure distances from boundary and grid edges.
  - Sampling timeframe
    - Field sampling of soil cores between November 2018 and March 2019; additional measurements (infiltration, earthworms, ANPP) conducted 2020–2021.
  - Sampling methods
    - Multiple core types and depths (0–5 cm, 5–15 cm, 15–30 cm, 30–50/60 cm, 50/60–100 cm); HyPROP cores for water retention (0–5 cm; 30–35 cm at some sites); 0–15 cm topsoil cores via national survey-type corers; deeper 0–100 cm cores via Cobra precision corer or Russian Auger as appropriate.
    - Litter and vegetation measurements collected in proximity to sampling points; litter depth measured at three points per location.
  - Data processing and quality control
    - ANPP derived from LDMC using regression models with error propagation via Monte Carlo methods; detailed R-Markdown workflow for predictions.
    - HYPROP data analyzed with HYPROP-FIT; K measured with mini-disk infiltrometer; QA includes internal standards, blanks, duplicates.
    - Soil chemical analyses (C, N, P, NO3, DOC, CEC, etc.) performed with standardized, UKAS-accredited methods; SC/LOI measured via thermogravimetric analysis with QA checks and internal standards.
    - PSD and ASD measured with laser diffraction; fixed QA with standard samples and replicated measurements.
    - SOM density fractionation performed with sodium polytungstate (SPT) density separation; fractions (LP, OP, MA) and DOM quantified; carbon and nitrogen quantified in each fraction; enzyme activities assayed where possible; microbial sequencing data generated and processed with standard pipelines (DADA2 for amplicons; Kraken2 for metagenomics).
  - Data management and sharing
    - Datasets are organized into multiple CSV files linked by a central connector file; 458 sample IDs and 91 locations; coordinates and site metadata provided for geolocation.
    - Some measurements flagged as NA where not collected at particular sites or where data quality prevented analysis (e.g., HYPROP at Alice Holt; earthworms at WW; some enzyme data omitted due to incorrect buffer).
    - Microbial sequence data deposited in ENA under project PRJEB66294; derived metrics included.
    - Missing values are explicitly marked as NA; data structure includes explicit connectors (site, plot, grid, core, slice, depth).

- Data gaps and considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Completeness varies by site and measurement; some high-cost or site-specific measurements are limited or NA at certain sites (e.g., HYPROP at Alice Holt; earthworms in Wytham; some enzyme data not collected due to buffer issues at Gisburn).
  - Data quality controls implemented (blanks, standards, duplicates) with documented QA procedures; certain analyses faced logistical constraints (e.g., microbial biomass measurements affected by freezing, delaying some analyses).
  - The dataset provides a modular structure suitable for integration into larger monitoring frameworks and process-based SOC models; allows cross-site comparisons of land-use contrasts and depth-dependent SOC dynamics.

- Data usage and potential applications
  - Enables analysis of SOC sensitivity to climate and land-management changes, SOC–soil-structure–biota feedbacks, and assessment of key soil metrics and modelling approaches for SOC dynamics.
  - Supports identification of UK regions and soil-vegetation-climate combinations where SOC may be at risk and where management interventions could maximize SOC storage.
  - Provides open, well-documented datasets with connectors to enable integration into monitoring frameworks, policy evaluation, and model development.
