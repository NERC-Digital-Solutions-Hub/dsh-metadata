# The EMEP-WRF global model, version 4.45

- What the dataset is
  - Daily mean surface ozone concentrations generated by the EMEP-WRF global model, version 4.45.
  - Based on the EMEP MSC-W chemical transport framework, with meteorology driven by WRF (v4.2.2) using IFS ECMWF data for nudging/initialisation.
  - Emissions are from IIASA GAINS ECLIPSE v6a for the year 2015.
  - Output focused on the grassland growing season (mid-April to mid-July) for the UK and USA in 2018, at 1° x 1° grid resolution.

- How the data were collected and generated
  - Model setup:
    - Global domain with 1° x 1° horizontal resolution.
    - 21 vertical layers, with thickness from ~40 m near the surface to ~2 km near the top (~16 km).
  - Meteorology:
    - Hourly 3D meteorological fields produced by WRF driving the EMEP-WRF model.
    - Initialised and nudged every six hours using GFS-FNL (GFS final reanalysis).
  - Emissions:
    - IIASA GAINS ECLIPSE v6a data used for 2015 emissions in the simulation.
  - Output:
    - Daily mean surface ozone concentrations (ppb) for 2018, 6 am to 6 pm local time, on a 1° x 1° grid.

- Data content, units, and structure
  - Spatial framework:
    - Geographic Coordinate System: WGS 1984.
    - Grid: 1° x 1° cells.
  - Data attributes:
    - FID: Unique grid cell identifier.
    - Lon: Centre longitude (decimal degrees).
    - Lat: Centre latitude (decimal degrees).
    - NAME: Country (USA or UK).
    - O3_ppb: Daily surface ozone concentration (ppb), seasonal mean for mid-April to mid-July, 2018.
  - Units:
    - Ozone in parts per billion (ppb).

- Quality assurance and validation
  - QA/QC processes applied before analysis.
  - Model validation referenced from Mills et al. (2018):
    - Comparison of modelled vs. observed ozone from GAW network sites during daily peak ozone periods.
    - The model captured spatial and temporal variations across regions and seasons with higher ozone episodes.
  - Validation figures and supplementary materials available in Mills et al. (2018).

- Key considerations for data governance and reuse
  - Provenance and lineage:
    - Data derive from the EMEP-WRF framework, linked to EMEP MSC-W chemistry transport model and ECMWF-driven meteorology.
  - Metadata and discoverability:
    - Shapefile format with clearly defined attributes and coordinate system (WGS 1984).
  - Potential limitations:
    - Focused on 2018 and on UK/USA grassland season; emissions data are from 2015 GAINS input, which may affect comparability with other periods.
    - 1° resolution may limit applicability for high-resolution local assessments.
  - Applicability:
    - Useful for evaluating ozone exposure during the grass-growing season in the UK and USA and for studies linking modelled ozone to impacts on crop production, aligned with related literature (e.g., Mills et al. 2018; referenced works).
