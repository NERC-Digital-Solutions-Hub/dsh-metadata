# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Describes Sourhope Field Site, a long-term soil biodiversity research site designed to study environmental health indicators.
- Integrates with UK Environmental Change Network (ECN) and SERAD Micronet to relate soil microbial and plant communities to management practices.
- Combines controlled experiments with ongoing ecological monitoring to inform policy and future decisions.

## Site context
- Location: Sourhope, Bowmont valley, Scotland; elevation ~304–315 m; north-facing slope on Sourhope soils.
- Climate/soils: Euoceanic, humid upland climate with substantial rainfall; soils range from brown forest soils to gleyed variants, with Festuca-Agrostis-Galium grasslands and moor/peat associations.
- Programmatic background: Linked to Hill Farming Research Organisation/Macaulay Institute lineage; longstanding focus on pasture improvement and hill-sheep systems; now embedded in ECN and Micronet programs.

## Monitoring framework and experimental design
- Structure: Replicated blocks with 30 main plots per block; various subplots; Ecotron plot for controlled environment work.
- Treatments: Control; Lime; Nitrogen (NH4NO3); Lime + Nitrogen; Biocide; Fallow (retained as additional controls rather than true fallow).
- Grazing management: Plots fenced; stock excluded; regular cutting to simulate grazing pressure; cut material removed.
- Monitoring objective: Evaluate effects of nutrient amendments, liming, biocides, and limited fallow on plant communities, soil chemistry, moisture, organic matter, and microbial/biogeochemical processes over time.

## Vegetation sampling and data collection
- Methods: 50 × 50 cm quadrats; five main plots per block with five subplots each; 25-point presence/absence (with potential abundance) per subsample.
- Timeline: Data collected from July–August 1998 onward.
- Analyses: Twinspan, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) comparisons, and association analyses to identify community groups and indicator species.
- Key vegetation patterns: Dominant grasses include Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, and Nardus stricta; richness generally increases downslope; edge plots show indicator species (e.g., Deschampsia flexuosa, D. cespitosa); NVC alignment matches U4d and, in moister microhabitats, U5b; spatial patterns reflected by block/subplot indicators.

## Soil sampling and analysis
- Protocol: August 1998 plot-level description, 0–30 cm auger cores in a W pattern (pooled per plot); profile pits excavated above each block; horizon-focused analyses.
- Measured variables: Physical (weight, moisture loss, LOI), Chemical (%N, %C, C:N, exchangeable Ca/Mg/K/Na, pH H2O and CaCl2), horizon-specific data across FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, BCx, C, etc.
- Depths and horizons: Detailed horizon descriptions (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx, etc.) across multiple blocks; emphasis on horizon differentiation and color/mottling.
- Key soil findings: Broadly acidic, humic surface horizons with high LOI; Ca more concentrated in surface horizons in some blocks; strong relationships among %N, %C, C:N, moisture loss, LOI, and cations (Ca, Mg, Na, pH); noticeable block- and horizon-specific differences; PCA indicates major explanatory variables include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, moisture loss, and LOI (~70% variance) with pH contributing additional variation.

## Data governance and archiving
- Data management: Vegetation and soil datasets organized by block/plot; horizon- and subplot-level data documented; site-specific tables and appendices (Appendix A and related docs).
- Sample archiving: Long-term soil samples stored at CEH Merlewood at -80°C for future analyses.
- Data accessibility: Data linked to ECN/Micronet components; structured data flow supports cross-plot comparisons and temporal analyses; underlying data intended to support monitoring and policy-relevant assessments.

## Ecotron and implications for monitoring frameworks
- Integrated framework: Combines replicated, randomized management perturbation experiments with long-term ecological monitoring through ECN and Micronet, linking soil properties, vegetation composition, and microbial/biogeochemical dynamics.
- Practical implications for policy-oriented monitoring:
  - Highlights importance of baseline data, clearly defined treatments, and robust, standardized sampling for environmental health indicators.
  - Emphasizes data governance needs: metadata quality, data provenance, archiving, and data sharing within governance constraints.
  - Demonstrates a model for connecting field experiments with long-term environmental networks to inform land management and biodiversity policy.
- Overall contribution: Provides a comprehensive blueprint for monitoring frameworks that integrate experimental manipulation, long-term networks, standardized data collection, and governance to inform policy decisions.
