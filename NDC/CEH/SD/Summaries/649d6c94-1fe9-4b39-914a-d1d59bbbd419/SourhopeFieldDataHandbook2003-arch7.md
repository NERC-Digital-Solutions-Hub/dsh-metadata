## Data Identifiers and Organization
- MLURI Barcodes are used to uniquely identify each soil sample and horizon (e.g., Block 4 samples 4A–4F; Block 5 samples 5A–5F; ECOTRON sample 1).
- Horizon-specific data are linked to their corresponding horizon labels (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and subplot/plot identifiers.
- Vegetation data are organized by block and plot/subplot, enabling GIS-driven cross-tabulation with soil data.

## GIS-ready Outputs and Uses
- Potential map layers and products:
  - Horizon-level soil property maps by block (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with pH, %N, %C, C:N, base cations (Ca, Mg, K), moisture loss, LOI.
  - Plot-level and block-level vegetation maps, including NVC-like classifications and indicator species distributions.
  - Block 4 and Block 5 plot polygons with treatment/land-use attributes and ECOTRON subplots.
  - Soil drainage and horizon-depth rasters or polygons to show gradient effects on soil chemistry.
  - Climate overlays where available to support temporal analyses alongside soil and vegetation data.
- Data integration opportunities:
  - Link soil horizon data with vegetation composition by plot to explore soil-vegetation relationships.
  - Combine with ECN/Micronet context for cross-site comparisons and long-term environmental analyses.
- Quality and coverage notes:
  - Vegetation sampling coverage is limited in some plots (e.g., not all subplots sampled); use with caution for site-wide extrapolations.
  - Horizons show variability across blocks and horizons; document sampling extent and any anomalous values when performing GIS analyses.

## Practical Considerations for GIS Specialists
- Use MLURI barcodes as the primary key to join soil chemistry, horizon data, and vegetation observations to GIS features (plots, subplots, Ecotron subplots).
- Create a multi-layer schema:
  - Horizon layers (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges and associated chemistry/physical properties.
  - Plot-level attributes: block, subplot, treatment, and vegetation classifications.
  - ECOTRON layer: ECOTRON plot with separate soil and vegetation attributes.
  - Climate context layer to enable temporal trend analyses where monthly/annual data exist.
- Document sampling coverage and data quality within GIS metadata to aid end-users in interpreting spatial patterns.
