# SUMMARY

## Introduction
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity, in the context of links between soil biodiversity and plant communities.
- Site previously grazed; in 1998 fencing established to exclude all grazing. Five summer cuts each year planned; five plots receive specific treatments (fertilisation, lime, insecticide) plus control plots.
- Objectives include understanding functional changes in plant communities (beyond species lists) using functional classifications (CSR framework) and assessing how management (mowing, fertilisers, lime, insecticide) drives structure and productivity.
- Baseline community described as Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland with subsequent shifts expected under different treatments. Emphasis on potential declines in diversity in fertilised plots and shifts toward stress-tolerant or competitive species in unimproved plots.

## Methods (Incorporating Site Activity)
- Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots. Treatments allocated at random; ongoing site activity mapped to a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
- Treatments (Plot-level): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Management practices:
  - Site-wide mowing monthly May–Sept to ~6 cm.
  - Insecticide applied to Insecticide plots after mowing.
  - Spring applications of Nitrogen and/or Lime to designated plots.
- Data collection:
  - On-site Automatic Weather Station since Feb 1999; regular weather data.
  - Above-ground productivity via 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots; biomass dried and weighed post-mow (since 1999).
  - Baseline vegetation survey (July 1998) and annual/biannual point analyses (2000–2002) using a 100-point grid within 0.5 m2 cells.
  - Bryophyte identification (2002) and species lists; soil sampling for pH (5 cm depth), moisture (theta probe in 2002), and periodic soil parameter measurements.
  - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass samplings; extensive data managed by multiple research groups (Phase I and II projects).
- Research group activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork included labelled CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements; activity adjusted post foot-and-mouth restrictions.

## Treatments and Measurements
- Treatments applied as described above; detailed timelines and rates provided (Appendix 2).
- Key metrics:
  - Above-ground biomass (May–Sept harvests; annual totals; ln-transformed for analysis).
  - Plant species composition via point analysis (100-hole grid; relative hits by species).
  - Bryophyte abundance and diversity (2002 focus).
  - Shannon Diversity Index (across 1998 baseline and 2000–2002 surveys).
  - Functional group classification of plants (stress-tolerators S, CSR, SR/CSR; tracking shifts over time).
  - Soil pH and moisture, and their relationships to productivity.

## Key Findings

### Weather and Productivity Context
- 2002 had varied rainfall with low April and September rainfall but wet periods in February, July, and late-year; overall 2002 experienced higher year-round rainfall than some prior years.
- Winter 2001/02 was milder than previous winters.

### Above-ground Biomass and Treatment Effects
- Overall biomass across treatments showed a long-term increase from 1999 but a notable decline in 2002 relative to 2001.
- The Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots remained among the most productive, with Nitrogen or Lime alone providing less gain; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1.
- 2002 reductions relative to 2001 ranged from about 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2). A clear downslope effect was observed: Block 5 showed a 16% reduction, Block 1 a 30% reduction.
- The general pattern confirms a strong positive effect of combined nitrogen and lime on biomass, but potential signs of saturation or moisture constraints in the most fertilised plots.

### Soil pH, Moisture, and Productivity Linkages
- Lime application markedly increased soil pH to near 7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect; controls and insecticide plots remained near baseline pH.
- Soil moisture content was negatively correlated with soil pH; improved plots tended to be drier than unimproved ones.
- Across treatments, there is a positive overall relationship between higher soil pH and biomass productivity, but treatment-specific relationships vary:
  - In plots with nitrogen and lime, the positive pH–biomass link is weaker or may reverse, suggesting complex interactions with moisture and other factors.

### Plant Composition, Diversity, and Functional Groups
- Point analysis (2002) showed:
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) had higher hits of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis (accelerated pasture-associated grasses); unimproved plots had higher hits of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophytes, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, increased across the site, reaching ~19.9% of total hits in 2002 (up from ~10.8% in 2001).
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across treatments, possibly due to mowing homogenisation or other site-level factors.
- Diversity (Shannon index):
  - 2002: Nitrogen & Lime plots showed a 15% decline relative to baseline; all other treatments showed increases (ranging from ~2% to ~29%), suggesting fertiliser N&L tended to reduce diversity, while other treatments maintained or increased diversity.
- Functional groups (CSR framework):
  - Three dominant functional groups accounted for 69–95% of hits per plot.
  - By 2002, N&L plots were dominated by C-S-R species, reflecting a shift toward competitive and stress-tolerant traits under improved conditions.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide) showed relatively stronger representation of stress-tolerant species.
  - SR/C-S-R groups decreased under lime and insecticide treatments, consistent with disturbance reduction and altered nutrient regimes.
- Multivariate patterns (PCA of the 2002 point data) clearly separated lime-treated plots from others; some nitrogen-treated plots clustered with limed plots, while some nitrogen-treated plots aligned more with controls and insecticide plots.

### Insecticide and Trampling Effects
- Insecticide (Dursban 4) may be linked to higher diversity in some plots, consistent with indirect effects via herbivore suppression and relief of competitive pressure on palatable species; however, causation is not definitively established due to limited data on exact herbivory pressure.
- Trampling (C2 plots) coincided with a marked drop in productivity in 2002, likely due to intense activity during 13CO2 pulse experiments, highlighting potential negative effects of disturbance on biomass in certain plots.

## Discussion (Key Interpretations)
- 4.1 Mowing effect
  - Decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments suggests a site-wide response, potentially to mowing regime and homogeneous mowing height (6 cm) rather than to a specific treatment.
  - Festuca rubra expanded especially in fertile plots; mosses expanded broadly, possibly due to reduced disturbance and the maintained sward height.
- 4.2 Fertilisation effect
  - Fertilisation (N and/or Lime) consistently boosts above-ground biomass, with the strongest response when both N and Lime are applied.
  - High lime rates raise pH toward 7.0; potential moisture limitation and plant stress (chlorosis) observed in lime-rich plots suggest possible saturation effects and stress under very high pH and reduced moisture.
  - N&L plots show a shift toward competitive-stress tolerant (C-S-R) species, suggesting altered resource availability and a different functional composition, with potential long-term consequences for diversity.
- 4.3 Insecticide effect
  - The insecticide treatment’s influence on diversity aligns with theoretical expectations that herbivore suppression can modify plant community structure, but the direction and magnitude of effects depend on the balance of palatable and less-palatable species and overall nutrient status.
- 4.4 Trampling effect
  - The 2002 reduction in productivity in C2 plots is plausibly linked to trampling during 13CO2 pulse work, illustrating how disturbance intensity and timing can confound biomass measurements in experiments that include dramatic management interventions.

## Conclusion and Data Implications
- The Sourhope site demonstrates clear responses of plant productivity, species composition, and functional structure to mowing, fertilisation, lime application, and insecticide use.
- Fertilisation, especially when combined with lime, increases biomass but can reduce diversity and shift functional composition toward competitive-stress tolerant traits.
- Mowing and absence of grazing appear to favor stress-tolerant and bryophytic expansion, with declines in certain grasses (Agrostis spp.) that may be grazed-out or outcompeted under mowing regimes.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are suggestive but not definitively causal; further targeted analysis would help disentangle herbivore pressures from nutrient and disturbance effects.
- The study emphasizes the importance of considering site-level disturbance, nutrient status, and pH–moisture interactions when predicting community responses to management, and it provides extensive datasets (Appendices) for deeper data-driven exploration (species lists, biomass series, PCA loadings, etc.).
