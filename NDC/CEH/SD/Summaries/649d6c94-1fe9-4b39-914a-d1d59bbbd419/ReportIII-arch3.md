# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Intensive, long-term field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for allied studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Baseline established in 1998; ongoing measurements designed to support policy-relevant environmental health assessments.
- Monitoring plan documented with dates and types of measurements to facilitate cross-project links and comparisons.

## Monitoring design and data collection
- Experimental setup includes multiple plots with distinct nutrient and management treatments: Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide (B); organized in blocks/subplots.
- Data collection spans 1998–2001, with a defined schedule of activities and measurements (Table 1 references in the report).
- Data sources and management:
  - Automatic Weather Station on-site; data downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
  - Field measurements conducted with standardized protocols and periodic personnel, including cross-checks between surveyors.

## Measurements and methods
- Above-ground biomass
  - Five mowing occasions per summer; 0.5 m2 sub-samples per plot/subplot; biomass dried at 80°C and weighed.
  - Biomass totals summed yearly and ln-transformed for analyses (ANOVA).
  - Normalization against the C1 treatment used to identify sustained effects of nitrogen and lime.
- Soil pH
  - Measurements from the top 0–5 cm; lime increased pH over time (October 2001: 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N&L plots).
- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) to determine species presence and relative abundance.
  - 100-cell grid per cell; 25 pins per quadrat; species hits recorded and later analysed (including PCA).
  - Species codes used (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Fr = Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis = Pp, etc.).
- Additional observations
  - Separate surveys (minirhizotron, relative cover surveys) conducted for targeted projects.
- Data analysis
  - Split-plot ANOVA to evaluate treatment effects on biomass; year-to-year contrasts (1999–2000, 1999–2001).
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on point quadrat data to explore relationships among plots, treatments, and species.
  - Correlation analyses between species abundance (hits) and biomass.

## Data management and governance
- Data presented and disseminated via reports, charts, and dashboards aligned with a governance framework.
- Metadata quality and data availability highlighted as general monitoring challenges (in the broader context of monitoring frameworks), including the need for clear data provenance, accessibility, and openness.
- On-site data management supported by the Soil Biodiversity Programme; weather data specifically managed by CEH’s data manager.
- Transparency of methods and potential data-sharing considerations noted (public sharing of underlying data as a potential barrier in some contexts).

## Key results
- 2001 weather and productivity
  - Weather broadly unremarkable relative to long-term norms; rainfall near average; slight decrease in temperature and higher soil moisture vs. prior year.
  - Above-ground biomass peaked in July/August for all treatments; 2001 biomass higher than in previous years, likely due to personnel changes and a shift from manual to mechanical mowing.
  - Nitrogen and Lime generally produced the strongest biomass responses; the combination (N&L) often most pronounced.
- Soil pH responses
  - Liming continued to raise soil pH; N addition also raised pH, though less strongly; control plots showed little pH change since baseline (1998).
- Botanical composition and diversity
  - 2001 point quadrat data showed substantial changes in species composition across treatments.
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments; Festuca spp. increased across treatments, especially in fertilized plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilized plots (notably N and N&L); less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved controls.
  - Diversity: 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs. 18 in the Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential early diversity decline with more fertile plots.
  - PCA indicated clear separation between improved (N and/or L) plots and unimproved plots; biomass correlated with certain species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and inversely with others (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes).
  - Increased litter in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Biomass and site heterogeneity
  - Biomass distribution showed spatial heterogeneity: central plots and certain columns yielded higher cumulative biomass over 1999–2001.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant differences among blocks in biomass.

## Site heterogeneity and data interpretation
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across columns (e.g., right-hand side more acidic; central plots often higher biomass).
- Relationship between acidity and productivity suggests pH as a key driver of biomass production at the site.
- Despite heterogeneity, treatment effects (N and/or Lime) remained detectable against unimproved controls, supporting the robustness of the monitoring framework.

## Challenges and limitations
- External disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD):
  - Restricted site access from February to May 2001; sampling proceeded under protocol with vet oversight thereafter.
  - Minor disruption to management activities (one biocide application missed); general site operations otherwise maintained.
  - Personnel change (Officer in Charge) during 2001, with potential influence on measurement consistency and methods (noted as a consideration in interpretation).
- Data and metadata considerations
  - The report underscores broader monitoring challenges such as data availability, metadata adequacy, and transformation requirements to ensure data usability across years and studies.
  - Emphasizes need for standardized data governance to support long-term environmental health monitoring.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-metric monitoring approach spanning weather, biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition.
- Highlights the value of:
  - Replicated, controlled experimental designs with clear treatment definitions.
  - Standardized, repeatable measurement protocols to facilitate cross-year comparisons.
  - Data normalization and appropriate statistical analyses to detect genuine treatment effects amid site heterogeneity.
  - Documentation of external disruptions and personnel changes to preserve interpretability of long-term datasets.
  - Ongoing data management and governance practices to enable data sharing, provenance, and reuse across monitoring programs.
