# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Detailed soil profile descriptions and laboratory analyses for BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 of Rigg Foot, Sourhope, including auger samples and vegetation surveys.
- Data are organized by horizon with depth ranges, color and structure notes, and boundary descriptions.
- Analyses cover soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture metrics, loss on ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2), and related properties.
- Ancillary data include site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage), soil series, parent material, rock types, and horizon-specific notes.
- Datasets are linked to barcode/ID systems (MLURI Barcode) and include both profile-level and horizon-level measurements.
- An ECOTRON plot section exists with soil analyses and vegetation survey data, enabling controlled-environment comparisons.

## Data Contents by Component

- BLOCK 4
  - Soil profile horizons (examples): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous organic-rich horizons, roots, structure (blocky to platy), mineral and igneous stone content.
  - Soil analysis per horizon includes: weight (mg), %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Auger samples (4A–4F) with %N/%C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH values.
  - Vegetation data per plot, including species counts and totals, across subplots.
  - Site context: MLURI barcodes tied to horizon data; multiple horizons have unique identifiers.

- BLOCK 5
  - Soil profile horizons (examples): LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with depths up to 100 cm; horizon names show more detailed mottling and gleying in deeper layers.
  - Descriptions note fibrous and semi-fibrous horizons, mottles, and abundant igneous stones; deeper horizons show clay loam to clay content with prominent mottling.
  - Soil analysis per horizon includes identical variables as Block 4 (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
  - Auger samples (5A–5F) with identical chemical/physical measurements.
  - Vegetation data per plot with species counts, totals, and per-subplot summaries.
  - Site details for Block 5 include grid coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and bedrock context.

- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Targeted soil analysis (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2) for a controlled plot.
  - Vegetation survey data aligned to ECOTRON plots, capturing species presence and abundance patterns.

## Data Formats, Identifiers, and Provenance

- Horizon and depth conventions:
  - Profiles divided into discrete horizons with explicit depth ranges (e.g., LF 0–1 cm, FH 1–4 cm, etc.).
  - Specific horizon labels reflect local soil taxonomy (e.g., Ah, Bg, BCg) and color/mottling descriptions.

- Coding and labeling:
  - MLURI Barcodes accompany each horizon/ sample (e.g., FH = 603951, Ah = 603953, etc.).
  - Auger samples labeled with lettered identifiers (4A–4F, 5A–5F) and corresponding barcodes.
  - Vegetation and plot data organized by block, plot, and subplot IDs (e.g., PLOT 4A, Ac, Ao, At, etc.).

- Data scope and linkage:
  - Data integrates soil profiles, auger analyses, vegetation surveys, and ECOTRON datasets.
  - Site context (grid references NT8544019520, altitude, slope, drainage) is provided for reproducibility and spatial analyses.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Provenance

- Data completeness:
  - Some fields use missing-value markers (.) for several variables across horizons and auger samples, indicating incomplete data in places.
  - Horizon nomenclature and boundary descriptions vary slightly between blocks, which may affect cross-block comparability without harmonized metadata.

- QA considerations:
  - Consistency between horizon depths, descriptive terms, and analytical results is essential for reliable interpretation.
  - Cross-reference of MLURI barcodes with horizon labels is critical to maintain traceability of measurements to the correct horizon and plot.

- Provenance:
  - Data are tied to field collection events, horizon sampling, and lab analyses, with archived sample handling implied (e.g., LOI, moisture loss, pH measurements).

## Practical Takeaways for Data Stewards

- Metadata and standardization
  - Maintain consistent horizon naming conventions and ensure alignment between profile descriptions and analytical results.
  - Use unified data schemas for all blocks (4 and 5) to enable straightforward cross-block comparisons.

- Provenance and traceability
  - Preserve and clearly document barcode-to-horizon-to-plot mappings (MLURI Barcodes, horizon IDs, plot IDs).
  - Capture sampling dates, depth intervals, and boundary definitions to support reproducibility and longitudinal analyses.

- Data quality and completeness
  - Implement QA/QC checks to address missing values and ensure consistent reporting across blocks and auger samples.
  - Create data dictionaries and appendices that explain horizon codes (e.g., LF, FH, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and measurement methods.

- Data storage and accessibility
  - Ensure long-term storage of both physical samples (where applicable) and digital data with proper provenance and versioning.
  - Link soil data to associated vegetation datasets and ECOTRON results to support integrated environmental-change analyses.

- Usage and reuse
  - The dataset provides a valuable baseline for soil chemistry-vegetation relationships and long-term soil Profiling studies; ensure clear guidance for future researchers on data scope, limitations, and harmonization needs.
