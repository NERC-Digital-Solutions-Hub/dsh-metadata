REPORT III
RESULTS FROM SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

# Overview
- Large field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Intensive, plot-based monitoring to link management, soil chemistry, biomass, and plant community composition.
- Data collected across 1999–2001, with annual and seasonal measurements, plus an Automatic Weather Station.

# Spatial Design and Data Collected (GIS-ready perspective)
- Experimental layout: multiple plots arranged in blocks with sub-plots and specific treatments (Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide).
- Key data layers for mapping:
  - Plot-level treatments and block structure.
  - Above-ground biomass (seasonal sums and annual totals; 1999–2001).
  - Surface soil pH (0–5 cm) and changes over time.
  - Botanical composition from Point Quadrat surveys (species hits; detailed species list).
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture).
- Temporal resolution: annual (2001 comparisons to 1999–2000) and within-year monthly biomass data (May–Sept).
- Noted site-wide events affecting data collection (FMD-related restrictions in 2001; change of site Officer in Charge).

# Climate and Environmental Context (2001)
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average (839 mm) after a very wet 2000 year; radiation stable; mean temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
- Soil moisture at 0–20 cm somewhat higher in 2001.

# Above-ground Biomass (2.2)
- General pattern: peak biomass in July–August across treatments.
- 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase relative to 2000.
  - Attributed to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Treatment effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions increased biomass compared with controls.
  - Nitrogen plus Lime often most effective at promoting biomass.
- Statistical findings:
  - ANOVA (ln-transformed biomass): significant differences between improved (N and/or L) and non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- Interpretation: soil fertilization and liming enhance productivity; management changes influenced absolute biomass in 2001.

# Soil pH (2.3)
- Lime raised topsoil pH (0–5 cm):
  - Limed plots: ~6.19 (Oct 2001).
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L) plots: ~6.38 (Oct 2001).
- Nitrogen alone also increased pH, but less than lime.
- Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (Aug 1998).

# Botanical Composition (2.4)
- Survey method consistent with 2000; 2001 data show:
  - 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in improved plots (N, L, N&L).
  - Agrostis capillaris most abundant in 2000 but declined across all plots in 2001; remained dominant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in fertilized plots (Festuca ovina in N; Festuca rubra in N&L).
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) enriched in fertilized plots; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated plots.
- Diversity signals:
  - Higher species richness in unimproved plots; potential early signs of diversity decline in most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows treatment-driven separation: nitrogen and/or lime plots cluster away from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots show greater association with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus spp.
- Biomass-links:
  - Positive correlation between abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with biomass.
  - Inverse trends for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with increasing biomass.
  - Higher nitrogen and/or lime treatments associated with more litter, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

# Site Heterogeneity (3.1–3.2)
- Spatial heterogeneity observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F showed more acidic conditions; underlying gradient suggested, though amplified by treatment/proportion of unimproved plots in those columns.
- Biomass distribution:
  - Outlying plots with low biomass across treatments tended to align with edge/less central locations; centrally located plots often had higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- pH–biomass relationship:
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- Block effects:
  - No significant differences in biomass between blocks (ANOVA).

# Data and Interpretation Notes
- Management and methodological changes affected comparability across years (e.g., mowing method shift in 2001).
- FMD-related access restrictions in 2001 limited site visits but critical management activities proceeded under protocol.

# Implications for GIS and Data Visualization
- Build multi-layer map representing:
  - Treatment layers by plot over time (1999–2001).
  - pH change maps by year, highlighting lime- and nitrogen-influenced plots.
  - Biomass heatmaps per year, with time-series animation to show 1999–2001 trends.
  - Species-dominance maps derived from Point Quadrat data, with PCA-based groupings to illustrate treatment-driven community shifts.
  - Spatial heterogeneity layer to reveal column/zone effects (e.g., pH gradients, central-vs-edge biomass patterns).
- Integrate weather data with plot-level responses to explore climate influence on biomass and pH changes.
- Use interactive dashboards to compare treatments within blocks and to track year-to-year changes, accounting for management changes.

# Summary of Key Conclusions
- Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments consistently promote above-ground biomass and raise soil pH; Nitrogen alone also contributes but to a lesser extent.
- 2001 biomass increase is linked to management changes (switch to mechanical cutting) in addition to treatment effects.
- Plant community composition shifts toward more fertilized-associated species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in improved plots; diversity appears higher in unimproved plots.
- There is a clear spatial pattern: central plots tend to have higher biomass; a positive link exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
- The site exhibits notable heterogeneity across columns, which should be incorporated into map-based data products to avoid overgeneralization.
