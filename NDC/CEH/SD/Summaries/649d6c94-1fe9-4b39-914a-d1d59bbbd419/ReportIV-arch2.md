# Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large Sourhope field experiment in the Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, while monitoring above-ground productivity, species composition and diversity in relation to management treatments.
- Treatments examined include mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and an insecticide, with six plot-level treatments plus controls across five replicate blocks.
- Data collected from 1999–2002 cover weather, above-ground biomass, soil chemistry, moisture, bryophytes, and detailed plant surveys, enabling analysis of treatment effects and environmental interactions.

## Site, treatments and data collection

- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient.
- Treatments (applied to sub-plots within main plots): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Management: site-wide mowing to ~6 cm from May–Sept; insecticide applied after mowing; nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring.
- Data collection methods:
  - Automated Weather Station for climate data since 1999.
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 sampling units within sub-plots, clipped prior to mowing, dried and weighed.
  - Baseline and repeated plant surveys using 0.5 m2 cells and 100-point grid (point analysis) with bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002.
  - Soil sampling for pH and moisture; pH measured in 5 cm depth; moisture via theta probe in plant survey cells.
- Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork including CO2 pulse experiments and trace-gas measurements.

## Major findings by theme

### Mowing effects
- Regular mowing (6 cm) and removal of grazing disturbance favored Festuca rubra in fertilised plots, while Agrostis spp. declined (Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by >40% since 2000, across all treatments).
- Stress-tolerant species expanded under most conditions, especially in unfertilised plots.
- Bryophytes expanded across the site, linked to maintained sward height and absence of grazing; mosses contributed to increased bryophyte hits in 2002.

### Fertilisation effects
- Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increased above-ground biomass (productivity); plots with both N and lime (N&L) were the most productive, though signs of possible productivity peaking in these plots emerged by 2002.
- Liming raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil layer; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
- High lime and high pH, coupled with lower soil moisture in fertilised plots, may have contributed to plant stress during dry periods.
- Functional composition shifted with fertilisation: CSR-type (competitive-stress-ruderal) and SR/CSR groups expanded in N&L plots; stress-tolerators (S) dominated in unimproved plots.

### Insecticide effects
- Shannon diversity was highest in insecticide-treated plots in 2002, though evidence for a direct causal link to reduced herbivory is circumstantial.
- The pattern aligns with some prior studies suggesting insect herbivory impacts on plant diversity, varying with insecticide type and plant life history; proposed mechanism is increased establishment of palatable species when herbivory is reduced, under relatively infertile conditions.

### Trampling effect
- In 2002, C2 plots (non-treatment) showed strong productivity declines attributed to trampling during intense activity associated with labelled CO2 pulses, indicating an artefact of experimental manipulation on vegetation growth in those plots.

## Plant community functional structure (CSR framework)

- Plant functional groups tracked over time: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
- By 2002, consistent treatment differences emerged:
  - N&L plots: CSR-dominated; strong growth and competitiveness under improved conditions.
  - Unfertilised/un-disturbed plots: S-dominated; stress-tolerant species benefited from lower nutrients and disturbance.
  - Lime-rich plots: SR/CSR and related groups reduced, indicating shifts away from ruderal traits in high-pH environments.
- Across years, the CSR framework helped explain shifts in biodiversity and productivity linked to soil fertility and disturbance regimes.

## Biomass and productivity trends

- 2002 biomass fell relative to 2001 for many treatments, yet the long-term trend from 1999–2002 shows an overall increase in productivity across treatments.
- Fertilised plots (especially N&L) remained the most productive; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than fertilised plots.
- Block effects related to slope; lower slope blocks showed larger proportional declines in biomass, indicating microtopography influences productivity.

## Diversity and species composition

- Point analysis shows improved plots dominated by Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while unimproved plots remained dominated by Agrostis spp. and related taxa.
- Bryophyte frequency (especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across treatments, contributing to higher bryophyte hits in 2001–2002.
- Drier, more fertile plots favored graminoids associated with improved pastures; unimproved plots maintained more native/fertility-limited communities.
- Shannon diversity declined in 2002 for nitrogen-and-lime plots relative to other treatments, while insecticide plots showed diversity increases.
- PCA of point analysis data separated improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated samples clustering distinctly; some nitrogen-treated samples also clustering with limed plots.

## Environmental drivers and relationships

- Lime addition produced a strong and significant rise in soil pH (toward 7.0) in the upper soil layer; moisture content negatively correlated with pH (r ≈ -0.68).
- A positive relationship exists between soil pH and above-ground productivity when considering all plots, though within individual treatments this relationship can flatten or reverse (notably in N+L plots).
- Higher soil pH with lime tended to favor competitive-ruderal traits, while more acidic, less disturbed plots favored stress-tolerant species.
- Drought stress likely contributed to chlorosis in highly fertilised plots during dry periods.

## Data management and accessibility

- The site has produced 11,621 soil samples to date (1998–2002 data cumulative).
- Comprehensive data streams exist from:
  - On-site weather data (1999–2002)
  - 0.5 m2 biomass sampling (1999–2002)
  - Point analysis surveys (baseline 1998; 2000–2002)
  - Soil pH and moisture measurements
- Full project details and datasets are available through the Soil Biodiversity website and via the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (Windermere Road).
- The programme comprises sixteen Phase I projects and eight Phase II projects with fieldwork conducted at Sourhope in 2002, including CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements.
- Some 2002 data are incomplete due to a weather-station malfunction; replacements from a nearby station were used for missing periods.

## Implications for monitoring and data reuse

- Value can be increased by integrating this site data with other environmental datasets (e.g., climate, land-use history) to explore broader soil-plant interactions.
- Ensuring access to and interoperability of underlying data (biomass, species hits, functional group classifications, and environmental measurements) supports policy assessment and cross-site comparisons.
