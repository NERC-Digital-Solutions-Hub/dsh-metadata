# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope ( Scottish Borders ) to understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, linking below-ground processes to above-ground plant communities.
  - Site originally a Festuca ovina–Agrostis capillaris–Galium saxatile grassland (NVC U4d). Research integrates 24 Phase I projects and 8 Phase II projects, spanning soil structure, nutrient cycles, micro- and macro-fauna, and plant interactions.
  - Vegetation monitoring includes above-ground productivity (biomass), species composition, and diversity; grazing ceased in 1998 with a mowing regime introduced in 1999. Five treatments distinguish fertilised (N and/or lime) from unfertilised plots; a separate Insecticide (Dursban 4) plots exist; data are used to assess how management changes affect community composition and function.

- Study design and data collection (Methods incorporating site activity)
  - Rigg Foot Sourhope site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells allocated to research groups.
  - Treatments (plot level): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatment); Nitrogen; Lime; Nitrogen & Lime; Insecticide.
  - Management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied post-mowing to Insecticide plots; spring applications of Nitrogen and/or Lime as per schedule.
  - Data collected since 1999: automatic weather data; above-ground biomass (within 0.5 m2 cells prior to each mow); baseline vegetation survey (1998); annual Point Analysis surveys (2000–2002) using a 100-hole grid; soil pH (0–5 cm), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002); supplementary surveys on biomass, bryophytes, litter, and species lists.
  - Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork included extensive sampling and use of labelled 13CO2 pulses with CEH labs.

- Key results (biomass, diversity, and soil-plant interactions)
  - Above-ground productivity
    - A consistent treatment hierarchy remained through 2002, with highest biomass in plots receiving both Nitrogen and Lime.
    - In 2002, biomass declined across most treatments relative to 2001, with Control 2 showing the largest drop; slope position also influenced productivity (lower on steeper blocks).
    - Overall long-term trend shows increasing biomass from 1999 to 2002 when compared to the starting point, despite 2002 declines.
  - Soil pH and moisture interactions
    - Lime markedly increased soil pH to near 7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen also raised pH slightly.
    - Moisture and pH are negatively correlated; higher pH plots tended to be drier.
    - Biomass correlates positively with higher pH when considering all treatments, but the relationship is treatment-specific (positive for some; weaker or reversed when both N and Lime are added).
  - Point Analysis and community composition
    - 2002 point analysis shows treatment differences in plant hits: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more frequent in fertilised/improved plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum more frequent in unimproved plots.
    - Bryophyte abundance (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across the site, especially in unimproved plots; bryophyte contribution to total hits rose from 6–11% (2000–2001) to ~20% in 2002.
    - Dominant vascular plants remain Agrostis spp., but relative abundance of Festuca rubra increased in fertile plots.
    - Shannon diversity indices showed treatment differences emerging from 2000 and becoming more pronounced in 2001–2002; overall 2002 index fell by about 15% in the Nitrogen & Lime plots versus increases in other treatments.
    - Functional groups analysis (CSR framework): stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress (C-S-R), and stress-ruderal (SR/CSR) groups accounted for the majority of hits; C-S-R species expanded in Nitrogen & Lime plots, while S species dominated unimproved plots; SR/CSR decreased in lime- and insecticide-treated plots by 2002.
  - Trampling and insecticide effects
    - The 2002 C2 plots (first-time sampling) showed notable productivity reductions, likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments, rather than treatment effects alone.
    - Insecticide’s effect on diversity aligns with some prior herbivory studies, suggesting possible indirect benefits to a subset of palatable species in a relatively infertile environment, though direct causation with diversity remains uncertain.

- Data integrity, limitations, and notes for practitioners
  - 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to weather-station malfunction; data replaced from nearby stations during gaps.
  - Data span long-term, with multi-year, multi-treatment design enabling robust cross-treatment comparisons; however, site-specific factors (e.g., mowing vs grazing) strongly influence community dynamics.

- Implications for data strategy and governance (relevant to Data Leaders)
  - Demonstrates the value of integrated, longitudinal data capturing both above- and below-ground responses to management.
  - Highlights the need for standardized, well-documented metadata (treatment regimes, sampling methods, timing, and units) to enable cross-project comparisons and meta-analyses.
  - Illustrates the utility of multiple complementary data streams (biomass, point analysis, soil chemistry, moisture, bryophyte surveys) and advanced analyses (PCA, CSR functional grouping, diversity indices) to interpret complex ecological responses.
  - Underlines challenges of data gaps (e.g., weather station outages) and the importance of data continuity plans and cross-site data sharing.
  - Suggests value in transparent reporting of treatment-by-year interactions and site-level factors (e.g., mowing regime, disturbance) for data-driven decision-making in ecosystem management.

- References and appendices (context for data assets)
  - Extensive appendices provide site maps, treatment summaries, species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes), weather data, biomass records, and analytical figures (e.g., PCA, ANOVA tables) to support future data reuse and replication.
