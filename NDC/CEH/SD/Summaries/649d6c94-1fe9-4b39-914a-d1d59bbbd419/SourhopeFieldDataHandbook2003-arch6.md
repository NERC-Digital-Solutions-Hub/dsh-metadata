# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview

- Provides soil profiles, soil chemical analyses, and vegetation survey data from Sourhope field site.
- Covers Block 4, Block 5, and ECOTRON plots with detailed horizons, lab measurements, and plot-level vegetation counts.
- Data collected to support long-term studies of soil–plant interactions, biodiversity, and responses to management.

## Site context and data scope

- Sourhope field site details (Block 5 section):
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude: 315 m; Slope: about 5 degrees; Imperfect drainage.
  - Major soil subtype: Brown forest soil with gleying; Rock types include undifferentiated intermediate igneous/andesite.
  - Site classification and parent materials documented for cross-block comparisons.
- Data scope includes:
  - Soil profiles with horizon descriptions and color/structure notes.
  - Laboratory soil analyses (nutrient elements, C/N, moisture-related metrics, pH, etc.).
  - AUGER samples across horizons with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH.
  - Vegetation sampling by plot (presence/absence data, species totals, and community classification insights).

## Data by blocks and plots

- Block 4 (Block 4, soil and vegetation data):
  - Site details: Block 4 with multiple horizons in several sub-models (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx).
  - Soil profiles include descriptions such as fibrous textures, moist conditions, granite/andesite-derived stones, and horizon boundaries (clear smooth or wavy).
  - Auger/samples provide a suite of chemical properties across horizons (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg; % moisture loss; % LOI; pH H2O and pH CaCl2).
  - Vegetation data per plot (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, etc.) with presence/absence and counts for a variety of taxa; community indicators and total species tallies documented.
- Block 5 (Block 5, soil and vegetation data):
  - Site details: Block 5 with grid coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage; major soil subgroups and rock types described.
  - Soil profiles span horizons such as LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, with color/mottling and structure notes.
  - Auger samples (5A–5F) with detailed metrics: %N, %C, C:N ratios, Ca/Na/K/Mg, % moisture loss, % LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Vegetation data per plot (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) including species totals and counts across subplots, enabling community-level interpretation.
- ECOTRON plots (special controlled-environment sub-site):
  - Soil analysis shows baseline values for Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH.
  - Vegetation survey data captured by subplots (Ac, Ao, At, Br, etc.) indicating which species are present and their counts in controlled conditions.

## Data formats and measurements

- Horizons and descriptions:
  - LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc., with depth in cm and qualitative soil descriptions (texture, roots, moisture, boundary types, mottling).
- Chemical and physical analyses:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition (LOI); pH (H2O) and pH CaCl2.
  - Sample weights (Wt mg) and MLURI barcodes for traceability.
- Vegetation data:
  - Plot-level species tallies and totals by subplot; presence/absence and abundance notes; indicative community classification (e.g., NVC associations) and indicator species.
- Data provenance and storage:
  - Standardized barcoding (MLURI Barcodes) for all samples; archival storage at CEH Merlewood (−80°C) and linkage to MLURI server data.
  - Outputs include detailed tables, figure sets, and appendices (e.g., Appendix A) supporting block-level data snapshots.

## Data quality, limitations, and caveats

- Sampling coverage:
  - Block datasets often comprise a subset of plots/horizons (e.g., multiple horizons per plot, but some plots not fully sampled); results are indicative where sampling is incomplete.
- Variability and anomalies:
  - Block-level soil chemistry and horizon structure show notable variability; some horizons exhibit anomalous values requiring careful normalization for cross-block comparisons.
- Complex design considerations:
  - Multi-block layout with overlapping treatments and microhabitats; cross-plot comparisons require context about slope, depth, and horizon properties.

## Data management, accessibility, and usage

- Data provenance and storage:
  - Samples and analyses tracked with MLURI barcodes; archived material stored at CEH Merlewood for long-term access.
- Accessibility for data use:
  - Rich, multi-dimensional datasets suitable for dashboards and self-serve exploration; outputs organized into plot-level vegetation data, horizon-level soil chemistry, and community classifications.
- Practical use cases for data support:
  - Linking vegetation metrics to soil chemistry and microtopography.
  - Supporting long-term ecological modelling, land-use planning, and biodiversity assessments.
  - Enabling cross-site comparisons within Sourhope and with ECOTRON datasets for climate/management impact analyses.

## Practical takeaways for data producers and users

- Leverage horizon-level and plot-level data to compare treatments, slopes, and microhabitats.
- Use Horizon descriptions and measured properties to contextualize vegetation results (e.g., indicator species by soil depth and pH).
- Be mindful of sampling limitations; treat some findings as indicative rather than exhaustive.
- Exploit archived soil samples for future re-analysis as methods advance or new hypotheses arise.
- Integrate block and ECOTRON data with environmental monitoring datasets to support broader ecological analyses and policy-relevant insights.
