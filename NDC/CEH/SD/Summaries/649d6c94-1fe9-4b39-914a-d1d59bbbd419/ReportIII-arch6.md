# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aim: provide broad context data to link with topic-specific studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
- Publication documents data collection, management events, and results across multiple measurements (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical composition).

## Data Collected and Methods (What was measured and how)
- Site management and design
  - Long-term field experiment with sub-plots receiving treatments: Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Biocide, and Controls.
  - Regular measurements planned over several years; data presented to facilitate cross-study comparisons.
  - 2001 site activities affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions; routine activities resumed under protocol; change of Officer in Charge.
- Automatic Weather Station
  - Annual headline measures: rainfall, radiation, air and soil temperatures, soil moisture.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Regular summer harvests (May–Sept) across treatments; biomass sums over five mowing occasions per year.
  - Data normalized to a reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects year-to-year.
  - Statistical analysis: split-plot ANOVA; log-transformed biomass; assessment of year effects and treatment interactions.
- Soil pH
  - Upper 0–5 cm pH measurements; impact of lime and nitrogen on pH over time.
- Botanical composition
  - Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) across plots; plant species identified and tallied as hits.
  - Species tracked across treatments; diversity metrics reported (24 vs 18 species in certain plots).
  - Multivariate analysis: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to examine shifts in community composition.
  - Correlation of species abundance with biomass to interpret productivity signals.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation in soil pH and biomass across site columns and blocks.
  - Examination of central vs peripheral plots and potential pH-biomass relationships.

## Key Findings

- Automatic Weather Station (2001)
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar to prior years; slightly cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture than previous years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass by treatment across the sampling period; peak biomass typically in July/August.
  - 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase relative to earlier years, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Nitrogen and Lime (especially Nitrogen + Lime) most strongly promoted biomass; significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - Block effects were not significant.
- Soil pH
  - Lime addition elevated soil pH; in October 2001, limed plots averaged about 6.19 and Nitrogen + Lime plots about 6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since baseline (1998).
- Botanical composition
  - 2001 Point Quadrat results: no significant surveyor differences; higher total hits in 2001 (suggesting denser sward, possibly from grazing stock removal in 1998).
  - Distinct treatment effects on dominant species:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
    - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; F. rubra particularly associated with lime-treated plots.
    - Improved pastures species (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more common in fertilized plots, especially Nitrogen + Lime.
    - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
  - Diversity trends: unimproved plots harbored more species (24) than the Nitrogen + Lime plot (18), suggesting a possible decline in diversity with the most improved plots.
  - PCA showed clear separation of improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved (Control and Biocide); biomass positively linked with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Biomass correlation: higher biomass plots tended to have higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; conversely, abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased.
  - Litter incidence increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial pH variation: columns E and F (sloping right side) tended to be more acidic, especially among Nitrogen and/or Lime plots.
  - Biomass distribution showed outliers with lower biomass in certain plots; higher biomass often in more central plots.
  - Positive correlation between surface pH and biomass; no significant difference in biomass across blocks.
  
## Data Quality, Context, and Interpretation

- Data consistency and comparability
  - Cross-year comparability supported by consistent measurement protocols and normalization against C1.
  - Inter-observer reliability demonstrated: no significant difference between surveyors in 2001 Point Quadrat survey.
- External factors and data interpretation
  - FMD restrictions in 2001 affected visitor access and sampling schedule; management and sampling operated under veterinary protocol.
  - Change in site officer and shift from manual mowing to mechanical shears in 2001 introduced a known bias in biomass estimates, addressed via normalization.
- Data scope and accessibility
  - Data presented include weather metrics, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition with supporting figures (1–9) and tables (1–6) and Appendix 1.
  - Analyses show treatment effects, year-to-year dynamics, and spatial heterogeneity, enabling integration with other studies within the Soil Biodiversity field experiment.

## Implications for Data Use

- Fertilization and liming increase productivity and raise soil pH, with the Nitrogen + Lime combination yielding the strongest above-ground biomass response.
- Community composition shifts toward species associated with improved pastures in fertilized plots; diversity may decline as fertility increases.
- Spatial heterogeneity and pH-biomass relationships should be considered when pooling data across the site or comparing plots.
- Data handling notes (normalization, cross-year comparisons, and documentation of external disruptions) are essential for accurate interpretation and integration with broader analyses.
