# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- A NERC Soil Biodiversity thematic programme field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, focusing on long-term monitoring of soil biodiversity and vegetation under varying treatments.
- Datasets include automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition (Point Analysis).
- Measurement periods span 1999–2001, with a baseline described in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Data are intended for cross-year comparisons and linking with other research groups’ data.

## Data Collection and Management
- Measurements collected by the Macaulay Institute at Sourhope; data uploaded to a central data manager (CEH) and documented for access and reuse.
- Main data types:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (Table 3).
  - Above-ground biomass from multiple mowing occasions (May–September) across subplots (Figure 1, Table 4).
  - Soil pH measurements (upper 0–5 cm; Figure 3).
  - Botanical composition via Point Analysis surveys (July 2001; Figure 4; Tables 6).
- Experimental design includes multiple treatments (Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide) across blocks and subplots (S, T, U, V).
- 2001 field activity was influenced by:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limiting site visits (Feb–May 2001).
  - A change in site Officer in Charge (May 2001).
  - Partial disruption to one biocide application (May 2001), with subsequent applications completed.

## Data Quality and Processing
- Consistency checks show no significant difference between surveyors in 2001 Point Quadrat data (ANOVA: F=1.90; p=0.18 NS).
- Biomass data processing:
  - 2001 biomass estimates increased, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass data were ln-transformed for ANOVA to assess treatment effects (Tables 4–5).
  - Normalization against a control plot (C1) used to compare year-to-year treatment effects (Figure 2).
- Statistical analyses:
  - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant treatment-by-year interactions; blocks not significant (Table 4, Table 5).
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to 2001 Point Quadrat data to explore shifts in plant communities (Figure 5).
- Protocol notes:
  - Soil sampling used 0–5 cm depth; pH measured in water; biomass harvested during five mowing events per summer; standardised clippings and drying procedures.
  - In 2001, measurement methods saw a shift to mechanical cutting, affecting biomass metrics and requiring careful interpretation for cross-year comparability.

## Data Availability and Access
- Weather and site data are transmitted to the CEH Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; detailed schedules and methods are documented (Tables 1–3, Appendix 1).
- Data provenance includes explicit recording of measurement dates, mowing schedules, and survey procedures to support reuse and reproducibility.

## Key Findings Relevant to Data Stewardship
- Biomass response:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments promoted above-ground biomass; Nitrogen plus Lime often most effective.
  - 2001 showed a notable biomass increase relative to 2000, partially attributed to methodological changes.
- Soil chemistry:
  - Lime addition strongly increased soil pH; Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change in baseline pH since 1998.
- Vegetation composition:
  - In fertilised plots, Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis became more dominant; Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001.
  - Improved plots tended to host species associated with higher fertility; unimproved plots maintained more distant species (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
  - Species richness varied by treatment; unimproved plots contained more species than highly improved plots (24 vs 18 in 2001 for specified treatments).
  - PCA showed clear separation between nitrogen/lime treated plots and unimproved/biocide plots.
  - Biomass correlated with shifts in species composition: higher Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass; bryophyte-dominated assemblages linked to lower biomass.
- Site heterogeneity:
  - Spatial variation across columns and plots observed; some columns exhibited more acidic plots, aligning with lower pH in nitrogen- and lime-treated columns.
  - Biomass correlated positively with surface pH; central plots often showed higher biomass.
- Environmental context:
  - 2001 conditions included a near-average rainfall year following a very wet previous year; measures of radiation and temperature showed modest year-to-year changes.

## Challenges and Governance Considerations
- Incomplete mapping of user needs and priorities; ensuring data capture supports diverse research questions.
- Timely acquisition of data from field sites and willingness of data creators to meet standards (metadata and format consistency).
- Interoperability across multiple systems and data formats; adjustments due to methodological changes (e.g., 2001 cutting method) impacting cross-year comparability.
- Large and heterogeneous datasets spanning multiple years and measurement types; documentation and version control essential.
- External disruptions (FMD restrictions) and organizational changes (Officer in Charge) that affect data collection consistency and metadata.

## Recommendations for Data Governance and Future Work
- Maintain thorough metadata documenting:
  - Measurement protocols, equipment changes (e.g., switch to mechanical shears in 2001), and any deviations from baseline procedures.
  - Field disruption events (e.g., FMD-related access restrictions) and their impact on data collection.
  - Treatment definitions, plot layout, block structure, and data transformations (e.g., ln-transform of biomass).
- Ensure data versioning and clear provenance to support cross-year analyses and reproducibility.
- Preserve cross-referencing between datasets (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical surveys) to enable integrated analyses.
- Create standardized data schemas and controlled vocabularies for species codes and treatment labels to facilitate interoperability.
- Provide user guides or data dictionaries to help external researchers understand context, units, and processing steps.
- Plan for ongoing data curation to maintain accessibility as datasets grow and methodologies evolve.
