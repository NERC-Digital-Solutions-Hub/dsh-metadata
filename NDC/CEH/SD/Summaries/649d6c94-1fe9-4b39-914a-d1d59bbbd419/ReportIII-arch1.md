# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Location: Sourhope field site, Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders; part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: Intensive, multi-parameter monitoring to contextualise detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
- 2001 operational context: two management disruptions
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site access; core sampling resumed under a vetted protocol.
  - Change of site Officer in Charge (May 2001).
- Management plan: Continued 2001 sampling per the Site Management Plan; several measurements (liming, nitrogen, pH, biomass, biodiversity surveys) maintained despite disruptions.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near long-term average after the very wet previous year.
- Radiation and average temperatures showed only modest changes; soil moisture slightly higher than in preceding years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass, with peak production in July–August each year.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass analysis normalised to C1 (control) to assess treatment impact:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions consistently boosted biomass relative to controls.
  - Nitrogen plus Lime gave the strongest biomass response.
- Statistical findings (ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass):
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime application continued to raise surface pH (0–5 cm) over time.
  - October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen+Lime plots ~6.38.
  - Nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control plots remained near baseline (Aug 1998).
  
### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis: protocol consistent with 2000; high inter-surveyor consistency (no significant surveyor bias).
- 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments, indicating denser sward, possibly from grazing stock removal in 1998.
- Treatment effects on species:
  - Agrostis capillaris most abundant across all treatments in 2000, declined in 2001; remained dominant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (Festuca rubra in N and N&L; Festuca ovina in N).
  - Fertilised plots (especially N&L) showed more species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis); control plots favoured less fertile associates (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Diversity:
  - Unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; Nitrogen+Lime plots had 18 species, suggesting reduced diversity with fertility enhancement.
- Multivariate analysis:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Unimproved plots tended to cluster with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus), Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed greater association with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Biomass vs species relative abundance:
  - Positive correlation: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis with higher biomass.
  - Negative correlation: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis with higher biomass.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slope-facing) tended to have more acidic plots, though confounded by higher proportions of Control/Biocide plots in these columns.
- Underlying spatial structure suggested: low pH measures in columns with N and/or Lime treatments in these areas.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution showed spatial patterning:
  - Outlying plots had the lowest biomass across treatments (e.g., various Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Biocide plots).
  - Higher biomass generally in more central plots (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- A strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical note: non-significant block effects).
