# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview of data scope and governance
- Documents four horizon-based soil profiles (Block 4 and Block 5) plus Auger samples and ECOTRON site data; includes site details, vegetation surveys, and extensive soil chemical/physical analyses.
- Each sample/ horizon is linked via MLURI barcodes, with weights recorded for each horizon and horizon-specific metadata (depths, color, structure, moisture, roots, stones).
- Data management practices include standardized horizon naming, sample tracking, archival storage (e.g., -80°C), and links to broader networks (ECN, SERAD Micronet) to enable cross-site analyses.
- Across blocks, measurements cover %N, %C, C:N, major cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture loss, loss on ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2), and detailed horizon descriptions; vegetation data accompany soil data for integrated analyses.

## BLOCK 4 – Soil profile and analyses
- Horizon sequence and descriptions (selected):
  - LF (0–1 cm): fibrous, moist, no identifiable mineral grains; clear boundary.
  - FH (1–4 cm): fibrous, moist, abundant fine roots; sharp boundary.
  - H (4–8 cm): black; amorphous; moist; weak blocky structure with abundant fine roots.
  - Ah (8–29 cm): dark reddish brown; sandy silt loam; friable; many roots; presence of igneous stones.
  - Abg / B sg (29–61 cm): pinkish grey to brown hues; sandy to sandy loam textures; mottles present; roots diminish with depth.
  - C gx (61–95 cm): reddish brown to brown; sandy clay loam; massive to platy structure; abundant small igneous stones; sparse roots.
- Key analytical patterns (selected highlights):
  - %N ranges from ~0.08 to ~2.14 across horizons; %C ranges from ~1.0 to ~38.1 in some horizons (notably FH/Ah in blocks with organic enrichment); C:N ratios commonly in the late teens to mid-20s.
  - Ca, Mg, K, Na values vary by horizon and block (e.g., Ca from ~0.3 to ~11 meq/100g; Mg from ~0.33 to ~5.92 meq/100g; K around 0.1–3.4 meq/100g in several horizons).
  - %Moisture loss and LOI indicate higher organic matter in upper horizons (Ah, FH, H) with LOI values often >60% in surface horizons of some blocks.
  - pH values generally acidic (pH(H2O) ~4.5–5.0; pH(CaCl2) ~3.6–4.6 in sampled horizons), with CaCl2 pH lower than water pH, reflecting acidity.
  - Physical features include abundant very fine fibrous roots in upper horizons, frequent igneous stones (andesite), and mottling in subsoil horizons indicating drainage and weathering patterns.
- Data management notes:
  - Each horizon has a dedicated MLURI barcode; weights recorded (in mg) for horizon samples to support future re-analysis.
  - Horizon labels and depth ranges consistently documented; archive storage and block/plot metadata maintained.

## BLOCK 4 – Auger samples
- Auger sample set (4A–4F) with horizons and corresponding analyses:
  - %N values roughly 0.51–0.58% across samples; %C values ~6.8–8.2% in some samples.
  - C:N ratios typically in the low teens to mid-teens (approximately 12–14 for several samples).
  - Ca, Mg, K, Na, and other cations show modest variability between auger samples; moisture loss ~4.3–9.4%; LOI ~4–20%.
  - pH(H2O) around ~4.5–4.9; pH(CaCl2) around ~3.5–4.1 across samples.

## BLOCK 4 – Vegetation survey
- Subplots and plots (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F) show species totals per subplot and plot totals; counts indicate presence of dominant grasses and forbs, with variation by plot position (e.g., edge vs interior) and sampling depth.
- Some plots show higher species totals (e.g., totals ranging into the dozens per plot in certain subplots), while others record limited species presence, reflecting spatial heterogeneity and treatment effects.

## BLOCK 4 – Ecotron data
- ECOTRON soil site: single horizon/plot analysis shows %N ~0.59, %C ~8.22, C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76 meq/100g; Mg ~1.7; moisture loss ~4.79%; LOI ~17.42%; pH(H2O) ~4.79; pH(CaCl2) ~3.82.
- ECOTRON vegetation survey indicates species counts across Ac/Ao/At/Fr etc. with varying totals per subplot, reflecting controlled conditions within the Ecotron environment.

## BLOCK 5 – Site details
- Site details (Block 5) include grid reference NT8544019520, altitude ~315 m, slope about 5 degrees, imperfect drainage; soil series described as SH 74714 Sourhope, Bellshill; major soil subgroup “Brown forest soil with gleying”; rock types include undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite.
- Horizon data for Block 5 (0–100 cm) show similar horizon naming (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with organo-mineral transitions and mottling in subsoil horizons.

## BLOCK 5 – Soil profile
- Horizon sequence and descriptions (selected):
  - LF (0–1 cm): fibrous; moist; no stones.
  - FH (1–5 cm): semi-fibrous; roots present.

- Vegetation survey across ECOTRON plots A–F shows diverse species presence with counts per subplot; data support cross-site comparisons of how controlled environments influence community composition relative to the main field blocks.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Holistic data modeling: The data showcase a cohesive model linking climate/soil chemistry/soil physics with vegetation and management treatments across multiple blocks, suitable for cross-domain integration and system-wide analytics.
- Metadata and traceability: Consistent use of horizon labels, depth ranges, and MLURI barcodes enables precise data lineage tracking and reproducibility; archiving and sample tracking workflows are essential for long-term utility.
- Data quality and transparency: Detailed horizon descriptions, dates, and depths, plus explicit notes on variability, anomalies, and gaps, support transparent QA/QC and confidence in future re-analyses.
- Cross-institution collaboration: The dataset demonstrates effective governance for multi-organization data products (MLURI, ECN, CEH) and emphasizes co-ownership, shared governance, and discoverability across networks.
- Actionable takeaways for data strategy:
  - Maintain a unified data model that seamlessly links climate, soils, vegetation, and treatments with robust metadata.
  - Standardize horizon naming, depth conventions, and sample identifiers; ensure comprehensive archiving and easy re-access to archived materials.
  - Balance high-resolution data with clear documentation of gaps and limitations to sustain long-term usability.
  - Promote inter-organ collaboration to maximize data reuse, reproducibility, and impact across networks and future studies.
