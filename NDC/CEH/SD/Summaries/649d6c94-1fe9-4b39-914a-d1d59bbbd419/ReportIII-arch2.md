# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Purpose and Context
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope to provide a broad environmental context for groups and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Baseline context and rationale described in the November 1998 Baseline Data Survey; presentation aligns with Report II to facilitate links with other data and cross-year comparisons.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions and a change in site officer, with management actions (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) continuing under an approved plan; one biocide application was missed.

## Monitoring Data and Methods
- Monitoring types: Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass production, soil pH (upper 5 cm), botanical (plant) composition via Point Analysis, and site heterogeneity (soil pH and biomass variation).
- Data collection timeframe: 1999–2001, with measurement dates and procedures documented (e.g., mowing schedule, biomass harvesting, botanical surveys, soil sampling, and weather data transfer).
- Standardised approach: Data collected to support cross-year comparisons and links with other research outputs; QA and data transformation implied as part of the monitoring workflow.

## Key Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after the very wet previous year.
- Total annual radiation similar to prior years; average air temperatures slightly lower; average soil moisture content modestly elevated relative to earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear, consistent treatment hierarchy in biomass across years; peak biomass occurred in July or August each year.
- 2001 biomass markedly higher than 2000, likely due to personnel changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Biomass analyses normalised against a reference plot (C1) to assess management effects; ANOVA indicates:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus unimproved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant differences between blocks.
- nitrogen and lime treatments most effective for increasing biomass; combined nitrogen and lime often produced the strongest responses.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots’ mean pH remained close to baseline measures from August 1998.

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis mirrored July 2000 survey; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
- Total plant “hits” in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density, potentially from reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment-specific shifts in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (except remaining most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots showed species associated with poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Species richness: unimproved plots contained 24 species; Nitrogen & Lime plots contained 18, suggesting a possible decline in diversity with the main improvements.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation between improved (N and/or Lime) and unimproved (Control and Biocide) plots; improved plots frequently associated with Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass vs species abundance correlations:
  - Positive correlation between biomass and Festuca rubra/Poa pratensis.
  - Negative trend for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes like Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus as biomass increased.
  - Increased litter frequency in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in Surface Soil pH and Plant Community Composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slopes facing up-slope) tended to have more acidic plots, a pattern influenced but not solely explained by treatment distribution (noting high representation of Controls or Biocide in those columns).
- Underlying spatial structure appears to affect pH and plant community composition.

### 3.2 Variation in Vegetation Biomass
- Biomass values show outliers with notably low biomass in several plots, while central site plots frequently display higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical test results cited).

## Conclusions and Implications for Monitoring
- The Sourhope field experiment provides a robust, standardized set of environmental measurements across multiple years to assess management and fertility effects on biomass, soil chemistry, and plant communities.
- Lime and nitrogen distinctly influence soil pH and vegetation composition, with biomass responses aligned to nutrient and liming treatments.
- Spatial heterogeneity at the site level influences outcomes and should be accounted for in analyses and interpretation.
- Consistent data collection and QA, alongside cross-year comparability, enable integration with broader monitoring programmes and support policy-relevant environmental health assessments.
- Data handling and dissemination emphasize routine data verification, transformation, and storage in appropriate data portals to support accessibility for researchers and policy makers.
