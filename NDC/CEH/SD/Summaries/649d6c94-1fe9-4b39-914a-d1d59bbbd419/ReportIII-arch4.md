# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, designed to provide context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Baseline data collected since 1998; aim to monitor a broad set of variables to interpret subsequent analyses.
- 2001 management and external events affected work:
  - Government restrictions during Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) limited site access Feb–May 2001; work continued under a defined protocol.
  - Change of officer in charge in May 2001.
- Measurements span automated weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with standardized protocols for data collection and analysis.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Automatic Weather Station (AWS)
  - 2001 headlines: rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slight drop in average temperatures; soil moisture higher than prior years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Measured across multiple mowing occasions (May–September) each year (1999–2001) on a split-plot design.
  - 2001 biomass readings higher than 2000, likely due to personnel changes and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass data normalized to a reference plot (C1) to isolate treatment effects.
  - ANOVA indicates significant treatment-year interactions; nitrogen and lime (N and/or L) have the strongest positive impact on biomass.
- Soil pH
  - Soil samples taken from the top 5 cm.
  - Liming raises pH notably (e.g., October 2001 averages: limed plots 6.19; N&L plots 6.38).
  - Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent; control plots show little change since baseline (1998).
- Botanical composition
  - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey (mirroring 2000 protocol); majority of plots show clear treatment-related shifts in species abundance.
  - Agrostis capillaris declines across most treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increase; Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra associated with improved pastures (especially N and/or L).
  - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting changes in diversity with fertility improvements.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; correlations show biomass rise with higher abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Relative litter presence increases in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with increased fertility.
- Species and biomass relationships
  - Correlations show Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively associated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta decline as biomass increases.
  - PCA and species-hit analyses illustrate community shifts linked to management treatments.

## Site Heterogeneity
- Spatial variation in soil and vegetation:
  - Columns E and F show more acidic plots, likely due to slope orientation and treatment distribution.
  - Central plots tend to have higher biomass; biomass correlates positively with surface soil pH.
  - No significant differences between blocks in biomass, but clear spatial patterns influence outcomes.

## Data Quality, Challenges, and Implications for Data Strategy
- Data continuity and comparability challenges:
  - A notable increase in biomass readings in 2001 tied to personnel changes and a switch to mechanical cutting; necessitates normalization (as done against C1) for year-to-year comparisons.
  - FMD restrictions limited access, though management activities continued under approved protocols.
- Methodological consistency and metadata:
  - Consistent use of Point Quadrat surveys, full botanical surveys, and mowing-based biomass collection across years to support longitudinal analysis.
  - Clear species coding (e.g., Ac for Agrostis capillaris, Fr for Festuca rubra, etc.) aids data integration and cross-study communication.
- Data analysis approaches:
  - Use of split-plot ANOVA to assess treatment effects; log-transformed biomass data for normality; PCA to explore community composition shifts.
  - Correlative analyses linking biomass, pH, and species abundance help interpret treatment efficacy and ecological responses.
- Implications for data governance:
  - Demonstrates value of integrated, multi-parameter datasets for understanding how management affects soil chemistry, vegetation, and productivity.
  - Highlights importance of robust metadata, standardized sampling protocols, and documentation of any methodological changes for cross-year accuracy and reproducibility.

## Conclusions Relevant to Data Leaders
- The Sourhope field experiment provides a rich, multi-dimensional data ecosystem linking management interventions (nitrogen, lime, biocide) to soil chemistry, plant communities, and biomass outcomes over three years.
- Key patterns: nitrogen and/or lime boost biomass and raise soil pH; plant communities shift toward species associated with improved pastures; diversity can decline under intensive improvement, though turnover (litter) increases with fertility.
- Data integrity hinges on accounting for site heterogeneity, methodological changes (e.g., mowing methods), and external disruptions (FMD restrictions), reinforcing the need for rigorous normalization, thorough metadata, and transparent documentation to support long-term data strategy and cross-system applicability.
