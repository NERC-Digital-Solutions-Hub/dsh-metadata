    - Vegetation survey data per Plot 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F show mixed species compositions with indicator species and community differentiation across plots, consistent with upland grassy habitats and NVC-type groupings.

    - ECOTRON vegetation data indicate species totals similar in pattern to Block 4/5 plots, with counts distributed across Ac–F subplots.

- Cross-cutting patterns and interpretations (data-driven focus)
  - Soil are broadly acidic (pH typically ~4.5–5.0 in H2O; CaCl2 values around 3.5–4.2) with strong organic-rich surface horizons (high LOI, high %C in FH/A horizons), decreasing in deeper horizons.
  - Surface horizons (FH/Ah) show high organic matter and relatively high C content, but variable N content, yielding C:N ratios commonly in the mid-teens to around 20 in some blocks.
  - Ca and Mg increase with depth in several horizons (notably Cg/BCg horizons), reflecting mineral weathering and/ or horizon differentiation in gleyed brown forest soils with igneous stone content.
  - In Block 4, horizon AH to C shows substantial igneous stone content and complex horizon structure (Abg, Bs) consistent with volcanic parent material; Block 5 shows more pronounced mottling and BCg horizons with strong fine-root density in Ah and AB horizons.
  - Vegetation data align with grassland communities typical of U4d and U5b vegetation classifications, with indicator species differentiating block-level community structure.
  - ECOTRON data provide a compact baseline: modest N and C, low Na, modest Mg, acidic pH, and a distinct soil chemistry profile that complements the larger block datasets.

- Data quality, accessibility, and use
  - The document emphasizes archiving and metadata for reproducibility, with datasets linked to MLURI barcodes and horizon-specific results (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons across blocks).
  - Data support long-term soil biodiversity and grassland ecosystem research, enabling correlations between soil chemistry, horizon development, and vegetation patterns.
