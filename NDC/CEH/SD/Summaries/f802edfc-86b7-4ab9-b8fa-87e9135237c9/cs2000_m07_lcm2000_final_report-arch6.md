# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents how Broad Habitats map to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colors).
  - Provides a basis for comparing land-cover classifications across the UK and its constituent countries.

- Data sources and definitions
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000, statistics derived from a full count of cover on a 25 m grid.
  - FS: Field Survey statistics (from Haines-Young et al. 2000), used for validation and comparison with LCM2000.
  - Footnotes emphasize differences between LCM2000 and FS, and explain coastal coverage variability and other definitional nuances.

- What the tables cover (Table 5, Table 6, Table 8–10)
  - Table 5: Coverage (km²) of Subclasses from LCM2000 and Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and FS, for UK and constituent countries.
    - Examples of totals:
      - England & Wales: LCM2000 total = 151,051 km²; FS total = 142,355 km².
      - Scotland: LCM2000 total = 78,898 km²; FS total = 78,730 km².
      - Northern Ireland: LCM2000 total = 17,739 km²; FS data not consistently available (n/a in places).
      - UK total: LCM2000 total = 246,688 km²; FS total not consistently available.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) for Broad Habitats (BHs) by England, Wales, Scotland, NI, GB, with 95% confidence (Low/High) from FS estimates.
    - Provides per-habitat comparisons and UK-wide totals; shows FS uncertainty ranges alongside LCM2000 figures.
  - Table 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices (results per 1000 or per 1000s) comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares.
    - Use weighted estimates (strata based on 40 Land Classes) and bootstrap confidence intervals.
    - Tables cover GB (Table 8), England & Wales (Table 9), and Scotland (Table 10) for Broad Habitats, Urban generalisation, Target Class, and Aggregate Class levels.
    - Notes that correspondences are presented as percentages per 1000 and include generalisations for urban areas; results are contingent on 40 Land Classes and bootstrapping.

- Key patterns and notes (data-quality and interpretation)
  - The tables reveal substantial mapping differences between LCM2000 and FS CS2000 field survey data across many habitat classes, with varying levels of agreement.
  - Coastal and urban areas require special consideration due to methodological differences (e.g., coastal coverage variability from tidal states; urban generalisation effects in the correspondence matrices).
  - Some FS data are not available (n/a) for certain regions or classes, limiting direct UK-wide comparisons in those rows.
  - The methodology relies on bootstrapped confidence intervals and weighting by land-class strata, which affects precision and interpretation of correspondences.

- Practical implications for data use (Data Support perspective)
  - When using LCM2000 for policy-making, planning, or analysis in the UK, cross-check against CS2000 field survey data where possible, particularly for coastal and urban habitats.
  - Be mindful of classification cross-walks (Target Class, Subclass, Variant) and the potential for urban generalisation to bias habitat-level matches.
  - Use Table 5 and Table 6 as references for coverage scales and uncertainties, and Tables 8–10 for understanding where LCM2000 aligns with or diverges from field-survey based classifications.
  - Document data limitations (e.g., missing FS data in NI, coastal variability) when integrating across countries or when aggregating to UK-wide levels.

- Methodological notes (footnotes highlights)
  - FS statistics are based on Haines-Young et al. 2000; differences with LCM2000 are explained in the accompanying text.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore intertidal areas.
  - Total FS coverage definitions can vary by how 1 km squares are included or excluded, particularly in Northern Ireland.
  - Tables use bootstrapping and weighting across 40 Land Classes to produce summary correspondence matrices.
