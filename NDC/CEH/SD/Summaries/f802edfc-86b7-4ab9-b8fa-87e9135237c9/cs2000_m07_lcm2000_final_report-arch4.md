# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Presents a mapping framework between LCM2000 classifications (Target Class, Subclasses, Variants) and Broad Habitats, using map display colours to denote Suclasses.
- Establishes the basis for subsequent tables that compare LCM2000 data with CS2000 field survey classifications across the UK.

## Overview and purpose

- The document provides detailed tabular data comparing land cover as mapped in LCM2000 with field-survey classifications (CS2000) across the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB aggregates).
- Aims to support assessment of data accuracy, compatibility, and alignment between remotely sensed land cover maps and ground-truth survey data.
- Includes extensive tables of habitat classifications, coverage, and correspondences to inform data strategy, governance, and cross-agency data integration.

## Key Tables and their focus

- Table 5. Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries.
  - Provides area estimates by habitat type (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Improved grassland, Neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, etc.).
  - Breaks down by country (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and aggregates for GB/UK.
  - Includes both LCM2000 (uncalibrated) figures and FS-derived estimates where available.
- Table 6. LCM2000 cover (km2) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (i.e., +/- 2 standard errors).
  - Presents Low/High FS estimates alongside LCM2000 totals for each broad habitat category (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, etc.).
  - Includes regional (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and UK totals, highlighting calibration gaps and uncertainty intervals.
- Tables 8–10. Summary correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain; England & Wales; Scotland.
  - Expressions per 1000 (Table 8) and per 1000 (Tables 9, 10) showing how often LCM2000 classifications correspond to CS2000 classifications across:
    - Broad Habitats (yellow cells) and urban-generalised areas (blue cells)
    - LCM2000 Target Class (pink cells)
    - Aggregate class levels (green cells)
  - Provide crosswalk performance metrics for different geographic aggregations (GB, England & Wales, Scotland) and for target class versus aggregate classifications.
  - Include weighting, bootstrapping for confidence, and notes on interpretive limitations.

## Methodology and notes

- LCM2000 statistics are based on a full count of cover using a 25 m grid; FS statistics derive from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics are explained in the text; coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
- Some NI data are limited (e.g., NI FS coverage for certain classes may be unavailable or excluded).
- Tables include numerous footnotes clarifying class definitions (Target Class, Subclasses, Variants), regional coverage, and data treatment (e.g., “BHlevel (excluding linear features)”).

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Validation and calibration: The CS2000 vs LCM2000 comparisons provide an evidence base for calibrating remote-sensed land-cover products against ground truth, essential for trusted data products.
- Metadata and provenance: The extensive class mappings, definitions, and footnotes underscore the need for clear metadata about target classes, subclasses, variants, and their crosswalks.
- Cross-border coordination: Substantial UK/regional differences highlight the importance of coordinated governance across England, Wales, Scotland, and NI when developing and maintaining UK-wide data assets.
- Data quality and gaps: The correspondence matrices reveal where misalignments occur, guiding prioritisation of data collection, refinement of classifications, and potential data fusion strategies.
- Data access and usability: Given the scale and detail, ensure transparent access to both LCM2000 and CS2000 metadata, and document calibration procedures to aid downstream data consumers and partners.

## Beginning, middle, and end coverage

- Beginning: Establishes the classification framework linking Broad Habitats to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants, setting up the subsequent comparative analysis.
- Middle: Provides extensive tables (Table 5 and Table 6) detailing habitat coverage, both uncalibrated LCM2000 and field-survey estimates, by country and habitat type, with confidence intervals and regional breakdowns.
- End: Presents summary correspondence matrices (Tables 8–10) illustrating how well LCM2000 classifications align with CS2000 across different aggregations and geographic scopes, accompanied by methodological notes and footnotes clarifying definitions and data limitations.
