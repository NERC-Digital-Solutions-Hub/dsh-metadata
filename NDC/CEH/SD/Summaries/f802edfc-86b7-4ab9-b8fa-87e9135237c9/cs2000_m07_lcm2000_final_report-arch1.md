# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

## Overview
- Provides a comprehensive crosswalk between Broad Habitats (BHs) and LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses color-coded in maps).
- Documents a detailed mapping across UK habitats, including inshore/subtidal, standing water, littoral and supra-littoral zones, montane habitats, woodlands, arable/horticulture, grasslands, heath, wetlands, urban and coastal features.
- Sets the stage for validating LCM2000 against CS2000 field survey data (CS2000 is the CS2000 crosswalk used in Tables 8–10).

## Key mappings and structure
- 22 Broad Habitats (BHs) are linked to LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (examples: Inshore sublittoral; Standing water/canals; Littoral rock/sediment; Supra-littoral rock/sediment; Montane habitats; Arable & horticultural; Improved grassland; Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands; Bracken; Dwarf shrub heath; Fen/marsh/swamp; Bog; Built up areas; etc.).
- Each BH is associated with one or more LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants, reflecting the detailed crosswalk used for analysis and reporting.

## Coverage and area data (Tables 5 and 6)
- Table 5: Field and map coverage (km2) for BHs, LCM2000 Subclasses/Aggregate classes, and comparison with field survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
  - UK totals (LCM2000): 246,688 km2; UK FS estimates reported for many categories (where available).
  - Country breakdowns show distinct totals for England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, with England & Wales often combined for broader aggregates.
  - Examples of aggregates include Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, Built up areas and gardens, and various Littoral/Montane/Coastal categories.
- Table 6: LCM2000 cover (km2) for BHs (uncalibrated) vs CS2000 field survey estimates at 95% confidence intervals (Low/High) across England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and GB.
  - Shows variability between LCM2000 estimates and CS2000 FS Low/High bounds by BH (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable & horticulture; Improved grassland; Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands; Bracken; Dwarf shrub heath; Bog; Fen/marsh/swamp; Built up areas; etc.).
  - CS2000 FS intervals indicate uncertainty around field-based area estimates, useful for assessing map accuracy and calibrating land-cover inputs.

## Validation and correspondence (Tables 8–10)
- Tables 8–10 present summary correspondence matrices (results expressed per 1000 or per 1000 units) comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain (GB), England & Wales, and Scotland.
  - Methodology: weighted estimates using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapping to calculate confidence intervals.
  - Purpose: quantify how often LCM2000 BHs/targets correspond to CS2000 field classes at multiple aggregation levels (BH-level, Target Class-level, and Aggregate-class level; with urban generalisation adjustments).
  - Results indicate varying degrees of correspondence across BHs (e.g., Broad Habitats, Littoral rock/sediment, Arable & horticulture, Grassland types, Dwarf shrub heath, Bog, Fen/marsh/swamp, Built up areas, Coastal/Oceanic/seas categories). Some categories show stronger cross-walk signals than others, reflecting scale and classification differences.
  - Urban generalisation notes appear in the matrices, highlighting how urban areas are treated during generalisation for analysis.

## Footnotes and methodological notes
- LCM2000 statistics derive from a full count of cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics are explained in the text; coastal coverage varies with tidal state and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
- Total coverage definitions depend on the FS population of 1 km squares; some BHs are excluded in Northern Ireland FS.
- CS2000 crosswalks include many coding details (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland vs Coniferous woodland; various cross-assignments for arable, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, etc.).
- Generalisation notes: urban areas and certain BHs may be treated as generalized in some matrices to support analysis at national or regional scales.

## Practical implications for analysts
- The document provides a robust crosswalk enabling translation between LCM2000 map classes and field-validated CS2000 classes, essential for accuracy assessments, model validation, and predictive analyses.
- Availability of 95% confidence intervals (Table 6) aids in assessing uncertainty, bias, and the reliability of map-derived estimates against field observations.
- The cross-country breakdowns (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) help identify regional discrepancies and guide calibration efforts.
- Urban generalisation and coastal/tidal considerations highlight important caveats when using LCM2000 for decision-making at fine scales or in coastal/urban contexts.
- Data provenance and metadata practices (tracking data sources, making datasets discoverable) underpin reproducibility and reuse in subsequent analyses.

## Summary takeaway
- This document establishes a detailed crosswalk between LCM2000 habitat classifications and field-validated CS2000 categories, accompanied by extensive UK-wide coverage data and validation metrics. It provides essential tools and cautions for analysts aiming to translate between map-based land-cover data and field observations, quantify accuracy, and calibrate models across regional scales, with explicit attention to coastal, urban, and scale-related challenges.
