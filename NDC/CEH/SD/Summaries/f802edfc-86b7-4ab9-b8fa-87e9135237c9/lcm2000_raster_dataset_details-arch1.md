# 25m raster

- The raster 25m dataset was created by converting land parcels within a vector dataset into a 25m grid. Each grid cell records the dominant land cover at that location using LCM2000 Subclasses.

## Dataset details (Great Britain vs Northern Ireland)

- Great Britain grid: 24,400 columns × 48,400 rows. Northern Ireland grid: 7,600 columns × 7,200 rows.
- Lower left corner coordinates:
  - Great Britain: easting 50,000 m, northing 10,000 m.
  - Northern Ireland: easting 180,000 m, northing 280,000 m.
- Pixel size: 25 m (both GB and NI).
- Coordinate systems and projections:
  - Great Britain: British National Grid, Transverse Mercator, Spheroid Airy, Datum OSGB 1936.
  - Northern Ireland: Irish National Grid, Transverse Mercator, Spheroid Airy Modified 1849, Datum Ireland 1965.
- Pixel center offset: add 12.5 m to each lower-left corner value to locate pixel centers.

## 1km raster

- The LCM2000 raster 1km data were created by summarising the 25m raster within 1km grid cells.
- Great Britain: 700 columns × 1,300 rows. Northern Ireland: 500 columns × 500 rows.
- Pixel size: 1000 m.
- Coordinate systems and projections: same as the 25m data (GB: OSGB36 / Irish Grid for NI; Transverse Mercator; Airy or Airy Modified 1849).
- Pixel center offset: add 500 m to each lower-left corner value to locate pixel centers.

## Coding scheme and data encoding

- The 25m data are summarised in two ways:
  - By LCM2000 Subclass (the primary 25m code).
  - By LCM2000 Aggregate class (broader category).
- Storage efficiency: LCM2000 Subclass codes (normally floating point with one decimal) are multiplied by 10 to store as unsigned 8-bit bytes (0–255). Example: Water (inland) Subclass code 22.1 becomes 221 in the raster.

## Table 3: crosswalk between Subclasses and Aggregate classes

- The dataset provides a correspondence between LCM2000 Subclass codes (25m) and Aggregate class codes (1 km), including the 1km code for each category.

- The crosswalk enables translating 25m-resolution land-cover information to the 1km grid and to the broader Aggregate classifications for analyses at different scales.
