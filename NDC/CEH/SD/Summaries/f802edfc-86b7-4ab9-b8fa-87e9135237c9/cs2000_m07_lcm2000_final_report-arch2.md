# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the mapping between Broad Habitats and LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (with Suclasses shown by map colours).
  - Provides a structured framework for linking habitat types to the LCM2000 classification system used in environmental monitoring.

- Classification structure
  - LCM Target class: the broad category used for monitoring (e.g., Sea / Estuary, Water (inland), Littoral rock and sediment, Supra-littoral rock, etc.).
  - LCM Subclasses: finer groupings within each Target class (e.g., Rock, Sediment, Woodland types, Arable and horticultural, Grassland types, Built-up areas, etc.).
  - Variants: specific habitat expressions within each subclass (e.g., rock with algae, sand/mud with algae, saltmarsh, grazed saltmarsh, dunes, urban types, etc.).
  - Examples highlighted include:
    - Inshore sublittoral: Sea / Estuary; variants include sea.
    - Standing water/canals: Water (inland); variants include water (inland).
    - Littoral rock and Littoral sediment: rock/sediment with multiple variant expressions (e.g., rock with algae, sand, dunes, shingle, etc.).
    - Supra-littoral rock/sediment and Benthos: saltmarsh, grazed saltmarsh, dune systems, shrub/disturbance variants.
    - Terrestrial habitats: broad-leaved woodland, coniferous woodland, arable & horticultural, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, bracken, dwarf shrub heath, fen/marsh/swamp, bog, mountain habitats, inland bare ground, mountain/rock complexes, built-up areas and gardens, urban/rural categories, and various marine-adjacent interfaces.
  - The table integrates 22 broad habitat groups and their corresponding LCM2000 target classes, subclasses, and variants, illustrating the breadth of habitat types covered by the LCM2000 framework.

- Table 5 overview: LCM2000 coverage by Subclasses and aggregates (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and UK)
  - Provides the area (km2) covered by each Subclass and Aggregate class from LCM2000, broken down by country and then summed for UK totals.
  - UK totals (LCM2000): 246,688 km2 across all broad habitats.
  - Country-level totals (LCM2000):
    - England: 130,362 km2
    - Wales: 20,689 km2
    - Scotland: 77,898 km2
    - Northern Ireland: 17,739 km2
  - Aggregated UK totals (LCM2000): 246,688 km2
  - For comparison, field survey (FS) totals are provided for several groups (e.g., England & Wales FS totals), illustrating differences between map-based coverage and field-based estimates.
  - Note: The table includes numerous habitat-specific rows (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable horticulture, Non-rotational horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Inland rock, Built-up areas and gardens, Supralittoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock/sediment, Littoral rock/sediment, etc.) with many country-specific and aggregated figures.

- Table 6 overview: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) vs field survey estimates (FS) with 95% confidence ranges
  - Compares LCM2000 coverage for key habitat groups (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed and yew woodland; Coniferous woodland; Arable and horticulture (combined); Improved grassland; Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands; Bracken; Dwarf shrub heath; Fen/marsh/swamp; Bog; Standing open water and rivers/streams; Inland rock; Built-up areas and gardens; Supralittoral rock/sediment; Littoral rock/sediment) across England, Wales, Scotland, and GB.
  - FS estimates are presented as Low and High ranges to illustrate uncertainty and differences relative to LCM2000 uncalibrated counts.
  - General pattern (illustrative):
    - For Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland, GB LCM2000 is around 15,259 km2 with FS Low/High ranges roughly in the 12,750–16,670 km2 range.
    - For Coniferous woodland, GB LCM2000 around 12,879 km2 with FS Low/High about 10,672–16,808 km2.
    - For Arable and horticulture (UK), LCM2000 around 57,630 km2 with FS ranges often spanning broader intervals.
  - Indicates notable differences between map-derived counts and field survey estimates, emphasizing calibration needs and regional variation.

- Tables 8–10 overview: Summary correspondence matrices (LCM2000 vs CS2000 field survey)
  - Table 8: GB-wide summary correspondences (results per 1000) for Broad Habitats and target classes, including urban-generalisation adjustments and cross-class mappings.
  - Table 9: England & Wales-specific summary correspondences (per 1000) with similar cross-walking between LCM2000 and CS2000 classifications.
  - Table 10: Scotland-specific summary correspondences (per 1000) with cross-walking details.
  - Purpose of these matrices
    - To quantify how well LCM2000 classifications align with CS2000 field survey squares, using bootstrapped confidence intervals and stratification by Land Classes.
    - To illustrate the degree of correspondence across broad habitats, target classes, and aggregate classes, including the effects of generalising urban areas.
  - The matrices show varying degrees of correspondence across habitat categories and country contexts, reflecting both methodological differences and real ecological variation.

- Footnotes and methodological notes
  - Data sources and comparability
    - LCM2000 statistics derived from a full count of cover based on a 25 m grid.
    - FS statistics derived from Haines-Young et al. 2000 field surveys.
    - Differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained in the accompanying text.
  - Coastal coverage caveats
    - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and differences in inclusion/exclusion of offshore intertidal areas.
  - Population and area definitions
    - Total coverage differs depending on the definition of the FS population of 1 km squares; some BHs are excluded from the survey in Northern Ireland.
  - General note on usage
    - These tables underpin the monitoring aim of providing standardized, verifiable environmental data for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.
    - They also support QA, data cleaning, and data storage practices, with emphasis on making underlying data accessible for reuse.

- Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Data integrity and standardisation
    - The document demonstrates a structured approach to classifying and aggregating habitat data for consistent monitoring over time.
    - Emphasises verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and archival of datasets, with outputs in familiar formats (reports, maps, charts).
  - Data accessibility and reuse
    - Highlights the goal of enabling access to underlying data used to produce outputs, supporting transparency and scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.
  - Value and integration of datasets
    - Recognises the challenge of increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating them with other relevant data sources rather than treating them as single-use products.
  - Storage and portal integration
    - Notes the importance of storing created datasets and uploading them to appropriate data portals to support ongoing monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Beginning, middle, and end coverage
  - Beginning: Establishes the mapping framework between Broad Habitats and LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants.
  - Middle: Provides detailed tables (coverage by habitat and country; uncalibrated map counts vs field surveys; correspondence matrices) to quantify habitat extent and crosswalks between classification schemes.
  - End: Addresses methodological notes, data usage implications for monitoring, and overarching aims of standardisation, QA, data accessibility, and dataset value enhancement.
