# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physiochemical water properties: Measurements across the tidal cycles - 2020-2022

## Aim
- Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Clyde estuary and compare anthropogenic vs. non-anthropogenic sources.
- Develop a model of controls and mechanisms for GHG production, transport, consumption, and release to the atmosphere.
- Determine how conditions (tidal regime, stratification, temperature, river flow) affect activity of sources and sinks.
- Specifically assess how stratification, salinity, flow, mixing, sediments, and pollutant sources (e.g., urban wastewater) impact water quality and GHG generation.
- Include additional measurements from seven single-point surveys across tidal cycles (published separately).

## Study design and site description
- Ten measurement locations (L1–L10) along the Clyde estuary, from near the tidal weir to offshore near Dunbarton.
- Eight transect surveys (CET1–CET8) conducted Sep 2021–May 2022 under varying tidal, river flow, and seasonal conditions.
- Sampling along longitudinal transects with measurements at surface and near-bed to understand GHG sources/sinks.
- Locations spaced to capture increasing seawards distance and changing estuary characteristics; several sites near industrial outfalls and wastewater treatment plant (UWWTP) outflows.
- Some sampling locations could not be reached in the last three surveys due to rough weather.

## Data collection and sampling regime
- Survey method: power boat sampling starting at high tide inland, moving seaward during ebb.
- At each location: surface samples collected in a 10 L bucket; near-bed samples collected at ~0.5 m above bed after depth measurement.
- Depth range: up to 12 m in deeper sections; shallower inland sites (<6 m).
- Water depth and sample depth recorded; side-mounted sampling from boat.
- Ambient air samples collected at ~1 m above the surface; duplicates/triplicates for headspace gas analyses.

## Measurements and analytes
- GHGs: CO2, CH4, N2O concentrations measured via headspace method; gas standards used for calibration.
- Physio-chemical properties: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO and DO%), pH; turbidity; surface and sub-surface water properties.
- Nutrients and carbon: total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) derived from TDC–DOC; nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonium-N; total phosphorus (TP).
- Additional indicators: absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) to infer aromaticity of DOC; various analytical methods (TOC-L, SEAL AQ2, UV-Vis spectrophotometry, colorimetry) with calibration standards.
- Data processing: samples filtered and processed the same day or the next; quality control via standard calibration runs; data analysis primarily by Alison Brown with support from others.

## Gas analysis and calculations
- Headspace gas concentrations converted to dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures using a mass-balance model and equilibrium assumptions.
- Key equations account for liquid/gas volumes, barometric pressure, temperature-dependent solubility (βT), and gas concentrations before and after equilibration.
- Dissolved gas concentrations expressed as μmol/L and converted to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law.
- Partial pressures (pCO2, pCH4, pN2O) calculated in relation to air; CH4, CO2, N2O saturations and concentrations reported.

## Data structure and units
- Data presented in CSV with defined columns (Location, Depth, Date, Time, Latitude, Longitude, Distance from tidal weir, etc.).
- Units include: depth in meters; Cond in µS/cm; Temp in °C; pH; DO in mg/L and DO% ; Turbidity in NTU; DOC, TDN, TDC, DIC, TP in mg/L or as appropriate; SUVA254 in L mg-C-1 m-1; CH4, CO2, N2O in µmol/L; pCO2air, pN2Oair, etc. (detailed in the data table).
- Some data missing (marked with an asterisk) due to weather or access constraints (e.g., CET7 L5–L10; CET6/CET8 at some locations; CET3 L10).

## Data outputs and accessibility
- Comprehensive dataset generated from eight transects plus seven single-point surveys; fixtures published with supplementary information.
- Data and methods are documented in supporting information; data processing and analysis conducted under NERC IAPETUS 2 DTP (PhD project) with acknowledgments to UKCEH and other collaborators.
- Data linked to and accessible via Environ. Inf. Data Cent., with detailed methodological notes and tables (including Tables 1–3 references in the document).

## Key notes and considerations
- The riverine inputs and estuary outfalls (e.g., Shieldhall UWWTP, Dalmuir, Dumbarton West, Paisley/Erskine, etc.) are relevant to GHG dynamics and were mapped relative to sampling locations.
- The study links water quality and GHG generation to longitudinal gradients in stratification, salinity, flow, and mixing along the estuary.
- The eight CET surveys, alongside single-point campaigns, provide temporal coverage across different tidal phases and river conditions; weather limited some sampling in the final surveys.
