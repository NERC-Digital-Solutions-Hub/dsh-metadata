# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physiochemical water properties: Measurements across the tidal cycles - 2020-2022

## Data Overview
- Longitudinal measurements of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and physio-chemical water properties in the Clyde Estuary, Scotland.
- Eight surveys conducted during 2021–2022 under varying tidal, river flow, and seasonal conditions.
- Measurements taken along a transect of ten locations (L1–L10) from the tidal weir to the outer estuary near Dunbarton.
- Data collected at the surface and near the bed to understand GHG sources, sinks, and mechanisms within the estuarine system.

## Study Objectives
- Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs in the Clyde Estuary; distinguish anthropogenic vs. non-anthropogenic sources.
- Develop a model of controls and mechanisms for GHG production, transport, consumption, and atmospheric release.
- Determine conditions under which sources and sinks are active (e.g., tidal regime, stratification, temperature, river flow).
- Specifically assess how stratification, salinity, flow, mixing, sediments, and urban wastewater influence water quality and GHG generation; evaluate the impact of known pollutant sources such as urban wastewater.

## Site description and data collection
- Ten sampling locations (L1–L10) distributed along the Clyde Estuary from near the tidal weir (L1) to offshore from the River Leven (L10).
- Spacing increases seawards; locations chosen to capture variation in location, salinity, river flow, and stratification.
- Sampling near L5 avoided the dredged channel; maximum sampling depth ~12 m; inland sites shallower (~6 m).
- Rivers entering the estuary noted (e.g., River Kelvin between L3–L4; River Leven near L10; White Cart and Black Cart between L7–L8).
- Industrial and wastewater outfalls noted (e.g., Shieldhall UWWTP near L5; Dalmuir, Paisley/Erskine, Dumbarton West outfalls).
- Eight surveys conducted Sep 2021–May 2022; details of dates and tidal conditions provided; some locations inaccessible due to rough weather in the last three surveys.

## Sampling regime
- Boat-based sampling starting at high tide inland, moving seawards with the ebb tide.
- Surface samples collected in 10 L buckets; near-bed samples collected at ~0.5 m above bed after depth measurement; to avoid sediment disturbance.
- On-site measurements: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO saturation, pH (10 cm below surface).
- Triplicate headspace gas samples collected at each location for CO2, CH4, and N2O; ambient air samples collected ~1 m above surface.
- Sub-samples prepared for later lab analysis; some samples kept cool for transport to lab.
- The work formed part of an IAPETUS 2 NERC PhD program; multiple contributors acknowledged.

## Analytical methods
- Headspace gas analysis: Agilent GC (7890B) with headspace auto-sampler for CO2, CH4, N2O; calibration with mixed gas standards.
- Turbidity measured on unfiltered samples with a Turbidity Meter (NTU units).
- Filtration of samples (GF/F 0.7 µm) for sub-samples used to measure:
  - Total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N, dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), and total phosphorus (TP).
  - Analyses conducted with Shimadzu TOC-L and SEAL AQ2, with appropriate standards and calibration.
- SUVA254 measured to indicate aromaticity of DOC (indicator of anthropogenic impact).
- Nutrients: nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N measured with SEAL AQ2 after appropriate preservation; colorimetric methods and reductions described in detail.
- Phosphorus: orthophosphate after acid digestion and colorimetric determination (molybdenum-blue method).
- Data handling: samples from each survey analyzed together; some samples refrigerated if measured the next day.

## Gas partial pressures
- Dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures derived using a headspace equilibration mass-balance approach.
- Key equation and conversions described (including barometric pressure, temperature-dependent solubility, and ideal gas law to obtain ppmv).
- Calculations account for equilibrium between liquid and gas phases and adjust for changes during equilibration.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Missing data indicated in the CSV with an asterisk; data not collected in some surveys/locations due to weather (e.g., CET7 at L5–L10; CET6 and CET8 at L9–L10; CET3 at L10).
- Table 3 details units for data columns; common parameters include:
  - Location, depth (surface / near-bed), latitude, longitude, date, time, water depth, sample depth, conductivity, temperature, pH, DO, DO%, turbidity, DOC, TDC, DIC, TDN, TP, ABS254, SUVA254, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, TN, gas partial pressures (pCO2air, pN2Oair, pCH4), CH4, CO2, N2O concentrations and related saturation metrics.
