# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physiochemical water properties: Measurements across the tidal cycles - 2020-2022

## Overview and aims
- Longitudinal measurements of greenhouse gas concentrations (CO2, CH4, N2O) and physiochemical water properties in the Clyde estuary, Scotland.
- Eight transect surveys conducted across 2021–2022 under varying tidal regimes, river flows, and seasons; additional seven single-point surveys published separately.
- Primary objectives:
  - Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs within the estuary and compare anthropogenic vs. natural sources.
  - Develop a model of controls and mechanisms governing GHG production, transport, consumption, and atmospheric release.
  - Identify conditions (tidal regime, stratification, temperature, river flow) under which different sources/sinks are active.
  - Assess how stratification, salinity, flow, mixing, sediments, and known pollutant sources (e.g., urban wastewater) impact GHG generation and water quality.

## Study design and site description
- Ten measurement locations (L1–L10) along the Clyde estuary, from near the tidal weir to offshore near the River Leven.
- Sampling locations chosen to capture effects of location, salinity, river flow, and stratification; spacing increases seawards as estuary becomes more homogeneous.
- Eight transect surveys between Sep 2021 and May 2022, plus seven additional single-point surveys from other campaigns.
- Depths up to 12 m in deepest surveyed areas; multiple locations near dredged channels or industrial outfalls (e.g., Shieldhall UWWTP, Dalmuir, Erskine, Dumbarton).
- River inputs noted (Kelvin, White Cart, Black Cart, Leven) and industrial outfalls acknowledged.

## Sampling regime and field procedures
- Power-boat transect: start at high tide inland, move seaward with ebb; surface samples collected in a 10 L bucket; near-bed samples taken 0.5 m above the bed after depth measurement.
- Surface depth around 0.2 m below surface; near-bed depth around 0.5 m above bed; replicate collection to avoid disturbance.
- In-field measurements: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (and saturation), pH (in-situ using portable meter).
- Sub-samples: 2 L aliquots kept cool for lab analyses; headspace gas samples collected in triplicate per location using syringes and sealed vials for GHG analysis; ambient air samples collected at ~1 m above surface.

## Analytical methods and data products
- Gas analyses:
  - Gas chromatography (GC) with headspace method to quantify CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations.
  - Calibration with mixed gas standards; runs typically within 1 week of sampling.
- Water quality and chemistry analyses (lab-based subsamples):
  - Turbidity (NTU); dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved carbon (TDC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC); nitrite, nitrate, ammonia; dissolved phosphorus (TP after digestion).
  - Techniques include total organic carbon analyzer (TOC-L), UV absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254), ion chromatography, and colorimetric methods.
- Additional measurements:
  - Absorbance (SUVA254) to infer organic matter character and potential anthropogenic influence.
  - pH, nitrate, nitrite, ammonia analyses with preservation (freezing) and specific colorimetric or reduction-based detection methods.
- Data handling and units:
  - Data are recorded in a CSV with clearly defined columns (location, depth, date, time, coordinates, gas concentrations, water chemistry, gas partial pressures, CH4/CO2/N2O saturations, etc.).
  - Units include standard SI and field-specific units (e.g., μmol/L for gas concentrations, ppmv for gas partial pressures, mg/L for nutrients, NTU for turbidity, µS/cm for conductivity, °C for temperature).
  - Missing data flagged in the CSV; some surveys lacked data at certain locations due to rough weather.

## Gas calculations and interpretation
- Dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures derived using a headspace equilibration mass-balance approach.
- Key equation components:
  - Equilibrium between liquid and gas phases, volumes of liquid and gas, and barometric pressure.
  - Gas solubility coefficients (temperature-dependent) and ideal gas law conversions to convert to μmol/L or ppmv.
- Partial pressures and saturations calculated to assess gas exchange dynamics between water and atmosphere.

## Data scope, timing, and metadata
- Sampling regime spanned eight surveys (CET1–CET8) with various dates and tidal conditions; some locations were inaccessible in the last three surveys due to weather.
- Locations and sampling details are documented (Table 1 and Figure 1 in the source), with precise latitude/longitude, distances from the tidal weir, and notes on nearby anthropogenic features (outfalls, wastewater treatment plants).
- Supplementary information (Appendix 1) provides deeper location details; data for river flow are tied to SEPA gauges and Renfrew tide gauge data.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates an end-to-end monitoring workflow:
  - Clear objectives aligned with policy-relevant questions about GHG sources, sinks, and environmental drivers.
  - Strategic site selection along an estuarine gradient to capture spatial variability.
  - Standardized, replicable sampling procedures for both in-situ and lab analyses.
  - Robust multi-parameter data collection (GHGs, nutrients, carbon, turbidity, pH, DO, SUVA254) enabling integrated assessments.
  - Transparent data processing steps for converting raw measurements to ecologically meaningful indicators (gas concentrations, partial pressures, saturations).
  - Comprehensive metadata and documentation to support data reuse and governance.
- Highlights typical challenges for monitoring programs:
  - Weather-driven data gaps and access limitations.
  - Need for high-quality metadata to verify data suitability for reuse.
  - Transformation and harmonization of diverse data streams (gas, nutrients, DOC/DIC, metals) into coherent indicators.
- Provides a concrete template for designing estuarine monitoring that informs policy decisions on GHG fluxes, anthropogenic impacts, and nutrient-driven processes, including data sharing, QA/QC, and reporting outputs.
