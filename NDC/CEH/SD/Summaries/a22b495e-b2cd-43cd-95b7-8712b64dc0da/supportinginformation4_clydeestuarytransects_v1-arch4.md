# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physiochemical water properties: Measurements across the tidal cycles - 2020-2022

## Data overview
- Longitudinal study of greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations and physio-chemical water properties in the Clyde estuary, Scotland.
- Measurements collected from eight surveys during 2021–2022 under varied tidal, river flow, and seasonal conditions.
- Ten sampling locations (L1–L10) span the estuary from the tidal weir to offshore, with samples taken at surface and near-bed depths to understand GHG sources/sinks along the estuary.
- Sampling conducted from a power boat; data used to support understanding of GHG production, transport, and exchange with the atmosphere.

## Study objectives
- Main goals:
  - Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes, and sinks of GHGs within the Clyde estuary; compare anthropogenic vs non-anthropogenic sources.
  - Develop a model of controls and mechanisms governing GHG production, transport, consumption, and atmospheric release.
  - Determine conditions (tidal regime, stratification, temperature, river flow) under which different sources/sinks are active.
- Specific objectives for this part:
  - Assess how stratification, salinity, flow, mixing, and sediments (varying longitudinally) affect water quality and GHG generation.
  - Determine the impact of known pollutant sources (e.g., urban wastewater) on GHGs.

## Site description and data collection
- Ten measurement locations (L1–L10) arranged from near the tidal weir (L1) to offshore near the River Leven (L10); locations chosen to reveal effects of salinity, flow, stratification, and pollutants.
- Notable site context:
  - L5 adjacent to Shieldhall UWWTP outflow; dredging near L5 influences sampling.
  - Rivers Kelvin, White Cart, Black Cart, Leven and other industrial outfalls impact locations along the transect.
- Sampling schedule:
  - Eight surveys between September 2021 and May 2022; each survey covered multiple locations with some inaccessible due to rough weather.
  - Sampling started at high tide at the head of the estuary and proceeded seawards during ebb.
- Depths and positioning:
  - Surface sampled at approximately 0.2 m below surface; near-bed sampled at ~0.5 m above the bed.
  - Maximum water depth sampled ~12 m near the dredged areas; shallower inland sections (<6 m).
- Data collection details:
  - Conducted from an inflatable power boat; water samples collected with depth-specific samplers; in situ measurements of conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, pH.
  - Triplicate headspace gas sampling at each location for CO2, CH4, and N2O, along with ambient air samples.

## Sampling regime and field procedures
- Surface samples collected in 10 L buckets; near-bed samples collected using depth measurements to target 0.5 m above bed.
- Headspace gas sampling used three 200 mL syringes per location with a 100 mL water and 100 mL air mix, shaken for equilibration, then transferred to sealed vials.
- In situ measurements included EC, temperature, DO, DO%, pH; water depth measured prior to near-bed sampling.
- Turbidity measured on unfiltered samples; sub-samples prepared by filtration for downstream chemical analyses.

## Analytical methods
- Gas analyses:
  - Headspace samples analyzed with Agilent 7890B GC and 7697A headspace auto-sampler to determine CO2, CH4, and N2O concentrations.
  - Standards used to calibrate gas concentrations; runs typically completed within a week of collection.
- Water chemistry analyses:
  - Turbidity via AQUAfast meter.
  - Filtration of samples for sub-samples: TDN, TDC, DOC, nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N, ions (via IC and spectrophotometry); TP measured in unfiltered samples.
  - TOC (TDN, TDC, DOC) measured with Shimadzu TOC-L; calibration with standards; DIC derived from DOC-TDC difference.
  - SUVA254 measured to assess aromaticity (indicative of humic content and anthropogenic impact).
  - Nitrogen species measured with SEAL AQ2; nitrate/N2O and ammonia determined via established colorimetric methods; potential interferences noted.
  - TP measured after oxidation digestion and colorimetric determination (molybdenum-blue method).
- Data processing:
  - Analyses coordinated by Alison Brown with support for data processing from Stella White; data from eight surveys analyzed in aggregate as part of PhD project.

## Gas partial pressures and data calculations
- Dissolved gas concentrations and gas partial pressures calculated using a headspace equilibration mass-balance approach.
- Key relationships:
  - Coliq and Cgas before and after equilibration related to liquid and gas phase volumes, gas partial pressures, and solubility coefficients.
  - Gas concentrations converted to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law (ppmv = μmol/L × RT).
- Calculations rely on temperature, barometric pressure, and solubility parameters to estimate dissolved gas fractions and atmospheric exchange characteristics.

## Data structure, units, and recording
- Data are organized with defined columns (e.g., location, depth, date, time, latitude, longitude, distance from tidal weir, sampling depth, sample codes, and a wide range of chemical and gas parameters).
- Table 2 lists the units for each parameter (e.g., surface/near-bed depth, latitude/longitude, EC, Temperature, pH, DO, Turbidity, DOC, TDN, TP, absorbance, SUVA254, NH4+, NO2-, NO3-, TN, gas concentrations, and partial pressures).
- Some data gaps exist due to weather or accessibility; missing values are indicated with an asterisk in the CSV.
- Several surveys and locations were not collected (e.g., CET7 at L5–L10; CET6 and CET8 at L9–L10; CET3 at L10) due to rough conditions.
