# Secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats Mustela putorius in Great Britain 1990 - 2016

## Overview
- This document summarises the data collection methods used in the paper by Sainsbury et al. (2018) on long-term exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in polecats in Britain.
- Data span a national monitoring effort with detailed sampling, laboratory analyses, and calibration with historical data.

## Carcass collection and sample preparation
- National monitoring survey conducted by the Vincent Wildlife Trust from December 2013 to March 2016.
- 68 polecat carcasses selected for rodenticide analysis, stratified by sex, location, and collection date.
- For the selected animals: 82% (n = 56) were road traffic casualties; others found dead in fields, killed by dogs, trapped, or unknown.
- Recorded data: collection date and location for all carcasses; carcasses stored frozen until necropsy at the National Museum of Scotland.
- Condition limitations: most carcasses were in poor condition, preventing assessment of clinical signs or calculation of body condition scores due to damage or incompleteness.
- Samples collected: teeth (aging), whiskers (stable isotopes), and liver tissue (rodenticide analysis).
- Sample handling: liver samples frozen and sent to CEH for rodenticide analysis; whiskers prepared at the University of Exeter and analysed at Elemtex; teeth sent to Matson’s Lab for aging via cementum analysis.

## Determination of rodenticides in liver using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry
- Target compounds: five SGARs licensed in Great Britain — bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, and difethialone.
- Sample processing: 0.25 g liver sub-sample ground and dried; internal standard (d5-bromadiolone) added; dual solvent extraction with 1:1 chloroform:acetone; cleanup with size-exclusion chromatography and solid-phase cartridges; multiple solvent exchanges and additional clean-up steps.
- Instrumental analysis: LC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole, APCI in negative mode; matrix-matched calibration; blanks included.
- Quality control and performance: calibration curves with R2 > 0.99; mean method detection limit (LOD) per compound ~0.0014 µg/g (0.0022 µg/g for difethialone); total recovery ~68.0 ± 2.1%.
- Reporting: liver SGAR concentrations expressed on a wet weight basis; ΣSGAR for each animal computed by summing detected concentrations (undetected compounds counted as zero).

## Stable isotope analysis
- Whiskers prepared by rinsing and freeze-drying; one whisker per animal sectioned into ~1 mm segments, pooled until total sample ~0.7 mg.
- Analysis: isotope ratio mass spectrometry (δ15N and δ13C) via EA-IRMS.
- Results: reported as δ-values (‰) relative to PDB (δ13C) and AIR (δ15N) standards.
- Precision: replicate standards (USGS references and in-house bovine liver) yielded SDs of 0.05–0.29 for δ15N and 0.05–0.22 for δ13C.

## Cementum aging
- Age estimation conducted by Matson’s Lab using standard protocol: decalcification, sectioning, staining, and visual counting of annual cementum growth layers (annuli).
- Birth date assumption set to 1 May for converting ages to months at death.

## Calibration with historical dataset
- Historical data from Shore et al. (2003) integrated with new data.
- To minimize bias from differing analytical sensitivities, the limits of detection (LOD) from Shore et al. (2003) were applied when combining datasets.

## Notes on data quality and provenance
- Several limitations due to carcass condition and potential biases from the opportunistic sampling (e.g., high proportion of road-kill samples).
- Samples and analyses were conducted across multiple institutions to ensure traceability and methodological rigor (liver analyses at CEH; isotope analyses at Elemtex; aging at Matson’s Lab).
- Data parameters collected and recorded (date, location, sex, morphometrics) support robust investigations into exposure patterns and potential temporal or geographic trends.
