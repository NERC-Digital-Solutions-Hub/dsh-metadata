# Secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats Mustela putorius in Great Britain 1990 - 2016

- Overview of study scope and data collection
  - Summarises data collection methods used in a long-term study on anticoagulant rodenticide exposure in European polecats in Great Britain.
  - Data originate from a national monitoring survey conducted by the Vincent Wildlife Trust (Dec 2013–Mar 2016); 68 polecat carcasses selected for analysis.

- Cohort structure and metadata
  - Selection stratified by sex, location, and collection date.
  - Predominant cause of death: road traffic casualties (82%), with others found dead in fields, dogs’ kills, traps, or unknown causes.
  - Recorded for each carcass: collection date and location; sex; head and body length; mass; internal fat score. Body condition score not calculated due to poor carcass condition.

- Biological sampling and storage
  - Collected samples: teeth (aging), whiskers (stable isotopes), and liver tissue (rodenticide analysis).
  - Liver samples frozen and sent to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) for rodenticide analysis.
  - Whiskers prepared at the University of Exeter and analyzed at Elemtex (UK).
  - Teeth sent to Matson’s Lab LLC (USA) for cementum-based aging.

- Laboratory analyses and targets
  - Rodenticides (SGARs) measured in liver for five licensed compounds in Britain: bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, and difethialone.
  - Analytical method: described as LC-MS/MS with detailed extraction, cleanup, and instrument settings summarized; full details available in Walker et al. (2017).
  - Quality controls: use of labelled standards; matrix-matched calibrations with R² > 0.99; method detection limits (LOD) around 0.0014–0.0022 µg/g; total recovery averaging 68% (not recovery-corrected); concentrations reported on a wet weight basis; summed SGAR concentration (ΣSGAR) computed across detected compounds.
  - Stable isotope analysis: whisker segments processed and analyzed for δ15N and δ13C using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer; results reported in per mil (‰).
  - Cementum aging: standardized protocol to estimate age at death from cementum annuli; birth date set to 1 May for monthly age estimation.

- Data integration and calibration
  - Calibration with historical data: integrated new data with historical Shore et al. (2003) dataset to ensure comparability.
  - Handling analytical sensitivity changes: applied previous study’s LODs to mitigate biases from differing detection limits across time.

- Data products and outputs
  - Primary outputs include: liver concentrations of each SGAR compound, summed SGAR concentration (ΣSGAR), δ15N and δ13C values from whiskers, and age-at-death estimates from cementum analysis.
  - Metadata accompanying samples include collection date, location, and basic morphometrics where assessable.

- Data quality, challenges, and limitations
  - Carcass condition hindered full assessment of exposure signs and some measurements.
  - Not all planned data could be collected for every specimen due to damage or incomplete remains.
  - SGAR data are not corrected for recovery; some compounds not detected are assigned zero for ΣSGAR calculation.
  - Variability in data collection and analysis across labs and time necessitated calibration against historical datasets.

- Collaborative scope and governance
  - Data generated through a multi-institutional workflow (Vincent Wildlife Trust, CEH, Elemtex, Matson’s Lab) with standardized protocols and cross-lab quality controls.
  - Emphasizes data traceability from field collection through laboratory analyses to final data products.
