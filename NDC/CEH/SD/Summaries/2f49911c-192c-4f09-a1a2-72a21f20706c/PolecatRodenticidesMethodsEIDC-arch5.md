# Secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats Mustela putorius in Great Britain 1990 - 2016

- This document summarises the data collection methods used in the study by Sainsbury et al. (2018) on long-term exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in British polecats.

## Overview of the dataset and study scope
- National monitoring survey of polecat carcasses conducted by the Vincent Wildlife Trust from December 2013 to March 2016.
- 68 carcasses selected for rodenticide analysis, stratified by sex, location, and collection date.
- 82% of sampled animals were road traffic casualties; others found dead in fields, killed by dogs, trapped, or unknown causes.
- Data collected included collection date and location for all carcasses; storage of samples frozen until necropsy at the National Museum of Scotland.
- Sample types collected: liver tissue (rodenticide analysis), whiskers (stable isotope analysis), and teeth (cementum aging). Body measurements were recorded where possible.

## Data collection design and metadata
- Necropsy and measurements:
  - Sex, head and body length, mass, and internal fat (scored 5-point scale). Body condition score not calculated due to damage/incompleteness.
- Tissue handling:
  - Liver samples frozen and shipped to CEH for rodenticide analysis; whiskers prepared at University of Exeter and analyzed at Elemtex; teeth aged at Matson’s Lab LLC.
- Age and growth data:
  - Teeth used for aging via cementum layers; birth date set to 1 May fo
