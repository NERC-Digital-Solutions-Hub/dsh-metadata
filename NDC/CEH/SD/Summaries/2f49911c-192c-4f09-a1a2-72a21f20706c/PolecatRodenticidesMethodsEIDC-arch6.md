Secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats Mustela putorius in Great Britain 1990 - 2016

## Overview
- This document summarises data collection methods used in the 2018 Environmental Pollution paper on long-term increases in secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats in Great Britain.
- Data come from a national monitoring effort focused on rodenticide residues, stable isotopes, and aging of polecats.

## Sampling and specimen handling
- 68 polecat carcasses were selected for rodenticide analysis from a national monitoring survey (Vincent Wildlife Trust) between December 2013 and March 2016.
- Sampling was stratified by sex, location, and collection date; 82% were road traffic casualties; others were field-found, dog-kill, trapped, or unknown cause.
- For each carcass, collection date and location were recorded; specimens stored frozen until necropsy at the National Museum of Scotland.
- Data collected at necropsy included sex, body length, mass, and internal fat score (five-point scale). A body condition score was not calculated due to damage/incompleteness.
- Tissues collected: liver (for rodenticide analysis), whiskers (stable isotopes), teeth (aging). Teeth, whiskers, and liver samples were prepared/analysed at designated facilities.

## Chemical analysis (SGARs in liver)
- Five second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (SGARs) licensed in GB were analysed: bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, and difethialone
