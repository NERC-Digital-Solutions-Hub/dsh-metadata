# Secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in European polecats Mustela putorius in Great Britain 1990 - 2016

## Overview
- Summarises data collection methods used in the study by Sainsbury et al. (2018) on long-term increases in secondary exposure to anticoagulant rodenticides in Great Britain.
- Focuses on how polecat carcasses were collected, processed, and analysed to quantify SGAR residues and obtain ancillary data (stable isotopes and age).

## Sampling frame and carcass collection
- National monitoring survey conducted by the Vincent Wildlife Trust from December 2013 to March 2016.
- 68 polecat carcasses selected for rodenticide analysis, stratified by sex, location, and collection date.
- Collection outcomes: 82% were road traffic casualties; others found dead in fields, killed by dogs, trapped, or of unknown cause.
- Data recorded for all carcasses: collection date and location.
- Carcasses stored frozen until necropsy at the National Museum of Scotland.

## Sample collection and storage
- Gross examination conducted where possible; recorded sex, body length (nose to tail), mass, and internal fat (5-point scale).
- Body condition score not calculated due to damaged/incomplete carcasses.
- Tissues collected: teeth (aging), whiskers (stable isotope analysis), and liver (rodenticide analysis).
- Liver samples frozen and sent to the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) for SGAR analysis.
- Whiskers prepared at the University of Exeter and analysed at Elemtex, UK; teeth sent to Matson’s Lab LLC (USA) for cementum aging.

## Rodenticide analysis (liver SGARs)
- Target SGARs: bromadiolone, difenacoum, brodifacoum, flocoumafen, difethialone.
- Analytical workflow:
  - 0.25 g liver sub-sample ground and dried.
  - Addition of labelled internal standard (d5-bromadiolone) for QA and recovery determination.
  - Two solvent extractions, cleanup with size-exclusion chromatography, and solid-phase cartridge cleanup.
  - Double extraction and multiple cleanups, culminating in solvent exchange to LC-MS/MS mobile phase.
  - Quantification by HPLC-MS/MS with APCI in negative mode.
- Calibration and QA:
  - Matrix-matched standards; linear curves with R^2 > 0.99.
  - Blanks run with each batch.
  - Method detection limits (LOD) across batches: ~0.0014 µg/g for most compounds; 0.0022 µg/g for difethialone.
  - Total recovery (based on labelled bromadiolone): 68.0% ± 2.1%.
  - Liver SGAR concentrations reported on a wet weight basis; concentrations for individual SGARs summed to produce ΣSGAR for each animal (zero assigned for non-detected compounds).

## Stable isotope analysis
- Whiskers cleaned, freeze-dried, and sectioned into ~1 mm segments starting from the proximal end.
- Segments pooled to reach ~0.7 mg per sample; analyzed for δ15N and δ13C using an elemental analyzer linked to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer.
- Results expressed as δ-values relative to standard references (PDB for carbon, AIR for nitrogen).
- Analytical precision reported via replicate standards (USGS references and in-house bovine liver standard).

## Cementum aging
- Teeth processed by Matson’s Lab LLC following established protocols.
- Decalcified, sectioned, stained, and examined to count annuli for age estimation.
- Birth date standardized to 1 May for monthly age calculations.

## Calibration with historical data
- Integrated new measurements with historical data (Shore et al., 2003) by applying the higher LODs from Shore et al. to minimize bias due to changes in analytical sensitivity over time.

## Data handling and monitoring implications
- Data collected include liver SGAR concentrations, stable isotope values from whiskers, and cementum-based ages, enabling long-term monitoring of exposure trends.
- The methods emphasize quality control (internal standards, QA/QC calibrations, explicit LODs, and recovery) and standardized processing to support comparability over time.
- The study framework supports data transparency and potential data sharing for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
