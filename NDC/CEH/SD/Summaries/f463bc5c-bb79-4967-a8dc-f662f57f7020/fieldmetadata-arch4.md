# Metadata for 'Long-term multisite Scots pine trial, Scotland: field phenotypes, 2013-2020'

- The metadata describe a long-term, multi-site field trial of Scots pine phenotypes conducted in Scotland from 2013 to 2020.
- Seed material and populations
  - Seed collected in March 2007 from ten trees per each of 21 native Scottish P. sylvestris populations.
  - Populations chosen to represent the species’ native range in Scotland, including three populations from each of seven seed zones.
  - Seeds germinated in 2007 and grown through nursery stages before field planting.
- Nursery and planting design
  - Seedlings transplanted to 8 cm × 8 cm × 9 cm pots and grown in one of three nurseries (NW, NG, NE).
  - In 2012, trees were transplanted to three field sites: Yair (FS, south Scotland), Glensaugh (FE, east Scotland), Inverewe (FW, west Scotland).
  - Field design used randomized blocks with 3 m × 3 m spacing and a peripheral guard row.
  - Each block included one individual from eight of the ten families from each of the 21 populations (168 trees per site).
  - Some family replacements occurred at FS where certain families were underrepresented.
  - Site coordinates and design details provided (FS: Yair; FE: Glensaugh; FW: Inverewe).
- Data collected and timeline
  - Growth measurements:
    - Height measured annually from 2013–2020 at FE and FW; 2014–2020 at FS.
    - Basal stem diameter measured annually at FE and FW; 2020 data available for FS only (as applicable).
  - Phenology assessments:
    - Spring phenology recorded at each site from 2015–2019 (2020 data not collected due to COVID-19 restrictions).
- Dataset contents and structure
  - Single data file: FieldTraits.txt.
  - Key columns (examples):
    - PopulationCode, Description: population identifiers.
    - Family: family code (offspring from the same mother tree).
    - FieldSite: site code (FE: Glensaugh; FS: Yair; FW: Inverewe).
    - FieldCode: unique tree code (ranges by site; e.g., Inverewe 5001–5672; 6001–6004; 7001–7672).
    - Block: randomized block code (A–D as applicable per site).
    - HA13–HA20: Height after 7th to 14th growing seasons (in mm) at respective sites.
    - HI13–HI20: Height increments per year (mm).
    - DA13–DA20: Base stem diameter per year (mm).
    - DI13–DI20: Base stem diameter increment per year (mm).
    - BD15–BD19/BD20: Duration of budburst (days) per year.
    - BT15–BT20: Time/days to reach budburst stages (various measurements per year).
  - Units: Height, diameter, and related growth metrics are recorded in millimeters (mm); budburst timing in days.
- Data quality, provenance, and gaps
  - Longitudinal, multi-site design enables cross-site comparisons of growth and phenology.
  - Data reflect nursery origin (trees raised in different nurseries) and field-site differences.
  - COVID-19 impacted 2020 phenology data collection.
  - Some families were replaced at FS due to insufficient representation, which may affect cross-site comparability for certain populations.
- Governance, metadata, and reuse considerations
  - FieldCode and FieldSite metadata provide traceability from individual trees to populations and fields.
  - The dataset supports analyses of growth trajectories, phenology timing, and diameter growth across environments and populations.
  - For integration and ongoing use, maintain consistent unit definitions, document nursery origins, and account for any replacements or missing years.
  - Potential applications include long-term genotype-by-environment studies, adaptation analyses, and informing forest management or breeding programs.
