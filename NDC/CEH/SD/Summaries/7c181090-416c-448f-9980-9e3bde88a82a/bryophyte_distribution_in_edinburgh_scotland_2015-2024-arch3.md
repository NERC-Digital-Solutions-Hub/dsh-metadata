# Bryophytes in an Urban Environment, a case study from Edinburgh

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the Botanical Society of Scotland's Urban Flora Project (UFP), initiated in 2015.
  - Dataset records the distribution of bryophytes (mosses, liverworts, hornworts) in the City of Edinburgh.
  - Aims to understand factors underlying species distribution and species richness in the urban environment.

- Spatial coverage
  - 138 monads (1x1 km squares) defined by the Ordnance Survey National Grid.
  - Geography largely within the A720 Edinburgh ring road; extends SW along the Water of Leith to Currie and Balerno; north to Cramond Island; east to Joppa.

- Experimental design and data collection
  - A route through each monad chosen to maximize ecological diversity of public spaces and waste ground.
  - Excluded excessively steep ground; only a few private gardens surveyed.
  - Each monad surveyed at least once; repeat visits to particularly species-rich monads.
  - 272 bryophyte species recorded as present or absent across 138 monads.
  - Some older data included for precipitous locations on unstable crags and steep ground.
  - Species names follow the UK Species Inventory.

- Data files and structure
  - Species_by_monad.csv: presence/absence of each species in each monad; includes Ordnance Survey grid references for monads; species abbreviations.
  - Species_location_habitat_date.csv: expanded dataset including species name, taxon group (Moss, liverwort, or hornwort), site name, original OS grid reference, 4-figure grid reference, latitude/longitude, habitat code, comment/secondary habitat, and date recorded.
  - Habitat codes (Table 3) include: agricultural, building and walls, crags and quarries, derelict and waste ground, gardens, heath, inland water and wetlands, marine and coastal, roads/paths/pavement, woodland/scrub/hedgerow, with subcategories.

- Quality control and data provenance
  - Field recorders were highly experienced bryologists; confirmations sought when needed; locations cross-verified on maps.
  - Some older data included for challenging locations (e.g., unstable crags).

- Miscellaneous and provenance
  - The dataset is cited in Chamberlain, D.F., and Wilson, J. "Bryophytes in an Urban Environment, a case study from Edinburgh" (Plant Ecology and Diversity); full reference pending.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates an end-to-end urban biodiversity data workflow suitable for policy scrutiny and decision-making:
    - standardized units (monads) and clear spatial scope.
    - structured metadata (habitat codes, grid references, coordinates, dates).
    - rigorous quality control and transparent data provenance.
    - documentation of data structure and data formats to support reuse.
  - Reflects common challenges for monitoring authors:
    - data gaps or uneven data quality; data access and timeliness.
    - organizational data silos and governance for sharing and updating datasets.
    - metadata adequacy and the transformation work needed to make data readily usable.
  - Provides a model for urban environmental health monitoring datasets to inform future data collection and policy.
