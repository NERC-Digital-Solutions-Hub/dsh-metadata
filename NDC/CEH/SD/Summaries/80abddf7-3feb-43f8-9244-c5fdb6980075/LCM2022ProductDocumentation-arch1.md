# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

- Purpose and scope
  - UKCEH LCM2022 comprises seven datasets: three for Great Britain (GB) and three for Northern Ireland (NI) at 10 m resolution (classified pixels, land parcels, and 25 m rasterised land parcels), plus a 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
  - Data produced from Classification Scenes using Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus Context Rasters; classification is automatic via Bootstrap Training and Random Forest.
  - Annual production aims to improve temporal consistency, support change detection, and differentiate real land-cover change from classification error; formal validation cites overall accuracy of 86.1%.

- Land Cover Classes and relationships
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; descriptions and relationships to BAP Broad Habitats documented (with careful notation to distinguish UKCEH classes from BAP Broad Habitats).
  - Tables and appendices define how classes map to BAP Broad Habitats, including nuances for seas/water, urban categories, and specific land-cover types.

- Datasets and data structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Mosaic of Classification Scenes; each pixel classified to the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class with a second band giving the class probability/confidence.
    - Maintains high spatial detail; not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve small features; validation performed against the 25 m rasterised dataset.
    - Pixel count details: GB 10 m dataset is organized with two bands (class, confidence); NI similarly has 2 bands.
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Generated by intersecting the 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create land parcel attributes.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
    - Rasterisation of Land Parcel data to 25 m; three bands per parcel: dominant land cover class (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
  - 1 km summary rasters
    - Summary of 25 m rasters to 1 km resolution; products include dominant class maps and percentage cover per class (21 class bands) and per aggregate class (10 bands); rounding can cause sums to deviate from 100%, especially near coastlines.
  - Classification and production details
    - GB classified pixels produced from 32 Classification Scenes; NI uses a single Classification Scene (49-band input including Sentinel-2 bands and context rasters).
    - Coordinate systems: GB uses British National Grid (EPSG 27700); NI uses Irish TM75 grid (EPSG 29903).

- Seasonal and contextual data
  - Seasonal Composite Images
    - Sentinel-2 data reprojected to 10 m, four-season median composites (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) across 10 Sentinel-2 bands; occasional cloud-related gaps are handled, allowing classification without manual gap-filling.
  - Context Rasters
    - 10 m GB context rasters: height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask.
    - NI context rasters: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distances to coast/road/freshwater, foreshore mask, tidal water mask.
  - Classification Scenes
    - GB: tiles ~100 x 100 km; 32 scenes used to cover GB; NI: single scene covering NI; scenes combine Seasonal Composites with Context Rasters to form 49-band inputs (NI) or 60+ bands (GB variations).

- The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Parcels originate from a long-running framework (min ~0.5 ha) designed to represent discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.).
  - Parcels help reduce classification noise and enable change detection; unique parcel identifiers (gid) may not match older datasets due to framework updates.

- Bootstrap Training and Random Forest classification
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic UKCEH LCM data (LCM2019–LCM2021) to automatically generate training observations from current imagery (pixels with >80% probability classified consistently across three years).
  - Random Forest classifier trained with balanced samples (10,000 per bag) to ensure rarer classes are well learned.
  - Training and classification rely on bespoke software integrating WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).

- Validation and accuracy
  - Validation dataset: 33,107 reference points across 21 classes (GB/NI combined); sources include countryside surveys, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payment Agency, and manual interpretation.
  - Overall accuracy: 86.1% (full thematic detail).
  - Appendices include detailed confusion matrices and producer’s/user’s accuracy per class.

- Known issues and caveats
  - A small number of polygons missing from vector land parcel products cause nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised parcels (negligible effect on 1 km products; 10 m pixel dataset unaffected).
  - Differences in methods across years can yield real changes plus methodological changes; users should treat some year-to-year differences with caution.

- Access, citations, and metadata
  - Each dataset has a DOI; citations provided (e.g., Marston et al. 2023–2024); DOIs cover 10 m classified pixels (GB and NI), 25 m rasterised land parcels (GB and NI), land parcels (GB and NI), and 1 km summary rasters.
  - Appendices provide detailed methodological notes, data relationships, and dataset metadata including coordinate systems and extents.
