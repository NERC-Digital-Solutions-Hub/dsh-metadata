# Parsonage Down experiment

## Aim
- To assess how different plant communities affect soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling.
- To create varied plant communities through hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying and compare resulting carbon and nutrient cycling to plant-group characteristics.
- To explore how herbicide-driven shifts in plant communities influence carbon and nutrient cycling over time.

## Experiment 1: Main experiment – plant functional groups and carbon cycling
- Approach: Establish diverse plant communities by selectively weeding and applying herbicide to create plots dominated by defined plant functional groups; measure resulting carbon and nutrient cycling and relate them to plant-group characteristics.
- Plant functional groups (FG):
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and some long-lived species.
    - Predicted outcomes: High soil carbon storage; roots may transfer carbon deeper, reducing accessibility to soil microbes.
    - Example species: Sanguisorba minor (salad burnet), Daucus carota (wild carrot), Dactylis glomerata (cocksfoot).
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; overall smaller physical presence.
    - Predicted outcomes: Less impact on carbon and nitrogen dynamics due to small size.
    - Example species: Bellis perennis (daisy), Festuca rubra (red fescue), Primula veris (primrose), Thymus pulegioides (broad-leaved thyme).
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; long-lived.
    - Predicted outcomes: Rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with high microbial activity; potential lower long-term carbon storage as carbon is quickly processed.
    - Example species: Vicia cracca (tufted vetch), Avenula spp. (oat grasses), Ranunculus spp. (buttercups).
- Species lists: A detailed enumeration of species assigned to FG1, FG2, and FG3 was prepared (extensive supplementary species catalog provided).
- Experimental design (plot layout): A grid of plots arranged 7 across and 6 down.
  - Across the grid, each of the seven columns represented different combinations of the three plant functional groups.
  - Each row repeated the combinations to create six replicates of each treatment.
  - The design included various mappings of FG combinations to specific plots to ensure replication (e.g., FG2, FG1, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3 in different positions).
  - The treatments were implemented in 2013, 2014, and 2015 via weeding and herbicide applications.

## Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
- Objective: Use seven herbicides to alter the plant community and observe subsequent effects on carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Herbicides used:
  - 2,4D – kills broadleaf weeds
  - Foundation – kills perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
  - Fusilade Max – kills wild oats and grass weeds
  - Kerb – kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaf weeds
  - MCPB – kills broadleaf annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
  - Shield – kills perennial broadleaf weeds
  - Starane – broad range of broadleaf weeds

## Timeline and data aspects
- Treatments and monitoring occurred during 2013–2015.
- Data generated aimed to quantify carbon and nitrogen cycling rates and relate them to the defined plant functional groups and herbicide-driven community shifts.
- Outputs were intended to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with standardised data handling expected from ongoing environmental monitoring analytics.
