# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover of each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, and weighed; summed across the site to calculate g biomass per m^2.
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated using Shannon and Weaver (1963).

## Greenhouse gas flux

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, along with photosynthesis and respiration, measured using four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) with transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; a reflective cover placed over the chamber and measurements repeated to obtain CO2 efflux in the dark.
- Soil moisture and temperature (WET sensor) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate alongside gas measurements.
- Calculations convert the 27 CO2 measurements over two minutes into CO2 flux in mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1.
- CO2 flux formulae use chamber volume and area, with standard unit conversions (e.g., atomic/molar masses and gas constant) to derive final flux values.
- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) analyzed by placing reflective-covered chambers in collars; 9 ml air sampled at 10, 20, and 30 minutes into evacuated gas vials and measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
- Final gas flux values for CH4, CO2, and N2O calculated using the same approach as the IRGA-derived CO2 flux.
