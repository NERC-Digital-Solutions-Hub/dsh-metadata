# Parsonage Down experiment

- Aim
  - Investigate how different plant functional groups affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling.
  - Use herbicide-based treatments to shift plant communities and assess consequent changes in carbon and nutrient cycling.

- Experiment 1: Main experiment – Plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Approach
    - Create diverse plant communities by combining hand weeding with herbicide spot spraying.
    - Measure resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates and relate them to plant-group characteristics.
  - Plant groups and rationale
    - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots with simple leaf structure; predicted to store more carbon by sequestering it deeper in soil.
      - Examples (selected): Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
    - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; predicted lower impact on long-term carbon storage.
      - Examples (selected): Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
    - Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and fast, high microbial activity; predicted rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with potentially less long-term storage.
      - Examples (selected): Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
  - Plot design and replication
    - Field grid of plots: 7 columns across by 6 rows down.
    - Across plots includes every combination of the three groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) in seven across; this arrangement is replicated across rows six times.
    - The layout encompasses single-group plots, all pairwise combinations, and all three groups together.
    - Details include a mapping of plot identifiers to FG combinations and notes on plot positions (e.g., bottom slope sections) and replication, with the overall treatment period spanning 2013–2015.
  - Treatments and management
    - Weeding and targeted herbicide applications used to establish the desired community compositions.
    - Field manipulations conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Aim
    - Alter plant community composition using herbicides to examine subsequent effects on carbon and nutrient cycling.
  - Herbicides tested (seven in total)
    - 2,4-D: broadleaf weed control
    - Foundation: perennial broadleaf weed and tree seedling control
    - Fusilade Max: grasses and grass weeds
    - Kerb: blackgrass and other grasses/broadleaf weeds
    - MCPB: broadleaf annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
    - Shield: perennial broadleaf weed control
    - Starane: broad range of broadleaf weeds
  - Implementation
    - Applied within the same field site to further modify plant community composition and examine resulting changes in carbon and nutrient cycling.
