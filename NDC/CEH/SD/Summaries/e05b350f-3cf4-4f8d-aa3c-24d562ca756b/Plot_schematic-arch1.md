# Parsonage Down experiment

- Aim and approach
  - Conduct two linked experiments to understand how plant community composition and herbicide-driven changes affect soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling.
  - Use a mix of hand weeding and targeted herbicide applications to create distinct plant communities and compare their effects on carbon and nitrogen cycling.

- Experiment 1: Main experiment – plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Objective: Create different plant communities by manipulating functional groups and measure resulting soil carbon and nutrient cycling rates, linking them to plant group characteristics.
  - Plant functional groups
    - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
      - Predicted impact: substantial soil carbon storage with roots depositing carbon deeper in soil.
      - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
    - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
      - Predicted impact: limited carbon/nitrogen storage due to small physical presence.
      - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
    - FG3: Big plants, shallow roots, large, fast-growing leaves.
      - Predicted impact: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling, high microbial activity; potential lower long-term soil carbon storage as carbon may be quickly processed.
      - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
  - Experimental design
    - Plots arranged in a grid: 7 columns across, 6 rows down, with all combinations of FG1, FG2, FG3 represented.
    - Each row replicated the treatment combinations; multiple plots per treatment to replicate (approximately six replicates per treatment across the grid).
    - Treatments included various FG1/FG2/FG3 combinations (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3) distributed across plots.
    - Spatial layout also included sections described as “bottom of slope” to capture microtopographic effects.
  - Timeline and methods
    - Treatments implemented through weeding and herbicide application in 2013–2015.
    - Measurements focused on carbon and nitrogen cycling rates and related soil/plant processes; plant group characteristics used to interpret results.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Objective: Use seven different herbicides to steer the plant community and examine subsequent impacts on carbon and nutrient cycling.
  - Herbicides used (and general action)
    - 2,4-D: kills broadleaved weeds
    - Foundation: kills perennial broadleaved weeds and tree seedlings
    - Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
    - Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaved weeds
    - MCPB: kills broadleaved annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
    - Shield: kills perennial broadleaved weeds
    - Starane: broad range of broadleaved weeds

- Data and resources
  - A comprehensive species list is provided for each functional group.
  - The design aims to enable analysis of how specific plant traits and community compositions influence soil carbon storage, carbon turnover, and nutrient cycling, with robust replication to support statistical inference.
