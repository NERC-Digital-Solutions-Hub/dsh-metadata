# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux

- Vegetation work
  - Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
  - Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
  - Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
  - Biomass biomass per quadrat harvested at ground level, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per m^2.
  - Shannon's Diversity index calculated using Shannon and Weaver (1963).

- Greenhouse gas flux
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured with four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in soil and transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
  - CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes; after this, reflective cover placed to measure CO2 efflux in the dark.
  - Soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate.
  - CO2 flux calculated from IRGA data as mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1 using chamber volume, area, and changes in CO2 concentration over time (converted from 27 measurements over two minutes).
  - Calculations include time-based predictions and standard constants (e.g., atomic masses, gas constant) to derive flux; final flux expressed per area and time.

- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O)
  - Chambers with reflective material placed in collars; 9 mL air samples collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes with exact timing noted.
  - Gas concentrations measured using a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
  - Final gas concentrations calculated using the same methodology as the IRGA-derived CO2 flux.
