# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux

- Purpose: quantify vegetation structure (diversity, biomass) and greenhouse gas flux (CO2, CH4, N2O) at the site to inform ecosystem-level processes.

## Vegetation measurements

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at soil surface from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed; summed across the site to yield g biomass per m^2.
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated as per Shannon and Weaver (1963).

## Greenhouse gas flux

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured with four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (EGM-4 IRGA).
- Procedure: measure CO2 influx over two minutes; place reflective cover over the chamber and repeat to obtain CO2 efflux in the dark.
- Additional measurements: soil moisture and temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), taken in triplicate.
- Data processing: convert the 27 CO2 measurements over two minutes into CO2 flux in mg m^-2 h^-1.
- Calculations described include time-based predictions (using a forecast function in Excel) and a ΔCO2 over one hour, defined as the difference between measurements at 120 seconds and 0 seconds.
- Final CO2 flux calculation: mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1 = (Chamber volume × ΔCO2) / (Chamber area).

## Methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O)

- Chambers with reflective material placed in collars; 9 mL air samples collected into evacuated vials at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gas concentrations measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
- Final gas concentration values calculated using the same procedure as for the IRGA-derived CO2 flux.
