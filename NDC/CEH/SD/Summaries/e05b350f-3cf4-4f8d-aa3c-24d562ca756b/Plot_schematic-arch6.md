# Parsonage Down experiment

- Overview
  - A field study with two experiments focused on plant communities and carbon/nutrient cycling in a species-rich grassland.
  - Experiment 1: Assess how different plant functional groups affect soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling, by creating varied plant communities through hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying.
  - Experiment 2: Use seven herbicides to alter the plant community composition and examine resulting changes in carbon and nutrient cycling.

- Experiment 1: Main experiment — plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Plant functional groups
    - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
      - Predictions: High soil carbon storage due to deeper rooting; carbon moved deeper and less accessible to microbes.
      - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
    - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
      - Predictions: Lower impact on carbon/nitrogen storage; smaller physical presence.
      - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
    - Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and fast, long-lived growth.
      - Predictions: Fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduced long-term carbon storage.
      - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
  - Experimental design
    - Field grid: 7 columns across x 6 rows down, creating a factorial set of treatments.
    - Across each row, all three plant groups are combined in various ways to form all combinations, with six replicates per treatment.
    - Plot mapping details indicate systematic pairing of plant-group treatments (FG1, FG2, FG3) across plots.
    - Treatments established via weeding and herbicide application in 2013–2015.
  - Data collected (implied)
    - Soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling rates.
    - Plant community composition and root characteristics.
    - Microbial activity indicators via plant and soil interactions.
  - Data goals
    - Compare carbon/nutrient cycling across plant-group combinations.
    - Link functional group traits to soil processes and potential carbon storage.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Seven herbicides tested to shift plant community composition:
    - 2,4D: broadleaf weed control
    - Foundation: perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
    - Fusilade Max: wild oats and grass weeds
    - Kerb: blackgrass and other grasses/broadleaved weeds
    - MCPB: broadleaved annual/perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
    - Shield: perennial broadleaf weeds
    - Starane: broad range of broadleaf weeds

- Data and analysis considerations for Data Support perspective
  - Experimental design yields multiple treatment combinations requiring careful data integration across plots and years (2013–2015).
  - Data to collect likely includes: plant composition, functional-group occupancy, soil carbon metrics, nitrogen cycling indicators, and microbial activity proxies.
  - Challenges may include managing a detailed species list, maintaining consistent treatment application, and ensuring robust replication for reliable cross-treatment comparisons.
  - End products could include datasets and visualizations comparing carbon cycling and soil properties across plant-group treatments and herbicide-induced community shifts, enabling stakeholders to explore how plant traits influence soil processes.
