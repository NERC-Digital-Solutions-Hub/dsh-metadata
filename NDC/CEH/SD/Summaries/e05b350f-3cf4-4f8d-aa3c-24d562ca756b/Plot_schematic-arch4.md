# Parsonage Down experiment

- What is studied
  - Two experiments in a species-rich grassland:
    - Experiment 1: effect of plant functional groups on soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling
    - Experiment 2: effect of seven herbicides to shift plant communities and carbon/nutrient cycling

- Data to be collected
  - Carbon cycling rates and nutrient cycling rates (primary outcomes)
  - Plant community composition by functional group (species presence, identity within groups)
  - Treatment effects from weed management and herbicide applications
  - Plot-level data linked to specific plant functional group combinations and herbicide regimes
  - Temporal data across multiple years (2013–2015)

- Experimental design and data structure
  - Plot grid: 7 across by 6 down (42 plots total)
  - Treatments: all combinations of three plant functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) replicated six times
  - Plot labeling and treatment mapping (e.g., FG1/FG2/FG3 combinations per plot)
  - Experiment 2: seven different herbicides to alter the plant community
  - Timeline: weeding and herbicide applications conducted in 2013, 2014, and 2015

- Plant functional groups and species (examples)
  - FG1: deep, thick tap roots; long-lived; predicted to store more carbon in soil
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, etc.
  - FG2: small rosettes with very small tap roots; smaller physical presence
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, etc.
  - FG3: big plants with shallow, abundant roots; fast carbon/nitrogen cycling
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., etc.

- Experiment 2: herbicides
  - 2,4D: broadleaf weeds
  - Foundation: perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
  - Fusilade Max: wild oats and grass weeds
  - Kerb: blackgrass and other grasses and broadleaved weeds
  - MCPB: broadleaved annual and perennial weeds
  - Shield: perennial broadleaf weeds
  - Starane: wide range of broadleaf weeds

- Data management and use considerations for Data Leaders
  - Implement a consistent, plot-level data schema to support analysis of plant-group effects on carbon/nutrient cycling
  - Capture comprehensive metadata: plot location, FG composition, species lists, herbicide treatments, application dates, and measured carbon/nutrient metrics
  - Ensure clear replication and labeling across years (2013–2015) for traceability and comparability
  - Facilitate data sharing with the wider ecological and land-management communities; align with potential standard data formats and discoverability needs

- Expected outcomes and relevance
  - Insights into how plant functional group composition influences soil carbon storage and microbial activity
  - Assessment of how herbicide-driven shifts in plant communities affect carbon and nutrient cycling
  - Data to inform grassland management for carbon sequestration and nutrient dynamics, potentially contributing to broader ecological modeling efforts
