# Parsonage Down experiment

## Aim
- Investigate how different plant functional groups and herbicide-driven plant communities affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling in a species-rich grassland.

## Experimental design
- Two experiments:
  - Experiment 1 (main): create varied plant communities through hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying; test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates and relate them to plant group characteristics.
  - Experiment 2: apply seven herbicides to shift the plant community.

## Experiment 1: Plant functional groups and carbon cycling
### Plant groups and predicted effects
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - Predictions: substantial soil carbon storage; roots may move carbon deeper, reducing availability to microbes.
  - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
  - Predictions: less impact on carbon/nitrogen cycling due to small size.
  - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; long-lived.
  - Predictions: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term soil carbon storage.
  - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

### Plot design and replication
- Field grid: 7 plots across (columns) and 6 plots down (rows).
- Across plots: every combination of the three plant groups; each row repeats the pattern to provide six replicates.
- Additional bottom-of-slope area included with a similar layout.
- Treatments labeled to reflect combinations of functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) and their mixes; spatial layout includes slope-position considerations.

### Treatments and timeline
- Treatments implemented via weeding and herbicide applications in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
- Measurements focus on soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling rates, analyzed in relation to the plant group configurations.

## Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
### Herbicides used
- 2,4D: kills broadleaf weeds
- Foundation: kills perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
- Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
- Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaf weeds
- MCPB: kills broadleaf annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
- Shield: kills perennial broadleaf
- Starane: broad range of broadleaf weeds

## GIS-relevant observations and data considerations
- Spatial design: grid-based layout (7x6) with replication across rows and along slope, enabling spatial analysis of treatment effects.
- Data integration: align carbon/nutrient cycling measurements with plot identity, year, and plant-group composition for map-based visualization.
- Data standardization: ensure consistent plot identifiers and treatment codes across years; address potential data gaps.
- Outputs: map-friendly representations of soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling by plot and treatment; capture spatial patterns along slope and across herbicide treatments.

## Summary of timeline and scope
- Treatments and data collection conducted between 2013 and 2015.
- Aimed to elucidate how plant functional group composition and herbicide-driven community shifts influence soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling, with a robust spatial grid suitable for GIS analysis.
