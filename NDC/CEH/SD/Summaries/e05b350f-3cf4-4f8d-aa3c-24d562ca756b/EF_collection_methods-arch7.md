# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux

## Vegetation work
- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of the percentage cover of each species.
- Species richness and percent cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass collected by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, and weighed; sum across the site to obtain g biomass per m².
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated using Shannon and Weaver (1963).

## Greenhouse gas flux
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured.
- Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in the soil; transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) for CO2 influx over two minutes, then covered to obtain CO2 efflux in the dark.
- Concurrent measurements of soil moisture and temperature (WET sensor) and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
- CO2 flux calculated by converting multiple CO2 concentration measures (ppm) to flux in mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹, using chamber volume and area along with temperature and gas constants.
- Data handling involves time-based comparisons (start t0 and t120) to derive hourly CO2 fluxes.

- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) measurements:
  - Chambers with reflective material collected air samples (9 mL) at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes; samples expelled into evacuated vials.
  - Gas concentrations measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B).
  - Final gas flux values calculated using the same approach as for IRGA-derived CO2.
