# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Purpose: Field methods to quantify vegetation structure and greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O) to derive biomass, diversity metrics, and net ecosystem CO2 exchange.

## Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percent cover of grasses and forbs are calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
- Biomass: clip at ground level from each quadrat, dry at 80 °C for 24 hours, weigh, and sum across the site to obtain g biomass per m².
- Shannon's Diversity index computed using the Shannon and Weaver (1963) method.

## Greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, along with photosynthesis and respiration, measured with four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in soil and attached transparent chambers to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA, EGM-4).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; then a reflective cover is placed to obtain a dark (respiration) measurement.
- Concurrent measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) taken in triplicate.
- CO2 flux calculations convert the raw CO2 measurements (ppm over two minutes) to flux in mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹, using chamber volume, area, time, and gas constants; two time points (start and after measurement) support rate calculation.
- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) measurements: reflective chambers placed in collars, 9 mL of air drawn into evacuated vials at 10, 20, and 30 minutes; analyzed with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B). Final gas flux values are calculated using the same IRGA-based approach as for CO2.
- Measurement setup includes repeated environmental readings (soil moisture, temperature, PAR) to support flux calculations.
