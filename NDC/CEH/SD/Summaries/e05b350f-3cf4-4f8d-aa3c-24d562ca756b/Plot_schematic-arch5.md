# Parsonage Down experiment

## Overview
- A field-based study split into two experiments.
- Experiment 1: investigates how plant functional groups affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling using a mixed-weeding and herbicide approach to create distinct plant communities.
- Experiment 2: uses seven herbicides to alter plant community composition.
- Conducted on species-rich grassland at Parsonage Down, with data collected across 2013–2015.

## Experimental design

- Experiment 1: Main experiment on plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Design: a grid of plots (7 across by 6 down) creating a full factorial combination of three plant functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3).
  - Replication: the treatment combinations are replicated six times by repeating the across-row arrangement.
  - Treatment mapping: specific plots labeled to reflect combinations (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3; FG1&2; FG1&3; FG2&3; FG1&2&3) across plots, with additional replication patterns described for different rows and slope positions.
  - Plant groups: three distinct functional groups characterized by root structure and growth habit; details and representative species are provided for each group.
  - Species lists: extensive species lists are given per group, illustrating the composition used to define FG1, FG2, and FG3.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Treatments: seven herbicides applied to alter plant communities.
  - Herbicides include 2,4D, Foundation, Fusilade Max, Kerb, MCPB, Shield, and Starane, each targeting different broadleaved or grass components.

## Data to be collected and structure

- Plot-level data
  - Plot identifiers, grid position (across and down), replication number, and slope position (e.g., bottom of slope).
  - Treatment codes indicating FG combinations (FG1, FG2, FG3, and their various pair/triple combinations).
  - Year of data collection (2013–2015) and any intervening management actions (weeding, herbicide applications).
- Biological and environmental data
  - Plant community composition per plot (species presence/absence or abundance) aligned to the designated functional groups.
  - Measures related to carbon and nitrogen cycling and microbial activity in the soil.
- Intervention data
  - Details of weeding and herbicide applications (dates, products used, application methods) for Experiment 1 and Experiment 2.

## Data governance and metadata

- Metadata requirements
  - Clear, machine-readable mapping between plot IDs, treatment codes, and actual plant composition per FG.
  - Consistent taxonomic naming conventions for plant species.
  - Documentation of measurement methods, units, and instrumentation used for carbon/nitrogen cycling metrics.
  - Timeline metadata indicating when treatments were applied (2013–2015) and when measurements occurred.
- Data standards
  - Standardized formats for plot-level design, treatment descriptions, and ecological measurements to enable reuse and cross-study comparisons.
  - Versioning and change-log to capture any reclassifications of FGs or plot mappings.

## Data quality and provenance

- Quality considerations
  - Accurate association of each plot with its FG and/or herbicide treatment throughout the multi-year design.
  - Verification of species lists against group definitions to maintain consistency.
  - Calibration and documentation of measurement protocols for carbon and nitrogen cycling metrics.
- Provenance
  - Maintain a data provenance record linking raw observations to processed datasets and final shared data.

## Access, sharing, and reuse

- Data sharing plan
  - Upload datasets to appropriate data portals with accompanying metadata and a data dictionary.
  - Provide documentation of methodology, plot design, treatment schedules, and measurement protocols to facilitate reuse.
- Documentation
  - Include a concise methods summary, definitions of FG1/FG2/FG3, list of herbicides and their targets, and a data dictionary describing each variable.

## Challenges and considerations for Data Stewards

- Complex, multi-year, multi-treatment design requiring careful data integration across plots and years.
- Large, potentially heterogeneous datasets (plant composition, soil carbon/nitrogen metrics, management actions).
- Risk of data gaps or misalignment between plot treatments and measured outcomes; requires rigorous validation and version control.
- Need for clear, interoperable metadata and a robust data dictionary to support discoverability and reuse by others.
