# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux measurements

## Vegetation work
- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of the percentage cover of each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass measured by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, drying at 80°C for 24 hours, and weighing; totals summed across the site to yield g biomass per m².
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated using the Shannon and Weaver (1963) method.

## Greenhouse gas flux
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured using four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) with transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; a reflective cover placed over the chamber to obtain a CO2 efflux measurement in the dark.
- Supplemental measurements collected in triplicate: soil moisture (WET sensor), soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR).
- Calculations convert 27 CO2 concentration measurements (ppm) over two minutes to CO2 flux in mg m⁻² h⁻¹.
- Final CO2 flux expressed as Chamber volume × ΔCO2 / Chamber area (with additional notes on time-based measurements and parameter definitions included in the equations).

## Methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O)
- Chambers covered with reflective material placed in the collars; 9 ml of air sampled at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gas chromatography (GC) used to determine CH4, CO2, and N2O concentrations.
- Final gas flux values calculated using the same methodology as the IRGA-derived CO2 flux.
