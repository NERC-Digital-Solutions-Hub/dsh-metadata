# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- A data rescue project by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology to digitise and archive the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps, enabling long-term analysis of Broad Habitat change across Great Britain from 1978 onward.
- Extends the Countryside Survey time series back to 1978, complementing later years (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and enabling examination of post-WWII land-use intensification effects on habitats, plant species, soils, and related ecological variation.

## Objectives and Significance for Monitoring Frameworks

- Preserve primary field data and maps that were at risk of loss and develop a digital GIS resource for cross-year analyses.
- Enable consistent characterization of the GB mosaic of Broad Habitats in 1978, linked with coincident plant and soil data, to improve stock estimation and change assessment over thirty years.
- Provide a basis for comparing habitat stock with later surveys, and to inform policy-relevant monitoring of habitat change and land-use drivers.

## Data and Source Information

- Source: 1978 Countryside Survey maps and field codes, originally recorded on paper; digitised maps and plot data were archived for GIS use.
- Time span context: Data rescue adds 1978 to the existing time series (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) for long-term monitoring.
- Linkages: Field codes (1978) mapped to Broad Habitats (BAP) and, where possible, to Priority Habitats; alignment with ITE Land Classification variants used in subsequent years.

## Digitization Procedure and Data Management

- Digitization workflow:
  - Scanned maps and plot data stored in CEH systems.
  - Maps digitised by ADAS in 2009 following a defined protocol.
  - Final digital data stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.
- Data accessibility and governance:
  - Original hard copies preserved in fire-safe storage; electronic backups created.
  - Data prepared to support cross-year analyses, with plans for data sharing and governance aligned to open data standards where feasible.

## Data Checking, Validation and Quality Assurance

- Primary checks:
  - Comparison of digitised data against original field maps to identify omissions or digitising errors.
  - Cross-year consistency checks by assembling each survey square by year on separate sheets to detect real change versus error.
  - Visual and map-based validation with input from researchers involved in the 1978 survey.
- Findings:
  - 1978 data are broadly consistent with later Countryside Survey datasets; major change signals are detectable and comparable when validated.
  - Some potential biases acknowledged (e.g., interpretation bias during translation from field sheets to base maps), but found to be consistently applied and manageable given the longitudinal context.
- Example outputs:
  - Illustrative figures show habitat changes across 1978, 1990, and 2007 squares (urbanisation, woodland planting, grassland shifts).

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Classification Notes

- Translation challenges:
  - Most 1978 codes map cleanly to Broad Habitats, but some categories were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath, or Acid Grassland).
  - Ambiguities resolved using original habitat maps, vegetation plots, and, where possible, cross-year data.
- Specific issues:
  - Upland codes are difficult to delineate; heterogeneous upland mosaics may be treated as mosaics in later work.
  - 1978 codes such as Herb Rich Pasture required careful cross-checking to distinguish Calcareous Grassland from other grassland types.
  - Inland Rock and boundary/linear features mapping differences between 1978 and later years affect national estimates.
  - 1978 line-work was digitised independently of later years but shown to be broadly consistent with other datasets after validation.
- Additional considerations:
  - Priority Habitats (e.g., Coastal Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) are identifiable when data permit.

## Note on Land Classifications and Sampling Framework

- Historical basis:
  - 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification with a 15 x 15 km grid (6039 classified squares used to derive national estimates from 8 km survey squares).
  - The evolution across years includes:
    - 1984: Updated sampling within the 12 km square framework using 1978 classifications.
    - 1990: All Squares classification; national estimates refined; urban/sea corrections introduced.
    - 1998: Land Classification expanded to 40 classes, Scottish reporting separated.
    - 2007: Land Classification expanded to 45 classes with Welsh reporting separated.
- Implications for comparability:
  - 1978 national estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to changes in classification schemes and sampling density.
  - When comparing 1978 with later years using consistent statistical approaches, minor adjustments to results are expected; direct 1978-to-2007 change assessments require careful harmonization.
- Appendix and crosswalks:
  - Appendix II provides a habitat code lookup linking 1978 codes to Broad Habitats.
  - Appendix III outlines the evolution of the Land Classification across the years.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock for 1978

- Purpose of the results:
  - Provide a preliminary set of national stock estimates for selected Broad Habitats based on the digitised 1978 data, with caveats about cross-year comparability.
- Key caveats:
  - Estimates use the 1990 All-Squares classification for analysis due to limited 1978 sample size by class; direct comparison to 2007 classifications is not advised without harmonisation.
  - Some Habitat categories lack direct equivalents across publications, complicating comparisons with Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993).
  - National estimates are presented with mean areas and 95% limits; the data are intended as a basis for further harmonised time-series analyses.
- Notable patterns:
  - Broad Habitats such as Arable and Horticulture, Improved Grassland, and various woodland classes were quantified to enable stock and change assessments within the long-term framework.
  - The table indicates broad-scale distributions (e.g., woodland, grassland, arable, urban, bog, fen, and water-related habitats) with substantial implications for land-use history and ecological drivers.

## Comparability, Limitations and Future Work

- Main comparability issues:
  - Differences in reporting classes and the all-squares versus center-square approaches across years hinder direct 1978-to-2007 comparisons without a harmonised reclassification.
  - Some habitat definitions are not perfectly aligned across publications, especially grassland subcategories and upland categories.
  - Some very small habitats may be over- or under-represented due to classification biases in 1978.
- Future work:
  - Perform harmonised reclassification of 1978 data to align with the 1990/1998/2007 frameworks for robust change analysis.
  - Continue validating 1978 data against later years using plot-level and species/soil data to refine Broad Habitat allocations.
  - Expand metadata and data governance to facilitate data sharing, reproducibility, and transparent methodology documentation.
