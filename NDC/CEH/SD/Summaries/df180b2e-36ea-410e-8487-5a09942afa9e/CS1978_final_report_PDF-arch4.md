# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

- Aims and context
  - Digitizes the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to create a GIS-compatible, long-term, national dataset.
  - Extends the Countryside Survey time series back to 1978, enabling analysis of habitat stock and change from 1978 through later years (1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007).
  - Links historical land-cover with coincident plant species data and soil data (pH, Loss on Ignition) to study ecological variation and land-use change over three decades.
  - Translates 1978 field codes to Broad Habitats (BH) and notes challenges in allocation, particularly in upland areas and ambiguous categories.
  - Establishes a robust dataset for future modeling and cross-year comparisons, with caveats about comparability due to evolving classifications.

- History and data groundwork
  - Countryside Survey began in 1978 with eight vegetation plots per 1km square (reduced to five plus hedges/roads) and manual habitat mapping using 80 codes.
  - Earlier years (1984, 1990, 1998/99, 2007) progressively digitized; 1978 maps had not been digitized until this rescue project.
  - The new digitization enables matching 1978 data with later years to assess landscape change across GB and to investigate land-use drivers.

- Issues to address in the 1978 dataset
  - Internal consistency: visual and cross-year comparisons show the 1978 data are broadly consistent with later datasets, allowing reliable change detection.
  - Potential biases: transfer/coding bias during base-map assignment; bias from the digitizer was consistent across 1978 and later work.
  - Quality assurance: retrospective checks against species data and later surveys support data quality comparable to other Countryside Survey years.
  - Dataset robustness: despite limitations, the rescued data have been used in models since the 1980s, indicating reliability.

- Digitization procedure
  - Maps scanned (JPEG/PDF); primary field documents stored securely; digitization performed by ADAS in 2009 following an established protocol.
  - Digitized maps stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster; alignment with other years’ line work to minimize slivers, while recognizing the 1978 line work was produced independently.
  - Data backups and documentation accompany the digitized dataset to support reuse.

- Data checking, validation, and cross-year comparison
  - Initial quality checks for omissions and digitizing errors; then cross-year validation by placing each square on separate sheets for 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007.
  - Anonymization of survey square locations to preserve scientific integrity.
  - Validation with staff involved in the 1978 survey confirmed real changes where present (e.g., conifer planting, urbanization, shifts among grassland types).

- Broad Habitat allocations and mapping challenges
  - 1978 codes were translated to Broad Habitats; most were straightforward, but several were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath, or Acid Grassland).
  - Ambiguities resolved using habitat maps, vegetation plots, and, where possible, species data; visual checks conducted for each square.
  - Key issues identified and discussed:
    - Upland codes are difficult to delineate due to heterogeneity.
    - Some codes (e.g., Herb-rich pasture) could map to multiple broad habitats; clarifications required.
    - Inland Rock codes tended to be overestimated in 1978 due to mapping methods; later codes allowed secondary coding to adjust.
    - 1978-to-later mapping consistency improved by adopting a common framework in subsequent years.
  - Some 1978 areas align with Priority Habitats (BRIG, 2007), including Coastal Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture.

- ITE Land Classification and sampling approach
  - Original 1978 ITE Land Classification used 15x15 km grid intersections for square sampling; 6039 squares were classified for refinement.
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat per square within Land Classes and multiplying by Land Class area.
  - Evolution of land classification across years:
    - 1978: initial classification (ITE framework).
    - 1984: refinement and broader linkages with landscape analyses.
    - 1990: “All Squares” classification, more comprehensive GB coverage and urban/sea corrections.
    - 1998: expanded to 40 classes (including Scottish reporting).
    - 2007: expanded to 45 classes (including Welsh reporting).

- Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock for 1978
  - Estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differences in classification and sampling intensity; 1978 used 32-class ITE framework, while later years used updated all-squares classifications.
  - 1978 stock (GB-wide, in thousands of hectares) highlights:
    - Arable and Horticulture: ~5105 (about 21.9%)
    - Improved Grassland: ~5188 (about 22.3%)
    - Urban: ~1441 (about 6.2%)
    - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1677 (about 7.2%)
    - Bog: ~2004 (about 8.6%)
    - Acid Grassland: ~1786 (about 7.7%)
    - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995 (about 4.3%)
    - Coniferous Woodland: ~1413 (about 6.1%)
    - Neutral Grassland: ~1442 (about 6.2%)
    - Other habitats varied in range; total GB area accounted as 100%.
  - Note: Some categories may be over- or under-estimated due to 1978 classification limitations; urban and unsurveyed urban areas were treated with specific accounting decisions.

- Comparison with previously published 1978 data
  - New digitized results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
    - Differences in reporting classes and consolidation schemes.
    - Ambiguities in polygon-to-hroad allocations requiring alignment with available vegetation data.
    - Use of the revised All Squares Land Classification (1990+) in the new analysis, which increases comparability with Barr et al. (1993) rather than Bunce & Heal (1984).
  - Specific habitat notes:
    - Boundary/linear features and arable/horticulture estimates show discrepancies due to classification differences and methodology.
    - Fen, Marsh and Swamp and Calcareous Grassland are particularly challenging to compare across publications.
    - Urban figures differ due to treatment of unsurveyed urban land in earlier vs later classifications.
