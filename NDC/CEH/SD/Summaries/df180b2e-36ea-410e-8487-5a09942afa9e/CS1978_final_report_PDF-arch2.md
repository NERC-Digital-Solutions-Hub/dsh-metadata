# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Presents the digitisation and data rescue of the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to create a GIS-compatible dataset.
- Extends the Countryside Survey time series to 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998/99, and 2007, enabling analysis of habitat stock and change over 30 years.
- Aligns 1978 data with Broad Habitat classifications and later survey datasets to improve reliability and power of long-term analyses.

## What was done
- digitised the 256 annotated 1978 Countryside Survey maps into a GIS framework for Broad Habitat analysis.
- Re-allocated 1978 survey field codes to BAP Broad Habitats (with careful review where ambiguous).
- Linked the 1978 dataset with subsequent surveys to enable comparative analyses across the time series.

## Data management and digitization
- Maps scanned (jpg/pdf); primary maps stored securely; digitisation completed by ADAS in summer 2009.
- Digitised maps stored in a GIS system at CEH Lancaster; linked to plot data and species information where available.
- 1978 data integrated with 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 datasets, noting methodological and classification evolutions.

## Validation and quality control
- Initial checks for omissions and digitising errors against original maps.
- Compared each survey square across years (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) to distinguish real changes from errors.
- Collaborated with long-time researchers to assess whether observed changes were genuine, supporting data robustness.

## Broad Habitat Allocations
- Most 1978 codes easily translated to Broad Habitats (BH), but some were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be several BHs).
- Used original maps, vegetation plots, and species data to resolve allocations; visual checks performed on every square.
- Noted difficulties with upland codes and certain grassland categorisations; some areas treated as mosaics when necessary.
- Identified instances where Priority Habitats (e.g., Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture) could be distinguished.

## Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications
- 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification; later periods used revised classifications (All Squares approach from 1990 onward).
- National estimates for 1978 calculated with the 1990 (32-class) framework for consistency with later analyses, acknowledging that direct comparability with 2007 results is limited.
- Historical sampling evolved: 1980s-1990s refinements expanded class definitions and country-specific reporting (Scotland/Wales), influencing cross-year comparability.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Provides national stock estimates for selected Broad Habitats (not all directly comparable to 2007 results due to classification changes and sample size).
- Example highlights (mean areas and % GB):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~21.9%
  - Improved Grassland: ~22.3%
  - Neutral Grassland: ~6.2%
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~6.1%
  - Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~4.3%
  - Bog: ~8.6%
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~7.2%
  - Urban: ~6.2%
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp: ~1.0%
  - Standing Open Water and Canals: ~1.5%
- Notes that 1978 figures are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to methodological differences and reclassifications; the aim is consistency within the rescued dataset for future time-series analyses.

## Comparisons with Previously Published Data
- New digitised results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Incompatibilities between 1978 reporting classes and later classifications.
  - Allocation ambiguities in 1978 polygon codes, edited where needed to maintain consistency.
  - Transition from 1978 ITE Land Classification to the 1990 All Squares/All-Squares framework in later publications.
- Where published values fall outside the new limits, reasons include classification changes and bamboo of comparability.

## Notes on Specific Habitats
- Boundary and Linear Features: overestimation in earlier 1978 methods; reinterpreting with later classifications reduces bias.
- Arable and Horticulture / Grasslands: shifts in broad class definitions across years complicate direct comparisons.
- Fen, Marsh and Swamp; Calcareous Grassland; Inland Rock; Urban: differences partly due to varying definitions and mapping approaches; careful cross-referencing with vegetation plots helps refine allocations.
- Urban: 1978 urban areas treated as a separate “Unsurveyed Urban” component in some earlier work; later work standardized this within the broader urban category.

## Appendices and Data Access

- Appendix III: Summary of the ITE Land Classification.
- Maps and scanned materials archived; digitised data stored in CEH Lancaster’s GIS with access for researchers.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Restores a complete, long-term dataset enabling robust analysis of habitat stock and change from 1978 onward.
- Demonstrates the value of data rescue for maintaining longitudinal environmental monitoring frameworks.
- Highlights the importance of standardized classification systems and transparent documentation to support future reuse and policy scrutiny.
