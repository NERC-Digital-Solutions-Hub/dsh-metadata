# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- A data rescue project by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology to digitize and preserve the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps.
- Converts 256 primary field survey squares into a GIS-friendly format, enabling long-term comparison with 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 surveys.
- Adds a crucial 1978 data point to the GB-wide time series of Broad Habitat stock, enhancing analyses of land-use change and ecological variation.

## History and Background
- 1978 survey built on earlier Cumbria and Shetland work, using habitat sketch maps and 80-field codes.
- 1978 maps were not digital; digitization enables alignment with later survey years and Broad Habitat classifications (Jackson, 2000).
- The digitization enables linking habitat maps with plant species data and soil measurements (pH, LOI) collected in 1978.

## Issues Addressed Regarding the 1978 Dataset
- Consistency: Cross-year visual checks show the 1978 data are largely consistent with later surveys; real change is identifiable.
- Coding Bias: Bias from transfer to base maps acknowledged but considered consistent with the digitization process and comparable to later surveys.
- Quality Assurance: Absence of contemporaneous QA addressed by cross-checking against species data and later-year datasets.
- Robustness: Despite concerns, the non-spatial data have been used in models since the 1980s, indicating robustness.

## Digitization Procedure
- Maps scanned to .jpg and .pdf; originals stored securely; field data sheets also scanned.
- Digitization performed by ADAS in 2009 following CS1978 Data Rescue protocol; files stored in a CEH Lancaster GIS.
- Visual verification against original maps conducted during validation.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial checks for omissions and digitizing errors against field maps.
- Squares laid out per year on separate sheets to compare 1978 with 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007.
- Changes assessed with input from staff involved in the 1978 survey to determine real change vs. error.
- Examples show gradual shifts in habitat types over time within representative squares.

## Broad Habitat Allocations
- 1978 field codes largely mapped to BAP Broad Habitats (BH). Some codes were ambiguous (e.g., Mixed Upland Moor could be Bog, Dwarf Shrub Heath, or Acid Grassland).
- Ambiguities resolved using original habitat maps and vegetation plots where possible.
- Challenges:
  - Upland codes are hard to delineate in heterogeneous landscapes; mosaic allocations may be used in later surveys.
  - Some pasture codes (e.g., Herb Rich Pasture) required careful review to avoid misclassification as Calcareous Grassland or other habitats.
  - Inland Rock and Rock classifications differed between 1978 and later practices.
- Notes:
  - Some 1978 mappings to Neutral/Improved Grassland and related classes were not straightforward.
  - During digitization, 1978 linework was created independently but later found to be broadly consistent with other years.

## Note Regarding the ITE Land Classifications
- 1978 used the original ITE Land Classification (1228 squares; 1215 classified; 6039 squares when expanding around centre squares).
- National habitat areas were estimated by multiplying mean habitat per 1 km square within each Land Class by the Land Class area, then summing across GB.
- The 1990 “All Squares” reclassification later refined classifications for Scotland and Wales; 1998 and 2007 expanded class detail (40 then 45 classes).

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Provides stock estimates for a selection of Broad Habitats (not all directly comparable to 2007 due to different classification schemes and sample sizes).
- Key figures (illustrative, GB-wide percent areas):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~21.9%
  - Improved Grassland: ~22.3%
  - Urban: ~6.2%
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~6.1%
  - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~4.3%
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~7.2%
  - Bog: ~8.6%
  - Acid Grassland: ~7.7%
  - Neutral Grassland: ~6.2%
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp: ~1.0%
  - Standing Open Water and Canals: ~1.5%
  - Rivers and Streams: ~0.3%
  - Inland Rock: ~0.8%
  - Other Land: ~1.1%
- Important caveats:
  - Estimates are not directly comparable with 2007 results due to differing Land Class schemes (32 vs 45 classes) and retrospective broad-habitat allocations.
  - The limited 256-square sample influences comparability and precision.

## Comparisons with Previously Published Data (8.1 and 8.1.1)
- Newly digitized results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Differences in the Land Classification used (1978 vs All Squares; 32 vs 45 classes).
  - Ambiguities in how 1978 polygons mapped to Broad Habitats.
  - Revisions in later analyses (e.g., all-squares approach) aligning more closely with Barr et al. (1993).
- Some previously published values fall outside the new dataset’s limits (noted in red); explanations include overestimation by 1978 classification and differences in class definitions.
- Urban and some grassland categories show notable shifts due to methodological changes and inclusion/exclusion of unsurveyed urban land in different publications.

## Appendices and Data Details
- Appendix II: Habitat Code Lookup Table mapping 1978 codes to Broad Habitat allocations (BH).
- Appendix III: Summary of the ITE Land Classification evolution and flowchart of class changes across years.
- Maps and habitat classifications support cross-year analysis and reproducibility.

## Implications for Data Support and Use
- The rescued 1978 dataset enables robust, long-term analysis of habitat stock and change from 1978 onward when combined with 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 data.
- Data now in a GIS format facilitates integration with species, soil (pH, LOI), and vegetation data for comprehensive analyses.
- Appropriate caution is needed when comparing 1978 results to later years due to changing land classifications and class definitions; future work will refine cross-year comparability.
