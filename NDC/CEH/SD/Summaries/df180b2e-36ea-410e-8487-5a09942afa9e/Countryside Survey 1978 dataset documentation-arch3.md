# Broad Habitat Area Estimates by Land Class for Great Britain

- National estimates of Broad Habitat stock (Habitats 1-21, excluding 15 and 20) for 1978, derived using the 1990 ITE Land Classification. Based on Countryside Survey data (CEH/NERC) and linked to the 30-year habitat-change assessment framework.
- Purpose within monitoring frameworks: provide baseline habitat area by Land Class to scrutinise policy implications, evaluate environmental health, and inform future decisions.

## Data products

- CS1978_Estimates_by_LC.csv
  - Content: National estimates of Broad Habitat area by Land Class for 1978.
  - Includes: YEAR, LAND_CLASS, BROAD_HABITAT, BROAD_HABITAT_NAME, LAND_CLASS_AREA (000s ha), MEAN_ESTIMATE (000s ha), LOWER_ESTIMATE (95% CI) and UPPER_ESTIMATE (95% CI) (000s ha).
  - Note: Excludes Broad Habitat codes 15 and 20 from the dataset.
  - Methodology reference: 1990 ITE Land Classification (per Bunce et al.; Scott 2007).

- CS78_BH1_17.tif
  - Content: 1 km pixel raster of Broad Habitat proportions within each Land Class.
  - Details: Each raster band corresponds to a Broad Habitat class (e.g., Band 1 = Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland; Band 2 = Coniferous Woodland; Band 3 = Boundary and Linear Features; Band 4 = Arable and Horticulture; … Band 16 = Urban).
  - Spatial details: 1 km pixel size, British National Grid, OSGB36 projection.

## Spatial and data details

- Year of survey: 1978.
- Land Classification basis: ITE Merlewood Land Classification (Bunce et al., 1996; 1981; linked through Bunce et al. and Scott 2007).
- Purpose of the raster: convert Land Class totals to pixel-level percentages for mapping Broad Habitat distribution within Land Classes.
- Coverage: Great Britain.

## How this supports monitoring and policy evaluation

- Provides a transparent, baseline quantification of habitat stocks by Land Class for 1978, enabling longitudinal assessments of habitat change when combined with subsequent Countryside Survey data.
- Facilitates policy evaluation by offering standardized historic measures of Broad Habitat distribution and density across Land Classes.
- Supports data governance in monitoring frameworks through documented data sources, classification schemes, and explicit data sharing/acknowledgement requirements.
- Highlights the linkage between field-based classifications (1 km survey squares) and per-land-class area estimates, supporting spatially explicit monitoring and mapping efforts.
