# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Executive overview
- Purpose: rescue and digitize the 1978 Countryside Survey land-cover maps to create a GIS-compatible dataset and extend the long-term time series of Broad Habitat data back to 1978.
- Outcome: digitization of 256 1km survey squares, with maps now stored in a CEH Lancaster GIS; enables analysis of Broad Habitat stock and change across GB from 1978 onward.
- Scientific value: links 1978 habitat maps with coincident plant species and soil (pH, LOI) data, allowing assessment of habitat mosaics and environmental drivers two decades after post-WWII agricultural intensification.
- Data quality and transparency: dataset checked against original maps, cross-validated with later survey data, and documented with clear notes on uncertainties, biases, and methods to maximize reliability and future reuse.

## Digitization and data architecture
- Process: maps scanned (jpg/pdf); digitized in 2009 by ADAS following CS1978 Data Rescue protocol; digitized maps stored in a GIS at CEH Lancaster.
- Data mapping: 1978 field codes translated to BAP Broad Habitats; consistency checked against subsequent years’ data.
- Access and metadata: documentation includes how changes were validated and how to access the digitized datasets and maps.

## Data checking and validation
- Intra-dataset checks: scanned maps compared with original field maps to identify omissions or digitizing errors; anomalies corrected.
- Inter-year consistency: each survey square reconciled with 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 datasets to distinguish real change from error.
- Spatial integrity: squares anonymized spatially to protect location confidentiality in published figures.
- Example comparisons: square-level assessments illustrate habitat change patterns (e.g., conifer planting, grassland changes, urbanisation).

## Broad Habitat allocations
- Translation: majority of 1978 codes mapped directly to Broad Habitats (e.g., Conifer Woodland = BH 2); some categories required careful adjudication.
- Ambiguities resolved with supporting data: original annotated habitat maps and vegetation plots used to clarify allocations.
- Key challenges:
  - Upland codes difficult to delineate; may be treated as mosaics in later datasets.
  - Certain codes (e.g., 23 Herb-rich pasture) could map to multiple Broad Habitats; resolution relied on supplementary data.
  - Inland Rock and rock-derived classifications differed between 1978 and later years.
  - Some 1978 mappings were aligned with later line-work (1984/1990) to avoid slivers, but remain inherently retrospective in some aspects.
- Potential identifications: Priority Habitats identified in some 1978 areas (Saltmarsh, Blanket Bog, Purple Moor Grass Rush Pasture).

## Note regarding the ITE Land Classifications
- Sampling framework: original 15 x 15 km grid with 1215 squares classified; ISA used to extend classification to 6039 squares across GB for analysis.
- Evolution of classifications:
  - 1978: original ITE Land Classification used for national estimates.
  - 1980s–1990: All Squares classification refined; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 1998: Scottish classifications separated; 40 classes.
  - 2007: Welsh classification separated; 45 classes.
- Implication: 1978 national estimates are not directly comparable to 2007 results due to differing classifications and sample structures; cross-year comparisons require careful harmonization.

## Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
- Scope: GB stock estimates produced for a subset of Broad Habitats (not all later-classes).
- Presentation: mean area per habitat (000s ha) and percent area of GB; accompanying 95% confidence limits.
- Example figures (illustrative; full table in the report):
  - Arable and Horticulture: ~5105 (GB, 000s ha), ~21.9% of GB
  - Improved Grassland: ~5188 (GB, 000s ha), ~22.3% of GB
  - Coniferous Woodland: ~1413 (GB, 000s ha), ~6.1% of GB
  - Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland: ~995 (GB, 000s ha), ~4.3% of GB
  - Acid Grassland: ~1786 (GB, 000s ha), ~7.7% of GB
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath: ~1677 (GB, 000s ha), ~7.2% of GB
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp: ~231 (GB, 000s ha), ~1.0% of GB
  - Bog: ~2004 (GB, 000s ha), ~8.6% of GB
  - Urban: ~1441 (GB, 000s ha), ~6.2% of GB
  - Other Land, Inland Water, etc.: additional categories included
- Caution on comparability: these 1978 estimates are not directly interchangeable with 1984–2007 results due to classification changes and sample size limitations; direct trend analysis requires harmonized methods.

## Comparison with previously published data
- New 1978 results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
  - Differences in Land Classification used (1978 vs 1990 All Squares) and resulting class definitions.
  - Reallocation of 1978 polygons to Broad Habitats with improved supporting data.
  - Some 1978 areas edited for consistency with later data when obvious real change was not supported by available data.
- General pattern: Barr et al. (1993) results align more closely with the rescued 1978 dataset than Bunce & Heal (1984) due to the 1990 All Squares framework.

## Notes on specific habitats and interpretation
- Boundary and Linear Features: Bunce & Heal (1984) overestimation likely due to 1978 Land Classification bias toward small habitats.
- Arable and Horticulture: newly digitized estimates higher than previous figures; classification differences contribute.
- Fen, Marsh and Swamp; Calcareous Grassland; Acid Grassland; Dwarf Shrub Heath: comparing across publications is difficult due to differing reporting classes and ambiguous 1978 mappings.
- Urban: 1978 urban estimates adjusted in later work; unsurveyed urban land treated as a constant in this analysis.

## Implications for research and future use
- Extends robust time-series analyses of Broad Habitat stock and change back to 1978, enabling assessment of long-term land-use impacts on habitat composition, plant species, and soils.
- Provides a transparent, citable digitization workflow and QA processes for historical data rescue.
- Highlights the need for careful cross-year harmonization when combining datasets with evolving land classifications and sampling schemes.
