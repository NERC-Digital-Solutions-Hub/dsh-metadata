# Countryside Survey: Measuring Habitat Change over 30 years 1978 Data Rescue - Final Report (CEH Project no.: NEC03689)

## Overview
- Documents a data rescue project to digitize the 1978 Countryside Survey field maps and linework, creating a GIS-ready dataset to extend the Countryside Survey time series back to 1978.
- Purpose: enable analysis of Broad Habitat stock and change across Great Britain over 30 years, aligning with later surveys (1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) and linking habitat data with plant species and soil data.
- Outcome: 1978 data converted from hard copy to digital GIS format and integrated with subsequent years for cross-year comparisons, with careful attention to metadata, provenance, and quality checks.

## Data Rescue and Digitization Details
- Primary records (land-cover maps and field data) were at risk; the 1978 maps had never been digitised prior to this project.
- Process:
  - Scanned maps and plot sheets into digital formats (jpg, pdf); originals backed up and stored securely.
  - Digitized maps by ADAS in summer 2009; data stored in a GIS system at CEH Lancaster.
  - 2007 data were already captured digitally; 1984/1990/1998 line work aligned to ensure comparability with earlier years.
- Storage and access:
  - Digital data housed in CEH Lancaster GIS; primary field sheets kept in Field Assessment Book (FAB) boxes.
  - Visual checks and cross-year verifications conducted to ensure robust integration with later datasets.

## Data Checking and Validation
- Initial checks for omissions or digitizing errors against original maps.
- Cross-year consistency checks: each survey square for 1978 and other years laid out on sheets to compare changes (anonymized locations to preserve scientific integrity).
- Validation steps included verifying changes with plot data and species data; visual scrutiny by staff confirmed 1978 data quality as comparable to other CS datasets.
- Notes on transparency:
  - Square locations were spatially manipulated to prevent identification, preserving scientific relevance.

## Broad Habitat Allocations and Classification
- 1978 field codes translated to Broad Habitat Allocations (BH) with most straightforward mappings, but several ambiguous cases required review.
- Ambiguities resolved using:
  - Original habitat maps annotated with species data.
  - Vegetation plots when available.
  - Visual per-square checks to ensure appropriate Broad Habitat allocation.
- Notable issues:
  - Upland codes were difficult to delineate; mosaics may be treated as a Mosaic in later surveys.
  - Some codes (e.g., 23 Herb-rich pasture) could map to multiple BH categories (Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath).
  - Inland Rock was overestimated in 1978 due to methodology changes in later years (secondary coding in 1990+).
  - 1978 line work differed from 1984/1990 line work; however, after review, 1978 data showed high consistency with other datasets.

## Data Provenance, Classification, and Comparability
- Land Classification framework:
  - 1978 used original ITE Land Classification across a 15 x 15 km grid; Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) helped classify 6039 squares (and 4 surrounding squares).
  - National habitat area estimates calculated as mean habitat per square within a Land Class times Land Class area; reporting across GB.
- Evolution of classifications:
  - 1984 and 1990 used revised schemes; 1990 introduced the All Squares classification (broadened and refined classes).
  - 1998 and 2007 further refined classifications (40 classes in Scotland, 45 in Wales by 2007).
- For comparability:
  - 1978 data were retrospectively allocated to the 1990 All Squares framework when feasible, but direct comparability with 2007 results is limited by differences in classes and sample sizes.
  - The report cautions that adding 1978 to the time series will cause minor shifts in results for later years.

## Access, Formats, and Documentation
- Digitized data are stored in a GIS system at CEH Lancaster; primary maps available in FAB boxes and digitized sheets stored in S:\PARR Section\LUS\resources\CS_digital_images\CEH.
- Appendices provide:
  - Habitat Code Lookup Table (mapping 1978 descriptions to Broad Habitat Allocations).
  - Summary of the ITE Land Classification evolution.
  - Habitat maps and classifications for reference.

## Specific Notes on Comparability and Results
- 8. Results: National Estimates of Broad Habitat Stock 1978
  - Provides stock estimates for a subset of Broad Habitats; results are not directly comparable to 2007 due to differing classifications and sample sizes.
  - 1978 results are based on 256 survey squares; later years use expanded schemes with more squares and refined classes.
- 8.1 Comparison with Previously Published Data
  - New digitized results differ from Bunce & Heal (1984) and Barr et al. (1993) due to:
    - Different Land Classifications and aggregation of classes.
    - Revisions in classification schemes (All Squares vs. original ITE).
    - Ambiguities in 1978 polygon allocations and subsequent edits for consistency.
  - Generally, new results align more closely with Barr et al. (1993) than with Bunce & Heal (1984) due to the use of revised classifications.
- 8.1.1 Notes on Specific Habitats
  - Some habitats show discrepancies (e.g., Boundary/Linear Features, Arable/Horticulture, Fen/Marsh/Swamp) largely due to classification differences and definitional ambiguities in 1978 data.
  - Urban area adjustments: unsurveyed urban land treated as a constant value in later analyses; 1978 Land Classification did not separate unsurveyed urban as in later publications.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Demonstrates a robust approach to rescuing and integrating legacy datasets with modern standards.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Clear provenance and documentation of digitization procedures.
  - Transparent handling of ambiguous classifications and per-square quality checks.
  - Consistent cross-year mapping to enable time-series analyses, with explicit caveats about comparability.
  - Maintaining access controls and anonymization to protect square locations while supporting research.
- Suggests ongoing work to refine comparability across years and to document metadata for end-users, including the limitations of cross-year habitat classifications.
