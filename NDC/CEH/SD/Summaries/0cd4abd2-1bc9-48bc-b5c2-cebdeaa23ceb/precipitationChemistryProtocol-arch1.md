# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1

## Aim
- To measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk sampler.

## Rationale
- Builds on century-long interest in acid rain and its ecosystem effects; deposition of atmospherically transported pollutants can impact physical, chemical, and biotic components of ecosystems.
- Deposition has two components: wet (rain/snow) and dry (gaseous/particulate); bulk collection captures both, with the option to separate later but at higher cost.
- Enables linking ECN data with UKPCMN networks and supports understanding future impacts from emission changes.

## Equipment and Method
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a collecting bottle, with a 1 mm mesh Teflon filter; jacketed to keep sample dark and cool; sample head at 1.75 m above ground; optional bird deterrent.
- Funnel sizes: two options (115 mm and 152 mm diameter); standard is 152 mm.
- Sample handling: weekly bottle change; maintain clean funnels; ice/snow allowed to melt into new bottle; samples weighed to determine volume; conductivity and pH measured on unfiltered water; filtered later for dissolved ions.
- Analysis: after filtration, analyze for Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P and alkalinity.
- Volume accuracy: use data from a nearby automatic weather station or standard raingauge to calculate precipitation volume, due to potential underestimation by bulk collector after snow events.
- Location considerations: place collector upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses; sit away from obstructions but near soil solution samplers when practical; secure to base or with guy ropes.

## Sampling, Labelling, and Handling
- Sampling procedure per Appendix I: prepare clean bottles, filters, and funnels; document contamination signs (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances); ensure caps are securely fastened to prevent leakage.
- Sampling schedule: change bottles weekly on Wednesdays at 0900 GMT; ensure funnel is clean or replaced if contaminated; ensure top of funnel is level before sampling.
- Labelling: samples identified by ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date; labels accompany results through all analytical stages.
- Washing: laboratory washing of funnel, filter, and bottle with deionised or distilled water using specified cleaning agents.

## Recording Conventions and Data Specification
- Core measurement: precipitation chemistry (PC) data collected weekly.
- Key identifiers required for datasets: Site Identification Code (e.g., T05), Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date/Time (GMT 24-h clock).
- Recorded variables (with units and precision):
  - Volume (ml) and Sampling Time (GMT 24-h clock)
  - pH (conducted on unfiltered water; units on pH scale)
  - Conductivity (µS cm-1; precision 0.1)
  - Alkalinity + (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Na+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Ca2+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Mg2+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Fe2+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Cl- (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - NO3--N (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - SO4--S (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - PO4--P (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - NH4+-N (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
- Data formats and transfer procedures are documented in ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; data should be uploaded with all required identifiers and measured values.
