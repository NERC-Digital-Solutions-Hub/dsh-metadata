# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim and Rationale
- Purpose: measure chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk deposition) at ECN sites using a continuously open gauge.
- Context: historical interest in acid rain and ecosystem impacts; bulk deposition captures both wet and dry inputs for UK ECN site integration with UKPCMN data.
- Data use: supports understanding of deposition processes and long-term environmental monitoring; data are intended for linkage with other UK monitoring networks.

## Equipment and Method
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a polythene collecting bottle; two funnel sizes (primarily 152 mm diameter) with a 63° cone; top ~1.75 m above ground; 1 mm mesh Teflon filter to exclude debris; jacketed bottle to keep sample dark and cool; bird deterrent.
- Materials: removable filter, steel jacket, cleaning/assembly components; Appendix II lists complete assembly and spares; supplier details provided.
- Sampling site setup: collector bolted to concrete base or secured; placed upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses; near TSS and soil samplers when feasible but without obstructing instruments.
- Volume and lab testing: volume determined by weighing bottle with contents; conductivity and pH measured on unfiltered water; post-filtering analysis for specific ions and alkalinity.

## Location and Deployment Considerations
- site selection to minimize local contamination; avoid proximity to vehicles, dusty paths, and animal houses; open, unobstructed locations near other ECN equipment when possible.
- installation practices to prevent movement or leakage (firmly fixed, appropriate height, regular maintenance intervals).

## Sampling Protocol
- Frequency: weekly sample collection; standard collection time is Wednesday at 0900 GMT.
- Procedure: replace sample bottle with a clean bottle and filter; clean or replace funnel as needed; transfer ice/snow directly into new bottle if present, without prior cleaning.
- Handling: replace funnel and filter during bottle changes; ensure the sample bottle cap is secured to prevent leakage during transport.
- Volume determination: determine precipitation volume on arrival in the laboratory by weighing bottle with contents.
- Laboratory analysis sequence: measure volume, then analyze dissolved constituents after filtration; follow ECN Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol for pH and conductivity on unfiltered water; subsequent ion analyses per specified targets.

## Labeling, Metadata, and Recording
- Unique sample identification: combination of ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date (e.g., 01-Jan-1996) to be marked on the bottle and accompanying records.
- Field disturbance codes: recording form captures potential factors affecting chemistry (insects, dust, bird droppings) and local disturbances (fires, dust sources, etc.).
- Data transfer: results must accompany the sample through analytical stages and into the ECN database; standard data transfer documentation exists (restricted access Site Managers' extranet; contact ECNCCU for access).

## Quality Assurance and Documentation
- QA approach: follows procedures established for the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network, including assessment of sampling, handling, and analytical errors.
- References and prior work: cites UK networks and standard methods (e.g., Devenish 1986; Hall 1986; Heyes et al. 1985; Last & Watling 1991; Review Group on Acid Rain 1990; Smith 1872).
- Documentation: standard field recording forms and explicit recording conventions provided (Appendix I: Routine sample collection; Appendix II: Equipment details; supplier information).

## Data Recording Conventions and Dataset Specifications
- Core dataset: weekly measurements with standardized fields.
- Key identifying fields (must be included in all datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (GMT; time element if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurements and variables (weekly):
  - Setting out date/time; sampling time
  - Volume (ml); pH (unfiltered water and after filtration as applicable)
  - Conductivity (µS cm-1; precision 0.1)
  - Alkalinity (+) (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Fe2+, Al3+ (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
  - Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4---P, NH4+-N (mg L-1; precision 3 sig figs)
- Data format considerations: ECNCCU 2001 data transfer standards govern dataset formatting; datasets for Site Managers’ extranet require specific schema and coding.

## Appendices and Documentation
- Appendix I: Routine sample collection – step-by-step field procedures, equipment checks, contamination prevention, and cap/ bottle handling to ensure integrity.
- Appendix II: Equipment details – complete assembly, spares, recommended quantities per site, and supplier information (Just Plastics Ltd, The Maltings, etc.).
- Recording forms and data transfer documentation are provided for consistency and traceability.
