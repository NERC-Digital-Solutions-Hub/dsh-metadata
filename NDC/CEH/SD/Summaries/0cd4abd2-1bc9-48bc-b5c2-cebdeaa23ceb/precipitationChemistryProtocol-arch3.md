# PC Protocol

- Aim and Rationale
  - Purpose: to measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk precipitation gauge.
  - Rationale: builds on a long history of acidic deposition research and its ecosystem impacts; aims to monitor atmospheric deposition as emissions change, with bulk deposition enabling practical, cost-effective data collection and linkage to UK PCMN data.

- Data and Data Governance (implications for monitoring frameworks)
  - Data are collected in a manner compatible with UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks to enable regional comparability.
  - Emphasis on unique identification of samples (site, core measurement, location, date/time) and consistent recording conventions.
  - Data transfer and dataset formats are specified in accompanying documentation (restricted extranet); data sharing and provenance are key considerations for transparency and reuse.
  - QA parallels established Acid Deposition Monitoring Network procedures; aims to assess and minimize errors in sampling, handling, and analysis.

- Equipment and Location
  - Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a collecting bottle, with a steel jacket, 1 mm PTFE filter, and a 25 mm air gap; collector placed about 1.75 m above ground; bird deterrent employed.
  - Variants: two funnel sizes (115 mm and 152 mm diameter) with 63° cone; 152 mm preferred for ECN sites.
  - Placement: upwind of contamination sources; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses; away from obstructions; near the weather station if feasible; secure installation (bolted or guyed).

- Sampling Procedure
  - Weekly collection: ideally every Wednesday at 0900 GMT; replace bottle with clean one and new filter; for snow/ice, melt in the new bottle without cleaning the ice/snow.
  - Handling: transport to laboratory with minimal contamination; volume determined by weight of bottle contents to the nearest 1 ml.
  - In-field checks: field recording of potential disturbances (dust, bird droppings, insects, etc.).

- Analytical Methods
  - In-lab: conduct conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; after filtering, analyze dissolved ions.
  - Analytes: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P, and alkalinity.
  - Volume-based flux calculations should use precipitation volume from an adjacent automatic weather station or standard rain gauge; bulk collector volume may be less accurate after snow.

- Labeling and Metadata
  - Each sample must be uniquely identified by ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, and Sampling Date.
  - Labels to accompany results through all analytical stages; recording form to capture potential affecting factors (e.g., insects, dust, bird droppings, local disturbances).

- Routine Collection and Equipment Handling (Appendix I and II)
  - Required materials: clean sample bottle, wash bottle with de-ionised water, forceps, two clean funnel filters, two clean funnels, cap, bag for funnel assembly, field recording form, pencil.
  - Stepwise procedures: detach funnel, replace bottle and filter, ensure clean handling to prevent contamination, reassemble funnel, verify horizontal funnel top, ensure cap is tightly closed.
  - Equipment details: complete assembly with stand, bottle holder, funnel, filters; recommended to have three funnel assemblies per site; supplier information provided.

- Quality Assurance
  - QA procedures align with the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network, including evaluation of sampling, handling, and analytical errors.
  - References to key sources for network design, equipment, and protocols are provided for context and benchmarking.

- Data Recording and Reporting (Measurement Variables)
  - Core recording fields (must be included in all datasets): Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time (GMT).
  - Weekly variables recorded: sampling time, volume, pH, conductivity (µS cm-1), alkalinity (mg L-1), major cations/anions (Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P) with specified units and precision.
  - Recording conventions specify units, time formats (GMT 24-h clock), and precision requirements (e.g., 0.1 for conductivity, 3 significant figures for most ions).

- Data Management and Access
  - Standard field recording form available; dataset specifications referenced in the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation.
  - Data and metadata management emphasize traceability from field collection to laboratory analysis to final dataset submission.
  - Access to detailed data transfer documentation may be restricted; contact ECNCCU for access or guidance as needed.

- Notes
  - A reminder to record the date/time when the bottle was last emptied and set out, supporting data provenance and quality assessment.
