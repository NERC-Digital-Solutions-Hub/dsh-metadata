# WAG Protocol

- Aim
  - Provide analytical guidelines for water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Each laboratory manages its resources, but must analyze under controlled conditions and document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - Analytical Working Group (one representative per lab) conducts annual reviews.

- Approved and reference techniques
  - Approved techniques cover determinands such as pH, conductivity, Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, HCO3-, PO4 3-, DOC, Total N, etc.
  - Alternatives are listed with notes; reference techniques include HMSO Blue Books and methods like AAS, IC/OES, Col-indophenol blue, Col-Hg/thiocyanate, Col-molybdenum blue, etc.
  - Laboratories must report data for the specified fraction; if a lab uses a slightly different fraction, they should monitor both techniques to check bias.
  - Analytical ranges and detection limits differ by lab; defined limits provide a uniform guideline.

- Priority and sample handling when volumes are limited
  - Priority (1 = highest): pH and conductivity.
  - Next priorities: cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+) and anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, then PO4 3-, Cl-).
  - Follow-up priorities: NH4+-N; Fe2+, Al3+; DOC; Total N, alkalinity.

- Providing details of methodology
  - Laboratories keep method details on-site; ECN database holds a meta-record per determinand per site.
  - Example field: substance, sample types, typical concentrations, calibration ranges, detection limits, accuracy notes, and QC measures.
  - Changes to methods are timestamped with new database records.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation via approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participate in interlaboratory analyses (e.g., AQUACHECK).
  - Accuracy: closeness to true value; track accuracy checks and corrections; record intercommunity agreement.
  - An accuracy example record demonstrates reporting of results, methods, lab, and percentage relative error.
  - Precision: use synthetic QC solutions to monitor batch bias; report QC data with results.

- Data management and reporting
  - Accuracy and precision records should be submitted to the ECN Database Manager in machine-readable form.
  - A separate QC dataset is maintained for each batch, including anion and cation results.

- Quality control procedures
  - A separate QC system for ECN participants; laboratories should continue independent QC assessment and join interlaboratory schemes.
  - Potential for site-to-site correction factors if all sites use the same QC solutions.
  - QC data management and batch-level monitoring are emphasized.

- QC solution preparation and procedure
  - Two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) prepared at Merlewood; diluted to working standards for use in analytical batches.
  - Subsamples may be acidified to match matrices; QC samples are analyzed identically to other samples.
  - A new concentrate is prepared annually, with continuity checks by re-analyzing previous year’s QC solutions.

- Data transfer format and example
  - QC data sent to ECN CCU in a free-format, comma-separated dataset with fields for preparation dates, analysis dates, pH measurements, conductivity, determinands, and QC codes.
  - Example provided for Moor House QC record, illustrating structure and field contents.

- Notes and references
  - Guidance on pH measurement in low ionic strength waters and separate reference to Initial Water Handling Protocol for certain steps.
  - Emphasis on documenting methodology changes and ensuring data suitability for purpose.
