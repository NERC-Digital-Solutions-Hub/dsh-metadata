# WAG Protocol

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for the analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Each laboratory bears responsibility for its analytical resources and for conducting analyses under controlled conditions.
- Laboratories must document methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- An Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory conducts annual reviews of procedures.

## Scope and Responsibilities
- Laboratories manage their own resources but adhere to controlled analytical conditions.
- Documentation of methodologies, changes, and validation is required.
- Regular annual review of methods by the Analytical Working Group to ensure consistency and quality.

## Analytical Techniques and Determinand Qualifications
- Approved techniques specified for each determinand, with alternative techniques listed in a table (superscripts reference notes).
- Key determinands include pH, conductivity, major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg), Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3-, SO4-S, HCO3-, PO4-P, DOC, Total N.
- Reference techniques are provided as primary comparison methods for evaluating new or alternative methodologies.
- For pH and conductivity, guidance references separate protocols; detection limits are defined to guide laboratory capability.
- Laboratories must report data for the specified fraction and monitor alternative techniques for bias when using non-standard methods.

## Priority Listing of Determinands
- When sample volumes are limited (e.g., during low rainfall), a priority order guides analytical choices:
  1) pH, conductivity
  2) Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ first; then K+, Na+)
  3) Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, then PO4 3-, Cl-)
  4) NH4-N
  6) Cations requiring separate acidified portions (Fe2+, Al3+)
  5) DOC
 7) Total-N, alkalinity
- See the Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling details.

## Providing Methodology Details and Data Provenance
- Laboratories keep detailed methodology records for operators; a summary is stored in the ECN database.
- Each ECN site and determinand has a data record linking site, core measurement, determinand, date, methodology, and precision.
- Example records (e.g., nitrate) illustrate typical concentration ranges, calibration, and measurement specifics.

## Validation, Accuracy, and Precision
- Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK).
- Accuracy: assessed by agreement with broader analytical community and control samples; record accuracy checks and corrective procedures if needed.
- Precision: ensured via quality control (QC) samples; results reported to Site Managers; data submission adjusted if QC indicates unacceptable performance.
- Laboratories submit accuracy results to the ECN Database Manager in machine-readable form.

## Quality Control Procedures
- A distinct ECN QC system complements laboratory QC; participation in accredited interlaboratory exchanges is encouraged.
- Potential to compute between-site correction factors to detect trends or rogue batches.
- QC procedures involve: preparing concentrated QC solutions for cations and anions, analyzing QC alongside samples, and updating QC solutions annually.
- Data from QC analyses are transferred to the ECN CCU in a specified format; QC data share the same dataset as samples, with appropriate date fields.

## Data Transfer, Formatting, and Documentation
- QC data must be submitted in the ECN data format, using comma-separated values, with fields for measurement code, site, QC code, preparation dates, analysis dates, determinations (pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, etc.), and a quality code.
- A detailed field list specifies the sequence and units for each parameter.
- An example Moor House QC record demonstrates the required structure and content.

## Change Control, Traceability, and Data Integrity
- Any methodological changes trigger a new database record stamped with the change date.
- Instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training are managed by the laboratory and reflected in the data records.
- The protocol emphasizes documenting changes to assess suitability for purpose and maintain data integrity.

## Example and Documentation References
- Example records (e.g., nitrate method) illustrate data formats, accuracy checks, and QC procedures.
- The protocol references the Initial Water Handling Protocol for related sample handling guidance.
- Emphasizes ongoing accuracy and precision assessment through AQUACHECK and internal QC measures.
