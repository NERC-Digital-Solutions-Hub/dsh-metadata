# WH Protocol

- Aim: To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water samples, and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.
- Rationale: Samples deteriorate after collection; deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and for Al and Fe determinations, acidification. Some activities require lab training, equipment, and health and safety compliance.

## Initial storage
- Store in cold conditions (1–4°C) if more than 7 hours will pass before measurements.
- Return to cold storage if filtration isn’t completed the same day as measurements.
- If sending to another site, send on the collection day by the fastest method; in transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the HMSO (1978) method; report results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
- Conductivity measurement must precede pH measurement; use a separate subsample if needed and avoid returning the subsample to the main sample.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample.
- Use the HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report results to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using the Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, refer to the AG Protocol for determinand priority.
- For Al and Fe determinations, transfer a 20 ml subsample (from samples >100 ml) and acidify with 20 µl HCl.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should occur within 16 days of collection, but no later than 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize the period outside cold storage; prefer next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatches.

## Documentation and sample coding
- Use unique sample codes: ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code (e.g., SS sampler code).
- Submit final data for inclusion in the ECN database with the unique reference.

## Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedure)
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Cleaning and handling: rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch filtered surfaces; use forceps; one filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: soils (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering through a glass fibre pre-filter, which must be washed with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Filtrate handling: pour filtered water into a clean, dry 250 ml bottle; do not return filtrate to unfiltered bottle.
- Subsampling for Al/Fe: if volume >100 ml, collect a 20 ml subsample for Al/Fe with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: containers must include ECN Site ID, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; ensure unique reference for ECN database submission.
- Suppliers: lists of contact points for BDH/Whatman/Millipore are provided.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Cleaning agents: use agents free of phosphate and hypochlorite; options include Decon products or Decon-90; avoid phosphate-containing cleaners.
- Cleaning steps: wash with cleaning agent, rinse four times in tap water and three times in deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times in distilled water and reseal; if used with the same sampler later, reuse is allowed.
- Drying and storage: shake to remove water drops, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and recap immediately.

## Additional notes
- Author references and suppliers are provided for protocol validation and equipment sourcing.
- Procedure emphasizes standardised methods, traceability, and data integrity for environmental monitoring outputs.
