# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
  - To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slowing methods include filtration, cold storage, and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
  - Requires laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
  - Background quality control procedures are referenced in related documents.

- Key procedures and standards
  - Initial storage and transport
    - Store samples at 1–4°C if more than seven hours elapse before measurements.
    - Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed on the same day as measurements.
    - If samples are sent to another site, ship on the day of collection; use cool boxes with pre-frozen blocks during transit.
  - Conductivity measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
    - Report results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
  - pH measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH.
    - Conductivity must be measured first; do not return the subsample to the main sample after measurement.
    - Report pH to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).
  - Filtering
    - Filter within 60 hours of collection using the Appendix I method.
    - Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
    - After filtration, analyze for dissolved ions: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
    - If sample volume is insufficient to measure all determinands, use priority order as specified.
    - For samples >100 ml, take a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
    - Separate documentation is provided for chemical analysis; assign unique sample codes per ECN guidelines.
  - Storage prior to chemical analysis
    - Store at 1–4°C; analysis should occur within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
    - If samples are sent to another location, minimize the time out of cold storage (advocated: next-day delivery; no Friday despatch).
  - Metadata, labeling, and data submission
    - Label containers with ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code to uniquely identify the sample.
    - Ensure the final data submitted to the ECN database includes the unique reference.
  - Washing bottles and containers
    - Appendix II specifies cleaning agents free of phosphate and hypochlorite; use Decon-90 or similar and rinse sequences.
    - Containers are washed before first use and then approximately every six months or when contaminated; dried and recapped after washing.
  - Procedures and suppliers
    - Appendix I lists equipment and brands for filtering (e.g., filter funnels, membranes, vacuum pump) and handling to avoid contamination.
    - Appendix II provides detailed bottle and vial washing procedures and acceptable cleaning products.
  - Author references
    - J.K. Adamson, HMSO, 1978 and 1988 (conductivity, pH determination, and low ionic strength water methods).

- Data governance and monitoring-framework relevance
  - Emphasizes traceability through unique sample codes and detailed documentation for each step.
  - Requires timely data collection and sharing within established databases (ECN) to support monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Highlights data quality considerations (quality control references, metadata completeness, and standardised analysis procedures).
  - Addresses practical barriers that monitoring programs may face (timeliness, data access, and maintaining up-to-date metadata).
