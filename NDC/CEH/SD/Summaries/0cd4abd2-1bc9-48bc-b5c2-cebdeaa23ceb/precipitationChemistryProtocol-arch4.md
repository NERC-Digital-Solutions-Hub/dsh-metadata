# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Purpose and context
- Measure the chemical composition of precipitation and bulk dry/wet deposition at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk deposition collector.
- Align methods with UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks to enable linkage to 32 rural UKPCMN sites (from 1986) and support understanding of deposition impacts on ecosystems.
- Focus on bulk deposition (wet plus dry) due to cost considerations when separating sources.

## Data collected and scope
- Volume of precipitation (measured and recorded weekly).
- Analytes and parameters of the collected water: pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl–, NO3–-N, SO4 2–, PO4 3–-P.
- Metadata for each sample: site ID, core measurement code (PC), location code, sampling date/time, and potential disturbance indicators (e.g., insects, dust, bird droppings).

## Equipment and design
- Bulk collector: conical polythene funnel (63° cone) with a collecting bottle, supported by a polished steel jacket; two funnel sizes (115 mm or 152 mm) with a standard 1 mm mesh Teflon filter.
- Upper surface height: 1.75 m above ground; features a bird deterrent.
- Field accessories: cleaning supplies, spare funnels and filters, and protective handling materials.
- Spare parts and supplier: Just Plastics Ltd (UK); recommended to have three funnel assemblies, bottles, and filters per site; specify funnel size (usually 152 mm).

## Location and contamination control
- Place collector upwind of potential contamination sources; avoid proximity to vehicle tracks, dusty conditions, or animal houses.
- Position near the TZSS and soil solution samplers if practical; avoid obstruction to other instruments.
- Secure collector to a concrete base or with guy ropes; minimize vegetation trampling and soil compaction during visits.

## Sampling protocol
- Frequency: weekly; standard collection time: Wednesday at 0900 GMT.
- Bottle change: replace with a clean bottle and filter; clean funnel with deionised/distilled water or replace if contamination is evident.
- Ice/snow handling: transfer ice/snow to the new bottle without cleaning; allow to melt in the new bottle.
- Transport and lab handling: weigh bottle and contents to determine volume; measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; filter for subsequent chemical analysis.
- Volume references: use data from nearby automatic weather station or standard raingauge for deposition flux calculations due to potential inaccuracies in bulk collector volume (especially after snowfall).

## Labeling and recording
- Unique identification: ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID (e.g., Moor House 04), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date (and time if applicable).
- Include field notes on potential factors affecting samples (insects, dust, bird droppings, fires, etc.).
- Ensure labels accompany results throughout analytical stages and are reflected in the ECN database.

## Quality assurance and data integrity
- QA procedures follow those used for the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network (error assessment across sampling, handling, and analysis).
- Protocol references: Adamsion & Sykes; Devenish (UKPCMN); Hall (precipitation collector design); Heyes et al. (acid deposition monitoring); Last & Watling (acidic deposition); Review Group on Acid Rain.
- Data governance: data transfer formats are specified for ECN dataset submission; ECNCCU provides Data Transfer documentation via restricted extranet.

## Data management and recording conventions
- Core measurement: precipitation chemistry (PC) data recorded weekly.
- Core recording fields (examples): Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time (GMT), Volume, pH, Conductivity, Alkalinity, Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, Cl–, NO3–-N, SO4 2–, PO4 3–-P, with specified units and precision.
- Data formatting and dataset specifications are available in restricted ECN dataset documentation; access via ECNCCU extranet for site managers and data recipients.
