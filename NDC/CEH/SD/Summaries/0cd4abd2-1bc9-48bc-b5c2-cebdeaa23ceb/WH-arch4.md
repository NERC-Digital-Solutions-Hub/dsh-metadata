# WH Protocol Aim INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Purpose and Rationale
- Purpose: measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water; filter samples before chemical analysis.
- Deterioration control: three methods to slow degradation — filtration, cold storage, and for Al and Fe determinations only, acidification.
- Training and safety: some steps require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance (consult chemists for analyses as needed).

## Data Lifecycle and Timeliness
- Initial storage: store at 1–4°C if more than seven hours before measurement; return to cold storage if filtering not completed the same day; ship samples promptly if sent elsewhere.
- Conductivity measurement: within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to 0.1 (µS cm⁻¹); measure conductivity first, then pH.
- pH measurement: within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; report to two decimals.
- Filtering: within 60 hours; record filtering details; analyze for specified determinands (DOC optional for precipitation water); prioritise determinands if sample volume is limited.
- Storage prior to chemical analysis: 1–4°C; ideally complete analysis within 16 days, definitely within 28 days; minimize time out of cold storage during transport.

## Data Documentation and Provenance
- Unique sample coding: use ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code to create a unique reference for ECN database submission.
- Appendix I: Filtering method and equipment details; filters used per sample; avoid cross-contamination by handling filters with forceps.
- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing procedures to prevent contamination; maintain clean, phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaners; proper drying and recapping.
- Documentation and sequencing: follow prescribed order of priority for determinands when sample volume is insufficient.

## Data Quality, Standards and Metadata
- Measurement standards: conductivity at 25°C (reported to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹) and pH (reported to 0.01 units); use HMSO methods; separate electrodes for pH measurements.
- Metadata capture: record sample handling steps, storage conditions, and filtering details to enable data provenance and reproducibility.

## Operational Resources and Compliance
- Equipment and suppliers: specified filter funnel assemblies, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, and vacuum pump; ensure all contact surfaces are clean and filters are single-use per sample.
- Sample handling: pre-filtering for certain water types may be required; ensure correct disposal and labeling of filtered vs. unfiltered portions.
- Timeliness guidance: minimize time samples spend out of cold storage; preferentially arrange next-day delivery to maintain data integrity.

## Appendices and Practical Details (Data-Leadership relevance)
- Appendix I: Filtering specifics, including equipment, filter types, setup, and contamination controls; guidelines for handling aliquots and acidification for Al/Fe when volume allows.
- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing protocols, cleaning agents (phosphorus- and hypochlorite-free), rinsing steps, and drying/capping procedures.

## Governance and Stewardship Takeaways
- Ensure traceability with comprehensive metadata and unique sample identifiers for central data systems.
- Maintain data quality through strict adherence to timing, temperature controls, and documented procedures.
- Support data integration and reuse by documenting methods, storage windows, and QC steps, enabling reliable ingestion into centralized databases.
