# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Labs are responsible for controlled analyses and must document methodology changes and validation procedures.
- Analytical methods are subject to annual review by an Analytical Working Group.
- Define detection limits as targets for chosen methods.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Laboratories manage their analytical resources but must operate under controlled conditions.
- Documentation of methodology, significant changes, and validation procedures is required.
- Results and methodologies should be stored/linked in the ECN meta database to indicate approach and precision.

## Approved and reference techniques
- Approved techniques exist for key determinands (e.g., pH, conductivity, major cations/anions, nutrients, DOC, Total N) with multiple method options.
- Techniques include pH/ conductivity measurements, AAS, ICP/OES, ion chromatography, colorimetric methods, and other reference approaches.
- Notes indicate some methods quantify related species indirectly; selection may require comparative testing.
- Laboratories should report data for the specified fraction (e.g., specific ion form); if a laboratory uses a method that quantifies a different fraction, it must monitor alternatives to confirm absence of bias.

## Priority determinands
- In low sample volumes, a priority order guides handling/analysis:
  1) pH and conductivity
  2) Cations: Ca2+, Mg2+ (then K+, Na+)
  3) Anions: NO3-, SO4^2- (then PO4^3-, Cl^-)
  4) NH4^+-N
  5) DOC
  6) Fe2+, Al3+
  7) Total N, alkalinity

## Providing details of methodology
- Laboratories keep detailed method information for operators; summary information is stored in the ECN database.
- One data record per determinand per ECN site documents method and its precision.
- Example records (e.g., nitrate by ion chromatography) include sample types, typical concentrations, calibration ranges, detection limits, and QC measures.
- Any methodological changes trigger a new dated record in the database.
- Instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training are managed by the laboratory.

## Validation, accuracy, and precision
- Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK) is needed.
- Two main quality measures: accuracy (closeness to true value and agreement with the analytical community) and precision (repeatability).
- Accuracy records document comparisons to reference schemes, with corrective actions noted if needed.
- An example accuracy record shows how results are benchmarked against a reference and reported with relative error.

## Quality control and interlaboratory comparison
- A dedicated ECN QC system supplements independent site QC; interlaboratory studies are complemented by regular QC checks.
- Synthetic QC solutions (separate cation and anion mixes) are prepared and distributed annually for batch QC.
- QC data must be submitted to the ECN Database Manager in a specified machine-readable format, including batch dates and results for all determinands.
- Data transfer for QC records uses a structured, comma-separated format with designated fields (site, dates, results for pH, conductivity, ions, nutrients, DOC, Total N, etc.) and quality codes.

## Data transfer and meta-database integration
- Methodology details, QC results, and analytical performance data are integrated into ECN’s meta-database.
- Data records link site, determinand, date, and method, enabling long-term monitoring and bias checks across sites.

## Example and notes on QC data practices
- Examples illustrate the structure of accuracy records and QC data submissions.
- Laboratories should maintain continuous records of accuracy checks, including any corrective actions, to support data quality over time.
