# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Overview
- Purpose: measure chemical composition of bulk precipitation (wet and dry deposition) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Context: supports understanding atmospheric deposition impacts on ecosystems; data linked to UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks (UKPCMN) for regional deposition distribution.

## Data Collection & Measurement Scope
- Bulk deposition collector: conical polythene funnel (two sizes), 1.75 m above ground, with a 1 mm mesh Teflon filter; jacketed bottle to keep sample dark and cool.
- Deposition components: measures bulk deposition (wet + dry); dry deposition can be inferred but bulk method preferred due to cost.
- Field data captured weekly: concentration and flux-related measurements combined with precipitation volume.

## Sampling Procedure & Logistics
- Sampling cadence: weekly, typically on Wednesdays at 0900 GMT.
- Sample handling: replace bottle with clean bottle and filter; funnel cleaned or replaced weekly; ensure funnel is horizontal and cap is secured firmly to prevent leakage.
- Site setup: collector placed upwind of contamination sources; bolted to base or secured by guy ropes; located to minimize interference with other equipment (e.g., weather station).
- Volume determination: precipitated water volume measured by weighing bottle contents (to the nearest 1 ml); use nearby raingauge or weather station for flux calculations when needed.

## Equipment & Appendix Details
- Equipment: bulk collector with two funnel sizes (typically 152 mm), aluminum stand assembly, filters, caps, and spare parts; supplier details included.
- Appendix I (routine collection): step-by-step field procedures for bottle/funnel handling, contamination checks, and secure sealing.
- Appendix II (equipment details): lists components and recommended spare sets (funnel assemblies, bottles, filters).

## Location & Contamination Controls
- Select open locations away from dust, tracks, animal houses, and obstructions; avoid vegetation trampling and soil compaction during visits.
- Document field conditions (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances) on the field recording form.

## Labeling, Metadata & Recording Conventions
- Sample identification: unique ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, Sampling Date (and time as needed).
- Recording forms capture factors affecting chemistry (insects, dust, bird droppings, disturbances) for traceability.

## Analyte List and Core Variables (Weekly)
- Key measured/recorded variables (with units and recording precision): 
  - Volume (ml) and Sampling time (GMT)
  - pH (unfiltered water)
  - Conductivity (µS cm^-1; precision 0.1)
  - Alkalinity (+) in mg L^-1 (precision 3 sig figs)
  - Na^+ (mg L^-1)
  - Ca^2+ (mg L^-1)
  - Mg^2+ (mg L^-1)
  - Fe^2+ (mg L^-1)
  - Al^3+ (mg L^-1)
  - Cl^- (mg L^-1)
  - NO3^- -N (mg L^-1)
  - SO4^2- (mg L^-1)
  - PO4^3- -P (mg L^-1)
  - NH4^-N (mg L^-1)
- Core dataset structure: first four fields are Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code (PC), Location Code, Sampling Date (and time if applicable); data formatted per ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation.

## Data Handling, QA & Format
- Data handling follows ECN Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol for sample processing and filtering.
- QA: established QA procedures cover sampling, sample handling, and analysis errors; documentation references include UK acid deposition monitoring network standards.
- Data transfer: final data are prepared for ECN dataset formats; additional specification available via restricted Site Managers’ extranet (Data Transfer documentation); contact ECNCCU for access.

## Data Use & Outputs
- Outputs include weekly records of volume, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, and ion concentrations, enabling assessment of spatial distribution of precipitation chemistry across ECN sites and linkage with UKPCMN sites.
- Data underpin interpretation of deposition patterns, temporal trends, and potential ecological impacts of atmospheric pollutants.

## References & Documentation
- Core protocol references and authors listed (PC Protocol; Hall 1986; Devenish 1986; Heyes et al. 1985; Last & Watling 1991; Review Group on Acid Rain 1990).
- Field recording forms and data recording conventions provided on standard ECN documentation channels.
