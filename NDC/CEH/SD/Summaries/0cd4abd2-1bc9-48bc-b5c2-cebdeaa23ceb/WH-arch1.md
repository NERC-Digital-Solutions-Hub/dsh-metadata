# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Deterioration slowed by: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background quality control and documentation are provided in related documents.

## Initial storage Method
- Store samples at 1°C–4°C if the interval to measurement is more than seven hours.
- Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed on the same day as measurements.
- If samples are sent to another site, send on the collection day by fastest method.
- In transit, keep in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the method specified by HMSO (1978).
- Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample.
- The same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH, but conductivity must be measured first and the subsample not returned to the main sample.
- Use HMSO (1988) method, implying separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection.
- Use the method in Appendix I.
- Record filtering details using unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).
- DOC is not mandatory for precipitation water.
- If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, follow the priority order described in the AG Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1°C–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location, minimize the time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery).

## Author References
- J.K. Adamson, HMSO (1978, 1988) on conductivity and pH measurement.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (Whatman WCN 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Procedures: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first use and between samples; avoid touching contact surfaces; use forceps; single-use filters.
- Pre-filtering: Waters from soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering; rinse pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Transfer: filtered water to a clean dry polypropylene bottle (approx. 250 ml; verify with the performing laboratory).
- If >100 ml sample: transfer a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: each container must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; include this reference in the ECN database.
- Suppliers: listed (BDH, Millipore) with contact details.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Cleaning agent: phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Cleaning options: Decon machine (e.g., Decomatic) or overnight soaking in Decon-90.
- Rinsing: four times with tap water and three times with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and re-cap immediately.
- Post-washing handling: shake to remove droplets, dry in a warm air, dust-free environment, and recap; Decon products obtainable from multiple suppliers.
