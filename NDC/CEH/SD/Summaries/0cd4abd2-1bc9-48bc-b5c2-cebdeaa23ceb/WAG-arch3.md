WAG Protocol

- Aim and scope
  - Provide analytical guidelines for water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Laboratories are responsible for managing analytical resources; must document methodology, changes, and validation procedures.
  - Annual review by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.
  - Establish appropriate methods and target detection limits; ensure comparability across sites.

- Approved techniques and reference methods
  - Tables outline multiple approved techniques for each determinand (with notes on when alternatives may be suitable).
  - Primary reference techniques exist to compare and assess new methods; laboratories must report fractions and units consistently.
  - For pH and conductivity, special handling guidance exists; for some determinands, methods quantify different species but are tested for bias against reference methods.

- Providing details of methodology and data governance
  - Laboratories keep detailed methods locally; ECN database stores summary information per determinand per site to indicate methodology, precision, and changes.
  - Each method change gets a dated record (metadata trail) to indicate suitability for the data.
  - Guidance includes how to report species, units, detection limits, calibration, accuracy, and interferences.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK) is required.
  - Accuracy reflects agreement with broader analytical community; results and any corrections must be recorded.
  - An example accuracy record shows comparing results against control schemes and noting relative error; corrective actions are documented.

- Quality control (QC) procedures
  - A separate QC system for ECN participants supports batch bias assessment and long-term trend detection.
  - Synthetic QC solutions (cation and anion) distributed to sites; used to assess batch performance.
  - Annual preparation of new QC concentrates; continuity checks with previous concentrates.
  - QC data are submitted to the ECN Database Manager in a standardized format; includes preparation dates, measurement dates, results for all determinands, and quality codes.
  - If pH/conductivity are measured locally, two QC preparation dates may be required; otherwise, the QC is prepared with a single solution.

- Data transfer, formatting, and governance
  - QC data are transferred in the same data system as samples, with fields for preparation dates, analysis dates, measured values, and quality codes.
  - Data records are free-format comma-separated with a defined sequence of fields; includes an explicit quality code (Q) and optional quality codes.

- Priority listing of determinands (limited sample volumes)
  - To guide decisions when sample volume is constrained:
    - 1: pH and conductivity
    - 2: Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, Cl-)
    - 3: Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+)
    - 4: NH4+-N
    - 5: DOC
    - 6: Fe2+, Al3+ (cations requiring separate acidified portions)
    - 7: Total N and alkalinity

- Sample handling, reporting, and interoperability
  - When reporting, data should reflect the specified fractions; if alternate techniques are used, labs must monitor for bias against reference methods.
  - The Initial Water Handling Protocol provides additional guidance for sample handling, filtration, pH adjustment, and acidification.

- Example and records
  - Includes an illustrative example of an accuracy record (SO4 2- measured by ion chromatography) and a Moor House QC example record, demonstrating the format and interpretation of results and corrective actions.

- Summary of organizational workflow
  - Laboratories: manage methods, conduct analyses under controlled conditions, document methodology and validation.
  - Analytical Working Group: reviews and updates protocols annually.
  - ECN Database Manager: collects and stores methodological and QC data; ensures traceability and data quality.
  - QC and interlaboratory checks: ongoing to ensure accuracy and detect anomalies or drifts over time.
