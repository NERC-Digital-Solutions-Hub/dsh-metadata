# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Aim
  - Measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water samples.
  - Filter samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale
  - Water samples deteriorate after collection due to chemical and microbiological processes.
  - Slowing deterioration via filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
  - Some steps require lab training, specialized equipment, and health/safety compliance.
  - Background quality control and related procedures are documented elsewhere.

- Key data collection and handling steps
  - Initial storage
    - Store at 1–4°C if >7 hours before measurements.
    - If filtering isn’t completed same day, return to cold storage.
    - If sent to another site, ship the same day; use cool box with pre-frozen blocks during transit.
  - Conductivity measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
    - Express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
    - Conductivity measured first; do not return subsample to main sample.
  - pH measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample.
    - Use a separate electrode setup; express results to 0.01 pH unit.
  - Filtering
    - Conduct within 60 hours; follow Appendix I methods.
    - Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
    - After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation).
    - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, use priority order defined in Appendix I.
  - Storage prior to chemical analysis
    - Maintain 1–4°C storage.
    - Ideally analyze within 16 days; must be done within 28 days.
    - If samples are sent elsewhere, minimize time out of cold storage.

- Data quality and metadata
  - Unique sample coding and traceability
    - Use ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06), ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (01), Sampling Date, and any sampler/instrument codes.
    - The unique reference must appear with final data submitted to the ECN database.
  - Documentation and control
    - Record all filtering details and any deviations.
    - Follow the specified order of priority for determinand measurements if volumes are limited.
  - Compliance and safety
    - Some steps (e.g., acidification for Al/Fe) require laboratory training and safety procedures.
    - Guidance and background QC are provided in related documents (AG Protocol, HMSO methods).

- Sample handling and safety considerations
  - Do not touch filter surfaces or filters with hands; use forceps.
  - When filtering: rinse all parts with deionized/distilled water before first use and between samples.
  - If volume >100 ml, prepare a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Label containers clearly and maintain clean, sterile handling practices throughout.
  - Minimize time out of cold storage, especially during transport.

- Appendix highlights
  - Appendix I. Filtering
    - Required equipment: filter funnel assembly, 0.45 µm membranes, vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar).
    - Pre-rinse filters and assembly; avoid hand contact with filter surfaces.
    - Pre-filter may be used for soils/rivers; wash pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
    - Subsample handling for Al/Fe if volumes permit.
  - Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
    - Use phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agents.
    - Prefer machine washing; if not available, use Decon products with thorough rinsing.
    - After washing, air-dry in a dust-free area and recap immediately.
  - Sample labeling and supplier references
    - Containers labeled with ECN site, measurement code, location, date, and sampler code.
    - Suppliers listed for filters and wash supplies (e.g., BDH, Millipore).
