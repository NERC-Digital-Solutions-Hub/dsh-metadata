# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slows degradation via filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
- Activities may require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance; guidance from chemists may be needed.
- Background and quality control guidance are provided in related documents.

## GIS-relevant metadata considerations
- Documentation and standardised sample coding are essential for joinable GIS attributes and provenance tracking.
- Ensure unique sample codes and location identifiers are recorded for integration with spatial datasets and ECN databases.

## Initial storage
- If the interval between collection and measurement of conductivity/pH > 7 hours, store in cold storage at 1–4°C.
- If filtering cannot be completed the same day, return samples to cold storage.
- If samples are sent to another site, send on the collection day by fastest method; transit in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹) using HMSO (1978) method.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample.
- Use separate glass and reference electrodes; conductivity measured first and do not return subsample to the main sample after measurement.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit) using HMSO (1988) method.

## Filtering
- Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection (Appendix I method).
- Record filtering details using the unique sample codes described in the Protocols.
- After filtration, analyse for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC optional for precipitation).
- If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, reference priority order (as per Appendix I).
- For data management, ensure a unique reference is included with final data submitted to the ECN database.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples must be sent to another location, minimize the time out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday despatch).

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters (Whatman WCN 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: rinse all filtering components with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; single-use per sample.
- Pre-filtering: Waters originating from soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering through a glass fibre filter (pre-rinse with 250 ml dist. water before use).
- Collection: pour filtered water into a clean dry bottle; do not return to unfiltered bottle.
- Volume handling: for samples >100 ml, transfer a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe, acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: containers must bear ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06), ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (01), Sampling Date, and any sampler code to uniquely identify the sample (appears in final ECN data).

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Cleaning agents must be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Cleaning options: Deconatic/Decon-90 in absence of a machine; or a laboratory cleaning agent.
- Washing workflow: rinse four times in tap water, three times in deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times in distilled water, reuse with the same sampler; dry in warm air in a dust-free environment; re-cap immediately.
