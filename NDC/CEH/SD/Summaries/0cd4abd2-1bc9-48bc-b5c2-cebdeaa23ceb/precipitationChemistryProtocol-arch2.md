# PRECIPITATION CHEMISTRY Version 1.1 (supplier contact details updated July 2005)

## Aim and Rationale
- Purpose: measure the chemical composition of precipitation and dry deposition (bulk precipitation) at ECN sites using a continuously open bulk collector.
- Context: acid rain history and its ecosystem impacts; atmospheric deposition of pollutants affects physical, chemical, and biotic components; future emission changes may alter deposition patterns.
- Approach: bulk deposition measurement (wet + dry inputs) chosen due to high cost and complexity of separating sources; results linked to the UK Precipitation Composition Monitoring Networks (UKPCMN) for regional comparability.

## Equipment and Method
- Bulk collector design: conical polythene funnel on a collecting bottle; two funnel sizes (63° cone; 115 mm or 152 mm diameter); funnel upper surface ~1.75 m above ground; 1 mm mesh Teflon filter; polished steel jacket; 25 mm gap; bird deterrent.
- Location: place upwind of contamination sources; open location away from obstructions; near soil solution samplers and weather station when feasible; collector bolted or guyed to secure base.
- Sampling frequency and process: typically weekly bottle changes (ECN standard: Wednesdays at 0900 GMT); replace bottle with clean bottle and filter; clean or replace funnel; handle ice/snow by transferring to new bottle without cleaning; lab measures volume by weighing; conduct conductivity and pH on unfiltered water; after filtering, analyze dissolved ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl, NO3-N, SO4-S, PO4-P, alkalinity); use nearby rainfall data for volume flux calculations.

## Location and Contamination Considerations
- Minimize local contamination by careful site selection; avoid dusty tracks and animal houses; regular site visits may affect vegetation.

## Labelling and Data Traceability
- Unique sample identification: ECN Measurement Code (PC), ECN Site ID, Location Code, Sampling Date.
- Labeling must accompany results through all analysis stages and into the ECN database.
- Recording forms capture factors affecting sample chemistry (e.g., insects, dust, bird droppings, fires, dust sources).

## Washing and Sample Handling
- Lab washing of funnel, filter, and bottle with a specified laboratory cleaning agent per the ECN Initial Water Handling Protocol.

## Quality Assurance (QA)
- QA procedures align with the Acid Deposition Monitoring Network, including assessment of sampling, handling, and analysis errors.

## Procedure (Appendix I: Routine sample collection)
- Required items: clean sample bottle with code and dry weight, wash bottle with de-ionised water, forceps, two clean funnel filters, two clean funnels, cap, large polythene bag, field recording form, pencil.
- Field steps: note contamination or disturbances; detach funnel assembly; replace cap firmly; insert funnel into bottle; remove filter; wash or replace funnel as needed; ensure top of funnel is horizontal; verify cap is tightly sealed to prevent leakage during transport.

## Equipment Details (Appendix II)
- Complete assembly includes: aluminium stand, bottle holder, reflector, funnel retainer, catchment funnel, filter, catchment bottle.
- Spares: funnel assembly, catchment bottle, filter.
- Recommended: three funnel assemblies, bottles, and filters per site.
- Supplier: Just Plastics Ltd (The Maltings, Weyford Bridge, Stalham, Norfolk, UK).

## Specification of Results and Recording Conventions
- Core measurement: precipitation chemistry (PC Protocol).
- Weekly recorded variables (core dataset fields): site identification, core measurement code, location code, setting out date/time (GMT, 24-h clock, time precision 1 min); sampling time; volume; pH (unfiltered water, conductivity in µS cm^-1, alkalinity, major cations/anions: Na+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4-S, PO4-P); all values with specified units and precision.
- Volume should be derived from the rainfall measurement closest to the site (automatic weather station or standard raingauge) due to potential underestimation by the bulk collector.

## Recording Forms
- A standard field recording form is available from the CCU for consistent data capture.

## Note
- Include the date/time the bottle was last emptied and set out in records.
