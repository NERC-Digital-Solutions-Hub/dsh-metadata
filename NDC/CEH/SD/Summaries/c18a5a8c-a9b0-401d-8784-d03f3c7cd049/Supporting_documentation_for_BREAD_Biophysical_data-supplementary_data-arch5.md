# Experimental design/Sampling regime

- Purpose and scope
  - Detailed soil and fertility data collection across households to study soil properties and moisture dynamics.
  - Data collected includes pore water conductivity, volumetric water content, and soil temperature across multiple months.

- Sampling design
  - Household-level sampling with three fertility zones per household:
    - Home: near the house with higher management inputs
    - Near: field between home and far field
    - Far: owner’s field furthest from the house
  - Replication and scale
    - Two main design scales:
      - Smaller scale: 36 households, 108 measurement sites, 324 samples
      - Larger scale: 72 households, 216 measurement sites, 648 samples
    - Within each fertility zone, 3 replicates per household
    - Kebeles (districts) involved: Konicha and 1st Choroko (and expanded for larger design)
  - Depths and zones
    - Soil measurements taken at three depth intervals per area: 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, 10–15 cm
    - Measurements conducted in all three fertility zones for each household

- Collection methods
  - Random positioning
    - Sample positions determined randomly within each fertility zone
    - Three replicates per zone per area
  - Measurement regiment
    - Measurements taken at 0–5 cm, 5–10 cm, and 10–15 cm depths
    - Instruments: W.E.T sensor for soil water content, electrical conductivity, and temperature
  - Field logistics
    - Data collected by two experienced soil scientists
    - Immediate data upload via tablet and ODK to minimize data loss
  - Documentation
    - Soil samples labeled and stored; minor loss due to label issues (<5%)

- Calibration and data processing
  - W.E.T sensor calibration for soil water content
    - Two-point calibration using damp and dry soil
    - Determine b0 and b1 parameters, then configure W.E.T custom soil type (Custom 1) with these values
    - Use Custom 1 soil type for field measurements
  - Calibration for pore water conductivity
    - Calibrate EC using a procedure involving soil slurry and double-volume water
    - Extract parameters to compute EC_p using specific equations and set them in the sensor
  - In-field operation
    - Calibrations saved in sensor settings (b0, b1, and EC parameters)
    - Ensure field measurements consistently use Custom 1 soil type

- Quality control
  - Sampling strategy accounts for spatial variability with random replicates
  - Routine checks of the WET sensor in saline solutions
  - Data capture workflow
    - Field data collected on tablet with predefined variables
    - Regular calibration checks of sensors and equipment
  - Lab analysis
    - Standard procedures and SOPs from the University of Aberdeen
    - Regular calibration and validation of nutrients and pH measurements
  - Data quality notes
    - Data checked for normal distribution and consistency
    - Minor losses due to labeling (<5%)

- Data files and schema
  - IPORE-Soil EC.csv
    - Columns include: S. no., HH no., Kebele, HH ID, Fertility Zone, Top depth, Bottom depth, Replicates, and monthly pore water conductivity (January–July)
  - IPORE-Soil water.csv
    - Columns include: S. no., HH no., Kebele, HH ID, Fertility Zone, Top depth, Bottom depth, Replicates, and monthly volumetric water content (January–July)
  - IPORE-Soil temperature.csv
    - Columns include: S. no., HH no., Kebele, HH ID, Fertility Zone, Top depth, Bottom depth, Replicates, and monthly soil temperature (January–July)
  - Common schema details
    - Each record includes: fertility zone (Home/near/far), depth range, replicate number
    - Monthly measurements for Jan–Jul across all three data types

- Governance and dataset context for data stewards
  - The dataset integrates sensor-derived measurements (EC, water content, temperature) with field metadata and spatial replication
  - Important metadata to capture and preserve
    - Sensor calibration constants (b0, b1) and selected soil type (Custom 1)
    - Pore water conductivity calibration parameters
    - Field protocol details (randomization, depth intervals, replication)
    - Data provenance (field collection dates, personnel, locations, kebeles)
  - Data quality considerations
    - Consistent labeling and sample tracking to minimize data loss
    - Documentation of measurement uncertainties (sensor accuracy specifications)
    - Clear versioning and linked data dictionaries for dataset fields
  - Sharing and updates
    - Data catalog entries should reflect hierarchical design (household, fertility zone, depth, replicate)
    - Update mechanisms needed for ongoing data collection and potential recalibrations
  - Usability and interoperability
    - Standardized column names and units across files
    - Alignment with metadata standards to facilitate discovery and reuse by data users and systems with large datasets
