## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Location: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain (approx. OS Grid SD393960)
- Temporal coverage: 1946–2012 data presented (continuous daily measurements collected since 1933)

## Provenance and Custodianship
- Data collection history:
  - Initially by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA)
  - Then by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003)
  - Subsequently again by FBA
- Rights: Database Right/Copyright © NERC - CEH/FBA
- Related provenance references include earlier publications documenting measurements

## Data Collection Methods
- Instrumentation: handheld mercury thermometer
- Measurement timing: around 09:00 h, near daily intervals
- Location within lake: inshore surface near the middle of the lake’s long axis; north basin measurements archived
- Historical publications documenting early methods: Kipling & Roscoe (1977, 1981)
