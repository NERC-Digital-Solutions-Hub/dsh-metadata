# Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012

- Description
  - Dataset of monthly mean inshore surface water temperature (°C) for Windermere, a lake in northern England.
  - Data presented for 1946–2012 (data collection began in 1933); originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), then by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003), and subsequently again by the FBA.
  - Used as part of data sources in Ohlberger et al. (2014) on phenology and trophic mismatch.

- Data Content
  - File: WindermereMonthlyTemp1946_2012.csv
  - Size: 13 kb; Format: CSV
  - Columns: YEAR, MONTH, TEMP (monthly mean lake surface temperature in °C)
  - Sampling site: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain. Approximate centre grid reference: SD393960 (OS Grid), 339385,496080 (OSGB36 Easting/Northing)

- Experimental Design and Sampling
  - Inshore surface water temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis from 1933 to present.
  - Collection method: handheld mercury thermometer with ~0.1 °C accuracy, around 09:00 h, near-daily intervals.
  - Previous period data (1943–1980) were published by Kipling & Roscoe (1977, 1981) for the north basin; data for later periods have not been previously published.

- Analytical Methods
  - Daily temperature records converted to monthly mean temperatures for the dataset.

- Quality Control
  - Temperature measurements are checked by permutations involving three individuals.
