# Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012

## Overview
- Dataset of monthly mean inshore surface water temperature (°C) for Windermere, a lake in northern England.
- Time span presented: 1946–2012 (data collection began in 1933).
- Used in Ohlberger et al. (2014) on phenology and trophic responses.

## Data content
- File: WindermereMonthlyTemp1946_2012.csv
- Size: ~13 KB
- Format: CSV
- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year of the monthly temperature
  - MONTH: Month of the average temperature
  - TEMP: Monthly mean lake surface temperature (°C)

## Location and sampling site
- Location: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate center: OS Grid SD393960; OSGB36 Easting 339385, Northing 496080

## Sampling design and data collection
- Inshore surface temperature monitored near the middle of the lake from 1933 to present.
- Measurement accuracy: ±0.1 °C using a handheld mercury thermometer.
- Time of measurement: around 09:00 h; near-daily interval.
- Earlier daily data from Windermere’s north basin published for 1943–1980; subsequent period not previously published.

## Data processing and analytical methods
- Daily records used to calculate monthly mean temperatures.

## Quality control
- Measurements are checked by permutations of three individuals (triangulated verification).

## Provenance and related datasets
- Data collection history:
  - Originally by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA)
  - then by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003)
  - subsequently by the FBA again
