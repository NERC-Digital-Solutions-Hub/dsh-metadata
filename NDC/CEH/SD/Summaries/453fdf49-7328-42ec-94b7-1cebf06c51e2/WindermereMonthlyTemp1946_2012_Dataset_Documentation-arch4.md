# Dataset Documentation Winfield, I. J. & Fletcher, J. M. (2014).  Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012.

## Overview
- Monthly mean inshore surface water temperature (°C) data from Windermere, a lake in northern England.
- Data collection began in 1933; presented here for 1946 onwards.
- Compiled by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), later by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003), then again by the FBA.
- Used as part of broader research, including Ohlberger et al. (2014).

## Dataset details
- File: WindermereMonthlyTemp1946_2012.csv
- Size: 13 kb
- Format: CSV (comma separated values)
- Columns:
  - YEAR: Year to which the annual temperature pertains
  - MONTH: Month to which the average temperature pertains
  - TEMP: Monthly mean lake surface temperature (°C)

## Sampling site
- Location: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate grid reference: SD393960 (OS Grid Reference) 339385,496080 (OSGB36 Easting/Northing)

## Experimental design / Sampling regime
- Inshore surface water temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis from 1933 to present.

## Collection methods & field/lab instrumentation
- Temperature recorded to ±0.1 °C using a handheld mercury thermometer at ~09:00 h at near-daily intervals.
- Daily measurements from Windermere’s north basin previously published for 1943–1980 (Kipling & Roscoe 1977; 1981). Data for later periods were not previously published.

## Analytical methods
- Daily records are used to calculate the monthly mean temperatures presented in the dataset.

## Quality control
- Measurements are taken and checked by permutations of three individuals.
