# Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012

## Overview
- Inshore surface water temperature dataset for Windermere, Cumbria, England, providing monthly mean values (°C) from 1946–2012 (data collection started in 1933).
- Collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), then by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) / predecessor IFE (1989–2003), and subsequently again by FBA.
- Used as part of broader ecological analyses, including Ohlberger et al. (2014).

## Data content
- File: WindermereMonthlyTemp1946_2012.csv
- Size: 13 kb; Format: CSV
- Columns: YEAR, MONTH, TEMP (monthly mean lake surface temperature in °C)
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria; approximate grid reference provided
- Experimental design: inshore surface temperature monitored near the lake’s middle along the long axis from 1933 to present

## Collection methods
- Temperature recorded to ±0.1°C using handheld mercury thermometers
