# Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012.

## Overview
- Dataset of monthly mean inshore surface water temperature (°C) for Windermere, a lake in northern England.
- Data presented from 1946 to 2012; collection began in 1933.
- Managed by Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) / predecessor IFE over time; later by FBA.
- Used in Ohlberger et al. 2014 (Proceedings of the Royal Society B) related to phenology and trophic mismatch.

## Data Content

## Sampling Location
- Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate grid reference: SD393960 (OS Grid); Easting/Northing 339385,496080 (OSGB36)

## Sampling Design & Methods
- Inshore surface temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis from 1933 to present.
- Measurements recorded around 09:00 h at near-daily intervals.
- Earlier daily datasets for 1943–1980 published by Kipling & Roscoe (1977, 1981); subsequent periods not previously published.

## Collection & Processing Methods
- Temperature recorded with handheld mercury thermometer, accuracy 0.1°C.
- Daily records converted to monthly means for the dataset.

## Quality Control
- Measurements checked by permutations of three individuals to ensure reliability.

## Provenance & Related Data
- Data lineage: FBA (initial), then CEH and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003), then FBA again.
