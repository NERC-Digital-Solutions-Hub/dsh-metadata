# Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012

- Overview
  - A dataset of monthly mean inshore surface water temperature (°C) for Windermere, a lake in northern England.
  - Data collection began in 1933; presented here for 1946–2012.
  - Originating organizations: Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and its predecessor IFE, with later involvement by FBA.
  - Used in Ohlberger et al. (2014) as part of a study on phenology and trophic interactions.
  - Related datasets available: perch weekly catches and perch weekly mean sizes for Green Tuft (1946–2012).

- Data file and columns
  - File: WindermereMonthlyTemp1946_2012.csv
  - Size: 13 kb
  - Format: CSV
  - Columns:
    - YEAR: Year to which the temperature pertains
    - MONTH: Month to which the average temperature pertains
    - TEMP: Monthly mean lake surface temperature (°C)

- Sampling site and location
  - Location: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
  - Approximate center grid reference: OS Grid SD393960

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Inshore surface water temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis (1933–present); this dataset covers 1946–2012.
  - Daily near-daily measurements collected around 09:00 h at the Windermere north basin.
  - Early daily records (1943–1980) were published by Kipling & Roscoe (1977, 1981); data for later periods had not been published prior to this compilation.

- Collection methods and instrumentation
  - Temperature recorded with a handheld mercury thermometer.
  - Accuracy: ±0.1 °C.

- Analytical methods
  - Daily records were aggregated to compute monthly mean temperatures presented in the CSV.

- Quality control
  - Measurements are taken and checked by permutations of three individuals to ensure reliability.
