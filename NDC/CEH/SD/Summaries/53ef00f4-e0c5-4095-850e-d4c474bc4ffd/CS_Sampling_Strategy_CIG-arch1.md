# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the field survey sampling framework used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Tracks the evolution of the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification and how it underpins stratified ecological sampling across Britain.
- Emphasizes maintaining comparability across time while meeting country-specific reporting needs (England, Scotland, Wales).

## Core concept: stratified sampling with the ITE Land Classification
- Sample design relies on stratifying land by environmental attributes (the ITE Land Classification) to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s countryside.
- Stratification aims to avoid bias and capture ecological variability across land types and regions.
- Land Classification originated from quadrat-based vegetation work, scaled to 1 km squares for national surveys.

## Chronological development and key milestones

- 1978 (CS1978) – Initial GB survey
  - Land Classification: 32 classes derived from environmental attributes for 1 km squares; centre squares of a 15x15 km grid classified (1228 squares), plus the four surrounding squares (total 6039 km squares considered).
  - Sampling: 8 squares per class, total 256 squares surveyed.
  - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class × area of that Land Class.
  - Basis: Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define classes.

- 1984 (CS1984) – Second field survey
  - Sampling: 12 km squares surveyed per Land Class (total 384 squares); eight squares per class previously visited retained.
  - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 (CS1990) – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Land Classification expanded to classify every GB square (full GB coverage).
  - Result: 508 squares surveyed; repeat sampling of 1978 quadrats; inclusion of urban/sea corrections; introduction of the first Land Cover Map linkage.
  - Classification: Land Classification expanded (answering policy/technical needs) to allow Scotland reporting; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report (1993).

- 1998–2000 – Revisions to support regional and country outputs
  - Land Classification revised to improve regional and local estimations; width to extend classification to all GB squares using surrogates for climatic, geological, and physiographic factors.
  - Consequence: only 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classifications; misclassifications mapped to neighboring classes; distortion in class distribution for national estimates.
  - Separate country estimates introduced (England & Wales vs Scotland) to improve country-specific reporting.

- 2000 (CS2000) – Separate country estimates and upland focus
  - Framework refined to enable country-unit reporting (England with Wales and Scotland) using country-specific sub-divisions of Land Classes (40 strata; later adjusted to 40–45).
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; 19 extra squares for Wales; 11 more to balance England vs Wales.
  - Upland module introduced: 30 extra squares placed in upland/marginal upland Land Classes to improve upland habitat estimates for England and Wales.

- 2007 (CS2007) – Wales-focused reporting and further refinements
  - Welsh-only reporting requirements led to explicit Welsh country-unit subdivisions: five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Strata expanded to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation of new Welsh classes (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: to balance Wales additions, two English classes (5e, 15e) retain only 4 squares each; Wales-specific reporting considerations take precedence.
  - Wales upland representation retained; upland module maintained with 30 upland squares.

## Sampling design details and outputs

- Country-specific estimates
  - By CS2000, framework supports England & Wales and Scotland as separate country units, with class sub-divisions and selective aggregation to ensure adequate representation within each country.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country estimates and replaced by additional England squares in later phases.

- Class structure and strata
  - CS1990 introduced 40 Land Classes (up from 32), enabling more nuanced country-specific reporting.
  - CS2000/CS2007 further subdivided classes to create country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales) and expanded strata (e.g., 45 classes/strata).

- Sample allocation and numbers (highlights)
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (40 classes; all GB squares classified).
  - CS2000: GB total sample around 569 squares; country-unit adjustments increasing Wales representation; upland module adds 30 squares.
  - CS2007: GB total around 591 squares; 45 strata with additional Welsh subdivisions; upland module retained (30 squares).

- Data interpretation and comparability
  - National estimates can be sensitive to the Land Classification used; 2006 scoping study noted that changing the basic classification for national estimates affects consistency, so decisions were made to use classification most appropriate for a given survey while noting cross-survey comparability concerns.

## Practical implications for analysis and policy
- The sampling strategy balances the need for consistent, time-series data with the demand for country-specific environmental policy reporting.
- The evolution of the Land Classification affects comparability across survey years; analysts must account for classification changes when examining change over time.
- The creation of country-unit estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) and Welsh-specific classes enhances policy relevance for devolved administrations.
- The upland modules improve precision for habitats in upland regions, addressing regional data gaps.
