# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish current land use, land cover, and vegetation data to monitor countryside changes and support ecological modelling.
  - Build current datasets for scientific evaluation of rural ecosystems and link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) through the ITE Land Classification System.
  - Implement a two-tier approach with ground-truth data to improve pattern detection and projection of results; continue and compare with earlier surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988).

- Survey design and planning
  - 512 squares sampled across six ITE Research Stations, with six teams (~85 squares each); each square expected to require about three survey days.
  - Flexible scheduling and travel planning to minimize time and cost; no overtime initially, with time off in lieu for excess travel.
  - Randomised sampling across groups; replacement squares used if permission is refused or access is blocked; prior contact with landowners encouraged.
  - Permanent field markers and standardized procedures to ensure repeatability in future resurveys.

- Equipment and field setup
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs), aerial photos, large-scale maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, marking tools, measurement gear, navigation aids, and personal gear.
  - Equipment shared between Merlewood (central) and local ITE Stations; some items provided by surveyors.

- Field procedures and data workflow
  - All squares surveyed using a defined general procedure: initial site overview, obtain full access permission, plan a route for full square coverage, and review data after recording to ensure completeness.
  - Data collection focuses on mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling, with an emphasis on documenting data sources and maintaining consistent approaches across observers.

- Permissions and access
  - Written permission from farmers/landowners considered essential for legal and background information; refusal triggers predefined contingencies.
  - Coordination of access through Station Coordinators; maintain an ownership/tenant log with contact details and cooperation ratings.
  - If access is denied for all or part of a square, fieldwork is abandoned or adjusted, and a replacement square may be drawn.

- Data recording and mapping (FAB framework)
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; data are logged on 1:10,000 maps with a standardized code system (primary and secondary codes) to annotate features.
  - Codes link logically (e.g., boundaries, vegetation, land use) and ensure consistent interpretation across analysts; recorded information is designed to be discoverable with metadata.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supports boundary identification, feature recognition, and updating of boundaries and features; API guidance is ground-truth prioritized and subject to field validation.

- Vegetation data collection (6.2.2–6.2.3)
  - Standardized recording of vegetation using nested quadrats:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots mapped on 1:10,000 maps with nested 4 m2 and smaller plots for detailed recording.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural or semi-natural vegetation types.
  - Species inventory from plots, with a restricted list of ~200 common taxa; unlisted species recorded in a catch-all section.
  - Cover estimates in 5% increments; height classes for bracken and heather; use of color coding if needed to reduce clutter.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded; some specimens collected for later identification; careful documentation to ensure repeatability.

- Plot types and layout
  - Large quadrats (200 m2) and nested quadrats (4 m2) for detailed vegetation structure.
  - Linear plots (up to 5 per square) along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide) to sample boundary vegetation and habitat gradients.
  - Boundary, stream, hedge, roadside, and other linear plots laid out at standard distances from identifiable features; permanent marker plates installed for relocation in future surveys.
  - Location/relocation rules cover 1978-era squares and new squares; ensure plots are placed to reflect current habitat types while remaining representative of the square.

- Species identification and data quality
  - Species identification guidelines emphasize consistency with previous surveys; combinations allowed where true species-level ID is uncertain.
  - A core list of frequent taxa used; bryophytes and lichens documented with a canonical set of species; emphasis on avoiding misidentification through documented combinations and field notes.
  - Permanently mark plots to enable accurate relocation; ensure field notes, sketches, and photographs accompany data entries.

- Freshwater biota sampling
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square:
    - Flowing waters: freshwater biota collected as per a separate Institute of Freshwater Ecology handbook.
    - Standing waters: NELUP sampling for water beetles and related fauna, including multiple standing-water habitats (lakes, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.).
  - Clear marking of sampling sites on the map; samples preserved and transported to Merlewood with proper labeling and chain-of-custody.

- Photography
  - Print photography of every vegetation plot to document general appearance and landmark context.
  - Plot number and edge marker plate clearly visible in photos for reference.

- Procedures after survey
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no features were omitted; avoid transposing data unless maps are damaged.
  - FABs, samples, and equipment transported to ITE stations promptly for processing and analysis.

- Data management and challenges (context for analysts)
  - Emphasizes standardized data collection, interoperability with remote-sensing data, and long-term data preservation with metadata.
  - Acknowledges challenges for analysts: data at local scales, access to disparate datasets, unstandardised storage, and need for consistent interpretation across observers.
  - The program is designed to produce robust, comparable datasets over time, enabling correlation analysis, trend assessment, and predictive modelling for land use and ecological change.
