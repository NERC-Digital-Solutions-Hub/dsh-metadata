# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

## Overview and purpose
- Documents the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Emphasises the long-term, time-series linkage between surveys and the need to understand how changes in classification affect interpretation of trends.
- Aims to ensure representative, stratified sampling across Great Britain to estimate habitat areas and land-use features.

## The ITE Land Classification and the value of stratified sampling
- Stratified, random sampling reduces bias and improves representativeness across ecological variation.
- Land Classification groups GB into classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than purely geographic units.
- Early work used a 1 km square sampling unit with central squares classified, plus surrounding squares, enabling scalable, comparable estimates.

## Evolution by survey rounds (conceptual timeline)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total).
  - National habitat estimates derived from class-area proportions and mean habitat area per square.
- 1984 (Second survey)
  - Sample size increased to 12 squares per class (384 total) to refine estimates.
  - Results published for Landscape Changes in Britain.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third survey)
  - Revised to classify data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map; broader data integration.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; fourth survey)
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; allowed separate Scottish reporting.
  - Field survey increased to 569 squares; emphasis on enabling regional estimates.
- 2000 (CS2000; fifth survey)
  - Introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) to support policy needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-specific versions, creating 40 strata; additional squares added to ensure representation, plus upland habitat sampling module.
- 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific subdivisions (now 45 strata total).
  - Increased Welsh sampling (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes retained fewer squares due to precision considerations.
  - Adjusted class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; Welsh upland sampling expanded to improve country-specific estimates.
  
## Country-specific estimates and Wales adjustments
- England, Scotland, and Wales are treated as separate reporting units with sub-divided land classes to reflect country-specific needs.
- Wales receives targeted sampling enhancements (Welsh-specific classes 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and extra squares to improve Wales-only estimates.
- The Isle of Man is excluded from country-unit estimates; its sites are replaced to maintain country-focused representation.

## Upland and dedicated modules
- CS2000 introduced a dedicated upland/marginal uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
- This module enhances statistical accuracy for highland habitats within country-based reporting.

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Classification versioning is critical: national estimates can change depending on whether the latest or original Land Classification is used.
- To ensure reproducibility and comparability across surveys, it is essential to:
  - Document the Land Classification version used for each dataset and estimate.
  - Map old class definitions to new subdivisions when necessary (and record any reclassification decisions).
  - Preserve historical classification maps and documentation (Figures and Tables referenced in reports) for audit and reanalysis.
  - Maintain clear metadata on sampling frames, strata definitions, and the number of squares per class per year.
- Data needs evolve with policy requirements (e.g., Wales-only reporting); governance should support flexible, auditable extraction of country-specific estimates.

## Data quality, transparency, and interoperability
- The approach relies on transparent stratification and consistent sampling rates within each class, but changes in classification and class definitions over time can affect comparability.
- Documentation should accompany data releases to explain:
  - The exact classification version and any sub-class definitions used.
  - How estimates were calculated (mean habitat per square × total class area, etc.).
  - Any reallocation or aggregation of classes to maintain country-specific representation.
- When sharing or integrating these data with other datasets, ensure alignment of class codes, geographic boundaries, and time periods.

## End-of-document notes and context
- Note discusses the impact of switching land classifications on national estimates and the preference for using the latest classification for internal consistency within a survey, while acknowledging historical comparability considerations.
- Appendices provide detailed historical context, class descriptions, and sample-size tables across survey years, highlighting the iterative nature of the Lands Classification and sampling design.

## Practical takeaways for data stewardship
- Implement robust version control for Land Classification schemes and associated metadata.
- Ensure each dataset carries a clear classification version, date of survey, and country-unit context.
- Preserve crosswalks between classification schemes to support long-term trend analysis.
- Maintain complete documentation of sampling frames, strata definitions, and numbers of squares per class for each survey year.
- Plan for and document upland module data separately to support country-specific habitat assessments.
- Anticipate policy-driven needs for country-specific reporting when designing future sampling and data-sharing strategies.
