COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview

- Purpose: monitor changes in the rural environment and ensure current, usable datasets by standardising data collection, storage, and governance for GB-wide surveys.
- Scope: large-scale field survey across 512 squares in Britain, building on 1977/78 and 1984 surveys; aims to integrate ground truth with satellite imagery and create a linked top-down/bottom-up land cover map.
- Outputs: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, aerial photographs, vegetation plot data, ownership and farmer information, boundary and feature data; data intended for use by ITE and DOE projects and later dissemination.

## Data Governance and Standards

- Data model and codes:
  - Extensive use of numeric primary codes and secondary codes, with alpha codes to conserve space; consistent coding order (dominant use first, etc.) and linking of categories (e.g., boundaries, vegetation, land use).
  - Universal and project-specific codes (e.g., 999 for no longer present; X for points; 6.2.x procedures; 6.1 mapping conventions).
  - Minimum mapping units and measurement thresholds specified (e.g., 1/25 hectare minimum; 20 m minimum boundary length).
- Data capture artifacts:
  - FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) to consolidate maps, codes, and narrative notes; must be completed neatly for reliable analysis.
  - Permanence and relocatability of plots ensured via metal plates and field sketches; field markers designed for future relocation.
  - Aerial photo interpretation (API) used to guide feature identification but ground verification remains primary.
- Ownership and permissions:
  - Detailed ownership/occupancy information recorded (owner/tenant names, addresses, contact details, and cooperation ratings 0–3).
  - Procedures for obtaining permissions; if denied, predefined fallback rules (abandon square or relocate plots); emphasis on courtesy and engagement with landowners.
- Data stewardship principles:
  - Clear evidence of data provenance, field conditions, and decision rationales documented on FABs and maps.
  - Standard operating procedures (SOPs) and a Field Handbook to minimise observer variation and improve repeatability.

## Data Collection Components and Data Model

- Core data elements:
  - Mapping data: annotated 6" (1:10,000) maps with coded features; inclusion of boundaries (actual and interpreted), roads, hedgerows, watercourses, buildings, and curtilages.
  - Vegetation data: standardised plots (quadrats) with a fixed list of ~200 common species; 5% cover categories; allows up to three cover codes per area for mosaics.
  - Ownership and land-use context: farmer/landowner information, physiography, inland water/coastal features, agriculture/natural vegetation types, and boundaries.
  - Sampling data: quadrats (large 200 m2, nested smaller plots), boundary plots, hedgerows, streamside and roadside plots, verge plots, and special 1978-rule plots for legacy alignment.
- Plot and sampling design:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square, with nested 4 m2 and smaller plots inside; five small 2 m2 quadrats in natural/semi-natural land cover types.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 plots per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; specific rules for placement, size, and sequencing.
  - Boundary, verge, road, and waterway plots; extra plots to represent diverse road typologies and water bodies.
- Field procedures and recording:
  - Field staff determine the center of gravity for habitats, orient plots to cardinal directions, and record species presence and cover within each plot.
  - Special attention to boundary delineation, ownership, and permission notes; use of “X” for point records and color coding for curtilages and urban features.
  - Separate sections for ownership (owner addresses and phone numbers), farmer conversations, physiography, land use, and boundaries.

## Data Quality, Consistency, and Documentation

- Quality control:
  - 1990 survey places emphasis on standardisation to reduce observer variation; multiple QC checks and a stringent Field Handbook to guide field recording.
  - The design acknowledges potential incomplete user needs and system fragmentation; procedures encourage consistency across observers and years.
- Documentation and traceability:
  - FABs must be neatly completed; include square numbers, boundary delineations, and site-specific notes.
  - Sketches, maps, and photographs accompany FABs to enable accurate relocation and future re-surveys.
  - Permanent markers and precise relocation procedures ensure longitudinal consistency across survey years (1977/78, 1988, 1990).

## Data Lifecycle, Updating, and Dissemination

- Planning and logistics:
  - Sample squares are grouped and assigned to six ITE Research Stations; flexible scheduling with travel-time considerations; no overtime (compensated with time off in lieu as needed).
- Re-surveys and change detection:
  - The 1990 survey re-measures land cover and vegetation types; new plots are added to gain additional detail, with relocation guided by updated land use.
  - Permanent markers and relocation rules support tracking long-term change and enable future comparisons.
- Data handling and storage:
  - Field data, FABs, maps, and samples are returned to Merlewood Research Station for processing; data are used to inform DOE/CC and other scientific engagements.
  - Although not explicitly digital in this document, the framework supports later data digitisation and integration with satellite-derived land cover maps.

## Particular Risks and Challenges

- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities for certain data types.
- Delays in obtaining timely data from some data creators or landowners.
- Heterogeneous data systems and formats across sites, complicating integration.
- Management of very large datasets and legacy databases requiring bespoke solutions.
- Dependence on legacy conventions (e.g., 1978 rules) and ensuring consistent application in 1990.

## Key Takeaways for Data Stewards

- Establish and enforce standardized data schemas, vocabularies, and coding conventions to ensure comparability over time and across sites.
- Preserve provenance through robust field documentation, permanent markers, and relocation records to enable longitudinal analyses.
- Manage access and permissions as a governance risk control, with explicit procedures for refusals and replacements to maintain study integrity.
- Integrate field data with ancillary data (ownership, physiography, land use, boundaries, API) to support rich, context-aware analyses.
- Plan for data quality and updating by documenting field methods, QC steps, and changes in sampling design across survey years.
- Ensure data storage and dissemination pathways are clear, with FABs, maps, photographs, and samples routed to a central repository for future use and potential digitisation.
