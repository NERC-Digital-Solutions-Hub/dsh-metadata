# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and comment on the accuracy of change statistics.
  - Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors such as drought.
  - Relate conclusions to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
  - Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of future statistics.

- Context and background
  - Field investigations with many recorders inherently vary despite training; QA aims to assess consistency and reliability across major field components.
  - Prior QA exercises informed improvements in training and procedures, including plot relocation challenges and cover estimates.

- Methods (overview)
  - Two QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares, independent assessors, relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation.
    - 1991: added photographs of individual plots and included 1 km squares from all 32 terrain classes; self-assessment squares included.
  - Plot types covered (six main types): 200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots, road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; relocation used sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates.
  - One quarter of each square resurveyed to include each plot type; additional accuracy checks via plate relocation success, location consistency, and re-recording of land cover at predetermined points.

- Key data quality metrics
  - Species concordance measures (four indices):
    - Percentage agreement, simple concordance.
    - Agreement excluding potentially erroneous initial records.
    - Agreement treating initial recording as baseline.
    - Percentage accuracy after removing time-2 errors.
  - Overall concordance (between 1990 and 1991) around 60.9%.
  - Initial efficiency (1990 survey) around 74% accuracy; reduced by plot relocation and seasonal factors; B and D-type variations dominated observed discrepancies.
  - 1991 QA showed a substantial increase in species per plot (average from 20.7–20.9 in 1990 to 23.4 in 1991 for all plots), with a large portion attributed to real ecological differences rather than assessor error.
  - Seasonal and drought effects: evidence that drought year (1990) under-recorded some species; wetter 1991 showed higher counts, especially in upland and moisture-demanding taxa.

- Findings by plot type and land class
  - Variation sources identified:
    - A: Mis-identifications.
    - B: Species overlooked in the original survey.
    - C/D: Seasonal/management changes and mis-location.
    - E/F: Seasonal effects, crop changes, and plot mis-location/orientation.
    - G/H: Plot mis-location/orientation at time 2.
  - Land class impacts:
    - Lowland arable (LC) showed notably lower recording accuracy than other land classes.
    - Upland areas (UP) and other land classes were more consistent; moor/bog vegetation showed particular challenges in accurate classification.
  - Mapping and land-use codes:
    - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable; minor categories less tested due to rarity.
    - Boundary codes were less consistent, partly due to interpretive variation in qualifying codes.
    - Use of detailed qualifiers introduced more potential for mismatch; consolidating mapping rules recommended.
  - Cover estimates:
    - Visual cover estimates for species recorded at both times were relatively stable for many dominant taxa, but co-dominance and minor species showed lower concordance.
    - Bryophytes and certain grasses were often mis-recorded or inconsistently recorded; emphasis on improving training for these groups suggested.

- Recommendations (selected highlights)
  - R1: Retain lichens in sampling (with minor modifications); provide habitat info and specimen studies in training.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey to separate genuine ecological change from observer effects.
  - R3: Ensure testers annotate photographs and relate them to the corresponding plots; photos help relocation.
  - R4: Use metal marker plates to mark X-plots where feasible to aid relocation.
  - R5: Define Y-plots (4 m2) with a survey tape, orienting by side rather than diagonal, and standardize SE corner placement; improve ground positioning.
  - R6–R7: Additional QA and self-assessment practices; align QA timing with fieldwork cycles.
  - R8–R12: Improve land-use coding:
    - Sub-divide upland grassland categories (102) to reflect variation in sward quality and bracken presence.
    - Recognize lowland rush pasture as a distinct class.
    - Treat wet heath as a distinct vegetation type in mapping.
    - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence and use qualifying codes for species composition.
    - Clarify forb-cover and hedge-condition codes, add missing definitions, and avoid overuse of uncertain codes.
  - R12: Simplify mapping by recording only the two most prevalent species per land-use parcel to improve reproducibility.
  - R13–R15: Emphasize bryophytes or other habitat-specific taxa in training when National Vegetation Classification relies on them; broaden allowable bryophyte lists as needed.
  - R16–R17: Encourage same-season QA for direct comparability; avoid cross-season comparisons within a single QA.
  - R18–R20: Improve quoting and handling of vegetation-cover data in analysis; standardize rules for tree/shrub cover in reports.
  - R21–R22: Improve photo annotation, ensure coordinate and distance data accompany sketches, consider time allocation for relocating in challenging unenclosed areas.
  - R23–R24: Mapping and coding education; reduce emphasis on minor species coverage; increase emphasis on mapping reproducibility and dichotomous code usage.

- Implications for data use and reuse
  - Foundational QA confirms data are broadly reliable for many land-use and vegetation mapping purposes, but cautions remain for lowland arable and certain habitat types.
  - Data users should consider season and drought effects when comparing across years; where possible, QA should be aligned with the survey year to minimize seasonal bias.
  - Documentation improvements (photography, plate usage, and precise plot positioning) enhance future data integration and longitudinal studies.
  - Mapping codes and thresholds should be standardized to reduce interpretive variance; consider adopting the recommended code refinements.

- Summary of practical outcomes for Data Support
  - Demonstrates robust QA framework for large ecological surveys, including multiple data facets: species lists, plots, land-use mapping, and boundary delineation.
  - Highlights concrete, implementable steps to improve data quality and reproducibility in future surveys (photography, ground markers, consistent seasons, clearer coding rules).
  - Provides quantified measures of data quality (concordance, accuracy, efficiency) and clear attribution of error sources, informing data governance and data product design.
