# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Outline the development of the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field sampling, linking current methodology to its historical origins to ensure continuity and relevance for policy-relevant environmental monitoring.

- Core approach: A stratified, random sampling system using the ITE Land Classification to divide Great Britain into discrete strata (land classes). Within each stratum, samples are drawn to be representative of the landscape, enabling national and country-specific estimates of habitat features.

- Key concepts
  - Stratified sampling to avoid bias and better capture ecological variation across land types.
  - Use of the ITE Land Classification as the basis for stratification, evolving since the 1970s from plant quadats to landscape-level environmental attributes.
  - Adoption of a centre-square approach (initially 1 km squares) with surrounding squares classified to each center square to form a robust sample frame.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to group land types into classes.
  - National estimates constructed from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.

- Evolution of the sampling framework and land classification
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey): 32 Land Classes created from 1228 centre 1 km squares; eight samples per class (total 256 squares) for national estimates.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey): Sample size increased by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384 squares) to support more robust landscape representations.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification and 3rd Field Survey): Classification revised to cover all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification and 4th Field Survey): Classification expanded to 40 classes to enable Scotland-only reporting; 569 squares surveyed in the field.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification and 5th Field Survey): Adjusted to enable Wales-only reporting; additional Welsh sub-classes created and more Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation; overall framework expanded to 45 strata.

- Detailed method and representation
  - Early sampling used a centre 1 km square with four surrounding squares; later approaches classified all sampled or nearby squares to improve representativeness.
  - For national estimates, the area of each Land Class was estimated from classified squares; habitat areas were derived from field measurements within Squares of each class.
  - As classifications evolved, national estimates could be produced under either the original 1990 classification or the newer classifications; the 2006 scoping study recommended using the latest classification for country estimates to maintain consistency within surveys.

- Country-specific reporting and upland considerations
  - Post-1998, the need for Scotland-only reporting led to a 40-class framework; Wales required even more targeted Wales-only reporting after devolution.
  - CS2000 introduced separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales and Scotland) by subdividing Land Classes into country-specific versions and aggregating small subgroups where needed, resulting in 40 strata (later 45 in CS2007).
  - An uplands module funded an additional 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve statistical precision for these habitats.

- Welsh and upland adjustments (CS2007)
  - Wales received the most intensive sampling (64 squares in CS2000; increased further for CS2007) to deliver robust Wales-only estimates.
  - New Welsh land-class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increased the total strata to 45.
  - England adjustments followed Wales' changes to preserve comparability; several English classes (5e, 15e) were allowed fewer samples (as low as 4 per class) with justified precision.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced in England to maintain country-specific reporting.

- Outputs and data governance considerations
  - The strategy emphasizes transparent, stratified sampling with clearly defined class maps, sample counts, and sampling rates to support policy-relevant environmental monitoring.
  - The need to maintain consistency across surveys is acknowledged, with notes on how changing land-class frameworks impact national estimates and the rationale for using country-specific classifications for comparability.
  - Data sharing, metadata quality, and documentation accompany the sampling framework to enable reproducibility and stakeholder confidence.

- Summary of survey design evolution and key figures
  - CS1978: 256 squares sampled across 32 land classes; eight samples per class.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); refined landscape representation.
  - CS1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; groundwork for Land Cover mapping.
  - CS2000: Wales and Scotland reporting enabled via subdivision and reallocation; 40 strata; upland module added.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused refinements with 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares; targeted adjustments to English classes to retain precision; upland habitat emphasis maintained.
