# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- **Aim and purpose**
  - Use standardized, verifiable data to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Provide current, scientifically usable datasets for evaluation of ecological systems and trends.
  - Link ground-truth field data with satellite/top-down imagery to produce a Britain-wide land cover map and support bottom-up field surveys.

- **Background and context**
  - Builds on earlier ITE land classification surveys (1977/78 and 1984) and the ECOLUC project; ongoing monitoring through to 1990 and beyond.
  - Demonstrates changes in land cover and landscape over time; informs models of ecological change and rural environment assessment.
  - Emphasizes standardization of field recording to reduce observer bias and improve statistical reliability.

- **Sampling design and scope**
  - 512 sample squares targeted for the 1990 resurvey, allocated across six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square typically contains about 3 survey days; planning balances local accessibility, travel time, and logistics.
  - Two-tier sampling approach: ground surveys (field plots) complemented by satellite-derived land cover mapping to enable data integration and projection.

- **Data collection framework**
  - Three core elements in the Countryside Survey 1990: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with sampling described in Section 7).
  - Data recorded on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), integrated with 1:10,000 aerial map bases; use standardized data codes (primary and secondary) to annotate features.
  - Data concepts include ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography, inland and coastal features, vegetation/cover types, boundary features, buildings/structures/communications, and boundaries.

- **Field procedures and governance**
  - Permissions and access: obtain permissions to access all parts of a square; manage farmer/landowner relationships; protocols for partial or full access denial.
  - Planning and logistics: flexible daily travel planning; travel time minimized; no overtime initially (time off in lieu for large overtime accumulation); cost-conscious field operations.
  - Equipment: minimal but essential field kit (FABs, maps, aerial photos, measurement tools, marker plates, etc.); each station contributes specific items.
  - Quality control: standardization of field methods; forethought on observer consistency; field handbook as prerequisite for recorder training.

- **Data recording and field procedure specifics**
  - FAB (Field Assessment Booklet): central data collection tool combining map annotations, ownership, vegetation, boundaries, physiography, and other landscape attributes.
  - Mapping and codes: encode features via primary/secondary codes; use alpha-numeric code schemes to conserve space while preserving detail.
  - Boundaries, ownership, and farmer information: record owner/tenant details, contact approaches, and cooperative potential; manage permissions and documentation.
  - General field survey procedure: arrival assessment, permission negotiation, planning a route for complete square coverage, and post-record review for omissions.

- **Plot types and vegetation sampling (6.2 and 7)**
  - Large quadrats: main vegetation mapping unit of 200 m2; nested quadrats (4 m2 and smaller) record species presence and relative cover.
  - Small quadrats and linear plots: five small (2 m x 2 m) quadrats in natural/semi-natural habitats; multiple linear plots for hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and boundaries.
  - Plot layout and relocation: permanent marking with metal plates; careful relocation of previously recorded plots; use of boundaries and local features for plot placement.
  - Vegetation recording: extensive species list (approx. 200 common species); 5% cover categories; note on bryophytes/lichens; include sketches and photographs; methodology for detailed plot descriptions andけ standardised data entry.
  - Boundary and woodland recording: detailed coding for hedges, fences, walls, banks, belts, and woodland canopy; use of dominant primary codes and secondary qualifiers; age and condition classifications for woodland units.

- **Aerial photograph interpretation (API) and mapping**
  - API to identify features not on OS maps, delineate boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types, and update land-use features such as buildings and roads.
  - Coded conventions for API-derived boundaries and isolated features; guidance on reconciling API guidance with on-ground evidence.

- **Vegetation identification guidelines and data integrity**
  - Emphasis on species-level recording where possible; allowances for difficult identifications via approved species combinations to maintain consistency.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded to a restricted list with defined codes.
  - Emphasis on field-based decisions; documentation of uncertainties and qualifying notes where necessary.

- **Photographic documentation and post-survey procedures**
  - Photography of vegetation plots to document habitat condition and reference landmarks.
  - End-of-day data verification, with caution against rearranging data unless absolutely necessary; timely return of FABs and samples to Merlewood and ITE stations for processing.

- **Freshwater biota sampling (7) and related components**
  - Freshwater biota sampling conducted in two streams per square (IFE and NELUP components); includes diverse habitat types such as lakes, ponds, flushed springs, and bogs.
  - Standardized sampling protocols and logistic arrangements with Merlewood/N Newcastle University partners; samples preserved and transported for analysis.

- **Outputs, accessibility, and data management**
  - Datasets intended for long-term scientific evaluation and policy assessment; outputs include harmonized field data, vegetation maps, and site-based records.
  - Data management emphasizes standardization, storage in appropriate portals, and integration with satellite-derived land cover maps for improved spatial analysis and policy evaluation.
