# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A detailed examination of quality assurance (QA) activities surrounding the 1990 Countryside Survey, including scope, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in survey statistics.

## Aims and scope
- Quantify accuracy of field recording and assess accuracy of change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Compare QA findings with previous ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence.

## Methods
- Two QA series were conducted:
  - Autumn 1990 (21 original survey squares): independent assessors evaluated using original sketch maps for plot relocation; included plate relocation and landcover/boundary checks at 9 fixed points per quarter.
  - 1991 (June–September): added photographs to assist relocation; used a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes; included a self-assessment component with multiple squares revisited.
- Plot types and relocation:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots).
  - Linear plots: including road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries.
  - A quarter of each square was resurveyed to include all plot types represented across the square.
  - Metal plates marking quadrat corners used for relocation; recovery rates measured under time-constrained searches.
- Metrics and data handling:
  - Species concordance: multiple indices to compare plot-level species lists across times (T1 vs T2).
  - Cover estimates: visual cover estimates at >5% for species; compared between surveys.
  - Mapping data: primary landuse codes, boundary codes, and descriptive qualifiers; assessment of coding reliability and level-of-detail.
  - DECORANA (first axis) used to evaluate ecological gradient shifts between times and plot types.

## Key findings

### Accuracy, agreement, and efficiency
- Overall concordance across plots (combining different indices): ~60.9% agreement between T1 and T2; initial overall % accuracy for 1990 survey data around 74% after removing T2-affected records.
- Change in species numbers: 1991 reassessment showed a significant increase in mean species per plot compared with 1990, largely due to real ecological differences (e.g., drought year of 1990 vs normal growing season in 1991) rather than merely improved recorder efficiency; some portion also attributed to greater assessor efficiency.
- Seasonal effects and drought: substantial differences in species presence and detection between summer (1990) and autumn (QA) surveys, and between drought-affected and normal years; caution advised when comparing change statistics across different land uses and seasons.
- Plot-type differences: X plots (quadrats) generally relocated more reliably than small Y plots; Y plots were the most challenging to relocate accurately; road verges and hedges showed relatively better relocation performance.
- Upland vs lowland: lower recording accuracy in lowland arable-dominant classes; upland plots tended to be more stable and easier to categorize, though some drainage/marginal areas showed variability.
- Plate relocation: relocation rates for plates were relatively high, supporting the use of metal plates for location marking, though upland unenclosed areas were more time-consuming.

### Species-level concordance and error sources
- Common error categories identified:
  - A: Mis-identifications
  - B: Species overlooked in the original survey
  - C: Overzealous recording
  - D/E: Placement/location/mis-orientation issues
  - J: Mysteries (unexplained discrepancies)
- Major drivers of mismatch:
  - Seasonal/annual changes (especially in annuals and ephemeral species)
  - Plot mis-location or mis-orientation at T2
  - Changes in management or crop between years
  - Inconsistent or unclear dating of recordings (season/year alignment)
- By plot type and landclass, error patterns varied; LC (lowland arable) showed particularly lower accuracy, while other classes were more consistent.

### Mapping and vegetation mapping accuracy
- Primary landuse code usage was generally reliable; boundary codes were slightly less consistent, partly due to re-visits by same vs different assessors.
- Qualifier codes and boundary codes showed interpretive variation; some habitual code ambiguities remained despite handbook definitions.
- Recommendations for mapping:
  - Increase priority on mapping the two dominant species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility.
  - Introduce clearer codes for specific landtypes (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) and subdivide upland grassland categories.
  - Distinguish and codify wetland/mire vegetation more clearly (e.g., bog vs moor) and reserve consistent boundary coding (hedge vs mixed) with appropriate qualifiers.
  - Limit reliance on cover values for boundary and minor species; focus mapping on primary landuse and dominant vegetation to reduce variability.

### Species cover and frequency changes
- Cover estimates often varied between surveys, with significant differences detected for several common grasses and herbs; bryophyte recording was less consistent and identified as an area needing targeted training.
- Frequency analyses of major species showed some apparent changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) likely reflecting real population changes or climatic differences; other apparent changes were attributed to under-recording in the initial survey.

### Ecological gradient and multivariate assessment
- DECORANA first-axis analyses indicated consistent directional shifts between years for multiple plot types, with upland areas showing distinctive, stable vegetation patterns.
- The overall axis shift between 1990 and 1991 aligned with broader ecological trends observed in earlier ECOLUC studies, but year-to-year variation and landuse differences were evident.

### Conclusions on data usage for GIS and future surveys
- Photographs and metal plates significantly aid plot relocation, particularly in unenclosed land; photographs should be annotated and linked to plots.
- Relocation challenges were most pronounced for small Y plots; recommending improved quadrat positioning methods and clearer site annotations.
- Seasonal timing is critical: QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey time to minimize seasonal and annual variation effects.
- Mapping practices should simplify codes and emphasize reproducibility; avoid over-detail in cover coding; focus on primary landuse and dominant vegetation to improve GIS data consistency.
- Bryophyte and grass identification training should be strengthened; consider expanding allowable bryophyte lists for certain habitats and improving grass identification in fieldhandbooks.
- For future QA:
  - Use photographs and site features to re-establish precise plot locations.
  - Conduct QA in the same growing season/year as the original survey.
  - Improve and standardize codes for land use, boundaries, and vegetation cover to reduce interpretive variance.

## Recommendations (highlights)

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens for general survey; provide species samples and habitat information during training.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey timing.
- Recommendation 3: Encouraging surveyors to annotate photographs and link them to plots; use metal plates to mark X plots; improve Y-plot ground positioning with tape-based definitions.
- Recommendation 4–5: Use tape for 4 m2 (Y) plots; orient such that sides align N-S; place corners consistently; attach plates to improve relocation.
- Recommendation 6–7: Emphasize annotating photographs and precise plate/ground positioning; consider extra manpower for challenging upland relocation.
- Recommendation 8–10: subdivide upland land classes; create distinct codes for lowland rush pasture and wet heath; standardize boundary code usage and restrict broad boundary classifications.
- Recommendation 11–12: Simplify mapping codes; record only the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit; reduce emphasis on multiple abundance qualifiers and broad cover codes; improve consistency in boundary and landuse coding; provide simple dichotomous keys for field use.

## Implications for GIS data products
- QA results inform data assurance practices for map-based outputs and change statistics.
- Emphasizing same-year QA and standardized coding improves cross-year comparability and supports robust GIS analyses of landscape change.
- Recommendations aim to enhance reproducibility, reduce interpretation variance, and improve accuracy of landuse, vegetation, and boundary layers used in GIS workflows.
