# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Purpose and Scope
- Establish a standardized, repeatable framework to monitor changes in land use, vegetation, and landscape features across Britain.
- Build current datasets for scientific evaluation and link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing to produce a Britain-wide land cover map.
- Emphasize data quality, comparability across observers, and long-term monitoring through a two-tier approach (field-ground truthing and satellite imagery).

## Survey Design and Planning
- Sample design: 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990; six teams (one per ITE Research Station) with about 85 squares each; 128 new squares plus 128 re-surveyed from 1977/78 data.
- Planning principles: flexible scheduling, minimize travel, no overtime (time off in lieu where needed), and randomization for selecting additional habitat types when necessary.
- Data standardization goal: reduce observer variation; quality control implemented via a Field Handbook and accompanying definitions.

## Equipment and Data Framework
- equipment mainly supports mapping and recording (FABs) with limited measurement; includes field recording books (FABs), aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking plates, poles, tapes, and basic field gear.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) is the central data-recording instrument, combining maps, quadrats, and sampling data; entries must be neat and unambiguous to enable later analysis.
- Permanence and traceability: permanent markers (metal plates) placed for plot relocation; scenarios for field relocation documented on maps and FABs.

## Field Procedures and Data Recording

### 6.1 Mapping and Data Coding
- Enlarge 1:10,000 maps are annotated with standardized data codes (primary and secondary) to describe land cover, use, boundaries, and other features.
- Alpha-numeric coding system: single alphabetic characters represent combinations of numeric codes for efficient map marking; codes must be used in logical, dominant-first order.
- Boundaries: all boundaries should be mapped and coded unless part of a curtilage; distinguish between actual vs interpreted boundaries and mark non-existing boundaries with a 999 code.
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API): optional guidance to identify features not on OS maps, mark boundaries, and indicate changes; final API advice remains ground-truth oriented.

### 6.1.2 Filling in the FAB
- FABs must be completed neatly; each page gets a square series number, owner information, and a detailed coding of vegetation, ownership, and other land-use attributes.
- Instructions for recording: map units, dominance of codes, 25–50%/50–75%/75–95% cover bands, and explicit notes for complex mosaics or changes.
- Species notes: includes a comprehensive list (across crops, grasses, sedges/rushes, ferns, forbs/woody species, mosses, lichens) with both listed and unlisted species capture, plus guidance for combining difficult identifications.
- Permanent recording: mandatory to sketch plot location, provide measurements, and attach photographs; quadrats and plots are relocated using fixed references and, when necessary, local features.

### 6.2 Field Methods for Survey (Plot Types)
- Six main plot types:
  - Quadrats: large 200 m2 quadrats and nested smaller quadrats for vegetation sampling.
  - Linear plots: boundary hedges, streamsides, and roadsides; up to 5 plots per square per type; strict placement rules relative to features.
  - Boundary and location rules: relocation rules for 1978 and new squares; ensure plots are placed on valid boundary features with a 1–10 m separation guideline.
- Location and relocation procedures: detailed steps for repositioning plots when land use changes or when features no longer exist; documentation on maps and FABs.
- Recording and analysis: all species recorded with 5% cover estimates; use up to three cover codes; keep track of dominant species and notable changes; plottable vegetation mosaics documented with color codes if necessary.

### 6.2.5 Species Identification and Taxonomy
- Emphasizes species-level recording where possible, but allows acceptable combinations for difficult taxa to ensure consistency with past surveys.
- Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with a restricted list; unlisted species captured in a designated section.

## Sampling, Freshwater Biota, and Photography

### 7 Sampling
- Two freshwater biota samples per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sampling) per a separate handbook.
  - Freshwater biota from standing water (NELUP sampling for water beetles) with standard labeling and transport procedures.
- Locations chosen to reflect typical square habitats (lakes, ponds, stagnant waters, flushes, sphagnum pools, animal/track depressions).

### 8 Photography
- Take photographs of every vegetation plot; display plot number on a board at the plot edge to document location and context.

## Permissions, Ownership, and Data Governance
- Permissions required to access all parts of each square; contact farmers/landowners prior to surveying; keep ownership details (who owns which land unit) in the FAB.
- If permission is refused for all or parts of a square, response protocols include abandoning the square and drawing a replacement; for partial refusals, survey feasible portions if possible.
- Documentation of owner cooperation and accessibility is used to assess future survey opportunities and network-building.

## Data Quality, Output, and Lifecycle

- Quality control: explicit focus on reducing observer variation; multiple checks after fieldwork; field recording guidelines to maintain consistency across teams.
- Data outputs: FABs, maps, ownership and farmer information sheets, species lists (including bryophytes/lichens), and photographic records; data backhaul to Merlewood/I TE stations for processing.
- Lifecycle and logistics: end-of-day data checks; transport FABs and samples promptly; precise relocation markers facilitate longitudinal analysis and future resurvey activities.
