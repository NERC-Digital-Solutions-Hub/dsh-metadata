# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose: Evaluate accuracy and reliability of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey; quantify observer error; explain differences; relate to prior work; recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Context: Acknowledges inherent variation due to many recorders despite training and supervision; tests consistency across major field components (plots, vegetation recording, and mapping).

## Aims and Scope

- Quantify accuracy of field recording and changes statistics (1990 QA vs 1990 original survey).
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate findings to previous ITE survey comparisons.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics in future surveys.

## Methods and Experimental Design

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares; relocation relied on sketch maps; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA using photographs of plots; 1 km squares from each of 32 terrain classes; each square visited within 14 days of the corresponding original date; additional self-assessment squares.
- Plot types (six main categories): X plots (200 m² quadrats), Y plots (4 m²), roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; plus related linear plot variations.
- Relocation approaches: relocated plates (metal marker) using sketch maps and photographs; plot relocation assessed with categories (plate relocated, plate not found but location satisfactory, plate not found).
- Data collected: plant species lists, cover estimates for key species, land-use mapping codes, boundary features, and nine-point ground-cover observations within a quarter of each square.
- Analyses: multiple concordance indices for species lists; percentage agreement; accuracy metrics; comparison of species frequencies; DECORANA ordination to assess ecological gradient shifts; land-use code accuracy; mapping cover concordance; assessment of error sources by plot type and landclass; evaluation of the impact of seasonal and annual changes.

## Key Findings: Accuracy and Concordance

- Overall species-list concordance:
  - Autumn 1990 partial analysis suggested around 45% agreement; full 1990 QA and 1991 QA indicated higher concordance.
  - Full 1990 QA combined with 1991 QA showed an overall percentage agreement of about 60.9% between time 1 (original) and time 2 (QA reassessment) for species lists.
- Change in species richness per plot:
  - Mean species per plot rose from 20.7 (1990) to 23.4 (1991); highly significant when all plots are pooled (p < 0.001).
  - Part of the increase attributed to real ecological change (e.g., more typical 1991 growing season) and, to an estimated ~27%, to improved recording efficiency by assessors; the remainder (~73%) attributed to actual changes in species composition between years (likely related to drought vs normal year).
- Seasonal and landclass effects:
  - Greater difficulties and lower accuracy in lowland arable/grazed plots (LC) compared with uplands (UP); upland plots showed relatively better consistency.
  - Evidence that drought year (1990) vs normal year (1991) influenced apparent species changes, especially in arable and marginal areas.
- Plot relocation and plate relocation:
  - Plate relocation success: autumn 1990 = 71% recovery with 5-minute search; autumn 1991 QA showed a 65% plate recovery and 87% plot recovery.
  - Y plots (small plots) were the most challenging to relocate accurately.
- Cover values:
  - Most species showed limited or non-significant differences in cover estimates between times; a few species displayed significant changes, largely explained by seasonal/annual variation and/or recording biases.
  - The grass group and bryophytes were highlighted as needing stricter recording in future QA and training (seasonal variations and identification issues).
- Species-group trends:
  - Across plot types, annual and common species generally showed some shifts, but no single group showed a significant overall difference in cumulative frequency between 1990 and 1991 QA assessments.
- Land-use and boundary mapping:
  - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable across surveys; boundary codes were somewhat less reliable, especially for hedges and certain descriptive qualifiers.
  - Marsh and upland categories needed clearer definitions; recommendations to subdivide certain upland codes (e.g., upland grassland) and to recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type.
- Mapping of vegetation and species cover at points:
  - At nine grid points, there is an 81% chance that a dominant species recorded at one time remains dominant at the other time when present; co-dominants drop to ~34% concordance.
  - Overall, only the most prominent species are reliably reproducible; recommendation to simplify mapping to emphasize the most prevalent species.

## Sources of Variation and Plot-Type Effects

- Major categories of error:
  - A: Mis-identification
  - B: Species overlooked in the original survey
  - F: Seasonal/annual vegetation changes
  - G/H: Plot mis-location or mis-orientation at time 2
  - I2: Variations due to management or vegetation changes
- Plot-type and land-class breakdowns showed:
  - Better relocate success for some plot types (e.g., roadverges); more challenging for Y plots.
  - Lowland LC plots exhibited notably lower recording accuracy; upland plots (UP) better preserved in recording accuracy.
- Recommendations from error analysis:
  - Annotate photographs with plot information and ensure photo-location ties to the sketch.
  - Use metal marker plates for X plots wherever possible; increase relocation efficiency in unenclosed uplands with additional manpower.
  - For Y plots, position using survey tape and orient to N-S rather than diagonal; place SE corner precisely with known reference points.
  - Photographs should be annotated by surveyors, with distances to features and bearings clearly documented.

## Land-Use Mapping, Boundaries, and Codes

- Mapping codes:
  - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable; minor categories (e.g., marsh, certain upland grasslands) caused discrepancies.
  - Boundary codes often misapplied due to similar hedge types and hedgerow compositions; recommendations to standardize the boundary code definitions and qualifying codes.
- Recommendations to improve mapping reproducibility:
  - Subdivide certain land-use codes (e.g., 102 upland grassland; introduce a lowland rush pasture; recognize wet heath as a distinct type).
  - Increase emphasis on land-use primary codes over fine-grained cover codes to reduce coder ambiguity.
  - Use a simpler, dichotomous approach for land-use mapping with clear guidelines on boundary features.

## Cover and Species Identification: Recommendations

- Recording of cover:
  - Emphasize recording only the most prevalent species at each point or unit to improve reproducibility.
  - Limit the use of detailed cover codes for minor species; focus on dominant species for mapping.
- Bryophytes and grass identification:
  - Target bryophytes and grasses more explicitly in training, with expanded species lists where appropriate to habitat type (wetland, peat, etc.).
- Seasonal consistency:
  - QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey and, ideally, in the same season to avoid large seasonal discrepancies.

## Practical Recommendations and Future QA

- Photographs and sketches are crucial for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed terrain; ensure accompanying documentation includes precise distances and bearings.
- Metal plates for X plots are effective but require more time in rough terrain; allocate additional manpower for relocation in uplands.
- For challenging small plots (Y plots), adopt standardized ground-truthing practices and enhanced documentation to improve relocation accuracy.
- Training should emphasize:
  - Distinguishing similar grasses and bryophytes
  - Accurate plot boundary placement and cover coding
  - Clear definitions and subdivision of land-use codes
- QA timing:
  - Conduct QA as close as practical to the original survey date to minimize seasonal biases; ideally within the same year and season.
- Mapping and data structure:
  - Simplify land-use coding schemes for mapping, reduce reliance on fine-grained vegetation cover beyond the most prominent species, and preserve the ability to relate vegetation to national vegetation classifications.

## Conclusions for Future Surveys

- The QA demonstrated that standardized recording and QA processes can meaningfully assess and improve data reliability in large ecological surveys.
- Photographic assistance and ground-truthing methods significantly enhance plot relocation accuracy and overall data quality.
- Seasonality and year-to-year climatic variation can substantially influence observed species composition, particularly in lowland and arable areas; QA should be year-consistent to avoid conflating true ecological change with observer bias.
- A combination of improved field protocols (photography, markers, precise plotting), refined coding (land-use and boundary codes), targeted training (grasses, bryophytes, and similar taxa), and a streamlined approach focusing on the most informative variables will improve future Countryside Survey data quality and comparability.

## Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- QA studies like this provide critical insight into data reliability and the confidence intervals around environmental indicators derived from large-scale monitoring programs.
- The emphasis on standardized methods, error source analysis, and actionable recommendations aligns with the Analysts’ aim to demonstrate environmental health and policy performance through consistent, scrutable data across time.
