# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Aim to update land use databases, monitor changes, and provide current data for scientific evaluation of ecological systems.
  - Based on prior ITE surveys (1977/8 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System; 1990 adds resurvey with enhanced data capture and greater collaboration.
  - Emphasizes standardised field recording, data quality, and linking ground-truth data with satellite imagery for better pattern detection.

- Data collection framework
  - Large-scale design: 512 sample squares across six teams; each square surveyed by station teams (~85 squares per team).
  - Sampling strategy: mix of new and previously surveyed squares (128 new, 384 from prior surveys); two-tier approach to integrate ground data with remote sensing.
  - Objectives include capturing land cover, landscape features, vegetation data, and relevant background information to support trend analyses.

- Survey design and scheduling
  - Planning and logistics governed by Station Coordinators; flexible scheduling; emphasis on minimizing travel and avoiding excessive revisits.
  - Clear permissions required before surveying; procedures for handling refusals, ownership contact, and background background information gathering.
  - Documentation and handbooks establish standard definitions and recording rules to ensure consistency across observers and years.

- Data recording and field sheets (FAB)
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) is the core data-recording tool, combining maps, ownership, habitat, physiography, boundaries, and vegetation data.
  - Use of primary and secondary codes to annotate features; alpha-numeric coding system designed to compress information onto maps while preserving detail.
  - Mandatory fields include: square series number, ownership, farmer information, physiography/inland water/coastal features, boundary types, and built features.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supplements ground data for features not easily visible on maps; instructions specify how API-conveyed features are to be marked and used.

- Mapping and API
  - Mapping uses enlarged 6" maps at 1:10,000 scale; data codes annotate features; boundaries and vegetation units are clearly demarcated.
  - API conventions: dashed guidance lines for limits, crosses for isolated features, diamonds for boundaries no longer present, and emphasis on ground-truth agreement.

- Vegetation sampling and plot types
  - Plot framework includes:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square, with nested smaller quadrats to record species and cover.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in natural or semi-natural land cover types.
    - Linear plots: up to 5 plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide strips).
  - Location and relocation rules:
    - Pre-positioned large quadrats with fixed relocation protocols if land use changes.
    - Small quadrats placed to represent distinct land cover types, with randomization if types exceed five.
    - Linear plots positioned near quadrats, with rules to avoid overlap and ensure representative sampling of boundaries.
  - Recording and measurement:
    - For each plot, record species presence, approximate coverage in 5% increments, and use combinations of codes for complex mosaics.
    - Permanent marking of quadrats with metal plates to enable future re-location; sketches and photographs accompany FAB entries.
    - Detailed instructions for plot setup, orientation, and measurement, including nestings of nested quadrats and data entry formats.

- Data coding and standards
  - Comprehensive code lists for vegetation types, boundaries, ownership, structures, and land use; use of up to three cover codes per area and predefined species lists.
  - Special attention to difficult species identifications; provision for acceptable species combinations when exact identification is not possible.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list, with a separate set of moss/lichen codes.

- Ownership, farmer information, and permissions
  - Ownership is mapped and recorded; contact details and cooperation ratings for landowners/tenants are captured to guide further surveys.
  - Permissions are essential; procedures for refusals, partial access, and repositioning of plots are defined to prevent wasted work.

- Freshwater and invertebrate sampling (IFE/NELUP)
  - Freshwater biota sampling: two samples per square from flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP); detailed procedures described in separate handbooks.
  - Sampling aims to reflect the two main freshwater habitats within each square and to capture aquatic assemblages.

- Photography and documentation
  - Photographic documentation mandated for every vegetation plot to capture appearance and landmark context; plot numbers displayed for reference.
  - Documentation accompanies FAB entries and maps to support future data interpretation and relocation.

- Procedures after surveys
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid transposing data onto new maps unless necessary (only in damage cases).
  - Transportation of FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly to maintain data integrity.

- Outputs and data products (Data Support perspective)
  - Primary outputs include Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), annotated maps, ownership and contact records, and photographic records.
  - Data designed for integration with environmental databases and for longitudinal analyses of land cover, vegetation changes, and landscape features.
  - Structure supports future re-surveys with permanent markers and standardized plot locations to enable robust comparisons over time.
