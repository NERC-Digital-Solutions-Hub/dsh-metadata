# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A comprehensive quality assurance (QA) exercise accompanying the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify recording accuracy, explain differences, compare with prior work, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess accuracy of change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, location, and information type.
- Relate findings to previous ITE survey comparatives.
- Recommend methodology modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.

## Methods

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991 (summer): expanded to include photographs of individual plots; same assessors revisited 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes; 28 squares visited within 14 days of original survey dates.
- Plot types resurveyed (one quarter of each square): X (200 m2) and Y (4 m2) quadrats, plus linear plots (road verges, hedges, streamsides) and boundaries.
- Plot relocation and plate trial:
  - Attempted relocation of buried corner plates; assessed success/failure under time constraints.
  - Use of sketches, photographs, and metal plates in relocation.
- Data comparison metrics:
  - Species concordance indices between T1 (original) and T2 (QA):
    - Percentage agreement
    - Agreement
    - Agreement (with original treated as baseline)
    - % accuracy (adjusted for certain errors)
  - Initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy) calculated from error classifications.
- Analysis by plot type and landclass aggregates (lowland arable, lowland grassland, marginal, upland).

## Key Findings

- Overall agreement and accuracy
  - 1991 QA showed a significant increase in mean species per plot versus 1990 (1990: ~20.7–22.7; 1991: ~23.4–24+ in various groups).
  - Percentage agreement across plots between 1990 and 1991 QA: about 60.9%.
  - Initial recording accuracy (excluding T2 variations) averaged around 74% overall; improved with methodology refinements.
- Sources of variation (types of error)
  - A. Mis-identification of species
  - B. Species overlooked in the original survey
  - C. Over-zealous recording
  - D. Plot mis-location/orientation
  - E. Seasonal/annual changes (management, crop, etc.)
  - F. Plot management/seasonal vegetation changes
  - G/H. Relocation/misalignment issues
  - I. Relocation-related misses or late identification
- Plot type performance
  - X plots: best relocation success; Road verges easier to relocate; Y plots (small quadrats) were the most difficult.
  - Unenclosed upland plots showed greater variability and relocation challenges.
- Landclass and mapping performance
  - Primary land-use codes for major habitats and crops were reliably assigned (high concordance).
  - Boundary codes were slightly less concordant; some codes caused confusion (e.g., marsh, bog, moorland vs. blanket).
  - Mapping of vegetation cover at nine-point grid showed reasonable but imperfect concordance, particularly for co-dominant species.
  - Two most prevalent species per vegetation unit were more reproducible; concordance dramatically drops for multiple co-dominants.
- Seasonal and climatic effects
  - Distinct differences in species lists between drought year (1990) and more normal growing season (1991) likely reflect real ecological shifts as well as recording differences.
  - Under-recording in 1990 and over-recording in 1991 were observed for certain common grasses; drought year contributed to variation.
- Species frequency changes
  - Certain species showed apparent increases (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata, Lapsana communis) likely reflecting real population changes.
  - Other species’ apparent changes (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis) likely due to under-recording in 1990.
- Effects on ecological gradient (DECORANA axis)
  - Axis scores for plot types generally moved in consistent directions between 1990 and 1991, supporting earlier ECOLUC findings; upland plots showed distinctive patterns.
  - Large axis shifts for individual plots were explained by a combination of crop change, relocation issues, species recording, and cover-value discrepancies.
- Land-use mapping and coding
  - Primary codes for land-use/vegetation were highly reliable; minor categories less so due to small sample sizes.
  - Point-by-point mapping showed high agreement in lowland areas; greater variability in upland vegetation due to unenclosed land and relocation challenges.
  - Recommendations to refine and subdivide certain upland/lowland codes to improve reproducibility (e.g., subdividing upland grassland, recognizing wet heath).

## Data Quality and Governance Implications

- Importance of standardized protocols
  - Need for strict adherence to plot size, relocation method, and timing to ensure comparability across years.
- Documentation and metadata
  - Photographs and sketches greatly aid plot relocation; mandatory annotation of photographs and explicit geolocational details improve reproducibility.
- Data licensing and versioning
  - QA highlights necessity of versioned data dictionaries, standardized codes, and clear provenance to support long-term data governance and discoverability.
- Handling climate/year effects
  - When assessing change over time, analyses should account for year-to-year climatic variation; ideally QA should occur in the same year as the original survey to minimize seasonal biases.
- Training and species lists
  - Emphasize bryophyte recording and grass species differentiation in training; maintain curated reference sheets to reduce mis-identifications.
- Data sharing and interoperability
  - A robust data sharing plan should accompany datasets, including updated codebooks, QA results, and recommended code revisions to support interoperability with other vegetation classifications (e.g., National Vegetation Classification).

## Recommendations for Future Surveys (Key Points)

- R1 Include lichens in general surveys; provide training and habitat context for familiarization.
- R2 Schedule QA as close as practical to the initial survey date to minimize seasonal and year-to-year variation.
- R3 Ensure surveyors annotate photographs and relate them to the corresponding plots; include precise distances to nearby features.
- R4 Use metal marker plates for plot X plots to aid relocation; allocate additional personnel for challenging upland relocation.
- R5 Define Y plots with a survey tape; orient 4 m2 plots with a fixed orientation (N-S), placing the plot at the SE corner.
- R6 Improve plot relocation methods with enhanced ground positioning techniques; ensure proximity features appear in both photos and sketches.
- R7 Target training on bryophytes and distinguish similar grasses; build species identification material into training modules.
- R8 Refine upland land-use coding (e.g., subdivide 102 upland grassland; clarify 104 moorland vs. blanket) to reduce ambiguity.
- R9 Introduce a distinct code for lowland rush pasture; recognize wet heath as a separate primary code.
- R10 Restrict primary boundary codes to hedges; ensure hedge species composition is captured via qualifying codes.
- R11 Limit the use of certain coverage qualifiers and focus on the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.
- R12 Shift emphasis in land-use mapping away from fine-grain cover for individual species; aim for mapping that supports consistent classification with the National Vegetation Classification.

## Conclusions for Data Stewards

- The QA exercise demonstrates that systematic QA can quantify observer error, seasonal effects, and relocation challenges in ecological surveys.
- Photographic documentation and standardized marking (plates) significantly improve plot relocation and data quality.
- Season/year alignment and targeted training are crucial to maximizing data integrity across survey cycles.
- Clear, well-documented data dictionaries and codes are essential for reproducibility and interoperability; ongoing governance should support code updates, versioning, and metadata integrity.
- For future data management, reduce ambiguity in land-use and boundary coding, emphasize reproducible mapping practices, and consolidate species data collection to the most informative, high-value observations.
