# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the sampling framework and data classification system used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Shows how the ITE Land Classification evolved over time and how it underpins stratified, random sampling of GB land.
- Explains how data were used to produce national and country-specific estimates and how classifications were updated to support Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting.

## Background: ITE Land Classification and Sampling Philosophy
- The ITE Land Classification provides an environmental stratification of Great Britain to ensure representative sampling across diverse land types.
- Stratification reduces bias from purely random sampling by ensuring all parts of the population (land types) are sampled.
- Early work (1970s) established a 1 km square sampling unit, balancing field survey practicality with ecological detail.
- Classifications are described by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and are periodically updated to reflect new data and policy needs.

## Historical Development and Key Surveys
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from 1228 central 1 km squares, plus surrounding squares classified for context.
  - Field surveys covered 8 squares per land class (256 total).
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by land-class area.
- 1984 (Second GB Land-Use Survey)
  - Used the 1978 Land Classification; increased sample to 12 squares per class (total 384).
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; included urban and sea corrections.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
  - 569 squares surveyed; separate Scottish reporting introduced.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; 5th Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting introduced; added Welsh sub-classes and more Welsh sample squares (overall more granular Wales coverage).
  - England and Wales were split into country units, creating 45 strata.
  - Additional upland module added to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

## Sampling Framework and Methodology
- Site unit: 1 km square, selected from classified land classes.
- Stratified random sampling to ensure representation across land classes.
--Assessment and data collection focused on habitat area, land cover, and related ecological features.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) historically underpinned initial class definitions; later classifications relied on environmental surrogates and multivariate approaches.
- For national estimates: estimated as the mean habitat area per square within each land class times the land-class area.

## National and Country-Level Estimates
- Estimates can be generated using different Land Class schemes (original 1990 vs. revised classifications); consistency considerations discussed to balance intra-survey vs. cross-survey comparability.
- Country-unit reporting
  - England with Wales and Scotland reporting adjusted to reflect country boundaries.
  - Land Classes subdivided by country units (e.g., 5w, 6w, etc.) and re-aggregated where necessary to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new Welsh classes; Wales receives more intensive sampling (and dedicated Welsh sub-classes).
- Upland habitat module (CS2000) added 30 upland squares to improve Wales/England upland estimates.

## Data and Reporting Outputs
- Table and figure references describe the distribution and changes in land classes and sample squares across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
- Key outputs include national estimates and country-specific results (England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales separately for 2007).
- Main reporting documents
  - Countryside Survey 1990: main report
  - Accounting for nature: assessing habitats in the UK countryside (CS2000)
  - Countryside Survey: UK Results from 2007 (CS2007)

## Practical Implications for Data Leaders
- Data lineage and versioning are critical: classifications have evolved (32 → 40 → 45 classes) with implications for comparability over time.
- Time-series integrity requires careful documentation of when and how land classes were subdivided or aggregated by country units.
- Metadata and discoverability: keep clear records of the rules used for class assignment, sample allocation, and country-specific adaptations.
- Data governance considerations include ensuring adequate representation across regions and country units, especially after devolved governance changes.
- Anticipate data gaps and access barriers when larger, more disaggregated classifications or country-specific reporting are introduced.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Changing land classifications affects consistency of national estimates across surveys.
- Ensuring adequate representation of minority or newly defined classes in each country unit (especially Wales) required additional sampling and subdivision.
- Balancing the need for detailed country-specific outputs with the statistical precision achievable given sample sizes.
- The approach relies on stratified sampling rooted in complex environmental classifications, which requires ongoing maintenance and clear documentation for users.

## Timeline Summary (Key Milestones)
- 1978: First GB ecological survey using 32 Land Classes; 8 samples per class.
- 1984: Second GB survey; 12 samples per class; expanded scope to land-use features.
- 1990: All-squares Land Classification; 508 squares; integration with Land Cover Map.
- 1998: Revised Land Classification; Scotland-only reporting; 40 classes.
- 2000: CS2000 with England & Wales and Scotland country-unit framework; additional sampling to correct class representation.
- 2007: CS2007 introduces Wales-only reporting, additional Welsh class subdivisions, upland module, and refined country-unit sampling (45 strata).
