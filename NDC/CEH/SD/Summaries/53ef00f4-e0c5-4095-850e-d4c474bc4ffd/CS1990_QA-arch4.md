# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Outline the scope, results, and recommendations of the quality assurance (QA) carried out for the 1990 Countryside Survey, with a series of conclusions to improve future survey accuracy and confidence in statistics.
- Context: Field surveys involve many recorders; QA aims to measure consistency and reliability of major field components, despite training and oversight.

## Aims and Scope

- quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess change statistics validity
- explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, and regional factors
- relate QA conclusions to previous ITE survey work
- recommend survey methodology modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics

## Methods

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original squares; two independent assessors; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation
  - 1991: added photographs of individual plots; paired assessors; used a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes
- QA design:
  - One quarter of each square was resurveyed to include all six plot types; field data collected per standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedure
  - Plot types: Quadrats (200 m2 X-plots; 4 m2 Y-plots); Linear plots (1.0 x 10 m strip features); Roadverges; Hedges; Streamsides; Boundaries
  - Plate relocation: attempted relocation of buried corner plates; assessed with photos and metal detector
  - Nine fixed points per quarter to assess landcover and boundary features
- Data comparison:
  - Multiple concordance metrics to compare T1 (original) and T2 (QA) species lists
  - Considered effects of season, location, and information type
- Additional self-assessment squares in 1991 for cross-checking and method refinement

## Key Findings

- Overall concordance and accuracy
  - Initial QA (1990) showed around 60% concordance between T1 and T2 species lists; broader analysis suggested about 74% maximum accuracy in certain strata
  - Full 1990 QA indicated an average initial accuracy around 58% with improvements when accounting for seasonal effects and plot relocation challenges
  - 1991 QA demonstrated a significant increase in mean species per plot (about 2.7 more species on average) largely due to real seasonal/annual differences and improved recording efficiency
- Sources of variation (T1 vs T2)
  - Notable error types:
    - A: Mis-identifications
    - B: Species overlooked at T1
    - C: Over-zealous/incorrect recording
    - D/J: Mis-location, mis-orientation, or plot mispositioning
    - E/F: Seasonal and management effects (crop changes, herbicide use)
    - G/H: Plot relocation/alignments between surveys
  - Seasonal and drought effects significantly influenced species presence, especially in drought years; upland vs lowland differences observed
- Plot relocation and data capture
  - Photographs greatly aided relocation, particularly for plots in unenclosed land
  - Metal plates for X-plots improved relocation success; Y-plots were most challenging to relocate
  - X plots relocated more reliably; Y plots and small plots hardest to pin down
- Landuse mapping and codes
  - Primary landuse codes were highly reliable for major habitats and crops; boundary codes and some descriptive qualifiers had lower concordance
  - Variation largely due to interpretation and definition ambiguities in the code handbook
  - Comparisons between assessor pairs and across time showed similar performance, indicating consistent coding practices
- Vegetation cover data
  - Cover estimates showed significant changes for several common species between 1990 and 1991, with some changes attributable to actual population shifts and others to recording differences
  - Bryophytes and some grasses identified as more problematic; suggested targeted training and inclusion of additional bryophyte taxa in future QA
- Mapping and boundary features
  - Primary landuse codes reasonably stable; boundary codes showed more variability due to interpretation and classification challenges
  - Point-by-point mapping concordance high in lowland areas; greater variability in upland areas, partly due to unenclosed land locations
- Ecological gradient and axis analysis (DECORANA)
  - Axis scores indicated a general shift consistent with known land-use changes and climatic/annual variation; upland moorland showed distinct vegetation responses
  - While mean axis shifts existed, year-to-year variation and plot relocation issues contributed to scatter
- Recommendations and implications
  - Emphasize standardized photographic documentation and precise relocation aids
  - Use metal plates for plot corners, and develop robust protocols for photographing and annotating plot locations
  - Improve positioning and orientation for small plots (Y-plots); standardize orientation to N-S along the shorter side
  - Restrict QA to the same year/season as the original survey to minimize climatic/seasonal variability
  - Enhance bryophyte inclusion and grass-level identification in training and QA
  - Refine landuse and boundary codes to reduce ambiguities; consider subdividing certain upland codes and adding new codes (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) for clearer classification
  - Reduce granularity of vegetation mapping to emphasize the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility
  - Encourage codified procedures for recording tree and shrub cover to reduce inconsistencies
  - Ensure mapping codes are used consistently across assessors; use simple, dichotomous choices where possible
  - Consider year-aligned QA to avoid inter-annual climatic effects; plan QA in the same growing season when feasible
- Specific improvements proposed
  - Recommendation 3: annotate photographs with location context and relate to plot sketches
  - Recommendation 5: define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tape and orientation constraints
  - Recommendation 8-12: subdivide/upgrades to landclass codes; recognize wet heath as a distinct type; clarify boundary coding; simplify and standardize cover recording
  - Recommendation 12: record only the two most prevalent species for land-use mapping to improve reproducibility

## Implications for Data Leaders (Data Strategy and Data Quality)

- QA demonstrates the critical role of standardized, repeatable data collection for credible change statistics and long-term datasets.
- Photographic records and physical markers (plates) should be integrated into data governance practices to enable reliable plot relocation and provenance.
- Clearly defined, well-documented coding schemes (landuse, boundaries, vegetation, cover) are essential to minimize inter-observer variability and facilitate cross-network data sharing.
- Seasonal and year-to-year context must be considered in change analyses; ideally, QA should occur in the same year and season as the original data collection to isolate observer effects from climatic variability.
- Training should emphasize identification of challenging taxa (grasses, bryophytes) and consistent application of cover and boundary codes; include reference materials (habitat samples, specimen exemplars) to reduce misidentifications.
- Data products should balance granularity with reproducibility; for mapping outputs, prioritize consistent representation of dominant species and major land-use classes over full-species detail where appropriate.
- When integrating this survey data with broader networks or national vegetation classifications, ongoing refinement of codes and metadata is necessary to ensure interoperability and comparability.

## Conclusions and Takeaways

- QA confirms that observer bias, seasonality, plot relocation, and coding interpretation significantly affect vegetation surveys; photographs and physical plot markers substantially improve data quality.
- A structured, codified approach to data collection, including explicit guidelines for plot positioning, vegetation cover, and landuse coding, is essential for reliable long-term data products.
- Implementing the recommended refinements would enhance future survey accuracy, support robust trend analyses, and improve data discoverability and usability across partners and networks.
