# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey fieldwork up to 2007.
- Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s landscapes.
- Highlights linkages between land classification, sampling, and national/country-specific habitat estimates, including Wales-only reporting.

## Core Concepts
- Stratified sampling to minimize bias and improve representativeness across diverse landscapes.
- Use of a Land Classification system to stratify the population into discreet, homogeneous classes.
- Sample units were typically 1 km squares; sampling within each class aimed to capture ecological and land-use variation.
- Indicators and methods: Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to derive land classes from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- National estimates derive from combining class-area proportions with per-square habitat metrics.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (1978–2007)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
  - 32 land classes derived from environmental data for 1228 center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid.
  - Each class represented proportionally; eight 1 km squares per class surveyed (256 total).
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) using the 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB; urban/seascape corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation/quadrat data collected; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 updates)
  - Strengthened framework to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - Began developing a GB-wide classification across all squares using surrogates for major climatic/geological factors.
- 2000 (CS2000 Developments; Separate country estimates)
  - Addressed policy needs for England, Scotland, Wales (and Isle of Man) to report country-specific estimates.
  - Introduced country-unit versions of land classes (40 strata total with sub-divisions and aggregations).
  - Added 19 extra squares for adequate representation; additional sampling to balance Wales representation.
  - Upland habitat module (30 extra squares) added to improve upland estimates in England/Wales.
- 2007 (CS2007 Adjustments; Wales-focused reporting)
  - Wales required Wales-only results; added Welsh country-unit sub-divisions (five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Expanded strata to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class.
  - England adjusted where Welsh squares were removed; two English classes (5e, 15e) kept with 4 squares each.
  - Wales emphasized as the most intensively sampled country; overall, a Wales-first approach for country-specific outputs.

## Sampling Framework and Field Surveys
- 1978 CS: 256 squares surveyed across 32 land classes; national estimates based on class areas and mean habitat per square.
- 1984 CS: 384 squares; maintained 1978 classification for estimates; increased sample size to reduce error.
- 1990 CS: 508 squares; shifted to an all-squares classification; included land-cover integration.
- 2000 CS: 30–40 strata with country-unit subdivisions; extensive reallocation to ensure country-specific reporting; upland module added.
- 2007 CS: 45 strata; Wales-focused expansion; Welsh squares increased; precision balanced with cross-country comparability.

## Country-Level Focus and Upland Module
- Separate country estimates implemented to provide England & Wales and Scotland-specific results, addressing devolved policy needs.
- Upland and marginal upland habitats included as a dedicated module to improve accuracy for those regions.

## Outputs, Implications, and Use
- Outputs include land-class maps, counts of survey squares per class, and estimated habitat areas by country unit.
- Important for tracking changes in habitat extent and distribution over time and across countries.
- Methodological notes underscore the trade-offs between classification consistency and the need for country-specific reporting.
- For long-term time series, maintaining comparability requires careful alignment of classifications and sampling design across survey waves.
