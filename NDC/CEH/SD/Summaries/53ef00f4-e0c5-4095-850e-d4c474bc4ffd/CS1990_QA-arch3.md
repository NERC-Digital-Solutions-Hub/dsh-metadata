# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A detailed quality assurance (QA) exercise for the 1990 Countryside Survey to measure accuracy and reliability of field recording, understand observer and seasonal variation, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and change statistics from the Countryside Survey 1990.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, and other factors (geography, drought).
- Relate findings to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of future statistics.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed using sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of individual plots to assist relocation; additional self-assessment squares included; each 1 km square sampled across terrain classes.
- Plot types examined (representative 1990 methods):
  - Quadrats: 200 m² (X-plots) and 4 m² (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots, road verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries
- Relocation and data collection:
  - Plots relocated using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detection; nine fixed points per quarter square recorded for landcover/boundaries.
  - Plate relocation and plot position recorded; three relocation outcomes defined (fully relocated, partially relocated, not relocated).
- Data analysis:
  - Species concordance indices (percentage agreement, agreement, accuracy) to compare 1990 vs 1991 records.
  - Initial efficiency of recording calculated; comparisons across land classes (lowland arable, lowland grassland, marginal land, upland) and plot types.
  - Assessment of cover estimates and mapping codes; DECORANA analysis for ecological gradient shifts; t-tests for species frequency changes.

## Key Findings

### General recording accuracy
- Overall species-level agreement between T1 (original) and T2 (QA) varied:
  - Initial analyses around 45–60% depending on metric.
  - 1991 QA with photographs increased apparent accuracy; overall percentage agreement around 60.9% after adjustments.
  - Initial efficiency of recording averaged about 58–74% across datasets; improved with QA processes and use of photographs (approaching 79% in some comparisons).
- Side-by-side comparisons showed substantial variation by plot type and landclass.

### Seasonal and climatic effects
- A real, detectable increase in species numbers in 1991 compared with 1990, largely due to improved recording and seasonal growth differences (1991 wetter/normal season vs 1990 drought).
- Seasonal differences between autumn QA (1990) and summer original surveys contributed to mismatches; in upland/moist habitats, species detection was more challenging.

### Plot relocation and data capture
- Plot relocation was easier for X plots and road verges; Y plots (smaller 4 m²) were notably more difficult to locate accurately.
- Use of metal plates and photographs markedly improved relocation success.
- Relocation performance varied by land class: upland squares tended to show fewer seasonal effects; lowland arable areas showed more variability due to crop changes and management.

### Species coverage and identification
- Mis-identifications and species overlooked contributed significantly to discrepancies; bryophytes and grasses were particularly challenging.
- Recording of some universal cover values differed between times; for certain common grasses, cover estimates changed (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica), but overall cover changes were not consistently significant across all taxa.
- The authors recommend targeted training on distinguishing grasses and documenting bryophytes, with explicit cover-handling rules in field handbooks.

### Land use mapping and vegetation coding
- Land-use primary codes showed high concordance (around 88–95%); boundary codes were slightly less consistent (around 80–83%), partly due to reuse of the same squares by different assessors.
- Some codes (e.g., marsh/wetland, upland categories) were inconsistently applied; marsh and bog classifications were especially problematic.
- Mapping of vegetation cover at fine taxonomic detail had limited concordance; only the most prominent species at a point tended to be reproducible across surveys.
- Recommendation: simplify mapping to record only the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit and reduce emphasis on detailed cover codes to improve reproducibility.

## Sources of Variation (Summary)
- A: Misidentifications
- B: Species overlooked in the original survey
- F: Seasonal/annual ecological changes
- G/H: Plot mis-location/mis-orientation at time of resurvey
- I/J: Other mismatches and “mysteries” in data
- Variation in T1/T2 often reflected a mix of true ecological change and recording artefacts; the QA emphasized distinguishing seasonality, management changes, and relocation errors.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Photographic and plate-based relocation substantially improves reproducibility and should be integral to future monitoring frameworks, especially in unenclosed land.
- Season- and year-aligned QA is crucial; ideally, QA should occur in the same year as the initial survey to minimize climatic and phenological differences.
- Documentation and metadata are essential. Provide explicit coordinates, distance bearings to features, and clear linking of photos to plot sketches to enable accurate relocation.
- Data governance considerations:
  - Standardize codes and provide clear definitions to reduce interpretive variation between assessors.
  - Limit granularity in mapping codes to enhance reproducibility, while maintaining essential ecological classification goals.
  - Ensure transparency about data provenance and QA processes to support data sharing and comparability over time.

## Recommendations (selected highlights)

- R1: Retain lichens in general surveys but enhance training materials with species samples and habitat context.
- R2: Conduct QA as near as practically possible to the initial survey date; consider same-year QA where feasible.
- R3: Require assessors to annotate photographs and tie them to locations; include distances to nearby identifiable features; consider bearings.
- R4: Use metal marker plates to mark all X plots; if used in unenclosed land, allocate extra manpower for relocation.
- R5: For 4 m² (Y) plots, define positions with a survey tape, orient sides NS rather than diagonally, place at the SE corner; improve positioning accuracy.
- R6–R7: Improve plot relocation practices with standardized referencing; allow QA assessors to access original sketch maps and photos.
- R8–R10: Subdivide complex land-use codes (e.g., upland grassland) for greater specificity; recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with its own primary code.
- R11–R12: Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence/absence with hedge species described via qualifying codes; focus mapping on primary land-use codes rather than dense cover qualifiers.
- R12 (mapping guidance): Record only the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit for mapping; reduce reliance on fine-grained cover codes to improve reproducibility.

## Conclusions

- Photographic aids and plate-based localization greatly enhance plot relocation and data reliability; same-year QA and consistent metadata are essential to minimize climate/phenology-driven discrepancies.
- While species-level concordance between original surveys and QA remains imperfect, the QA demonstrated meaningful improvements with methodological enhancements and highlighted key data-quality challenges.
- Simplifying and harmonizing land-use and vegetation-coding schemes, along with targeted training on grasses and bryophytes, are practical steps toward more reliable and reproducible environmental monitoring data.
- The findings inform a more robust monitoring framework by emphasizing standardized procedures, better relocation protocols, clearer metadata practices, and balanced coding schemas to improve both data quality and policy-relevant interpretability.
