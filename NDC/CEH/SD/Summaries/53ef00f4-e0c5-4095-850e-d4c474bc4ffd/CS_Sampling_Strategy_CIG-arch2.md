# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and aim
  - Provides the field sampling framework and land classification system (ITE Land Classification) used to stratify and sample large-scale ecological surveys in Great Britain.
  - Emphasizes creating time-series data to detect environmental change and support policy-relevant environmental monitoring.
  - Details how data are stratified, collected, and transformed into national estimates, with outputs suitable for reporting across England, Scotland, and Wales.

- Core concepts and methods
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across GB.
  - The ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical, environment-based stratification of land used to guide sample allocation and interpret results.
  - Use of 1 km square sample units for field surveys, with larger context provided by surrounding areas and the overall land-class distribution.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used in early development to classify vegetation units, later scaled to landscape-level classification.
  - National estimates are derived from the mean habitat area per square within each land class, multiplied by the land-class area (with adjustments for country-specific reporting).

- Evolution of the sampling framework (timeline)
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and 1st field survey
    - 1228 classified squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid); 6039 km squares classified when including surrounding squares.
    - 8 sample squares per land class (total 256) surveyed; habitat areas estimated per class.
  - 1984 – 2nd field survey
    - Expanded to 12 km squares per land class (total 384), maintaining the 1978 framework for national estimates.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and 3rd field survey
    - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB, with urban/sea corrections; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Results anchored to the 1990 Land Classification.
  - 1998/2000 – Revised Land Classification and 4th field survey
    - Classification expanded (40 classes) to enable separate Scottish reporting; issues with representation addressed by adjusting sample allocation.
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) with reallocation and aggregation of classes as needed; additional upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland regions.
  - 2007 – Revised Land Classification and 5th field survey
    - Wales-only reporting needs drive further refinement: sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (creating five new Welsh/England-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; English squares adjusted due to removal of Welsh squares.
    - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country unit; England retains most classes but with some reduced samples in two classes.

- Country-specific and upland considerations
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-specific reporting.
  - Wales requires finer Welsh-specific land-class subdivisions to support Wales-only environmental policy reporting.
  - An uplands module (CS2000) added to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- Data outputs, coverage, and guidance for use
  - Tables and figures (e.g., class maps and sample-square distributions) illustrate the evolving sampling framework and representation across GB and its countries.
  - For national estimates, the approach can be complex due to changing classifications; consistency is weighed between year-to-year comparability and cross-survey coherence.
  - Note acknowledges the impact of changing land classifications on the comparability of national stock estimates; guidance favors using the latest country-specific classification for internal consistency while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.

- Implications for monitoring and data reuse
  - Provides a standardised, repeatable framework for long-term environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Highlights the importance of maintaining stratified sampling to avoid bias and to support robust time-series analysis.
  - Emphasizes the need for transparency in how classification changes affect national estimates and the representation of different countries within GB datasets.
  - Aligns data collection with portals and data-management practices, ensuring datasets are stored and accessible for policy monitoring and public scrutiny.
