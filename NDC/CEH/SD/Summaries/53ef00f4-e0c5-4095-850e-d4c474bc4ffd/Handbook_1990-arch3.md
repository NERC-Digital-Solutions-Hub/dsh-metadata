# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aims and scope
  - Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, monitor changes, and inform future decisions.
  - Large-scale, standardized land-use and vegetation monitoring across Britain to update databases and evaluate ecological change.
  - Combines ground surveys with satellite/remote-sensing approaches (two-tier: bottom-up field data with top-down imagery) to enable robust trend analysis.

- Approach to monitoring and data management
  - Emphasises learning from stakeholders and other programmes to identify useful indicators and avoid duplication.
  - Seeks data from diverse sources, addressing metadata gaps by contacting original data custodians; where possible, adds metadata and publicly shares underlying data (data governance considerations acknowledged).
  - Commits to data quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and clear presentation (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Plans for transparency and stakeholder consultation; data sharing is pursued while adhering to governance standards.

- Study design and sampling
  - 512 square sites; six ITE Research Stations coordinate field teams.
  - A two-tier approach: ground-truth land cover/vegetation data and linkages to bottom-up field data with top-down satellite imagery.
  - Re-survey planned for 1990 to capture land cover, landscape, and vegetation changes; standardisation to minimise observer variation is a core lesson from earlier surveys.
  - Permanent markers and relocatable plots enable accurate future comparisons; extensive use of aerial photographs to support mapping and interpretation.

- Field procedures and permissions
  - Flexible planning to accommodate access constraints; permission from landowners/farmers is essential to complete square surveys.
  - If permission is refused, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon the square or adjust survey scope (with replacement squares considered).
  - Stakeholder engagement emphasizes notifying landowners and obtaining informed consent; a structured ownership/occupancy data process is implemented within the field sheets.

- Data recording, coding, and outputs (FAB)
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) integrates mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling; all pages linked to a square and recorded with precise identifiers.
  - Uses a systematic coding scheme with primary and secondary codes to annotate land cover, boundaries, features, and uses; alpha-numeric combinations enable compact, information-rich records.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) supplements field data to identify features not easily mapped on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees, recent boundaries).
  - Detailed guidance for completing FAB pages, including ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, boundaries, buildings, roads, verges, streams, hedges, and woodland.
  - Universal code lists cover land use, boundary types, vegetation types, species, and bryophytes/lichens; codes are applied consistently to enable cross-site comparison.

- Plots and sampling design
  - Vegetation plots:
    - Large quadrats: 5 x 200 m2 plots per square, placed to represent habitat types; nested 2 x 2 m vegetation sampling within each large quadrat for detailed recording.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 x 2 m plots per square in natural or semi-natural vegetation.
  - Linear plots:
    - Up to 5 per square across categories: hedgerows (B1–B5), streamsides, roadside plots, and boundary plots adjacent to linear features.
    - 1978 rules for locating linear plots to ensure comparability with earlier work; relocation rules when features change are specified.
  - Location, relocation, and permanent marking:
    - Plots are marked with metal plates or field-anchored markers to ensure future relocatability; distances and bearings are recorded.
    - When land use changes or hedgerows/streams disappear, plots are relocated or replaced following explicit guidelines.
  - Locating and recording rules ensure plots are placed to capture habitat diversity while avoiding bias; centers of gravity for habitats guide large quadrat placement, with adjustments as needed.

- Vegetation sampling and species recording
  - Species lists cover common British flora with a restricted set of bryophytes/lichens; combinations allowed where species-level identification is difficult (to maintain consistency with past surveys).
  - Species presence recorded within nested quadrats; estimates of percent cover recorded in 5% bands; max 100% cover can occur due to layered vegetation.
  - Documentation includes sketch maps, notes on mosaics, and full provenance of each recorded unit; unlisted species recorded at the bottom of forms.
  - Guidelines for identifying and classifying vegetation types emphasize distinctions between managed vs. unmanaged vegetation, moorland types, and herbaceous vs. woody components.
  - Detailed lists and code tables for crops, grasses, forbs, woody plants, and bryophytes/lichens accompany the FAB.

- Freshwater biota sampling
  - Two freshwater biota sampling streams per square:
    - Freshwater Ecology (IFE) biota from flowing waters (procedure in a separate handbook).
    - NE/LUP biota sampling (water beetles) from standing waters (lentic habitats), with sampling points chosen to reflect square-wide habitat types.
  - Clear labeling, sample handling, and transport protocols to Merlewood for analysis.

- Photography and supplementary outputs
  - Photographs of vegetation plots to document appearance and linkage to local landmarks; plot numbers recorded on photographic boards for reference.

- Data quality, reporting, and governance
  - Emphasises post-day data review to avoid omissions; where possible, data are transposed to new maps only when necessary.
  - Encourages timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations for QA and centralised analysis.
  - Acknowledges potential barriers to data sharing (metadata gaps, access issues) and addresses them via standardised field procedures and documentation.

- Practical considerations and resources
  - Equipment needs: FABs, aerial photographs, maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, surveying poles, tapes, first-aid, cameras, field gloves, and related supports.
  - Coordination and logistics: six-station governance, travel planning, flexible work arrangements, and a hierarchy of coordinators to manage site-specific issues.
  - Background and contact: ITE Merlewood Research Station as a primary information hub; handbook and definitions provided to guide surveyors.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring frameworks
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 presents a comprehensive, codified framework for long-term environmental monitoring that integrates ground-truth vegetation and land-cover data with remote-sensing inputs.
  - It foregrounds data standardisation, metadata, reproducibility, stakeholder engagement, and governance to support policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
  - The methodology emphasizes replicability across time and space, enabling robust detection of ecological changes and informing adaptive management decisions.
