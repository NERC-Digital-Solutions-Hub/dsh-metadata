# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Context and motivation
  - Characteristic organic farming practices (e.g., rotations) raise questions about where benefits are greatest: farm-scale versus landscape-scale (multiple farms).
  - Hydrological effects of organic farming depend on watershed-scale cultivation patterns; landscape context can also influence socio-economic outcomes.
  - Abandonment of organic farming often stems from economic consequences and geographic isolation, highlighting the value of advice networks and producer collaborations; however, local concentrations can intensify competition and reduce local profits.

- Research aims
  - Two core questions: (1) What factors influence the spatial concentration of organic farms across scales? (2) How do scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts vary with farm concentration?

- Project scope and approach
  - Integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Scales range from field to landscape to national; using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting organic fractions.

- Systems perspective and context-dependence
  - Farms are not isolated; neighboring conventional practices can indirectly protect or undermine organic farms.
  - Biodiversity benefits from organic management may require larger, landscape-scale habitat mosaics rather than small, isolated areas.
  - Biodiversity and other outcomes depend on landscape embedding, management variation, and access to exchange networks.

- Data, methods, and analyses
  - Sub-systems and scales: watershed, landscape, farm, and social networks are analyzed for their mutual relationships and contributions to system performance.
  - Co-adaptive, time-evolving processes: changes in one sub-system influence others; the approach can be applied recursively to smaller components (farms within landscapes, networks).
  - Mixed methods: qualitative and quantitative empirical techniques combined with modelling; participatory approaches via workshops and iterative learning with scientists and stakeholders.
  - Field and social data: field surveys of fauna, flora, water flows, and soil quality; structured and open interviews within focal neighborhoods and the broader organic food chain.
  - Scenarios: construction and evaluation of future development scenarios for the organic sector across local, regional, and national levels.

- Data and outputs for analysts
  - Cross-scale, nested empirical analyses cover biodiversity (bird, invertebrate, plant), soil properties, soil infiltration and hydrology, water runoff and downstream nutrient transfer, farm economics, resource use, marketing and supply chains, cross-farm social interactions, and cultural attitudes.
  - A systems approach integrates qualitative insights with quantitative data to understand drivers of spatial density and potential shifts toward organic- or conventional-dominated landscapes.
  - Findings inform policy and practice by identifying scale-aware strategies, the role of collaboration networks, and the conditions under which biodiversity and flood-mmitigation benefits accrue with minimal costs to farms.

- Implications for policy and practice
  - Emphasizes scale-aware planning to maximize ecological and hydrological benefits while preserving farm viability.
  - Highlights the importance of fostering farmer collaborations, local networks, and regional supply chains to lower transaction costs and accelerate diffusion of organic farming.
  - Cautions that too much local concentration may reduce profits due to competition; policies should balance expansion with market and network support.
  - Supports scenario-based planning to test how different spatial concentrations influence outcomes across biodiversity, water management, economy, and culture.

- Project structure and collaboration
  - Systems framework applied across multiple nested scales with nine integrated work packages.
  - Combines field surveys, social interviews, and participatory workshops to explore interactions and sensitivities to neighborhood context.
  - Uses empirical data and modelling to construct and evaluate future development scenarios for the organic sector.

- Outputs and accessibility
  - The research generates integrated analyses linking hydrological, environmental, social, and economic dimensions to scale.
  - Aims to produce actionable insights for stakeholders at local to national levels, informing policy directions, network designs, and management practices.
  - Emphasizes the need for data standardization and accessible datasets to support replication, cross-site comparison, and ongoing monitoring across scales.
