# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

## Overview
- A UK-based project assessing hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
- Aims to span scales from field to landscape to national, using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting fractions of organic cultivation.

## Objectives and scope
- Investigate what influences the spatial concentration of organic farms across multiple scales.
- Examine scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts of varying organic farming concentrations.
- Explore whether a critical mass of producers is needed to establish supply networks and stimulate conversion to organic farming.

## Study design and scale
- Employs a nested, multi-scale approach from field, to farm, to surrounding landscape, to national context.
- Within each landscape, select focal organic and conventional growers on similar soils and crops.
- Use matched pairs to isolate effects of organic concentration from confounding factors.
- Combine empirical analyses with modelling across these scales and with social survey methods.

## Sub-systems and systems approach
- Recognizes farms cannot be treated in isolation; context (surrounding conventional practices, habitats, networks) influences outcomes.
- Identifies essential sub-systems (e.g., watershed, landscape) and studies their interactions and contributions to the overall system performance.
- Views change over time as a co-adaptive process among interacting sub-systems, allowing recursive application to smaller parts (e.g., farms within landscapes).

## Dimensions studied
- Biodiversity: birds, invertebrates, plants.
- Soil and land management: soil physical properties, tillage energy, soil infiltration rates, run-off, erosion, and nutrient transfer to downstream waters.
- Hydrology: water flows and flood/soil-water interactions.
- Socio-economic and cultural: farm economic flows, value added, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chain coordination, cross-farm social interactions, and farm family attitudes.
- Extra-focus: potential need for a critical mass to establish alternative supply networks and stimulate conversion.

## Methods and engagement
- Mixed qualitative and quantitative methods plus modelling.
- Nine integrated work packages organized around field surveys, hydrological and soil measurements, and social research.
- Field work includes fauna, flora, water flows, and soil quality; complemented by structured and open interviews in focal neighborhoods and the broader organic food chain.
- Uses participatory approaches (workshops) to support iterative learning among natural scientists, social scientists, and stakeholders.
- Develops scenarios for future development of the organic sector across local, regional, and national levels.

## Data, governance, and dissemination
- Emphasizes systems data integration, provenance, and metadata quality.
- Engages with dataset originators to fill gaps and improve metadata; acknowledges barriers to data sharing (openness, governance, up-to-date information).
- Combines field data with models and social data to construct and evaluate scenarios.
- Aims for outputs that inform policy and practice, with governance structures to support ongoing monitoring and data sharing where appropriate.

## Drivers, outcomes, and implications for monitoring
- Identifies drivers that influence the spatial density of land management practices and whether landscapes become organic- or conventional-dominated.
- Highlights scale-dependent effects on biodiversity, hydrology, and ecosystem services, stressing the need for indicators that operate across field, landscape, and national scales.
- Indicates potential social and economic trade-offs, such as local market competition in concentrated organic regions.
- Suggests that integrated, scale-aware indicators and robust data governance are essential to monitor policy impacts and to inform land-use planning and flood management.

## Outputs and impact
- Produces integrated analyses and scenario-based insights for local, regional, and national cases.
- Provides a framework for understanding how landscape configuration of organic farming shapes environmental and socio-economic outcomes.
- Supports the development of monitoring tools and governance processes that enable ongoing, transparent evaluation of organic farming policies and their broader social-ecological effects.
