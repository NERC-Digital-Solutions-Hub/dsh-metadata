# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Purpose and scope
  - An integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Aims to understand how uptake scale (field to landscape to national) influences impacts, and what drives the spatial concentration of organic farms.
  - Employs a systems approach across nested scales (field, farm, landscape) with matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting organic fractions.

- Data sources and domain coverage
  - Field surveys and measurements across multiple domains:
    - Biodiversity: birds, invertebrates, plants
    - Soil properties: physical properties, soil workings, tillage energy
    - Hydrology: water infiltration rates, runoff, soil erosion, nutrient transfer to downstream waters
    - Socio-economics and culture: farm economics, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chains, cross-farm interactions, farm family attitudes
  - Qualitative components:
    - Structured and open interviews in focal neighborhoods and the organic food chain
    - Participatory workshops and iterative learning with researchers and stakeholders
  - Modelling and scenario analyses to project future development of the organic sector

- Study design and scale considerations
  - Use of matched pairs of organic and conventional farms within landscapes that vary greatly in organic cultivation fractions
  - Examination of context-dependent effects: indirect protection from neighbours, landscape embedding of farming practices, and the necessity of spatio-temporal management variation
  - Investigation of whether a critical mass is needed to establish alternative supply networks and foster diffusion of organic farming

- Data governance, provenance, and interoperability (Data Stewards focus)
  - Data architecture must support multi-domain outputs (ecology, soil, hydrology, socio-economics, culture) with consistent formats and interoperable metadata
  - Documentation requirements:
    - Sampling design (paired landscapes)
    - Farm-level procedures
    - Measurement protocols
    - Provenance trails for traceability and re-use
  - Standardization and metadata
    - Grid-based indicators (hotspots/coldspots) require precise definitions, versioning, and reproducibility
  - Constraints and updates
    - Explicit handling of data constraints (disclosure risks, embargoes, proprietary issues)
    - Clear update plans for new rounds of data collection and extended analyses
  - Scale definitions and cross-study use
    - Clear articulation of spatial scales (field, farm, landscape, national) to support cross-study comparisons and governance
  - Data integration
    - Integration of diverse data sources (field measurements, maps, qualitative quotes) under interoperability guidelines and data-curation standards

- Project structure and collaboration
  - Nine integrated work packages combining quantitative and qualitative methods with modelling
  - Nested, landscape-level case studies with cross-disciplinary collaboration among natural and social scientists and stakeholders

- Practical implications for data stewardship
  - Emphasize robust metadata and versioning to ensure long-term reproducibility across scale- and landscape-based analyses
  - Maintain transparent documentation of sampling designs, protocols, and data processing steps for provenance and re-use
  - Develop interoperable data formats and controlled vocabularies to enable seamless data integration across ecological, hydrological, and socio-economic domains
  - Establish governance around data access, sharing, embargo periods, and updates to support ongoing monitoring and policy-relevant analysis

- Outcomes and relevance
  - Provides empirical and modelling evidence on how landscape-scale concentrations of organic farming influence biodiversity, soil hydrology, and socio-economic dynamics
  - Informs policy and farming practice about clustering, collaboration, market development, and networked approaches
  - Supports ongoing data collection and re-analysis at multiple scales, with potential for updated hotspot mappings and extended datasets as organic farming patterns evolve
