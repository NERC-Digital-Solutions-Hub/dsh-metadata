# Effects of Scale in Organic Agriculture, 2006-2010

- Integrated assessment across hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of organic farming.
- Scales studied range from field to landscape to national; uses matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting fractions of organic cultivation.
- Emphasizes a systems approach, acknowledging that farms cannot be studied in isolation and that context (surrounding conventional farming, landscape composition) influences outcomes.

## Aims and Key Questions

- Investigate two main questions:
  - What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms at different scales?
  - How do scale-dependent effects of different farm concentrations impact ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural outcomes?
- Explore how landscape-scale considerations, not just farm-scale practices, shape biodiversity, water dynamics, and rural communities.

## Methods and Data Scope

- Matched landscape design with focal organic and conventional growers on similar soils and crops.
- Data collected across nested scales: field, farm, and surrounding biophysical and social landscape; integrated with social surveys.
- Variables of interest include:
  - Ecological: bird, invertebrate, and plant biodiversity; soil physical properties; soil workability; tillage energy requirements; water infiltration and runoff.
  - Hydrological: infiltration rates and downstream nutrient transfer.
  - Socio-economic and cultural: farm economics, value added, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chains, cross-farm social interactions, and farm family attitudes.
- Analytical approach combines qualitative and quantitative methods with modelling and participatory workshops.
- Nine integrated work packages organized to develop scenarios for future organic sector development at local, regional, and national levels.

## Data Governance, Assets, and Platforms (Data Leaders Perspective)

- Data assets to support analysis and decision-making:
  - Hotspot maps of organic concentration (10x10 km grids).
  - Farm-level datasets: farm type (dairy/mixed), soil type, proximity, and field-level measurements (three winter cereals and three permanent pastures per farm).
  - Biodiversity indicators, soil hydrological properties, and hydrology data.
  - Farm economics, value chains, and marketing data.
- Data governance and collaboration:
  - Promote co-ownership of data products with participating farmers and network partners.
  - Prioritize data formats, metadata quality, discoverability, and timely updates.
  - Address access barriers (paywalls, data protection) and pursue open, standards-based sharing.
  - Build scalable data platforms to support cross-farm and cross-network collaboration, with links to policy colleagues and other stakeholders.
- Analytical pipelines and dissemination:
  - Develop reproducible workflows to analyze biodiversity, soil, and hydrology across hotspot and coldspot regions.
  - Translate scale-dependent findings into actionable insights for policy, land management, and farming communities.

## Practical Context and Stakeholders

- Farmers: insights into social dynamics, historical treatment, economic realities, and the role of local networks.
- Networks and services: importance of buying, processing, and distribution cooperatives to reduce transaction costs and speed diffusion of organic farming.
- Policy and practice: data-informed policy support and communities of practice to scale organic farming and biodiversity outcomes.

## Implications and Next Steps

- Research directions:
  - Expand analysis of scale effects to identify which species benefit from clustering of organic farms.
  - Assess potential cost-free biodiversity gains under broader adoption and strategies to maximize cooperative farming models.
  - Examine soil and hydrological pathways to inform flood mitigation and land-use planning.
- Policy and practice:
  - Encourage farmer collaboration to create habitat networks and landscape-scale biodiversity gains.
  - Align data-sharing practices with governance and privacy requirements to enable broader data-driven decision-making.
- Ongoing themes:
  - The importance of scale in ecological and socio-economic outcomes.
  - The need for integrated, cross-sector data platforms to support multi-disciplinary insights and collaboration.
