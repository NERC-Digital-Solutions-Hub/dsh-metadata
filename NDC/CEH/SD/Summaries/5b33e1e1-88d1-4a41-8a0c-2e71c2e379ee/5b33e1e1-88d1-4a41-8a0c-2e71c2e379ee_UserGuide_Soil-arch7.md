# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Aim and scope
  - Conduct an integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social and economic effects of land management, using organic farming as a case study.
  - Explore impacts across scales from field to landscape to national, using matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting fractions of organic cultivation.

- Why this matters for GIS specialists
  - Requires spatially explicit analysis across multiple scales to understand landscape context, connectivity, and hydrological implications.
  - Seeks to identify drivers of where organic farming concentrates and how those patterns translate into ecological and socio-economic outcomes, informing map-based decision support.

- Key questions
  - What influences the spatial concentration of organic farms at various scales?
  - How do ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts vary with landscape-scale patterns of organic farming?

- Context and relationships
  - Farms cannot be viewed in isolation; surrounding conventional farms can indirectly affect biodiversity and pest/weed dynamics.
  - Biodiversity benefits from organic farming may require larger, connected areas rather than isolated patches.
  - Landscape and watershed context influence hydrological outcomes, biodiversity, and socio-economic dynamics.

- Scales and landscape focus
  - Analyses span field, landscape, and national levels.
  - Emphasis on how management practices interact with landscape features (soil, landforms, crops) to shape outcomes.
  - Investigates whether there is a necessary “critical mass” of organic producers to drive network formation in supply chains and marketing.

- Systems approach and methods
  - Nine integrated work packages combining qualitative and quantitative methods.
  - Field surveys of fauna, flora, water flows and soil quality.
  - Structured and open interviews within focal neighbourhoods and the wider organic food chain.
  - Modelling and participatory workshops to develop and evaluate future development scenarios.
  - Nested analyses across local landscapes and broader biophysical and social contexts.

- Dimensions and outcomes studied
  - Ecological: biodiversity (birds, invertebrates, plants), soil physical properties, tillage energy, water infiltration, runoff, and downstream water quality.
  - Socio-economic and cultural: farm economic flows, value added, on-farm resource use, marketing choices, supply chain coordination, cross-farm social interactions, and farm families’ cultural attitudes.
  - Network and policy implications: potential for collective action, advisory networks, and the formation of processing/marketing cooperatives; economic viability and isolation effects when organic adoption is geographically concentrated or dispersed.

- Drivers and implications
  - Identifies drivers influencing the spatial density of land management practices (organic vs conventional) and whether landscapes will tilt toward organic- or conventional-dominated regimes.
  - Explores how local networks and social capital can lower barriers to conversion and diffusion of organic farming.

- Outputs and implications for GIS/data products
  - Framework for mapping landscape-scale patterns of organic farming concentration and associated ecological and socio-economic indicators.
  - Potential GIS layers include land use status (organic vs conventional), landscape-scale concentration, watershed and hydrology indicators, biodiversity proxies, soil properties, market networks, and social-interaction networks.
  - Scenario-based maps to visualize potential future developments under different spatial concentrations and network configurations.

- Takeaways and policy relevance
  - Landscape-scale considerations are critical for biodiversity, hydrology, and socio-economic outcomes; policies should promote multi-scale coordination rather than only farm-level changes.
  - Strengthening local organic producer networks and achieving sufficient spatial clustering may enhance ecological benefits while supporting livelihoods.
  - Understanding landscape context helps anticipate economic viability and inform targeted interventions, advisory services, and market development.

- Notable methodological note
  - The project adopts a systems view, recognizing interdependencies among watershed, landscape, farms, and social networks, with iterative learning through stakeholder engagement and scenario exploration.
