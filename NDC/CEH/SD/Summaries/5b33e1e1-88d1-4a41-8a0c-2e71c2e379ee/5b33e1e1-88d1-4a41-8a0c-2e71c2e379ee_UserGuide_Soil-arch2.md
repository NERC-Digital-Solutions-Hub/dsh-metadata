# RURAL ECONOMY AND LAND USE

- Problem context
  - Intensive agriculture is costly; farmland biodiversity loss is a major conservation concern; water use and agro-chemical run-off have economic and environmental costs.
  - Many UK farms are transitioning from conventional intensive practices to alternative land uses like organic farming.
  - The environmental and social effects of these changes depend on the scale of uptake and the scale at which they are assessed.

- Aims and scope
  - Conduct an integrated assessment of hydrological, environmental, social, and economic effects of land management using organic farming as a case study.
  - Investigate effects across scales from field to landscape to national level.
  - Use matched pairs of organic and conventional farms in landscapes with contrasting fractions of land under organic cultivation.

- Contextual considerations
  - Farms cannot be analysed in isolation; surrounding conventional farms can provide indirect protection or increase pest/weed pressures on organic farms.
  - Biodiversity benefits from organic farming may require landscape- or region-scale management rather than farm-scale efforts alone.
  - Hydrological and socioeconomic outcomes depend on landscape and watershed context; local networks and markets influence adoption more than technical feasibility alone.

- Key research questions
  - What drives the spatial concentration of organic farms at multiple scales?
  - What are the scale-dependent ecological, hydrological, socio-economic, and cultural impacts of different farm concentrations?

- Subjects of study
  - Biodiversity: birds, invertebrates, plants
  - Soil and hydrology: soil physical properties, tillage energy requirements, water infiltration, runoff, erosion, nutrient transfer to downstream waters
  - Socio-economic and cultural: farm economics, on-farm resource use, marketing and supply chains, cross-farm interactions, and farm family attitudes

- Hypotheses and outcomes
  - Investigate whether a critical mass is required to establish supply networks that promote organic conversion.
  - Identify drivers of spatial density of land management practices and whether landscapes become predominantly organic or conventional.

- Methodology and approach
  - Systems approach with essential sub-systems (e.g., watershed, landscape) and their interactions.
  - Nested spatial scales: field, farm, landscape, and broader socio-biophysical contexts.
  - Mixed methods: empirical analyses, modelling, qualitative social surveys, and participatory workshops.
  - Nine integrated work packages; field surveys of fauna, flora, water flows, and soil quality complemented by structured and open interviews.

- Outputs and framing
  - Scenarios for future development of the organic sector across local, regional, and national cases.
  - Evaluation of how spatial concentration affects human and biophysical environments.
  - Data and modelling outputs to inform landscape-scale policy and farm-management recommendations.

- Implications for policy and practice
  - Emphasizes networks, information sharing, and market coordination to maximize environmental and socio-economic benefits of scale.
  - Highlights potential trade-offs: local competition among organic producers may reduce profits; social networks can reduce transaction costs and accelerate diffusion of organic farming.

- Data, monitoring, and dissemination
  - A systems-based, multi-scale analysis combining qualitative and quantitative methods with stakeholder participation.
  - Integrated data framework to support policy evaluation and environmental monitoring at multiple scales.
  - Notable dissemination includes peer-reviewed articles, policy-relevant briefs, and media coverage.

- Who conducts the work
  - University of Sussex and collaborators; project integrates ecological, hydrological, social, and economic sub-systems to inform landscape-scale policy and practice.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring analysts
  - Demonstrates a multi-scale, data-driven framework to assess environmental health and policy performance across scales.
  - Supports standardized data collection, integration, and sharing to enable scrutiny of ecological, hydrological, and socio-economic outcomes.
  - Highlights the importance of context, networks, and market structures in interpreting environmental data and policy impacts.
