# Supporting information

## Overview
- Dataset of nutrient concentrations (mg/L) for nitrate, silica, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) from Blelham Tarn.
- Sampling locations include the main buoy at 1 m depth and inflows/outflows: Wray Beck (inflow), Blelham Beck (outflow), Fish Pond Beck (inflow), and Ford Wood Beck (inflow).
- Collected monthly across two periods: June–December 2016 and January–December 2017.
- SRP analyzed by Emma Gray; nitrate, silica, TN, and TP analyzed by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster).

## Sampling design and scope
- Spatial coverage: lake surface site plus four inflow/outflow sites around Blelham Tarn.
- Temporal coverage: over 2 years with monthly sampling, enabling temporal trend assessment and site comparisons.
- Data collection performed for a defined project (NEC05744).

## Analytical procedures
- Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
  - Field filtration (47 mm GF/C) and colorimetric analysis.
  - Antimony-phospho-molybdate complex formation, reduced with ascorbic acid; read at 880 nm.
  - Calibration with known SRP standards (50 µg/L) and QC stock (working AQC at 10 µg/L diluted from 50 µg/L).
- Total Phosphorus (TP)
  - Potassium persulfate digestion with H2SO4, followed by colorimetric molybdenum blue.
  - Unfiltered samples digested; analysis with SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser.
  - Calibration curve with blanks; data corrected by blank means.
- Total Nitrogen (TN)
  - Acidification with HCl, purge to remove inorganic carbon, measurement with Shalar Formacs CA16 (ND25).
- Nitrate
  - Ion chromatography after filtration (Whatman cellulose acetate 0.45 µm).
  - Instrument: Dionex ICS2100; QC samples every 10 samples.
- Silica
  - Colorimetric method using ammonium molybdate, reduction with ascorbic acid to form silicomolybenum blue.
  - Absorbance read at 880 nm; background corrected using blanks.

## Data structure and contents
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Site (name of inflows, outflow, or lake), nitrate (mg/L), silica (mg/L), total nitrogen (mg/L), total phosphorus (mg/L), soluble reactive phosphorus (mg/L).

## Data provenance and quality
- Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.
- QA/QC procedures embedded in procedures (calibration curves, blanks, field filtration, and QC samples) to ensure accuracy and traceability.
- Analytes consistently measured with documented laboratory methods and instrumentation.
