# BLEL_nutrient_profiles.csv

## Overview
- Nutrient concentrations measured in Blelham Tarn at the main buoy (deepest point, 14.5 m) during June–October 2016 (monthly sampling).
- Parameters: Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP), Nitrate, Silica, Total Nitrogen (TN), Total Phosphorus (TP).
- SRP measured at every metre in the water column (1–13 m); Nitrate, Silica, TN, and TP measured at 1 m, 4 m, 7 m, 10 m, and 13 m.
- Analyses conducted by Emma Gray (SRP) and the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster) for the other nutrients.

## Data structure
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m; 1–13), SRP (mg/L), Silica (mg/L), TN (mg/L), TP (mg/L).

## Analytical procedures
- Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP): Field filtration (47 mm GF/C), colorimetric analysis using ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate in acid; blue complex read at 880 nm. Calibration with standards; quality control via a 50 µg/L stock diluted to 10 µg/L.
- Total Phosphorus (TP): Potassium persulphate digestion followed by colorimetric molybdenum blue; unfiltered water digested and measured; calibration curve and blank corrections.
- Total Nitrogen (TN): Acidification with HCl, purge to remove inorganic carbon, measurement with Shalar Formacs CA16 (ND25).
- Nitrate: Ion chromatography; samples filtered (0.45 µm) and analyzed with a Dionex ICS2100; QC samples every 10 samples.
- Silica: Colorimetric method using ammonium molybdate reduced with ascorbic acid to form silicomolybdenum blue; measured at 880 nm; blanks used for background correction.

## Sampling details
- Location: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, North West England; buoy at deepest point (14.5 m) as per bathymetry from Ramsbottom (1976).
- Temporal coverage: June–October 2016; monthly sampling schedule.
- Data collection structure: SRP measured at all depths (1–13 m); other nutrients at depths 1, 4, 7, 10, and 13 m.

## Data quality and provenance
- Data collected by Emma Gray; chemical analyses conducted by CEH chemistry department (Lancaster).
- Clear documentation of analytical methods, calibration, and QA steps to enable reproducibility and cross-dataset integration.
- Reference depth context provided via Ramsbottom (1976) depth charts.

## Limitations and considerations for analysts
- Local-scale measurement from a single buoy; may not represent broader lake or watershed.
- Five-month window in 2016; limited temporal coverage for long-term trends.
- Depth resolution varies by nutrient (continuous 1–13 m for SRP vs. selective depths for other nutrients).
- Documentation of QA/QC aids reliability; integration with other datasets should consider consistency of units, calibration practices, and sample handling.
