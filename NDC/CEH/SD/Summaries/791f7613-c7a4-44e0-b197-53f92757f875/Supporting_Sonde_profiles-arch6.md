# Supporting information

- File: BLEL_Sonde_profiles.csv
- Collected by: Emma Gray for the project NEC05744
- Instrument: YSI EXO2 sonde
- Site: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, NW England; monitoring buoy at the lake’s deepest point (14.5 m)
- Sampling frequency and period: Weekly profiles during stratified period (May/June–November) and fortnightly or monthly outside of this period in 2016–2017
- Calibration and QA: Sensors calibrated at least every six weeks per manufacturer specifications
- Parameters measured (profiles recorded at 0.5 m depth intervals): 
  - Chlorophyll a (µg/L) via fluorescence
  - Phycocyanin (µg/L) via fluorescence (not quality checked)
  - Water temperature (°C)
  - Conductivity (µS/cm)
  - Specific conductivity (µS/cm)
  - Oxygen saturation (%)
  - Oxygen (mg/L)
  - pH
  - Depth (m): raw measurement and depth rounded to 0.5 m
- Data quality notes:
  - Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements compared to chemically determined chlorophyll with R² = 0.56 (p < 0.05), indicating a moderate positive relationship
  - Phycocyanin data not quality checked
- Data structure (columns in the dataset):
  - Date (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Chlorophyll a (µg/L)

  - Water temperature (°C)
  - Conductivity (µS/cm)
  - Specific conductivity (µS/cm)
  - Oxygen (% saturation)
  - Oxygen (mg/L)
