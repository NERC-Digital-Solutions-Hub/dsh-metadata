# Supporting information

- Dataset: BLEL_nutrient_profiles.csv, collected by Emma Gray for NEC05744.
- Purpose: Describe concentrations of key nutrients (SRP, Silica, TN, TP) with depth at Blelham Tarn to enable analysis of vertical profiles over time.

## Data Coverage

- Timeframe: June–October 2016 (monthly sampling).
- Location: Blelham Tarn, main buoy at the deepest point (14.5 m).
- Depths: SRP measured from 1 m to 13 m; Silica, TN, TP measured at 1 m, 4 m, 7 m, 10 m, and 13 m.
- Variables (units): Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m), SRP (mg/L), Silica (mg/L), TN (mg/L), TP (mg/L).

## Data Collection & Handling

- SRP: Field filtration (47 mm GF/C) and colourimetric analysis using ammonium molybdate/antimony tartrate in acid; read at 880 nm. Calibration with standards (10–100 µg/L); QA solution (AQC) at 50 µg/L diluted to 10 µg/L for checks.
- TP: Potassium persulphate digestion followed by molybdenum blue colourimetric analysis; unfiltered water digested; SEAL AQ2 analyser; blanks used for correction.
- TN: Acidification with HCl, purge to remove inorganic carbon, measured with Shalar Formacs CA16 (ND25).
- Nitrate: Ion chromatography (Dionex ICS2100); samples filtered (Whatman cellulose acetate 0.45 µm); QC across 10 intervals.
- Silica: Colourimetric method using ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid; silicomolybdenum blue measured at 880 nm; background correction used.

## Data Structure

- Fields: Date, Depth, SRP (mg/L), Silica (mg/L), TN (mg/L), TP (mg/L).

## Quality and Validation

- Calibrations and standard curves used for all colourimetric assays.
- QA/QC procedures include running QA solutions and blank corrections to ensure accuracy.

## Potential Uses for Data Support

- Data cleaning, harmonisation with other datasets, and verification across formats.
- Creation of self-service tools (dashboards, pivot tables, charts) to explore nutrient profiles by depth and month.
- Prototyping and sharing outputs to encourage reuse; informing better data creation and documentation practices.
