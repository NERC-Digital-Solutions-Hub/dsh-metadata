# BLEL_Sonde_profiles.csv

## Overview
- Supporting information file for the NEC05744 project, collected by Emma Gray.
- Uses a YSI EXO2 sonde to record vertical profiles of water quality parameters in Blelham Tarn.
- Profiles taken at the monitoring buoy located at the lake’s deepest point.

## Location and Instrumentation
- Lake: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, North West England.
- Monitoring buoy position: deepest point in the lake (~14.5 m).
- Instrument: YSI EXO2 sonde.

## Parameters Collected
- Chlorophyll a (µg/L) determined by fluorescence measurements.
- Phycocyanin (µg/L) determined by fluorescence (not quality checked).
- Water temperature (°C).
- Conductivity (µS/cm).
- Specific conductivity (µS/cm).
- Oxygen saturation (%).
- Oxygen (mg/L).
- pH.
- Depth: raw (m) and depth rounded to 0.5 m.

## Sampling Details
- Frequency: weekly during the stratified period (May/June to November) and fortnightly or monthly outside this period.
- Sampling period: 2016 and 2017.
- Depth resolution: 0.5 m intervals in the water column.

## Data Structure
- Columns include: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Chlorophyll a (µg/L, fluorescence), Phycocyanin (µg/L, fluorescence; not QC), Temperature (°C), Conductivity (µS/cm), Specific conductivity (µS/cm), Oxygen saturation (%), Oxygen (mg/L), pH, Depth (raw, m), Depth (rounded, m).

## Calibration and Quality
- Sensors calibrated at least every six weeks per manufacturer specifications.
- Chlorophyll a fluorescence measurements compared to chemically determined chlorophyll, with R² = 0.56 (p < 0.05), indicating a moderate correlation.
- Phycocyanin measurements not quality-checked.

## Data Availability and Limitations
- Data may be limited by seasonal sampling frequency and the 2016–2017 window.
- Phycocyanin data lack quality checks.
- Fluorescence-based chlorophyll estimates show only a moderate correlation with chemical determinations.
- Depth data include both raw measurements and 0.5 m rounded values.
