# BLEL_Secchi.csv

## Overview
- Supporting information file describing Secchi depth measurements at Blelham Tarn.
- Collected by Emma Gray for the project NEC05744.
- Site: main buoy at Blelham Tarn (deepest point 14.5 m).
- Purpose: provide a measure of water transparency for environmental health monitoring.

## Data details
- Variable collected: Secchi depth (meters).
- Data structure: Date (dd/mm/yyyy) and Secchi depth (m).

## Sampling regime
- Timeframe: 2016 and 2017.
- Frequency:
  - Weekly during the stratified period (May to early November).
  - Fortnightly to monthly outside of this period.

## Equipment
- Secchi disk: oceanographic, all white.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Contributes a key transparency metric that supports assessment of lake water quality and eutrophication risk.
- Useful for trend analysis and informing policy decisions on environmental health measures.

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Metadata is minimal; ensure comprehensive metadata for long-term reuse (sampling methods, time zone, coordinating units, QA/QC procedures).
- Data sharing and openness should be planned, with clear provenance and versioning.
- Consider data standardization and integration with other datasets (e.g., turbidity, chlorophyll) for broader monitoring insights.

## Practical considerations for use
- Applicable for detecting temporal changes in water clarity and potential environmental pressure.
- Limited to 2016–2017 and to the main buoy at a single depth point; caution in extrapolating beyond these constraints.
- Clear data structure facilitates incorporation into dashboards or reports for decision-making.
