- File: BLEL_nutrient_profiles.csv
- Collected by: Emma Gray for the project NEC05744
- Purpose: Concentrations of nutrients (SRP, nitrate, silica, TN, TP) in Blelham Tarn
- Monitoring point: Main buoy at the deepest point (14.5 m)
- Monitoring period: Monthly sampling from June to October 2016
- Data collection details:
  - SRP measured at every metre from 1 m to 13 m
  - Nitrate, Silica, Total Nitrogen, and Total Phosphorus measured at 1 m, 4 m, 7 m, 10 m, and 13 m
- Data structure (columns):
  - Date (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Depth (m) [1–13 m; 1 m is near surface, 13 m deepest]
  - SRP (mg/L)
  - Silica (mg/L)
  - Total Nitrogen (mg/L)
  - Total Phosphorus (mg/L)

- Analytical procedures:
  - Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP):
    - Field filtration through 47 mm GF/C filter
    - Colourimetric determination using ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate in acidic medium
    - Blue complex read at 880 nm via spectrophotometer
    - Calibration with standards (50 µg/L; diluted to 10–100 µg/L)
    - Quality control: an AQC solution (50 µg/L) diluted to 10 µg/L for comparison
  - Total Phosphorus (TP):
    - Potassium persulphate digestion followed by colourimetric molybdenum blue
    - Unfiltered water digested, then measured with SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser
    - Calibration alongside blanks
  - Total Nitrogen (TN):
    - Acidification with HCl, purge to remove inorganic carbon, then measurement with Shalar Formacs CA16 (ND25)
  - Nitrate:
    - Ion chromatography (filtered samples through Whatman 0.45 µm filters; Dionex ICS2100)
    - QC samples included at 10 sample intervals
  - Silica:
    - Colourimetric method using ammonium molybdate, reduced with ascorbic acid to form silicomolybdenum blue
    - Colour read at 880 nm
    - Background corrected using blanks

- Location context:
  - Figure 1 describes Blelham Tarn’s location in the Lake District (NW England) with the monitoring buoy at the deepest point (14.5 m) based on Ramsbottom (1976) bathymetry
