# Supporting information

## Overview
- Light profiles (μmol s-1 m-2) were collected at the main buoy located at the deepest point (14.5 m) of Blelham Tarn, Lake District, NW England.
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
- Collected in 2016 and 2017, weekly during the stratified period (May to early November) and then fortnightly to monthly outside this period.

## Data details for GIS use
- File type: CSV (BLEL_Light.csv).
- Data columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m), Light (μmol s-1 m-2).
- Depth convention: 0 m is just below the water surface; -9 m is the deepest measurement.
- Light unit equivalence provided: 1 μmol s-1 m-2 = 6.022 x 10^17 photons s-1 m-2.

## Spatial and temporal context
- Spatial location: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, NW England.
- Observation point: monitoring buoy at the lake’s deepest point (14.5 m).
- Bathymetric reference: Ramsbottom (1976) depth charts for the lake.

## Instrumentation and procedure
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
- Measurement protocol: Light recorded just below the surface, then at 1 m intervals down to 9 m, on the shaded side of the boat; sensor held at maximum arm length away from the boat.

## Data structure and metadata
- Structure: Date, Depth, Light.
- Temporal coverage: 2016–2017 with seasonal sampling cadence as described above.
- Data provenance: Collected by Emma Gray for the NEC05744 project.

## GIS-relevant notes and potential uses
- Suitable for creating depth-profile light attenuation visuals in combination with lake bathymetry.
- Can be integrated with other spatial datasets to map temporal changes in underwater light regimes.
- Useful for analyses comparing light availability across depths and time, or for informing ecological or limnological models.
