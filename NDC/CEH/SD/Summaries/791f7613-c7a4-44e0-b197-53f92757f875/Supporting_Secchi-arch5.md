# Supporting information

## Overview
- File: BLEL_Secchi.csv
- Collected by: Emma Gray
- Project: NEC05744
- Purpose: Secchi depths (m) at the main buoy of Blelham Tarn (deepest point 14.5 m)

## Data content and structure
- Data fields: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Secchi depth (m)
- Instrument: Oceanographic Secchi disk (all white)

## Temporal coverage and sampling regime
- Study period: 2016 and 2017
- Stratified period sampling: weekly during May to early November
- Outside stratified period sampling: fortnightly to monthly

## Location and measurement context
- Location: main buoy at Blelham Tarn
- Depth reference: deepest point 14.5 m

## Provenance and metadata
- Data creator and project context provided (Emma Gray, NEC05744)
- Metadata captures date format, measurement unit (meters), and instrument used

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Potential metadata gaps: no explicit coordinates, uncertainty estimates, or data validation steps described
- Important governance actions for stewardship:
  - Ensure consistent metadata (date format, units, instrument, location)
  - Document data provenance and project linkage
  - Note sampling cadence changes and period-specific coverage
  - Clarify any embargoes, updates, or future data availability
  - Plan for interoperability considerations if integrating with other datasets (e.g., adding coordinates or depth reference details)
