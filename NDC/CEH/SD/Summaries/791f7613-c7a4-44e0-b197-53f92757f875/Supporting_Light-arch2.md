## BLEL_Light.csv overview
- Collected by: Emma Gray for project NEC05744
- Purpose: Light profiles (μmol s⁻¹ m⁻²) at the main buoy in Blelham Tarn to characterize underwater light environment
- Depths: Measurements from just below surface (0 m) to 9 m depth; deepest measurement at -9 m
- Location: Main buoy at deepest point of Blelham Tarn (14.5 m); Figure 1 shows location and bathymetry

## Instrument and procedure
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor
- Procedure: Light recorded just below surface, then at 1 m intervals to 9 m depth on the shaded side of the boat; sensor kept at maximum arm’s length from the boat

## Sampling schedule
- Stratified period (May–early November): weekly sampling
- Outside stratified period: fortnightly to monthly sampling
- Periods covered: 2016 and 2017

## Data structure and units
- Data fields: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m) with 0 m as surface and -9 m as deepest measurement, Light (μmol s⁻¹ m⁻²)
- Unit note: 1 μmol s⁻¹ m⁻² = 6.022 × 10^17 photons s⁻¹ m⁻²

## Relevance to environment-monitoring analysis
- Provides standardized light-availability data across depths and times for the main buoy
- Supports assessment of underwater light climate relevant to ecological health and depth-related processes
- Data quality considerations include clearly defined depth conventions, sampling cadence, and explicit units

## Data handling considerations (for analysts)
- Emphasize documentation of data provenance (collector, period, instrument)
- Ensure data are stored in appropriate data portals and made accessible for reuse
- Acknowledge temporal gaps (2016–2017, limited outside stratified periods) when integrating with longer-term datasets
