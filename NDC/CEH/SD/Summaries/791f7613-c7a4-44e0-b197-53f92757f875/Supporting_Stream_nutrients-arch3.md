## Overview
- Nutrient concentrations (nitrate, silica, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus) measured at the main buoy (1 m depth) and at inflows/outflows (Wray Beck inflow, Blelham Beck outflow, Fish Pond Beck inflow, Ford Wood Beck inflow) of Blelham Tarn.
- Sampling months: June–December 2016 and January–December 2017.
- Analyses conducted by: Emma Gray (SRP); UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster) for TP, TN, nitrate, silica.

## Sampling design
- Spatial coverage includes the lake and its identified inflows and outflow.
- Temporal coverage spans two calendar years with monthly sampling.

## Analytes (units)
- Nitrate (mg/L)
- Silica (mg/L)
- Total Nitrogen (mg/L)
- Total Phosphorus (mg/L)
- Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (mg/L)

## Analytical procedures
- Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
  - Field filtration through 47 mm GF/C; colorimetric determination.
  - Antimony-phospho-molybdate complex formation, reduced with ascorbic acid; measured at 880 nm.
  - Calibration curve with standards 10–100 µg/L; quality control using a 50 µg/L standard diluted to 10 µg/L.
- Total Phosphorus (TP)
  - Potassium persulphate digestion with acid digestion, colorimetric molybdenum blue.
  - Unfiltered water digested; measured with SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser.
  - Calibration with prepared standards; data corrected by blanks.
- Total Nitrogen (TN)
  - Acidify with HCl, purge inorganic carbon, measure with SHALAR Formacs CA16 (ND25).
- Nitrate
  - Ion chromatography after filtering (Whatman cellulose acetate 0.45 µm); Dionex ICS2100.
  - Precision checked with QC samples at 10 sampling intervals.
- Silica
  - Colorimetric method using ammonium molybdate; reduced with ascorbic acid to form silicomolybenum blue.
  - Read at 880 nm; blanks used to correct background.

## Data structure
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Site (inflow/outflow/lake name), nitrate, silica, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, soluble reactive phosphorus (all in mg/L).
