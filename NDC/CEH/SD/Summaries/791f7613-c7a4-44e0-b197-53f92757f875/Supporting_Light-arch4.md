# BLEL_Light.csv

## Overview
- Light profiles (μmol s⁻¹ m⁻²) collected at the main buoy of Blelham Tarn (deepest point: 14.5 m).
- Timeframe: 2016 and 2017.
- Sampling frequency: weekly during the stratified period (May–early November); fortnightly to monthly outside that period.

## What and where
- Location: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, NW England.
- Monitoring buoy placed at the lake’s deepest point (14.5 m). Bathymetry referenced from Ramsbottom (1976).

## Instrument
- LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.

## Sampling procedure
- Light recorded just below the surface, then at 1 m intervals down to 9 m depth.
- Measurements taken away from the shaded side of the boat; sensor held at maximum arm length from the boat.

## Data structure and units
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m) (0 m = surface; -9 m = deepest), Light (μmol s⁻¹ m⁻²).
- Unit conversion note: 1 μmol s⁻¹ m⁻² equals 6.022 × 10¹⁷ photons s⁻¹ m⁻².

## Metadata and provenance
- Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.
- Figure 1 demonstrates location; data reference: Ramsbottom (1976) for depth charts.

## Data quality and limitations
- Depth measurements cover surface to -9 m, with discrete depth intervals (1 m steps).
- Sampling frequency varies seasonally, leading to potential temporal gaps outside the stratified period.
- No explicit data quality flags or calibration details provided beyond the instrument type and procedure.

## Context for data governance
- Data are structured with clear temporal and vertical dimensions, enabling aggregation by date or depth.
- Provenance and instrument documentation are available, supporting discoverability and reuse.
- Potential considerations for data leadership: ensure continued metadata completeness, consider broader seasonal sampling, and integrate with related datasets to improve system-wide data utility and cross-partner collaboration.
