# Supporting information

## Overview
- Supplementary file detailing phytoplankton counts for the BLEL project (BLEL_Phytoplankton_counts.csv), collected by Emma Gray for NEC05744.
- Water samples collected from the lake at depths 1–6 m during weekly sampling from June to November 2016 for taxonomic identification.
- Counts conducted with PlanktoMetriX (PMX) software to identify species and calculate biovolume; 142 phytoplankton species identified in the broader dataset; biovolume calculations follow European standard guidance (CEN 2014).

## Methods and workflow
- Sample handling: water samples preserved with Lugols iodine, stored in dark bottles, and kept cool to minimize evaporation; periodically topped up as needed.
- Analysis: PMX software used to count and measure organisms in the 1–1000 µm size range; measurements in 3 x 100 mL cylinders, with settlement to obtain a final sample.
- Taxonomic reference: a PMX database built from 2011–2015 data to identify species common to Blelham Tarn; sub-sampling from 1 m depth to identify species and determine ten measurements per species.
- Biovolume calculation: species-specific geometric shapes and equations assigned based on CEN 2014 guidance.
- Counting protocol: random fields of view in a Lund chamber; larger phytoplankton counted at x100, nanophytoplankton at x400; 100 fields of view counted at each magnification; counts limited to 100 individuals per species before stopping.

## Data contents and structure
- Data fields include: Sampling date, depth (1–6 m), Species name, AvX (mean x-dimension, µm), AvY (mean y-dimension, µm), AvZ (mean z-dimension, µm), Biovolume (µm³/mL).
- Measurements for AvX, AvY, AvZ are means derived from 10 measurements per species.

## Tools, standards and references
- Software: PlanktoMetrix (PMX) used for counting and measuring plankton.
- Equipment: Olympus BX45 inverted microscope; Lund counting chamber.
- Standards: CEN (2014) guidance on estimation of phytoplankton biovolume; methodological references include Lund (1959) for counting chambers and PMX validation (Zohary et al., 2016).

## Location and context
- Study site: Blelham Tarn, located in the Lake District, NW England.
- Monitoring buoy positioned at the deepest point of the lake (14.5 m); bathymetry referenced from Ramsbottom (1976).

## Data provenance and governance implications
- Data collected as part of an ongoing monitoring effort; integrates new measurements with a pre-existing database (2011–2015) to identify species and standardize biovolume calculations.
- Use of standardized counting and biovolume estimation methods facilitates comparability and potential data sharing within monitoring frameworks.

## Key takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- Emphasizes standardized, reproducible methods for organism counting and biovolume estimation, aligned with published guidance.
- Demonstrates integration of long-term historical data with new measurements to improve species identification and biovolume calculations.
- Highlights the importance of metadata and documentation (sampling dates, depths, species, dimensions, biovolume) to ensure data usability and transparency.
- Provides a detailed, transparent counting protocol (field-of-view method, magnification choices, and stopping criteria) to support data quality and comparability across studies.
