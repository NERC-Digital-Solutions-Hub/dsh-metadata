- Purpose and scope
  - Nutrient concentrations (mg/L) measured in Blelham Tarn to monitor environmental health over time.
  - Parameters: nitrate, silica, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP).

- Sampling sites and period
  - Main buoy at 1 m depth (lake center) and inflows/outflows: Wray Beck (inflow), Blelham Beck (outflow), Fish Pond Beck (inflow), Ford Wood Beck (inflow).
  - Location: Blelham Tarn.
  - Sampling frequency: monthly from June–December 2016 and January–December 2017.

- Data collection and analysts
  - Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.
  - SRP analysis performed by Emma Gray.
  - TN, TP, nitrate, silica analyses performed by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster).

- Analytical procedures (key methods)
  - Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
    - Field filtration (47 mm GF/C); colorimetric determination.
    - Formation of antimony-phospho-molybdate complex; reduced with ascorbic acid; measured at 880 nm.
    - Calibration: standards up to 100 µg/L; QC solution prepared from a 50 µg/L stock diluted to 10 µg/L for quality control.
  - Total Phosphorus (TP)
    - Potassium persulfate digestion; molybdenum blue colorimetric detection.
    - Unfiltered water digested; measured with SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser.
    - Calibration and blank corrections applied.
  - Total Nitrogen (TN)
    - Acidification with HCl; purge to remove inorganic carbon; measurement with SHalar Formacs CA16 (ND25).
  - Nitrate
    - Ion chromatography; samples filtered (Whatman cellulose acetate 0.45 µm).
    - Analysis with Dionex ICS2100; QA using QC samples at intervals.
  - Silica
    - Colorimetric method using ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid to form silicomolybdenum blue.
    - Read at 880 nm; blanks used to correct background.

- Data structure and output
  - Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Site (inflow, outflow, or lake), nitrate (mg/L), silica (mg/L), total nitrogen (mg/L), total phosphorus (mg/L), soluble reactive phosphorus (mg/L).
