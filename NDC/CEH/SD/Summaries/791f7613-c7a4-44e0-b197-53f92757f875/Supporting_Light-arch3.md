# BLEL_Light.csv

- Overview
  - Light profiles (μmol s-1 m-2) collected at the main buoy of Blelham Tarn, at the deepest point (~14.5 m).
  - Timeframe: weekly measurements during the stratified period (May–early November) in 2016 and 2017, then fortnightly to monthly outside this period.

- Collection and purpose
  - Collected by Emma Gray for the NEC05744 project.
  - Aimed at capturing vertical light profiles to inform understanding of the lake’s light environment.

- Instrument and method
  - Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
  - Procedure: Light recorded just below the surface and at 1 m intervals down to 9 m, on the shaded side of the boat; sensor held at the maximum arm length away from the boat to minimize shading.

- Data structure and units
  - Fields: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m) with 0 m just below surface and -9 m as the deepest measurement, Light (μmol s-1 m-2).
  - Units note: 1 μmol s-1 m-2 equals 6.022 x 10^17 photons s-1 m-2.

- Location context and references
  - Location: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, northwest England (Figure 1 referenced in the file).
  - Monitoring buoy positioned at the deepest point (14.5 m).
  - Bathymetry reference: Ramsbottom (1976).

- Data provenance and references
  - Supporting information for the dataset; primary reference cited: Ramsbottom, A. (1976) Depth charts of the Cumbrian lakes, Freshwater Biological Association, Kendal.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a structured, time-resolved dataset of underwater light with explicit sampling depth, date, and measurement values.
  - Clear documentation of instrument, procedure, and units supports data quality assessment and comparability.
  - Temporal cadence (weekly to monthly) and depth coverage (0 to -9 m) offer a basis for assessing changes in the lake’s photic environment during different seasons.

- Data governance and metadata considerations
  - Metadata included (instrument type, sampling depths, units, and data structure), but additional metadata (e.g., calibration details, data flags, cloud cover, turbidity) could enhance data usability.
  - As a piece of supporting information, clarity on data access and sharing policies would aid reproducibility and reuse within monitoring programs.
