# BLEL_Phytoplankton_counts.csv

## Overview
- Supporting information for phytoplankton counts from Blelham Tarn, collected in 2016 (weekly June–November).
- Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.
- Data used for taxonomic identification, biovolume estimation, and monitoring of environmental health.

## Sampling and Sample Handling
- Water samples collected at 1–6 m depth from the automated monitoring buoy (deepest point, ~14.5 m).
- Preservation: Lugols iodine added in dark bottles (2.5 ml) prior to sampling.
- Laboratory storage: cool room, darkness, constant temperature, and evaporation checks with topping up if needed.

## Laboratory Analysis and Counting
- Phytoplankton counted with PlanktoMetriX (PMX) software (image analysis system for 1–1000 µm organisms).
- PMX database created from 2011–2015 data to identify species common to Blelham Tarn.
- Counting uses an Olympus BX45 inverted microscope with Lund chambers; larger taxa at 100x, nanophytoplankton at 400x.
- Counting protocol: random fields of view in known-area/volume chamber; 100 fields at 100x and 100 fields at 400x per sample; 50% visibility rule for inclusion; cap of 100 individuals per count before continuing beyond that threshold.

## Data Collected
- For each sample: sampling date, depth (1–6 m), species name, AvX (µm), AvY (µm), AvZ (µm), Biovolume (µm³/mL).
- Measurements (AvX, AvY, AvZ) are mean values from 10 measurements per species.

## Species Identification and Biovolume Calculation
- 142 phytoplankton species identified in the dataset.
- Species identification guided by CEN (2014) for biovolume estimation.
- Geometric shapes and equations assigned to each species to compute biovolume.
- Biovolume applied to samples from 1–5 m using the sub-sample approach to identify species and then extrapolated.

## Data Quality and Processing
- Prior to analysis, a PMX-based database integrated historical counts (2011–2015) to ensure consistent species identification.
- Sub-sampling from 1 m streamlines species identification and increases counting efficiency.
- Final datasets include species-level counts, dimensions, and calculated biovolumes to support standardized environmental monitoring outputs.
