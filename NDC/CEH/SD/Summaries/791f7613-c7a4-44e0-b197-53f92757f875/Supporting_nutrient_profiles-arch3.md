- Purpose and scope
  - Presents nutrient concentration data collected at the main buoy (depth 14.5 m) of Blelham Tarn.
  - Sampling occurred monthly from June to October 2016.
  - SRP analyses performed by Emma Gray; nitrate, silica, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus analyses performed by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster).

- Data collected and structure
  - Variables: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m; 1m to 13m), SRP (mg/L), Silica (mg/L), Total Nitrogen (mg/L), Nitrate (mg/L), Total Phosphorus (mg/L).
  - Sampling depths:
    - Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP): at every metre from 1 m to 13 m.
    - Nitrate, Silica, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus: at 1 m, 4 m, 7 m, 10 m, and 13 m.
  - Location: main buoy at the deepest point of Blelham Tarn.
  - Data source and authorship: collected by Emma Gray; analyses conducted by CEH (Lancaster).

- Analytical procedures
  - Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
    - Field filtration (47 mm GF/C) and colourimetric analysis.
    - Technique: ammonium molybdate and antimony potassium tartrate in acid medium form antimony-phospho-molybdate, reduced with ascorbic acid; read at 880 nm.
    - Calibration: standards from 10–100 µg/L; additional 50 µg/L stock used as QC (AQC) diluted to 10 µg/L.
  - Total Phosphorus (TP)
    - Digestion with potassium persulphate and acid, followed by colourimetric molybdenum blue analysis.
    - Instrument: SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser; calibration with matching digested standards and blanks correction.
  - Total Nitrogen (TN)
    - Acidification with HCl, purge to remove inorganic carbon, measurement with Shalar Formacs CA16 (ND25).
  - Nitrate
    - Ion chromatography: filtration through 0.45 µm cellulose acetate filters; analysis with a Dionex ICS2100 IC.
    - QC: included at 10 sample intervals.
  - Silica
    - Colorimetric method: ammonium molybdate reaction with ascorbic acid reduction to form silicomolybdenum blue.
    - Read at 880 nm; background correction using blanks.
