## Overview
- Nutrient concentrations (mg/L) for nitrate, silica, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), and soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) collected from Blelham Tarn.
- Sampling locations: main buoy at 1 m depth; inflows/outflows at Wray Beck (inflow), Blelham Beck (outflow), Fish Pond Beck (inflow), and Ford Wood Beck (inflow).
- Sampling frequency: monthly from June–December 2016 and January–December 2017.
- Analyte responsibilities: SRP analyzed in-field by Emma Gray; nitrate, silica, TN, and TP analyzed by the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology chemistry department (Lancaster).

## Sampling details
- Site information: Date, Site (inflows, outflow, or lake), and nutrient concentrations.
- Temporal coverage: 2016 and 2017.
- Data file context: Associated map (Fig.1) shows inflows and outflows around Blelham Tarn.

## Analytical procedures
- Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP)
  - Filtration in the field (47 mm GF/C) and colorimetric analysis.
  - Antimony-phospho-molybdate complex formation, reduced with ascorbic acid; measured at 880 nm.
  - Calibration curve prepared with standards (10–100 µg/L); quality control with a 50 µg/L stock diluted to 10 µg/L.
- Total Phosphorus (TP)
  - Potassium persulphate digestion with acid and subsequent molybdenum blue colorimetric analysis.
  - Unfiltered water digested; measurement with SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser; calibration curve with blanks for correction.
- Total Nitrogen (TN)
  - Acidification with HCl; purge with zero-grade air to remove inorganic carbon.
  - Measurement with Shalar Formacs CA16 analyser (ND25 accessory).
- Nitrate
  - Ion chromatography (filtered through 0.45 µm Whatman cellulose acetate filters).
  - Instrument: Dionex ICS2100; QC samples measured every 10 samples.
- Silica
  - Colorimetric method using ammonium molybdate and ascorbic acid to form silicomolybenum blue.
  - Absorbance read at 880 nm; background corrected with blank measurements.

## Data structure
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Site (inflow, outflow, or lake name), nitrate (mg/L), silica (mg/L), total nitrogen (mg/L), total phosphorus (mg/L), soluble reactive phosphorus (mg/L).

## QA/QC and data quality
- Calibration curves used for each analyte; inclusion of QA/QC solutions and blanks to monitor accuracy and background corrections.
- SRP QC procedure includes a working QC solution diluted to 10 µg/L for validation against calibration.

## GIS relevance and applications (for GIS Specialists)
- Enables spatial visualization of nutrient concentrations across inflows, outflow, and the lake at 1 m depth.
- Supports temporal trends analysis (monthly data over 2016–2017) and spatial comparisons among inflow streams.
- Useful for nutrient loading assessments, catchment management, and informing policy or public communications.
- Data can be mapped as point locations (sites) with time-series attributes or integrated with hydrological layers for richer spatial analyses.
