# BLEL_Secchi.csv

## Overview
- Secchi depths (m) collected at the main buoy (deepest point 14.5 m) of Blelham Tarn.
- Period: 2016 and 2017.
- Frequency: weekly during the stratified period (May–early November); then fortnightly to monthly outside this period.
- Instrument: oceanographic Secchi disk (all white).

## Data structure
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Secchi depth (m).

## Spatial and temporal context
- Location: main buoy at Blelham Tarn (deepest point 14.5 m).
- Temporal coverage: 2016–2017 with seasonal sampling pattern as described.

## Data collection and provenance
- Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.

## GIS considerations and potential uses
- Suitable as a time-enabled point attribute (Secchi depth) linked to the buoy location.
- Can be visualized as time-series maps or charts to show changes in water clarity.
- Prepare for GIS by parsing dates, ensuring unit consistency (meters), and handling any missing values.

## Data quality and limitations
- Limited to two years and a single geographic point.
- Variable sampling frequency across the year may affect temporal analyses.
- No additional spatial variability data; integration with other lake features may be required for broader spatial analyses.
