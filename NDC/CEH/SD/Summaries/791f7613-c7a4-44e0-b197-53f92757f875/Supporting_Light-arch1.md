## Overview
- Light profiles (μmol s^-1 m^-2) collected at the main buoy at the deepest point of Blelham Tarn (14.5 m).
- Data collected during 2016 and 2017 for the NEC05744 project.
- Aimed at characterizing light availability with depth over time to support ecological analyses (e.g., primary production, photosynthesis).

## Data collection and instrument
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
- Collected by: Emma Gray.
- Light measurement concept: recorded just below the surface and then at 1 m intervals down to 9 m from the shaded side of the boat; sensor held at maximum arm length away from the boat to minimize shading effects.
- Units: Light expressed as μmol s^-1 m^-2; 1 μmol s^-1 m^-2 equals 6.022 x 10^17 photons s^-1 m^-2.

## Sampling design and temporal coverage
- Temporal span: 2016 and 2017.
- Sampling frequency:
  - Weekly during the stratified period (May to early November).
  - Fortnightly to monthly outside the stratified period.

## Variables and data structure
- Columns:
  - Date: dd/mm/yyyy
  - Depth: m (0 m is just below the surface; -9 m is the deepest measurement)
  - Light: μmol s^-1 m^-2
- Data structure captures depth-resolved light profiles from the surface down to 9 m.

## Study location and sampling point
- Lake: Blelham Tarn, located in the Lake District, North West England.
- Monitoring buoy position: at the lake’s deepest point (14.5 m depth).
- Figure reference: bathymetry and buoy location described (Ramsbottom 1976).
