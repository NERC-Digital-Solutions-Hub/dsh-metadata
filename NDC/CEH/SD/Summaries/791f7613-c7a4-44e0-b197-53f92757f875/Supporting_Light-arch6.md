# BLEL_Light.csv

## Overview
- Light profiles (μmol s-1 m-2) collected at the main buoy at Blelham Tarn, deepest point 14.5 m.
- Collected by Emma Gray for the project NEC05744.

## Sampling regime and timing
- Measurements taken weekly during the stratified period (May–early November) in 2016 and 2017.
- Outside the stratified period, data collected fortnightly to monthly.

## Instrument and procedure
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
- Procedure: Light recorded just below the surface, then at 1 m intervals down to 9 m on the shaded side of the boat; sensor held at the furthest arm’s length from the boat.

## Data structure and units
- Data columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Depth (m) with 0 m just below the surface and -9 m as the deepest measurement, Light (μmol s-1 m-2).
- Units note: 1 μmol s-1 m-2 = 6.022 x 10^17 photons s-1 m-2.

## Location and figure reference
- Location: Blelham Tarn, in the Lake District, North West England.
- Monitoring buoy positioned at the deepest point (14.5 m).
- Bathymetry reference: Ramsbottom (1976).

## Data use and quality considerations
- Useful for analyzing depth- and time-varying light availability, aiding studies of the euphotic zone and potential primary production.
- Metadata and procedural details support data quality assurance, transformation, and reproducibility.
- Data structure is clearly defined to facilitate integration with other datasets and self-service analysis.

## Data provenance and access notes
- Collected as part of NEC05744.
- Documentation includes instrument details, measurement protocol, and data structure to aid interpretation and reuse.
