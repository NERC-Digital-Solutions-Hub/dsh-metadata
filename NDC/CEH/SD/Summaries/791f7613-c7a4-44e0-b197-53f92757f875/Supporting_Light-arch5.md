# Supporting information

- Collected by Emma Gray for the project NEC05744; describes light profiles (μmol s-1 m-2) at the main buoy of Blelham Tarn (deepest point 14.5 m) during 2016 and 2017.
- Instrument: LI-COR underwater quantum sensor.
- Data file: BLEL_Light.csv; supplementary information to the study with figure context (Figure 1) and a reference to Ramsbottom (1976).

## Data and methods

- Light measurement details:
  - Light recorded just below the surface, then at 1 m intervals down to 9 m, away from the shaded side of the boat; sensor positioned as far as possible from the boat.
  - Units: μmol s-1 m-2 (1 μmol s-1 m-2 = 6.022 x 10^17 photons s-1 m-2).
- Data structure:
  - Date (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - Depth (m) with 0 m just below surface and -9 m as the deepest measurement
  - Light
- Location and scope:
  - Blelham Tarn, Northwest England; buoy located at the deepest point (14.5 m).
  - Bathymetry referenced from Ramsbottom (1976).

## Temporal coverage

- Sampling frequency:
  - Weekly during the stratified period (May–early November)
  - Fortnightly to monthly outside this period (2016–2017)

## Provenance and references

- Data is part of a broader study; Figure 1 locates the lake and buoy; reference to Ramsbottom (1976) for depth charts of the Cumbrian lakes.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations

- Metadata and standardization
  - Ensure fields include: instrument, method, date format (prefer ISO 8601), units, depth convention, location (lake, buoy), sampling cadence, and depth range (0 to -9 m).
  - Maintain clear documentation of the measurement procedure and any deviations.
- Data quality and interoperability
  - Verify consistency of depth values and sign convention (0 m below surface, negative depths downward).
  - Confirm unit consistency and provide any calibration data or instrument maintenance notes.
- Accessibility and sharing
  - Catalogue in relevant data portals with proper dataset-level metadata and citations (including the Emma Gray authorship and NEC05744 project).
  - Include references to external sources (e.g., Ramsbottom 1976) and link to Figure 1 for spatial context.
- provenance and versioning
  - Record collection year(s) (2016–2017) and any updates or corrections; version control for BLEL_Light.csv.
- Limitations and context for reuse
  - Data limited to 0–9 m depth range and to the 2016–2017 period; consider seasonal and depth coverage when reusing for models of photosynthetically active radiation or lake light climate.
- Potential uses
  - Light regime analyses, validation of aquatic light models, coupling with stratification studies, and cross-dataset integration for lake ecosystems research.
