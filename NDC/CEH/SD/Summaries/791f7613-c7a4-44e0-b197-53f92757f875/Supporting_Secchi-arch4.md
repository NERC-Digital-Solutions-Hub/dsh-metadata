# BLEL_Secchi.csv

- Overview
  - Supporting information for project NEC05744; contains Secchi depth measurements (in meters) from the main buoy at Blelham Tarn (deepest point 14.5 m).

- Data details
  - Variables: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Secchi depth (m).
  - Instrument: Oceanographic Secchi disk (all white).

- Sampling and collection
  - Time period: 2016 and 2017.
  - Frequency: weekly during the stratified period (May to early November); outside this period, measurements are fortnightly to monthly.
  - Site: main buoy at Blelham Tarn.

- Provenance
  - Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.

- Data quality and metadata considerations
  - Potential gaps outside the stratified period due to reduced sampling frequency.
  - Metadata is limited to date and depth; no explicit time zone, measurement uncertainty, or detailed metadata beyond the variables listed.

- Data management implications for Data Leaders
  - Ensure consistent metadata standards (date format, units in meters, instrument used, site, sampling frequency, time zone, uncertainty).
  - Improve discoverability and provenance by linking to the project and collector (NEC05744, Emma Gray).
  - Plan for long-term storage, versioning, and updates; document any changes in sampling schedule or methodology.
  - Consider data quality implications in analyses (seasonal sampling differences) and potential need for gap handling or imputation.
  - Useful for examining water transparency trends and their relation to seasonal stratification; compare across years with attention to differing sampling frequencies.
