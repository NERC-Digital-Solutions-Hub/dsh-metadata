# Supporting information File: BLEL_Phytoplankton_counts.csv

## Overview
- Collected by Emma Gray for project NEC05744.
- Location: Blelham Tarn, Lake District, England; monitoring buoy at the deepest point (14.5 m).
- Timeframe: 2016, weekly from June to November.
- Sample collection: water samples at 1–6 m depth; preserved with Lugols iodine; stored cool and dark to prevent evaporation and light exposure.

## Data collection and processing
- Counting and measurements performed with PlanktoMetriX (PMX) software, designed for 1–1000 µm organisms; enables biovolume/biomass calculations.
- Species identification: PMX database built from 2011–2015 data to identify species common to Blelham Tarn; 142 phytoplankton species identified.
- Biovolume estimation: geometric shapes and equations from CEN (2014) used; equations assigned per species in PMX.
- Sub-sampling approach: 1 m depth used to identify species and gather ten measurements per species; average values applied to samples from 1–5 m.
- Counting protocol: Olympus BX45 inverted microscope, Lund chamber; 100 fields at x100 and 100 fields at x400; random fields; count within known chamber volume; larger organisms counted at x100, nanophytoplankton at x400.
- Counting limits: up to 100 individuals per count; beyond this, counting stops.
