# Supporting information File:BLEL_Secchi.csv

## Overview
- This supporting file documents Secchi depth measurements collected at the main buoy of Blelham Tarn during 2016 and 2017, for project NEC05744.

## Data collection context
- Collected by Emma Gray for the NEC05744 project.
- Location: Blelham Tarn, main buoy (deepest point 14.5 m).

## Measurements and method
- Secchi depth measured in meters using an oceanographic all-white Secchi disk.
- Sampling schedule:
  - Weekly during the stratified period (May to early November).
  - Fortnightly to monthly outside the stratified period.

## Data structure
- Columns: Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Secchi depth (m).

## Temporal and spatial scope
- Timeframe: 2016 and 2017.
- Spatial scope: Main buoy at Blelham Tarn, deepest point 14.5 m.

## Data quality and standardisation
- Measurements follow a standard approach (consistent Secchi disk type and schedule).
- Data intended for quality assurance and transformation as part of environmental monitoring workflows.

## Data handling and storage
- Datasets are stored as part of the project outputs and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Potential uses and relevance
- Provides a standardized measure of water transparency, useful for monitoring lake health over time.
- Can be integrated with other environmental datasets to assess overall ecological status.

## Limitations and notes
- Limited to 2016–2017 data and a single monitoring site (main buoy).
- Data structure is simple (date and depth) with no accompanying metadata on conditions during measurement.
