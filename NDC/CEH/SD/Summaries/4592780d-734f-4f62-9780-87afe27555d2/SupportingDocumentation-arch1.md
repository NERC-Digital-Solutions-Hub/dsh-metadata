# Supporting documentation: Data from the experimental management of arable field options for rare plants (Defra project BD5204)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents four main experiments (2011–2014) on management options for rare arable plants and baseline data for modelling population dynamics.
  - Data are organized by experiment and dataset, with metadata and quality assurance notes to support reuse.

- Common experimental context
  - Topics across experiments include effects of cropping practices, herbicide use, cereal headland management, and crop rotation on rare arable plant communities.
  - Species identification follows Stace (2010) with intentional aggregates for difficult-to-distinguish taxa.
  - Data collected across multiple sites with standardized sampling protocols and temporal coverage (2011–2014 for vegetation, counts, and related measures).

- Data quality assurance
  - Procedures include outlier checks, spot checks of input data, and correction of ID inconsistencies among recorders.
  - Where necessary, species aggregates were formed to improve reliability.
  - Documentation notes ensure traceability of data processing and deposition, including maintaining metadata and provenance.

- Experimental design overview
  - Margin management experiment
    - Setup: multi-site, autonomous randomised complete block split-plot design at three sites (Brecklands, Fivehead, Roundwood); Brecklands had 4 replicates, others 3.
    - Main plots: six 12 m x 60 m blocks arranged in a 2x3 factorial of cultivation season (spring/autumn) and cultivation method (discing, harrowing, ploughing).
    - Sub-plots: four 12 m x 15 m sub-plots per main plot with four herbicide treatments (unsprayed, glyphosate, graminicide, selective broadleaf herbicide plus graminicide).
    - Treatments applied annually (2010–2014).
  - Herbicide screening experiment
    - Setup: 15 seed strips (1 m width x 110 m length) with 15 rare arable species assigned to strips; three blocks with 23 herbicide strips; 21 herbicides plus two unsprayed controls.
    - Sowing: 30 Apr 2012; herbicides applied pre- and post-emergence in 2012; performance scored on 1 Aug 2012 in 1 m x 1.5 m plots.
    - Selection criteria: minimum 10 established plants per plot for inclusion in assessments; 6-point scale for condition (0 = dead, 5 = no visible damage).
  - Crop rotation experiment
    - Purpose: baseline data for modelling population dynamics under rotation scenarios.
    - Design: split-plot mesocosm experiment with six crop treatments across two replicate blocks; within each main plot, twelve mesocosms assigned to two seed mixes (autumn- vs spring-germinating species).
    - Timeline: soil inoculation on 18 Sept 2013; sowing of winter crops (wheat, rape) on 19 Sept 2013; spring crops (barley, beans, grass-clover ley) on 20 Mar 2014.
    - Counts and seed production: initial count before sowing (19 Mar 2014) and final counts (2 Jun 2014 for some crops; 7 Jul 2014 for others); seed head collection for seed production.
  - Cereal headland experiments
    - Purpose: assess responses of rare arable plants to cereal sowing density and N fertilizer.
    - Two parallel experiments: winter wheat (WW) and spring barley (SB) in 12 m-wide margin; four replicate blocks; plots assigned to five treatments (control, low density, low density + N, high density, high density + N) with specified plot lengths depending on N.
    - Sowing and management: central 5 m x 5 m area sown with rare arable species; final counts include species, seed heads, vegetation structure, and cereal metrics.
    - Sampling: five 0.5 m x 0.5 m quadrats per plot for final assessments; seed heads collected for seed production analyses.
  - Cereal headland data datasets
    - Vegetation cover (five quadrats per plot) and structure (tiller density, height, bare ground) datasets.
    - Rare plant demography and seed production datasets for sown rare arable species.
  - Crop rotation experiment datasets
    - Design and two counts in March 2014 and June/July 2014 for mesocosms.
    - Seed production datasets per mesocosm for seed head analyses.
