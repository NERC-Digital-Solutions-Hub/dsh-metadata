# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems

- A multi-disciplinary ESRC project (2005-2009) examining adoption of non-chemical pest management in UK field crops, focusing on conservation biological control (CBC) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies.
- Objective: assess technical feasibility, economic viability, and policy mechanisms to promote wide-scale adoption of CBC and semiochemicals in arable systems.

## GIS data and usage in the project

- Integrated landscape and field experiment data to evaluate how habitat manipulation influences pest control.
- Spatial data collection at multiple scales:
  - Field margins (e.g., 6 m flower-rich margins), hedges, beetle banks, ditches, and uncropped areas.
  - Proximity measures up to 750 m; interior field perimeter analyses; landscape-scale metrics within 1000 m radii.
- GIS and GPS-enabled data collection:
  - Mapping field boundaries, margins, hedge networks, and boundary features; use of MapInfo for spatial calculations.
  - Linking habitat features and predator/pest distributions to spatial coordinates for spatial analyses.
- Data layers and metrics:
  - Pest counts (e.g., aphids like Sitobion avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, Metopolophium dirhodum).
  - Natural enemies (ground and flying predators, parasitoids) and their movements.
  - Boundary flora, margin width, structure (trees, hedges, banks, ditches), and surrounding land-use types.
  - Plant community data (Braun-Blanquet scores) and floral resources (rubidium-tracking technique).
- Spatial analyses and modelling:
  - GLMs and ANOVA linking pest control to habitat and landscape features.
  - SADIE and spatial autocorrelation to examine predator/pest patterns.
  - Exploration of scale effects: field-level vs landscape-level adoption.

## Key spatial findings for GIS interpretation

- Habitat management effectiveness:
  - Flying natural enemies provide stronger cereal aphid control than ground predators alone; effectiveness rises with more grass margins across 250–750 m radii.
  - Habitat features and flower-rich margins boost natural enemy abundance and pest suppression; larger-scale habitat mosaics yield more consistent outcomes.
- Scale and adoption:
  - Habitat changes funded by CBC and AES can reduce insecticide use in some cases; outcomes depend on scale and landscape context.
  - Semi-natural habitats may help locally, but benefits’ persistence and reach depend on adoption scale, natural enemy movement, and landscape connectivity.
- Semiochemicals and interactions:
  - Semiochemicals (e.g., cis-jasmone) can enhance parasitoid activity and reduce aphid colonisation in some crops; responses are crop/variety- and landscape-context-dependent.
- Policy-relevant implications:
  - Spatially linked economic analyses (willingness to pay, pesticide taxes) illustrate policy pathways to encourage CBC/semiochemical adoption.
  - AES payment structures influence farmer decisions; GIS-based habitat uptake mapping can guide targeted policy and interventions.

## Data integration and interpretation

- Merges economics, sociology, ecology, entomology, and GIS to model adoption pathways and ecological outcomes.
- Uses spatially explicit data to test how habitat quantity, proximity, and landscape composition affect biocontrol efficacy.
- Addresses scale effects and interactions between field-level management and landscape-scale habitat networks.

## Data challenges and GIS considerations

- Fragmented data across programs, locations, and studies; need for standardized schemas and metadata for GIS interoperability.
- Resolution and scale mismatches between fine-field measurements and broader landscape metrics; requires careful harmonization.
- Need for consistent definitions of margins, habitat types, and boundary features to ensure reliable mapping.
- Representing uncertainty: spatial variability in biological responses requires clear depiction of risk and data reliability in maps.

## Implications for GIS data products and visualization

- Potential map products:
  - Field-and-landscape habitat maps showing margins, hedges, beetle banks, and uncropped areas with pest-control indicators.
  - Distance-based impact maps showing relationships between pest suppression and margin proximity (0–1000 m).
  - Scale-aggregation visuals illustrating field-scale vs landscape-scale adoption and predicted reductions in insecticide use.
  - Temporal/spatial dashboards combining pest counts, predator abundance, and habitat changes across sampling dates.
- Applications:
  - Support for AES planning and targeting habitat enhancement schemes.
  - Visualization tools for farmers and policymakers to evaluate biocontrol benefits under varying landscape configurations.
  - Integration with decision-support/bio-economic models to optimize CBC and semiochemical deployment at farm and regional scales.

## Methods and data sources to inform GIS practice

- Experimental design:
  - Field trials with designated margins (6 m flower-rich, grass margins), exclusion cages to manipulate natural enemies, transects for sampling.
  - Repeated sampling and spatially distributed traps (sticky traps, D-vac suction) for predator and pest dynamics.
- Data collection techniques:
  - GPS-enabled field mapping; interior perimeter calculations; margin surveys; boundary flora assessments; Braun-Blanquet vegetation scoring.
- Analytical workflow:
  - Spatial data integration with GLMs, ANOVA, and SADIE for spatial pattern analysis.
  - Multiscale analyses linking habitat attributes to biocontrol outcomes.
  - Spatial econometric approaches to relate adoption decisions to farm characteristics and landscape context.

## End-of-project conclusions for GIS readers

- GIS analyses show habitat manipulation and landscape context can influence biocontrol, with stronger effects at larger spatial scales.
- CBC plus semiochemical approaches show promise but require replication, scale-aware deployment, and supportive policy/incentives.
- GIS-based visualization and analysis are essential to translate complex, multi-scale ecological and economic data into actionable map-based data products for policy, industry, and farmers.

## Future directions and recommendations for GIS use

- Develop standardized, interoperable GIS datasets across AES schemes, field margins, and landscape features for cross-study comparisons.
- Expand spatial econometric and bio-economic models to incorporate GIS-derived habitat metrics and landscape-scale adoption data.
- Create pilot GIS dashboards for AES planning illustrating pest-control gains under different margin configurations and adoption scenarios.
- Enhance data collection protocols to improve temporal and spatial resolution, enabling precise mapping of scale effects and functional complementarity among natural enemies.
