# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Aims and context
- Investigates adoption of alternative pest management technologies in UK arable systems, focusing on habitat management for natural enemies (CBC) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies.
- Seeks to understand technical feasibility, economic viability, social factors, and policy design to promote broad adoption of biological control in field crops (especially cereals).
- Examines how agri-environment schemes (AES) and policy instruments influence adoption, landscape-scale implementation, and pest control outcomes.

## Data, methods, and study design
- Economics and consumer data: choice experiments to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for foods with reduced pesticide levels; latent class models to capture preference heterogeneity; large-scale farmer pest-management surveys analyzed with PCA, count data models, and quantile regression.
- Social science and interdisciplinarity: interdisciplinary interviews to understand framing of bio-economic models and integration across disciplines; evaluation of collaboration dynamics and capacity-building.
- Field-scale CBC and habitat manipulation trials: field experiments in cereal aphid systems testing conservation biological control through habitat features (grass margins, field margins, beetle banks); exclusion cage designs to isolate effects of ground vs flying natural enemies; spatial analyses of margin width, distance from field edge, and surrounding uncropped land; tracking floral-resource usage and parasitoid/predator activity; GIS-based landscape metrics.
- Semiochemicals and plant activation: lab, semi-field, and field trials with cis-jasmone and other semiochemicals; formulation development (gum arabic vs microencapsulation) and release-rate assessments; foraging bioassays; semi-field arena trials; crop-variety responses and landscape-scale field trials.
- Biodiversity and community ecology: control cage experiments to examine how natural-enemy diversity and evenness affect pest suppression; exploration of complementarity among predator/parasitoid guilds; assessment of scale-up from field to landscape.
- Adoption, policy relevance, and modelling: analyses aimed at understanding how habitat manipulation and semiochemical strategies translate from field to landscape scales and how AES engagement shapes adoption.

## Key findings and perspectives
- Adoption and technology portfolios
  - UK arable farmers use multiple IPM practices in portfolios rather than relying on pesticides alone; AES engagement and farm characteristics shape portfolio composition.
  - Identified four IPM portfolios incorporating combinations such as habitat manipulation, pheromones, resistant varieties, crop rotations, and selective pesticide use.
- Economic assessments and policy relevance
  - Consumer WTP indicates value for reduced pesticide use and improved environmental quality; proposed pesticide tax rates suggest policy can influence adoption, though rates are modest relative to industry costs.
  - AES support for habitat-based CBC appears to reduce insecticide use in some combinations, signaling policy potential when coupled with incentives.
- Efficacy of biological control and habitat management
  - Flying natural enemies (Syrphidae, Empididae, Dolichopodidae) provide stronger cereal aphid suppression than ground predators, with reductions up to ~90% when flying predators are present.
  - Habitat features (grass margins, flower-rich margins) within 250–750 m of fields enhance aphid suppression by flying natural enemies; wider margins can increase predator presence, with effects context-dependent.
  - Margins increase predator diversity and abundance, but may attract predators away from crop interiors; benefits depend on landscape context and scale.
- Semiochemicals and plant activation
  - cis-Jasmone can enhance parasitoid foraging and reduce aphid colonization in some crops (notably peas); wheat results were inconclusive due to low aphid pressure.
  - Variety-dependent responses to plant activators; combining CBC with semiochemicals may mitigate individual limitations.
  - Release-rate results: gum arabic formulations provided sustained release; microencapsulated formulations did not sustain beyond ~48 hours.
- Biodiversity and ecosystem-service outcomes
  - Balanced natural-enemy assemblages yield more reliable pest control; functional complementarity among predators/parasitoids is important for stable suppression, especially at mid-to-high predator densities.
- Scale, adoption, and policy implications
  - Adoption barriers include high fixed costs, risk preferences, and interactions with other agronomic practices; AES payments help but require ongoing design refinement.
  - Landscape-scale efficacy is scale-dependent; initial field-to-farm gains may plateau if ecological redistribution saturates, though wider adoption offers potential for synergy.
  - Integrated IPM approaches that combine CBC, semiochemicals, and landscape management are needed for meaningful pesticide reduction.
- Future directions
  - Emphasize social science and interdisciplinarity to understand AES engagement, precision-farming data linkage, and policy design for IPM incentives.
  - Expand natural-science work to other pests/crops, investigate mechanisms of complementarity among natural enemies, and evaluate new semiochemicals alongside habitat management.
  - Develop bio-economic models to optimize semiochemical and habitat-management strategies across scales, incorporating adoption dynamics, risk preferences, and markets for reduced-pesticide foods.

## Policy, practice, and environmental monitoring implications
- AES and policy design can enable adoption of CBC and semiochemical approaches but require targeted, scale-aware strategies and consideration of ecosystem-scale dynamics.
- Data-driven insights (WTP, adoption determinants, pest-control efficacy, landscape metrics, habitat area) provide a basis for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time, including potential reductions in pesticide use and increases in biodiversity-friendly farming.
- Highlights the importance of integrating diverse data streams (economic, social, ecological, landscape) to assess effectiveness and value of IPM strategies across spatial and temporal scales.

## Data management, dissemination, and capacity-building
- Outputs include peer-reviewed publications, policy-relevant findings, and practical farmer guidelines; findings feed into AES design and future research.
- Emphasis on combining datasets (consumer preferences, farm practices, ecological outcomes, landscape context) to enhance the value and utility of environmental monitoring data for policy scrutiny and farm decision-making.
- Training and capacity-building across Imperial College London, Rothamsted, GWCT; dissemination to farmers, stakeholders, and policy audiences; collaboration with RES projects and knowledge networks.

## Takeaways for analysts monitoring environmental health and policy performance
- Integrated data streams (economic preferences, farming practices, habitat features, pest-control efficacy, landscape context) are essential to evaluating environmental health and policy impact over time.
- Standardised, cross-disciplinary methods (economic modelling, ecological experiments, GIS analyses, field trials) enable robust, comparable monitoring outputs.
- The study demonstrates how policy instruments (AES) can alter land-use practices with measurable ecological and economic effects, underscoring the value of monitoring, transparency, and data sharing to scrutinise policy performance and environmental outcomes.
