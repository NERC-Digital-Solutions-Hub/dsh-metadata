# 4.1.1.1. Aphid counts

- Purpose and timing
  - Aphid counts were conducted on three of four trapping dates to assess aphid populations and the impact of predator presence and margins.
- Sampling design and measurements
  - At each trapping point, 25 randomly selected wheat tillers within a 5 m radius were counted for aphid species.
  - Recorded species: S. avenae, M. dirhodum, and R. padi.
  - For each aphid: location on the tiller (ear, flag leaf, or lower), alate status, and parasitism where identifiable.
  - Counts were pooled across the 25 tillers at each point for analysis.
- Predator treatments and margins
  - Treatments (within exclusion cages and adjacent crop controls):
    - B = ground predators only
    - R = flying predators only
    - RB = no predators
    - W = all predators
  - Margin types:
    - F = flower-rich margin
    - C = control standard margin
- Experimental setup and spatial layout
  - Exclusion cages used to factor predator access by treatment.
  - Field layout includes a 500 m by 10 m floral strip and a beetle bank; hedges and a farm track with surrounding fields (winter wheat and barley) are part of the spatial context.
  - Data collection points included along transects and at varying distances from the field margin.
- Data collection tools and data structure
  - Additional data components include pitfall traps, sticky traps, and exclusion cages as part of the broader experimental design.
  - Datasets referenced for aphids and predators include:
