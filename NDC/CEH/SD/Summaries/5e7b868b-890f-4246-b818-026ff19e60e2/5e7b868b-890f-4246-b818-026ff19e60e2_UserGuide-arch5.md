# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Data Stewardship Context
- Multidisciplinary field datasets across ecology, economics, sociology, and GIS require interoperable data formats and robust provenance.
- Sensitive farmer/survey data necessitates privacy protections and careful access controls.
- Large, longitudinal, and multi-site data demand scalable governance, versioning, and long-term preservation.

## Data Types and Key Variables
- Biological and ecological data
  - Aphid counts (e.g., Sitobion avenae, Rhopalosiphum padi, Metopolophium dirhodum)
  - Predator/parasitoid groups (Carabidae, Staphylinidae, Cantharidae, Syrphidae, Tachyporus, Lycosidae, Linyphiidae, Aphidius spp., etc.)
  - Habitat features and treatments (grass margins, hedgerows, beetle banks, flower-rich margins)
  - Predation dynamics under different treatments (ground, aerial, both, or none)
  - Spatial data: traps, exclusion cages, transects, radii around fields (100–1000 m)
  - Semiochemicals: cis-jasmone formulations, release rates, foraging responses
- Economic, social, and behavioral data
  - Farmer pest-management practices, AES membership, attitudes toward pesticides
  - Willingness-to-pay studies (two-choice experiments), latent class analyses
  - IPM portfolio adoption determinants (farm type, tenure, regional effects)
  - Interdisciplinary interviews and modelling context
- Data structure notes
  - Field trial designs with margins, distances, and exclusion treatments; multi-year replication
  - Field/lab/semifield/field-scale data across studies
  - Data integration needed for bio-economic analyses
- Example dataset identifiers (illustrative)
  - Rebug experiment files: aphids_2006_gwct.xls, aphids_2007_gwct.xls, dvacs_2007_gwct.xls, sticky_traps_2006_gwct.xls, sticky_traps_2007_gwct.xls
  - Common variables: Day/Days after infestation, Farm code, Plot number, Treatment (B, R, RB, W), Margin (F, C), Distance, Field, Transect, G.S. (growth stage)

## Data Collection, Provenance, and Metadata
- Methods and protocols
  - Habitat experiments with exclusion cages (ground vs. flying predators) and margin manipulations
  - Field and landscape sampling: transects, D-vac suction, sticky/pitfall traps
  - Semiochemical testing: formulations, release rates, foraging assays, semi-field trials
  - Consumer and farmer surveys: instrumentation for PM practices, AES membership, and WTP analyses
- Provenance and documentation
  - Data collected across multiple sites/years; detailed field notes, site codes, treatment identifiers, measurement units
  - GIS/statistical analyses referenced (GLMs, ANOVA, spatial econometrics, latent class analysis)
  - Need for data dictionaries, variable definitions, and clear links between datasets and experiments

## Data Quality, Standards, and Documentation Needs
- Quality considerations
  - Low infestation levels can reduce statistical power; variability in biodiversity data; replication and landscape-scale analyses needed
  - Generalizability of semiochemical results requires cross-crop/landscape replication
- Documentation gaps
  - Unified data dictionary and metadata schema across disciplines
  - Clear variable definitions, units, measurement protocols, sampling schedules, site context
  - Provenance records linking datasets to experiments, treatments, and analyses
  - Codebooks for models (GLMs, latent class, nonparametric methods) and data processing steps
- Reproducibility
  - Availability of analysis scripts (R, Genstat, GIS workflows) and data transformation steps
  - Versioned archives of raw, cleaned, and derived datasets

## Data Sharing, Access, and Governance
- Current status
  - Publications exist; explicit direct data sharing arrangements are not detailed
- Recommended governance
  - Data Management Plan (DMP) aligned with institutional policies
  - Archive in institutional repositories or recognized platforms with DOIs (e.g., Dryad, Figshare)
  - Data usage licenses (e.g., Creative Commons) and any restrictions (e.g., anonymization)
  - Metadata catalog with standardized fields: project, site, date range, treatment, variables, units, data type, coordinates, quality notes
  - Link datasets to publications, models, and supplementary materials to boost discoverability

## Data Management and Sharing Recommendations
- Develop and implement a comprehensive DMP covering:
  - Data collection standards, formats, naming conventions
  - Metadata and data dictionaries for all datasets
  - Provenance tracing from collection to analysis and publication
  - Access controls, licensing, and privacy protections
  - Backup, storage, disaster recovery, and retention plans
- Create a centralized, searchable data catalog linked to experiments, margins, landscapes, and semiochemical trials
- Encourage data publication alongside manuscripts; provide guidance on deposition and licensing
- Include equity and capacity-building notes to support future interdisciplinary work

## Practical Implications for Data Governance
- Prioritize interoperability across ecological and socio-economic domains to enable integrated analyses (bio-economic modeling)
- Implement scalable metadata schemas capturing experimental design, treatments, collection methods, and analytical approaches
- Ensure long-term preservation and accessibility for policy analysis, AES program evaluation, and replication studies
- Facilitate data reuse for pesticide reduction strategies, landscape management, and adoption analysis while protecting participant confidentiality

## Potential Impact and Outputs
- Supports peer-reviewed articles, policy-relevant findings, and evaluations of AES programs
- Informs IPM strategies combining habitat management and semiochemical approaches
- Enhances reproducibility and cross-site comparability; enables design of future large-scale interdisciplinary studies

## Typical Challenges for Data Stewards
- Heterogeneous data streams across disciplines requiring harmonized formats
- Incomplete or uneven data coverage across sites/years
- Balancing privacy/consent with data reuse
- Managing large, complex, spatially explicit datasets with version control
- Translating non-technical outputs into machine-readable data with clear provenance

## Appendices / Example Data Schemas (Illustrative)
- Example data fragments show common fields and structure, such as:
  - Distance from margin, Margin type, Treatment, Field, Plot, Transect, Days/Day, G.S. (growth stage)
  - Trap types (pitfall, sticky), date of collection, farm/block identifiers, rotation of treatments
  - Dataset filenames indicating year, experiment, and crop network (e.g., rebug_experiment_3_aphids_2006_gwct.xls)
