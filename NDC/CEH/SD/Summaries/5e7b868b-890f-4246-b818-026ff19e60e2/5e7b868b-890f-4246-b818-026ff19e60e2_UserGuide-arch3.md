# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Overview and aim
- Assess adoption and effectiveness of alternative pest management (IPM) technologies in field crops, focusing on conservation biological control (CBC) and semiochemical (push-pull) approaches.
- Examine technical feasibility, economic viability, and policy design to promote broad adoption in UK arable systems (cereals), including landscape-scale implementation and interactions with agri-environment schemes (AES).

## Monitoring framework perspective
- Purpose: identify environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, inform decisions, and guide monitoring design.
- Key measures:
  - Ecological indicators: predator diversity and activity (flying vs ground predators), aphid densities and species composition, parasitism rates, habitat quality (flower-rich margins, hedgerows, field margins).
  - Economic and social indicators: consumer willingness-to-pay (WTP) for reduced-pesticide foods, farmer adoption rates, AES uptake, potential price premia.
  - Governance indicators: data availability, metadata quality, data sharing, standardised data collection, and cross-study data integration.
- Data management considerations:
  - Need for metadata to judge data suitability; data transformation requirements; openness and public sharing barriers; governance to ensure quality, storage, and accessibility.

## Data collection and experimental design (aphid counts and monitoring activities)
- Aphid counting protocol (4.1.1.1):
  - Conducted on three of four trapping dates; at each station, 25 wheat tillers sampled within a 5 m radius.
  - Count by aphid species (S. avenae, M. dirhodum, R. padi) and record on which plant part (ear, flag leaf, lower) they occur.
  - Mark alate and parasitized individuals where possible; counts pooled across 25 tillers per point.
- Field layout and treatments:
  - Exclusion cages and margin treatments to isolate predator effects (ground vs flying predators; presence/absence of predators).
  - Margin types: F = flower-rich margins, C = control margins.
  - Metrics collected include predator presence, aphid infestation timing, and spatial positioning along transects.
- Data collection tools and outputs:
  - Sticky traps and pitfall traps deployed near margins and within crops; aphid counts linked to trap location and days after infestation.
  - Several data files (e.g., rebug_experiment_3_aphids_2006_gwct.xls, rebug_experiment_3_aphids_2007_gwct.xls, rebug_experiment_3_dvacs_2007_gwct.xls, rebug_experiment_3_sticky_traps_2006_gwct.xls, rebug_experiment_3_sticky_traps_2007_gwct.xls) accompany the study, documenting temporal and spatial sampling details.
- Visual and mapping context:
  - Aerial and ground-truth figures illustrate trap layouts, margins (flower-rich vs standard), and landscape features (beetle banks, hedgerows).

## Key findings and insights (beginning, middle, end)
- Ecological efficacy:
  - Flying natural enemies often provided stronger cereal aphid suppression than ground predators alone; epigeal predators contributed but were less effective in isolation.
  - Habitat enhancements (grass margins, field margins, hedgerows) boosted predation and aphid suppression, with stronger effects at 250–750 m landscape scales; larger margins improved predator immigration but effects varied by predator guild.
  - Predator diversity and balance improve pest control reliability; functional complementarity among predators/parasitoids enhances suppression and resilience.
- Semiochemicals and plant-activated defence:
  - Cis-jasmone formulations can boost activity of certain parasitoids and reduce aphid colonisation in some crops (notably peas; some wheat varieties show promise). Cereals field results were less conclusive due to low aphid pressure, indicating context-dependent potential.
  - Semi-field trials support enhanced parasitoid performance on cis-jasmone-treated plants; host-plant variety interactions suggest targeted deployment within IPM packages.
- Landscape and scale:
  - Field-scale habitat manipulations improve pest control locally; landscape-scale adoption is required to realise full benefits and avoid displacement effects.
  - AES payments can reduce pesticide use but require replication and long-term adoption; policy design significantly shapes farmer willingness to invest in non-crop amenities.
- Economics and adoption:
  - Evidence of consumer value for reduced pesticide residues suggests potential price premia for pesticide-reduced cereals, though variability exists.
  - Adoption is heterogeneous; farm type, tenure, and AES engagement influence decisions; portfolios that modify the cropping environment can reduce insecticide use, with context-dependent outcomes.
  - Policy context (AES) is nudging farmers away from pesticides, but diffusion can be constrained by scale, consistency, and administrative rules.
- Monitoring and data considerations:
  - Low pest pressure in some trials reduced statistical power for semiochemical effects; robust inference requires higher infestation periods or alternative pests.
  - Multi-scale measurements (field, farm, landscape) are essential; integrating GIS and precision farming data enhances monitoring potential.

## Data governance, dissemination, and barriers
- Outputs span peer-reviewed papers, policy-relevant reports, and stakeholder briefings; aims to inform AES design and IPM adoption.
- Data sources include farmer/consumer surveys, field experiments, GIS habitat data, and lab/field trials; analyses employ latent class models, PCA, GLMs, ANOVA, and bio-economic modelling.
- Public sharing of underlying data is a known barrier; emphasises outputs and policy-relevant summaries to support monitoring and adoption.

## Challenges and limitations
- Low pest pressure in several trials limited power to detect semiochemical and field-scale effects.
- Heterogeneity across spaces and scales complicates generalisation from field to landscape to national levels.
- Data gaps and the need for long-term monitoring to capture adoption trajectories and ecosystem-service benefits beyond short-term experiments.
- Balancing biodiversity, pest control, and agricultural productivity requires careful design to avoid unintended ecological interactions.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks (policy-makers and researchers)
- Multi-layer monitoring approach:
  - Combine ecological metrics (predator diversity, aphid densities, parasitism rates, habitat quality) with economic/behavioural metrics (adoption rates, WTP, AES uptake, price premia).
- Scalable, landscape-aware indicators:
  - Track effects at field, farm, and landscape scales; assess how adoption scale modulates pest-control outcomes.
- Data integration and governance:
  - Standardised data collection and metadata practices; reduce silos; integrate GIS/precision farming data for spatial analyses.
- Methodological triangulation:
  - Use experiments, surveys, and modelling in tandem to identify causality and to design incentives that support durable adoption.
- Policy design guidance:
  - Align AES and market incentives with farmer risk preferences and the public-good nature of reduced pesticide use; consider retailer governance as a lever for uptake.

## Conclusions and future directions
- CBC and semiochemical approaches show promise but require further development, replication, and integration to serve as practical insecticide substitutes in cereals.
- A combined strategy, supported by well-designed AES and robust monitoring, has potential to reduce pesticide use while maintaining crop protection.
- Future work should broaden crop-pest targets, deepen landscape-scale assessments, and extend socio-economic analyses to deliver actionable monitoring frameworks that support widespread IPM adoption.
