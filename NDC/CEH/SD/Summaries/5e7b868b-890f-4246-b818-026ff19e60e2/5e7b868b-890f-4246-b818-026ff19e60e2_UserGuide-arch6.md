# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Context of the Aphid Counts Sub-Study
- Aphid counts were performed on 3 of 4 trapping dates at each station.
- 25 wheat tillers were randomly selected within a 5 m radius of the trapping point; counts recorded by species (S. avenae, M. dirhodum, R. padi) and their location on the tiller (ear, flag leaf, lower).
- Alate aphids and parasitized aphids were noted where possible; counts pooled across the 25 tillers per point.
- Field setup included two yellow sticky traps per trap, a map of the site, a 500 m floral strip, beetle bank, hedges, tracks, and multiple crop fields (winter wheat and barley).

## Experimental Design and Treatments
- Exclusion cages used to isolate predator groups at multiple fields.
- Margin types: F = flower-rich margin; C = control standard margin.
- Predator treatments within cages: B = ground predators only; R = flying (air) predators only; RB = no predators; W = all predators.
- Additional design elements included transects, pitfall traps within exclusion cages, and adjacent crop controls.
- Data collection included multiple data streams: aphid counts, predator presence, and trap data.

## Data Collection and Data Files
- Aphid data collected across several datasets:
  - rebug_experiment_3_aphids_2006_gwct.xls
  - rebug_experiment_3_aphids_2007_gwct.xls
- Predator and trap data:
  - rebug_experiment_3_dvacs_2007_gwct.xls (d-vac/vac traps)
  - rebug_experiment_3_sticky_traps_2006_gwct.xls
  - rebug_experiment_3_sticky_traps_2007_gwct.xls
- Additional contextual fields in datasets include:
  - Days after aphid infestation; cluster and farm blocking; farm code; plot number; growth stage (G.S. Zadoks).
  - Treatment codes (B, R, RB, W) and background counts from adjacent crops.
  - Distances from the field margin and transect positions.

## Data Variables and Measurements
- Aphids:
  - Species counts by station and plant attachment point (ear, flag leaf, lower).
  - Alate status and parasitism determination where feasible.
- Spatial and temporal context:
  - Days after infestation; farm, plot, and field identifiers.
  - ZADOKS growth stage for each observation.
- Predator assessments:
  - Treatments specify which predator groups were active within cages.
  - Pitfall and sticky trap data capture ground and flying predator activity and presence relative to margins.
- Experimental positioning:
  - Distance from margin (various meters), field numbers, margins (F/C), and transect positions.

## Data Management, Processing, and Accessibility
- Data structured across multiple Excel files with consistent field labels to enable cross-dataset integration.
- Blocking by farms and clustered experimental design inform analyses.
- Data types include count data (aphids, trap catches), categorical treatments, and spatial coordinates (distance from margin, transect positions).
- File naming and metadata imply integration with broader analyses of pest dynamics, predator efficacy, and margin effects.

## Analyses, Insights, and Relevance to Data Support
- Data enable assessment of:
  - Effect of predator presence (ground and/or flying) on aphid counts.
  - Influence of field margin type (flower-rich vs standard) on aphid suppression and predator activity.
  - Spatial patterns of aphid distribution relative to margins and trap locations.
- Structure supports mixed designs with farm-level clustering, enabling robust statistical analyses (count models, ANOVA-like approaches, and spatial considerations).
- Findings from this component contribute to understanding the mechanisms of biological control and the design of habitat features to enhance pest suppression.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Practical Considerations
- Parasitism status and alate identification rely on field determination, which may introduce measurement limitations.
- Data integration across multiple datasets requires careful harmonization of variable names and coding schemes (e.g., treatment codes, margin designations, day counts).
- The dataset focuses on three of four trapping dates, which may affect temporal completeness.

## Implications for Data Support and Future Work
- Demonstrates multi-stream data collection (aphids, predators, traps) within a single experimental framework, highlighting the need for standardized data schemas and documentation.
- Emphasizes the value of clear metadata (treatment codes, margin types, farm blocks) to enable reproducible analyses and cross-field comparisons.
- Supports ongoing data integration efforts to model pest-predator dynamics and to inform habitat-based IPM design and policy recommendations.
