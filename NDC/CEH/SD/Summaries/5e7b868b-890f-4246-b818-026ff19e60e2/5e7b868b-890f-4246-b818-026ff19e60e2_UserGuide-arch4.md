# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Overview
- Interdisciplinary project combining economics and natural science to develop, test, and promote biological pest control technologies in UK arable crops.
- Two main technologies: habitat management for natural enemies (CBC) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies.
- Aims to understand technical feasibility, economic viability, adoption barriers, and policy design to promote broader use of biological pest control.

## Data Assets and Data Collection Methods
- Economic and consumer data
  - Consumer WTP studies: two choice experiments; large survey of 3,000 households with 420 usable responses; latent class analysis to identify preference groups; pesticide tax scenarios.
  - Farmer surveys: pest management practices from 7,500 mailed; 645 returned (571 usable); analysis of IPM adoption, AES engagement, and determinants of practice change (PCA, regression, quantile regression).
- Field and landscape experiments
  - Field scale CBC trials: cereal aphid model; field margins varied; exclusion cages to separate ground vs. flying predators; spatial analyses linking predator presence to aphid suppression.
  - Habitat and margins studies: multiple fields with varying grass margins; transects at 20, 40, 80 m from field edge; measurements of aphid numbers, predator abundance, parasitism; spatial pattern analyses (SADIE).
  - Floral resource usage: rubidium-tracing to track predator foraging on floral margins; sticky traps and lab analyses to map predator movement.
- Semiochemicals and biological interactions
  - Formulation development: cis-jasmone release properties, microencapsulated vs gum acacia formulations; headspace sampling for release rates.
  - Foraging bioassays: parasitoids (Aphidius ervi and A. rhopalosiphi) responses to cis-jasmone-treated plants.
  - Semi-field arenas: predator–parasitoid–aphid interactions assessing parasitism and aphid suppression.
  - Crop responses: pest colonisation in wheat varieties treated with cis-jasmone; field-scale plots in wheat and peas to assess aphid colonisation and predator activity.
- Biodiversity and community ecology
  - Control cage experiments manipulating natural enemy richness and identity; ecological and interaction-strength analyses using classical and Bayesian models.
- Data integration and analysis
  - Statistical methods: ANOVA, GLMs, Poisson/nonparametric count models, latent class models, PCA, regression, spatial analyses (SADIE).
  - Bio-economic modelling: linking ecological outcomes to farmer decisions and AES policy design.
  - GIS/spatial data: landscape metrics (uncropped land, field margins, hedgerows, grasses) within radii (100–1000 m) of fields; habitat-feature mapping and predator movement.

## Analytical Approaches and Key Findings
- CBC effectiveness and scale
  - Flying natural enemies (syrphids, predatory flies, spiders) provide stronger cereal aphid control than ground predators; effectiveness increases with wider margins and improved habitat connectivity.
  - Aphid control improves with adjacent margins (roughly 250–750 m) due to predator movement and resource availability; margins support overwintering and foraging.
  - Habitat complexity and balanced predator assemblages yield more reliable suppression; diversity–function relationships depend on species identity and interactions.
- Semiochemicals and plant-induced responses
  - Cis-jasmone formulations show potential to boost parasitoid activity and reduce aphid colonisation in some crops (notably peas) and varieties (e.g., Solstice in wheat); results vary with pest pressure and season.
  - Semi-field results indicate improved parasitism and reduced aphid numbers, but responses vary by parasitoid species and crop context; landscape context and replication are important.
- Adoption economics and policy design
  - AES-like payments can raise CBC adoption and reduce insecticide use in certain configurations; outcomes depend on landscape scale, spatial distribution, and farmer type.
  - IPM tends to be adopted as portfolios rather than single practices; adoption heterogeneity linked to farm type, tenure, AES engagement, and regional policy.
  - Consumer WTP for pesticide-reduced foods suggests possible market-driven adoption, but retailer governance and market segmentation influence viability.
- Scale and integration
  - Field-scale benefits may differ when scaled to landscape levels; design of AES and deployment of CBC/semiochemicals must consider scale mismatches and diffusion effects.
  - Economic-ecological interactions indicate path dependencies; early adopters and strong incentives are critical to overcome transition costs.
- Overall conclusion
  - Progress toward integrating IPM technologies with conventional approaches requires further replication, broader crop/landscape testing, and policy mechanisms aligning private costs with social benefits.
  - CBC and semiochemicals show complementary potential; integrated deployment could reduce chemical inputs, contingent on scale, ecosystem context, and incentives.

## Data Governance and Stewardship for Data Leaders
- Data integration and interoperability
  - Requires harmonization of multidisciplinary datasets (ecology, economics, sociology) with standardized metadata, measurements, and interoperable GIS layers.
  - Linking field experiments, consumer surveys, and AES policy data enables robust bio-economic modelling and scenario analysis.
- Scale-aware data design
  - Data collection must capture field, farm, and landscape scales to model adoption dynamics, scale effects, and diffusion of benefits (habitat metrics, predator movements, pest pressures).
- Methodological diversity and reproducibility
  - Combines experimental, observational, and modelling approaches; integration of latent class analysis, count data models, spatial statistics, and Bayesian methods to handle heterogeneity and uncertainty.
- Data quality, provenance, and replication
  - Seasonal and spatial variability necessitates careful experimental design, replication, and clear provenance to produce generalizable findings and reliable predictive models.
- Actionable insights and policy support
  - Data-driven understanding of effective IPM portfolios by landscape context informs policy design, AES deployment, and farmer outreach strategies.
- Data access and governance
  - Documentation of data sources, access controls, and licensing to enable sharing among researchers, policy makers, and extension networks while protecting sensitive information.

## Practical Implications for Data Leaders
- Data-driven policy design
  - Use integrated data to identify optimal policy mixes and incentive structures that maximize social welfare and adoption rates.
- Extension and outreach
  - Translate findings into practical guidelines; tailor outreach to landscape contexts and farm types to accelerate adoption.
- Tooling and capacity
  - Develop reproducible workflows, dashboards, and decision-support tools that synthesize ecological and economic signals for stakeholders.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Low pest infestation in some trials reduces statistical power and complicates treatment effect detection.
- Landscape heterogeneity and regional policy implementation affect transferability of results.
- Scaling CBC and semiochemical strategies from plots to whole-farm/landscape requires careful consideration of ecological and economic feedbacks.

## Future Research Priorities
- Social science and interdisciplinarity
  - Deeper farmer interviews and matched case studies; integrate with precision farming and spatial econometrics to assess AES impacts; broaden adoption determinants across farm types and regions.
- Natural science and ecology
  - Extend to other pests/crops; further study key natural enemy guilds; develop additional activators and semiochemicals; explore varietal responsiveness.
  - Investigate scale effects and landscape-level design to optimize habitat manipulation and semiochemical deployment.
- Economic and policy design
  - Refine bio-economic models to identify optimal policy mixes; design AES that maximize welfare and adoption; market studies on pesticide-reduced foods and retailer governance.
- Capacity building
  - Training in quantitative methods, GIS, and modelling; foster interdisciplinary collaboration and stakeholder engagement.

## Capacity Building and Collaboration
- Build capacity through quantitative methods training, GIS, and modelling; cross-disciplinary workshops and international collaborations.
- Translate findings into practical guidelines and policy recommendations through publications and stakeholder engagement.

## Conclusions
- The project advances understanding of CBC and semiochemical-based pest management as viable complements to pesticides, emphasizing habitat, landscape context, and economics in adoption.
- Integrated data approaches and bio-economic modelling are essential to guiding policy design and accelerating real-world uptake of biological control technologies in UK arable farming.
