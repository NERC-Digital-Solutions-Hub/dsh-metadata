# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN site areas as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by the BTO.
- Provide information on year-to-year and longer-term population changes across habitats in the UK.
- Improve on CBC/WBS by random site selection, more sample sites, counting along transects (not territories), reduced per-site effort, and better representativeness.

## Methodology

### Location
- If overlaps with CBC BM usage, select at least one 1 km square at random from squares within the former survey area.
- Moorland sites use the same squares as previously used.
- If neither protocol was used previously, randomly select at least one (preferably more) 1 km square from all available squares.

### Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects, 1 km long, oriented north/south or east/west.
- Transects are 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect is divided into five 200 m sections (ten sections total); section starts are marked.
- Route is mapped and reused each year; deviations to avoid barriers are allowed if the two transects remain at least 200 m apart.

### Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for every 200 m section, within 25 m on either side of the line.
- Use habitat codes to denote the predominant habitat (first) and a second habitat if present, selecting from hierarchy levels 1–4.
- If the transect route deviates, record the average distance from the ideal route and also an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

### Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain’s lowlands, two counting periods: early April–mid May and mid May–late June, with one visit per period (≥4 weeks apart).
- First visit aligns with resident breeding birds’ main activity; second after latest migrant breeders arrive.
- Timing adjusted for sites further north or higher altitude.
- Counts in mornings (ideally 06:00–07:00 BST, no later than 09:00). Start times kept consistent across season and years.
- Avoid surveying in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather recorded.

### Bird recording
- Record all birds seen or heard along both transects.
- Classify observations by distance band relative to transect: 1 (within 25 m), 2 (25–100 m), 3 (>100 m including beyond square), or F (birds in flight).
- Distances estimated perpendicularly to the line; avoid double counting; juveniles distinguished from adults where possible.
- Use standard BTO species codes; colony nesting (rook, sand martin, gulls) counts conducted separately for the entire square.
- After each field visit, produce summaries of adult birds by species and distance band for the ten transect sections.

## Data recording and specification

### Recording conventions and dataset fields
- Data capture for each ECN site uses four key identifiers: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, and Sampling Date/Time.
- Breeding birds (BB) entries involve two yearly visits to transects within 1 km squares, with habitat and species counts along transects; data follow BTO coding conventions.
- Typical recorded fields include: Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit date/code, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, and related codes (e.g., BST time, grid references).

### Recording forms and data access
- CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms are available from the Census Unit of the BTO; CBC outline maps are prepared by the BTO.
- Moorland bird field recording form available from the ECNCCU.
- Data formats and transfer specifications for ECN datasets are available via the restricted ECN Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Data use relies on standardized BTO codes and distance categories for cross-site comparability.

## Notes
- References to BTO codes (species, activity, weather, habitats, and distance categories) are standardized across the protocol.
