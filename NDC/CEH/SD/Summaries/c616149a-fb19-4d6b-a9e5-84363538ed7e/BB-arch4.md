# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Provide information on year-to-year and long-term population changes for a wide range of breeding birds across UK habitats.
- Improve representativeness and efficiency over earlier CBC and WBS methods by random site selection, more sites, and counts instead of territories.
- Document procedures to ensure consistent data collection and eventual publication details.

## Data collection design and scope
- Part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Two visits per year per 1 km square: early (April–mid-May) and late (mid-May–late June).
- Each visit separated by at least four weeks; field timing adjusted for latitude/altitude.
- Data collected via transects within 1 km squares, counting birds encountered along the route.
- Use of standard codes and forms for habitats and bird records; aims to enable time-series analyses.

## Location and transect establishment
- Select at random at least one 1 km square (preferably more) within areas previously surveyed; if not previously surveyed, select from all available squares.
- For moorland sites, use the same squares as previously used.
- Transects: ideally two parallel lines per square (1 km each), 500 m apart, 250 m from square edge.
- Each transect divided into five 200 m sections (10 sections total). Start and section markers recorded on a map; the route is to be repeated each year.
- If the ideal route cannot be followed due to barriers, deviations are allowed as long as lines remain at least 200 m apart; minor intrusions into adjacent squares permitted to complete surveying.

## Habitat recording and classification
- Habitat features recorded at the beginning of each recording year for every 200 m section, including habitats within 25 m of either side of the line.
- Use codes to describe first habitat and second habitat, with up to two more habitats from deeper levels of a hierarchical classification.
- Record a separate habitat list for the ideal transect if the actual route differs.
- A habitat recording form is used, with codes for levels 1–4; changes in habitat during the year are noted.

## Frequency, timing, and conditions
- Southern Britain lowlands: two counting periods (early April–mid-May and mid-May–late June); one visit per period.
- Begin counts in good weather; avoid heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather conditions recorded.
- Morning counts preferred (ideally 0600–0700 BST, no later than 0900); times should be consistent within and between years.
- Provisions for northern or high-altitude sites to adjust timing.

## Bird recording and data capture
- Record all birds seen or heard along both transects; birds are categorized by distance from transect:
  - 1: within 25 m of line
  - 2: 25–100 m
  - 3: more than 100 m or outside the square
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated perpendicularly to the line; same individual should not be recorded twice.
- Use standard BTO species codes; juveniles distinguished where possible.
- Special counting for colonies of rooks, sand martins, and gulls (count or estimate nests) outside the transect, as needed.
- After each field visit, summarize counts by species and distance band for each transect section.

## Recording forms and data management
- Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit (BTO); CBC maps are interpreted by BTO for outline maps of the survey area.
- Moorland bird field recording form available from the CCU.
- BTO codes and related mapping conventions referenced (species, activity, habitat, weather, distance, etc.).
- Data specification for ECN sites requires: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit date, Visit code, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, Units, and BTO codes.
- Data transfer and dataset formats are defined in accompanying ECN data transfer documentation accessible via restricted extranet (ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access).

## Notes and references
- BTO codes, habitat codes, weather codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, and distance categories are defined in the referenced BBS documentation (pages cited in the protocol).
- Field and data collection procedures emphasize consistency across years and sites to enable robust temporal analyses.

## Data governance and access considerations for data leaders
- Data are captured across standardized transects with consistent timing and coding to support long-term comparability.
- Metadata and data specifications are formalized (core parameters and coding schemes) and linked to restricted ECN data transfer documentation.
- Access to detailed data specs and ECN datasets is controlled via restricted extranet; collaboration and data sharing require appropriate authorization.
