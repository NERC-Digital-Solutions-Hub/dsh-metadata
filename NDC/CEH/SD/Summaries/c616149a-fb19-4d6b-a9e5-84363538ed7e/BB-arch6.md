# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by the BTO.
- Provide information on year-to-year and longer-term changes across a range of habitats in the UK.
- Improve representativeness by random site selection, increasing the number of sample sites, counting instead of mapping territories, reducing per-site effort, and enabling broader data use.

## Location
- For sites with prior CBC/ BM protocol use during overlap, select at least one 1 km square at random from those containing part of the former area (preferably more).
- Moorland sites: use the same squares as previously used during overlap.
- Sites with no prior protocol: select at least one (preferably more) 1 km square at random from all available squares.

## Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transect lines (1 km long) oriented north/south or east/west.
- Transects 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect divided into five equal sections (total of ten sections); start of each section marked.
- Routes may deviate to avoid barriers, provided the two lines remain at least 200 m apart.
- Minor intrusions into adjacent squares acceptable if necessary.
- The exact route is mapped and repeated each year.

## Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, covering habitats within 25 m of either side of the line.
- Use a habitat coding system with primary (first habitat) and secondary habitats, choosing codes from multiple habitat levels.
- If the actual transect differs from the ideal two-parallel lines, estimate the average distance from the ideal and also record an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain lowlands, conduct two counts within the breeding season: early (April to mid-May) and late (mid-May to late June).
- One visit in each period, at least four weeks apart.
- Time visits to align with resident and migrant breeding activity: start mornings (ideally 0600–0700 BST, no later than 0900).
- Start time should be consistent within a season and between years.
- Countings not conducted in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather conditions recorded.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds encountered along the two transects.
- Classify observations into distance categories:
  - 1: within 25 m of the line
  - 2: 25–100 m from the line
  - 3: more than 100 m from the line (including birds outside the square)
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated perpendicularly to the transect line; repeat sightings of the same individual should be avoided.
- Use standard BTO species codes and distinguish juvenile from adults where possible.
- For dense nesting colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls), conduct separate colony counts for the entire 1 km square rather than the transect method.
- After each field visit, produce summaries of adult birds seen by species in each distance band per transect section.

## Recording conventions and results specification
- Data variables required for each sampling location at an ECN Site include:
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Year
  - County
  - 1 km square code
  - Transect section
  - Habitats
  - Visit (Sampling) date
  - Visit code
  - Weather
  - Start time and Finish time
  - Species seen
  - Distance category (from transect)
  - Bird activity
  - Units (BTO code)
  - National Grid reference (numeric code 1–10)
  - BTO codes for species, activity, weather, etc.
- Data are recorded on standard BBS field forms; formats and data transfer details are specified in ECN data documentation.
- The ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation outlines dataset formats; access is via restricted extranet (ecnpcu@ceh.ac.uk for access).

## Recording forms
- CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit, BTO.
- CBC outline maps are typically prepared by the BTO.
- Moorland-field recording form available from the CCU.

## Notes
- BTO codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories referenced in the data and forms.
