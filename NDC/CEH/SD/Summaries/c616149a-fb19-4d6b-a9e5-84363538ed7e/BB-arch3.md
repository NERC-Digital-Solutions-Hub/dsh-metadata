# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Part of the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) Integrated Population Monitoring Programme.
- Designed to track year-to-year and long-term changes across a range of habitats in the UK.
- Improves on CBC and WBS by random site selection, increased sample sites, counts over territory mapping, reduced per-site effort, and enhanced representativeness.

## Background and Rationale
- Builds on the BC Protocol and BM Protocol by selecting random squares and increasing site numbers to improve coverage and comparability over time.
- Focuses on counts along standardized transects rather than territory mapping to facilitate consistent trend analysis.

## Study Design and Site Selection
- Location: Sites chosen to align with former CBC/BM usage; at overlap, use the same 1 km squares; when new, random selection among available squares.
- Sample squares: At least one 1 km square per site, preferably more; route and habitat context recorded for comparability across years.
- Route consistency: The exact transect route is planned and fixed each year; minor deviations are allowed if necessary to avoid barriers, provided the two transects remain ≥200 m apart.

## Transect Establishment
- Per square: ideally two parallel transect lines, each 1 km long.
- Spacing: 500 m apart; 250 m from the square edge; transects divided into ten 200 m sections.
- Marking: Start of each section marked with permanent landmarks or visible markers; same route recycled annually.
- Recording: Any deviations from the ideal two-transect design documented; average distance from the ideal transect also recorded if applicable.

## Habitat Recording
- Habitat features recorded at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, within 25 m of each transect side.
- Uses a coded habitat system with primary and secondary habitats (levels 1–4).
- If transect route deviates from the ideal, an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect is also recorded.
- Changes in habitat during the recording year noted on the habitat form.

## Frequency and Timing
- Geographic scope: Southern Britain breeding season focus; timing adjusted for more northern or elevated sites.
- Visits: Two visits per square per year.
  - Early: April to mid-May.
  - Late: Mid-May to late June.
- Interval: At least four weeks between visits.
- Timing: Early visit during peak resident breeding bird activity; late visit after latest migrant breeders arrive.
- Daily timing: Morning counts, ideally 0600–0700 BST, not later than 0900; start times kept consistent across years.
- Weather: Counts not conducted in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong winds; weather conditions recorded.

## Bird Recording and Coding
- Recording: All birds observed or heard while walking the two transects are logged.
- Transect sections: First transect (sections 1–5) walked first; second transect (sections 6–10) after a short break; total visit ~90 minutes.
- Distance categories relative to transect: 
  - 1: within 25 m
  - 2: 25–100 m
  - 3: more than 100 m (including birds outside the square)
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated perpendicular to the line; familiarity with 25 m and 100 m estimation recommended.
- Nesting colonies: For dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls), standard transect counts are inadequate; count/estimate nests in the whole 1 km square separately from transects.
- Data recording: Use Standard BTO species codes; distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
- Data aggregation: After each visit, summarize adult birds by species and distance band per transect section.

## Colony Counts and Moorland Considerations
- Dense colonies: Separate counting/estimation of nests for specified species (rook, sand martin, gulls) outside regular transects.

## Data Management and Recording Conventions
- Recording forms: Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field forms available from BTO; CBC outlines are prepared from recorder maps by BTO.
- Moorland birds: A field recording form available from the CCU.
- Data specifications: ECN Site data require core identifying fields and standardised measurement codes; data transfer documentation defines ECN dataset formats.
- Identifiers (example fields):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (with time element when sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Data submission: Data intended for ECN data centres; documentation and formats may reside on restricted extranets (Site Managers’ extranet). Access requests via ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Key Data Elements and Variables
- Core sample identifiers: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Site/Spatial: County, 1 km square code, E/N grid references, transect section.
- Temporal: Visit (sampling) code (E for early, L for late), Weather, Start time, Finish time.
- Biological: Species seen (BTO codes), Distance category, Bird activity, Nest counts (where applicable), Juvenile/adult status.
- Habitat: Codes for first/second habitats per section, with notes on changes.
- Output: Summaries of adult birds per species per distance band; codes and weather logs; data used for further transfer and reporting.

## Access, Documentation, and References
- Data standards and ECN dataset formats described in accompanying Data Transfer documentation; available through restricted access Site Managers' extranet.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Emphasizes a robust, repeatable sampling design with random site selection and standardized transects to enable trend detection.
- Highlights the importance of comprehensive metadata, standardised species/habitat codes, and clear data governance (including access controls and data sharing considerations).
- Demonstrates the need for detailed data specifications, quality assurance, and documented data transfer procedures to ensure data are usable for long-term monitoring and policy evaluation.
