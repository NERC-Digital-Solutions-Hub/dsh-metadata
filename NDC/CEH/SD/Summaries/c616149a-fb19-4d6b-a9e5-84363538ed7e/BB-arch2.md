# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN site areas.
- Part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Designed to show year-to-year and long-term population changes across habitats.
- Improves on CBC/WBS by random site selection, more sites, counts instead of territory mapping, reduced per-site effort, and better representativeness.

## Location and site selection
- For overlapping CBC/BM sites, select at least one random 1 km square from squares containing part of the former area; moorland sites use the same squares as before.
- If neither CBC nor BM used previously, random select at least one (preferably multiple) 1 km squares from all available squares.
- Transects are anchored within each selected 1 km square.

## Transect establishment
- Ideal setup: two parallel transects per square, each 1 km long, oriented north-south or east-west.
- Transects 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect divided into five 200 m sections ( ten sections total).
- Start locations marked; route must be recorded and followed annually; deviations allowed to avoid barriers but keep minimum spacing of 200 m between lines.
- If actual route differs from ideal, distance from ideal is estimated and an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect is recorded.

## Habitat recording
- Recorded at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, including habitats within 25 m of each transect side.
- Use a habitat form with coded descriptors; identify primary and secondary habitats per section.
- Habitat coding uses levels 1–4; select appropriate codes for each habitat.
- If transect route deviates from the ideal, record both actual and ideal transect habitat lists.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain lowlands, breeding season roughly 1 April to 30 June.
- Two counting periods: early (April–mid May) and late (mid May–late June); one visit in each period, at least four weeks apart.
- Timing: earlier in southern sites; later in northern or higher altitude sites.
- Mornings: counts typically 0600–0700 BST, not later than 0900; keep start times consistent by year.
- Good weather: avoid heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather recorded.

## Bird recording
- All birds encountered along transects are recorded.
- First transect (sections 1–5) walked, start time recorded; after completion, move to second transect (sections 6–10) and record times.
- Average visit ~90 minutes; listen for songs and scans for flying birds while walking.
- Birds categorized by distance from transect:
  - 1: within 25 m
  - 2: 25–100 m
  - 3: more than 100 m (including beyond square)
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated perpendicularly to the line; avoid double-counting the same individual.
- Use standard BTO species codes; juveniles distinguished where possible.
- Dense- colony nesting birds (rook, sand martin, gulls) not well censused by transects; count/estimate nests in the entire 1 km square separately and independently of transects.
- After each field visit, produce summaries of adult birds by species and distance band for each transect section.

## Data handling and outputs
- Field formats: standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field forms; available from BTO Census Unit. CBC maps are typically prepared by BTO.
- For moorland birds, a separate field form is available from the CCU.
- Outputs include habitat associations and annual population counts by species and distance band.
- Data are recorded on field forms with standard notations and codes (BTO reference codes, weather codes, distance categories, etc.).

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- For ECN Site data, four key identifying parameters must be included: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, and Sampling Date/Time (with time elements if sampling is more frequent than daily).
- BB data variables include: site code, core measurement code, location code, year, county, 1 km square code, transect section, habitats, visit code (early/late), weather, start/finish times, species seen, distance category, bird activity, and BTO codes.
- Recording supports detailed tabulation of counts by species and distance bands, with standard coding for time and weather.

## Recording forms and references
- Access to standard CBC and BBS forms through BTO Census Unit.
- BTO codes and habitat/activity mapping are defined in accompanying references (BTO codes, habitat codes, weather codes, distance categories).

## Notes on data use and accessibility
- Data are organized for ECN Site data submission to ECNCCU, with transfer documentation and restricted access via the Site Managers' extranet.
- Emphasizes standardisation, quality assurance, and compatibility for integration with other environmental datasets and monitoring outputs.
