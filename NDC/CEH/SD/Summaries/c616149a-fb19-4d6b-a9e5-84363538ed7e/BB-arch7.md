# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Track year-to-year and longer-term population changes across UK habitats.
- Improve representativeness by random site selection, increasing site numbers, and using counts along transects rather than territory mapping.
- Procedure is based on BBS observers’ instructions.

## Location
- For overlap with CBC/BM protocols: select at least one random 1 km square from squares containing part of the former survey area.
- If moorland sites use previously used squares; if neither protocol has been used, select at random from all available squares.
- At least one 1 km square per ECN site (preferably more).

## Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects, each 1 km long (north/south or east/west).
- Transects 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge.
- Each transect divided into five 200 m sections (ten sections total); section starts marked with landmarks.
- Routes may deviate to avoid barriers, provided transect lines remain at least 200 m apart; minor intrusions into adjacent squares acceptable.
- Exact route mapped and followed each year.

## Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, within 25 m of the line.
- Use a habitat coding system with first and second habitats; levels 1–4 used to describe predominant habitat (and second habitat if present).
- For each habitat, select codes from the appropriate levels; if the transect route deviates from the ideal, record average distance from the ideal and an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern lowlands, two counting periods: early (1 April–30 June) and late (mid-April to late June), one visit per period, at least four weeks apart.
- Timing: early period coincides with main resident breeding activity; late period after latest migrant breeders.
- Earlier visits may be needed further north or at higher elevations.
- Counts typically conducted in the morning (ideally 0600–0700 BST, no later than 0900) with consistent start times across the season and years.
- Record weather conditions; avoid counting in heavy rain or poor visibility.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds encountered on both transects.
- Transect 1 (sections 1–5) walked first, recording start time; then transect 2 (sections 6–10) with finish time.
- Total visit duration ~90 minutes.
- Record birds seen/heard into one of four distance categories relative to the line:
  - 1: within 25 m
  - 2: 25–100 m
  - 3: more than 100 m (including birds beyond square boundary)
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated perpendicular to the transect; distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
- Do not double-count the same individual.
- Use standard BTO species codes; colony counts for dense nesting species (rook, sand martin, gulls) counted separately for the whole square.
- After each visit, provide summaries of adult birds by species and distance band for each transect section.
- Colony nests for specified species counted separately from transect counts.

## Recording conventions and data specification
- Key parameters for each sampling occasion (space/time) include:
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN site code, e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time
- Additional variables include: Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit (Sampling) date, Visit code, Weather, Start time, Finish time, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, Recording units (BTO code), National Grid reference, and BTO codes for species, habitat, weather, etc., with 24-h BST times.
- Data alignment with ECN dataset formats; ECNCCU data transfer documentation available on the restricted extranet.

## Data formats, access and references
- Recording forms:
  - Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit (BTO) for interpretation and map preparation.
  - Moorland bird field recording form available from ECN CCU.
- Codes and mapping references:
  - BTO species codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories are provided in referenced pages (e.g., p177–p181 in BTO materials).
- Data transfer and access:
  - ECN dataset specifications and data transfer documentation available on the restricted Site Managers' extranet.
