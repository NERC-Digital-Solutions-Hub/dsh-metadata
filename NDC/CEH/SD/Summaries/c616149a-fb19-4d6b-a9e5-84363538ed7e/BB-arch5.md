# BB Protocol

## Aim and Scope
- Breeding Bird Survey to record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within ECN site areas.
- Part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Designed to improve representativeness and efficiency via random site selection, more sites, counts instead of territory mapping, and consistent methodology.

## Location and Sampling Design
- Selection of sites: random 1 km squares overlapped with CBC/BM methods where applicable; reuse of same squares during overlap; random selection from all available squares when neither BC nor BM has been used previously.
- Transect setup: within each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects (1 km long), north/south or east/west, 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge; each transect divided into five 200 m sections (ten sections total). Routes are marked and fixed each year.
- Route deviations: minor deviations allowed to avoid barriers, provided transects remain sufficiently separated.

## Habitat Recording and Classification
- Habitat data collected at the start of each recording year for every 200 m section, including habitats within 25 m of either transect side.
- Recording uses a coded habitat system with a first habitat and a second habitat, plus up to two habitats from deeper levels (1–4).
- If transects deviate from the ideal two-parallel-transect layout, an additional list for the ideal transect is recorded.

## Frequency, Timing, and Weather
- Two visits per year per square: early (April–mid May) and late (mid May–late June); each visit at least four weeks apart.
- Timing: mornings (ideally 0600–0700 BST, no later than 0900); start times consistent within and across years.
- Site variation: counts adjusted for latitude/altitude (northern/higher sites later in season).
- Weather: counts not conducted in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; prevailing weather recorded.

## Bird Recording and Counting
- All birds observed while walking transects are recorded and categorized by distance from transect: within 25 m, 25–100 m, more than 100 m (including beyond square), or birds in flight (F).
- Estimation is by right-angled distance to line; assign to appropriate category; avoid double counting of individuals.
- Use standard BTO species codes; juvenile vs. adult distinction where possible.
- Special handling: nesting in dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls) counted by nests in the entire 1 km square; colony counts are separate from transect counts.
- Post-fieldwork deliverables: summaries of adult birds by distance band for each transect section.

## Data Standards, Recording Conventions, and Documentation
- Required data fields for ECN Site datasets: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time; plus Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit code, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity; Units and codes per BTO conventions.
- Data format alignment: ECNCCU data transfer documentation specifies ECN dataset formats (accessible via restricted extranet); contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- Recording forms: Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field forms available from the Census Unit; BTO typically provides CBC outline maps; moorland birds field form available from CCU.
- Documentation codes: BTO species codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories referenced in accompanying notes.

## Notes and References
- BTO-specific coding references (p177–p181) for codes related to species, habitat, weather, and distance categories.
