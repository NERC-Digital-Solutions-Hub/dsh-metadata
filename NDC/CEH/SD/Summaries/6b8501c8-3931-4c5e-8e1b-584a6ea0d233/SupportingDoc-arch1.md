Growing season methane and nitrous oxide static chamber fluxes from Sodankylä region, Northern Finland - Supporting Documentation Kerry Dinsmore 19/07/16

## Site Description
- Arctic Research Centre of Sodankylä (67°22'N 26°39'E; 179 m a.s.l.) in central Lapland, Northern Finland; part of Pallas-Sodankylä GAW station and a level 1 ICOS ecosystem station.
- Sub-arctic/boreal vegetation zone with Scots pine forests and wetlands as dominant ecosystems.
- UVET-classified Scots pine forest on sandy podzol; mean vegetation height ~12 m; stand age 60–100 years; tree density ~2100 ha^-1.
- Lichen presence influenced by reindeer; nearby Halssiaapa wetland (eutrophic flark fen) with sedge vegetation, Sphagnum, and Betula spp.
- Measurements across forest (3 plots: unfenced, 12-year enclosure, ~50-year enclosure) and wetland to capture vegetation and water-table variability.

## Experimental Design and Sampling Regime
- Measurements conducted during growing season 2012 in two campaigns: Summer (12 Jul–2 Aug) and Autumn (22 Sep–14 Oct).
- 60 static chambers total: 21 in forest, 39 in wetland.
- Forest: 7 chambers per subplot (no enclosure, 12-year enclosure, ~50-year enclosure) to reflect grazing exclusion treatments.
- Wetland: chambers positioned to cover vegetation communities and varying water-table depths.
- Sampling cadence: flux measurements at ~2-day intervals.
  - Summer: 10 measurements across all chambers.
  - Autumn: 7 measurements for forest chambers and 8 for wetland chambers.

## Collection Methods
- Static chambers: 40 cm diameter opaque polypropylene, shallow 10 cm bases left in ground; lids 25 cm pipe with closed top and pressure compensation.
- Air sampling: 100 ml sample drawn at four times during ~45 min flux period; flushed through 20 mL glass vials; analyzed in lab ~1 month later.
- Ancillary measurements: soil temperature at 10 cm (4 replicate points outside chamber bases); forest soil moisture (4 replicate VMC) adjacent to bases.
- Wetland: 21 dip wells installed near or between chambers; water-table depth derived from adjacent wells.
- Soil respiration: measured adjacent to forest chambers and 14 wetland chambers; covers ground vegetation respiration as well.
- Vegetation: recorded visually within each chamber.
- Root-zone nutrient probes: paired cation/anion PRS probes deployed adjacent to each chamber base during both campaigns; deployment/ recovery windows noted.

## Fieldwork and Laboratory Instrumentation
- Gas analysis: HP5890 Series II GC with electron capture detector (CH4/N2O) and flame ionisation detector (CH4) for CH4 and N2O respectively (detection limits: CH4 < 70 μg/L; N2O < 7 μg/L).
- In-situ sensors: Omega HH370 soil temperature probe; Theta probe HH2 for volumetric soil moisture.
- Soil respiration: PP-Systems SCR-1 chamber with EGM-4 IRGA.
- PRS probes: Western Ag Innovations Inc., Canada.

## Calibration Steps and Values
- GC calibration: 4-point calibration with standards run roughly every 20 samples.
- CH4 and N2O standards (ppmv):
  - Std 1: CH4 1.26, N2O 0.1995
  - Std 2: CH4 1.83, N2O 0.285
  - Std 3: CH4 5.16, N2O 0.490
  - Std 4: CH4 101.1, N2O 0.975

## Analytical Methods and Quality Control
- Flux calculation: GCFlux v2; uses up to five models and selects the best-fit model for each chamber set (linear or asymptotic for CH4; N2O fluxes from linear model due to detection-limit uncertainties).
- Flux units: nanomoles per square meter per second (nmol m^-2 s^-1).
- Data handling: following standard processing for probe corrections and lab analyses; concentrations near detection limits treated with caution for N2O.

## Data Structure / Nature and Units of Recorded Values

## Location and Chamber Details
- Forest chambers located at specified long/lat coordinates within the three subplots (no enclosure, 12-year enclosure, 50-year enclosure).
- Wetland chambers distributed across a range of water-table depths with multiple dip wells near chambers.
