# Growing season methane and nitrous oxide static chamber fluxes from Sodankylä region, Northern Finland - Supporting Documentation

- Overview
  - Document describes measurement setup and methods for methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes using static chambers during the 2012 growing season in Sodankylä, Finland.
  - Data originate from forest and wetland ecosystems within the Arctic Research Centre Sodankylä, with measurements designed to capture spatial variability (lichen cover, vegetation) and hydrology effects on fluxes.
  - Analytical processing performed at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, UK, with PRS probe analyses by Western Ag Innovations Inc., Canada.

- Site Description
  - Location: Arctic Research Centre of Sodankylä (67°22'N, 26°39'E), ~100 km north of the Arctic Circle; sub-arctic/boreal vegetation zone.
  - Ecosystems: Scots pine forest (UVET type) on sandy podzol and Halssiaapa wetland (flark fen) with rich sedge cover and Sphagnum/moss; reindeer presence affects lichen cover.
  - Forest details: 12 m vegetation height, ~60–100 year stand age, 2100 ha-1 density; three plots with varying grazing enforcement (no enclosure, 12-year enclosure, ~50-year enclosure).

- Experimental Design / Sampling Regime
  - Campaigns: Summer (July 12 – August 2, 2012) and Autumn (Sept 22 – Oct 14, 2012).
  - Sampling: 60 static chambers (21 forest, 39 wetland). Forest: 7 chambers per subplot (no enclosure, 12-year, ~50-year enclosures). Wetland: chambers positioned across vegetation communities and water table depths.
  - Frequency: Flux measurements about every 2 days; Summer yielded 10 measurements across all chambers; Autumn yielded 7 for forest and 8 for wetland chambers.

- Collection Methods
  - Chamber construction: 40 cm diameter opaque polypropylene, with 10 cm deep bases left in ground; 25 cm lid with pressure-compensation plug attached during 45-minute flux measurements.
  - Gas sampling: 100 ml chamber air sampled 4 times during the 45-minute period and flushed into 20 mL glass vials; vials analyzed ~1 month later.
  - Ancillary data: Soil temperature at 10 cm depth (four replicates); forest soil moisture (4 replicates) adjacent to chamber bases; wetland soil moisture via 21 dip wells; water table depth calculated from dip wells; soil respiration measured adjacent to chambers; vegetation recorded within each chamber.
  - Resource probes: PRS (cation and anion) probes deployed adjacent to each chamber during both campaigns; deployment and recovery dates noted.

- Fieldwork and Laboratory Instrumentation
  - Gas analysis: HP5890 Series II GC with electron capture detector (N2O) and flame ionisation detector (CH4); detection limits <7 μg L-1 for N2O and <70 μg L-1 for CH4.
  - Temperature and moisture: In-situ soil temperature with Omega HH370; volumetric soil moisture with ThetaProbe HH2.
  - Respiration: PP-Systems SCR-1 respiration chamber with EGM-4 IRGA.
  - PRS probes: Sourced from Western Ag Innovations Inc., Canada.

- Calibration Steps and Values
  - GC calibration: Four-point calibration with standard concentrations for CH4 and N2O; standards run approximately every 20 samples.
  - Standards include CH4 and N2O concentrations spanning low to high ranges (example standards: CH4: 1.26 to 101.1 ppmv; N2O: 0.1995 to 0.975 ppmv).

- Analytical Methods and Quality Control
  - Flux calculation: GCFlux software (v2) using five methods and selecting the best fit for each chamber set; fluxes reported as instantaneous nmol m-2 s-1.
  - CH4 fluxes: Reported using best-fit model (linear or asymptotic) per chamber.
  - N2O fluxes: Given higher uncertainty near detection limits, calculated from the linear model only.
  - Data handling: Concentrations converted to fluxes with reported uncertainties; emphasis on selecting appropriate model per chamber.
