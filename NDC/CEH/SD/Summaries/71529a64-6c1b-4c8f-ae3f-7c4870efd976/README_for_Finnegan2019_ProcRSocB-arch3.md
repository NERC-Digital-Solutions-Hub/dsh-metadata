# Meiotic drive reduced egg-to-adult viability in stalk-eyed flies

## Overview
- Presents data from an experiment testing whether the SR-drive chromosome in Teleopsis dalmanni reduces viability during egg-to-adult development.
- Controlled crosses produced eggs with all possible SR and ST male and female genotypes.
- Offspring were genotyped at adult eclosion to yield observed genotype ratios used to estimate selection coefficients against drive in both sexes.
