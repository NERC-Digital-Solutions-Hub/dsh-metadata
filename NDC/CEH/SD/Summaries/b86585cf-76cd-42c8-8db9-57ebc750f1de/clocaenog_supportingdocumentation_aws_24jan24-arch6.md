- Site information
  - Location and purpose
    - Automated climate change manipulation site at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, established 1998
    - Replicated drought and warming treatments; powered by solar and wind
  - Habitat and vegetation
    - Upland west-atlantic moorland; dominant Calluna vulgaris (heather) with Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum; bryophytes present
  - Soil and horizons
    - Humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons; typical E horizon at 6–17 cm
  - Climate (1997–2014)
    - Mean air temperature: 8.0 °C
    - Mean soil temperature (control): 7.5 °C
    - Mean annual rainfall: 1411 mm
    - Total N-deposition: 20–25 kg N ha-1 yr-1
  - Vegetation structure
    - Shrub and bryophyte cover with measured biomass at start of experiment (1998)

- Climate change treatment information
  - Treatments and layout
    - Two treatments: drought and warming; each with three replicate plots (4 m x 5 m)
    - Three control plots with scaffolding to mirror shading (total n=9 plots)
  - Drought treatment
    - May–Sept drought implemented 1999–2011 (and later adjustments)
    - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof triggered by rainfall sensor; reduces annual rainfall by ~20%
    - Limitations: some small rain events missed; since 2012 extended to Apr–Oct; since 2016 rainwater accumulation prevented roof retraction
  - Warming treatment
    - Uses retractable aluminum mesh curtains to reduce infrared radiation (reflects 96–97%) and limit nighttime heat loss
    - Operated at night; retracted during rain to avoid removing rainfall; some rainfall exclusion occurs due to lag
    - Rainfall reductions ~14% overall
  - Maintenance and changes
    - 2016–2017: original frames replaced with new frames installed atop old ones to reduce disturbance
    - 2018: rainfall sensor on site broken; drought roofs not in operation during some periods
    - 2020–2021: field work affected by COVID; some years with incomplete data
  - Treatment timing and metrics
    - Table 6a: yearly drought dates and percent rainfall reductions (varied by year)
    - Table 6b: warming treatment data; growing degree days (GDD) compared between control and warming; provides percentage change per year
    - GDD calculations rely on plot-level temperature data; some years NA due to missing data or not measured

- Equipment, protocols and data processing methodology
  - Automated weather station (AWS) and micro-meteorological data
    - AWS mounted at 4 m after thefts; sensors measure: air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction
    - Measurements: 1-minute intervals; hourly averages
    - Data quality control: visual QC using Excel after collection
  - Micro-meteorological plot data
    - Plot-level soil and air temperature; soil moisture via TDR sensors since 2008 (CS616)
    - Earlier soil moisture measured with ML-2 theta probe
    - Data frequency: 1 minute; hourly averages (pre-2016) and half-hour averages (post-2016)
  - Rain gauge data (site-level rainfall) and rainfall chemistry
    - Ground-level rain gauge with 12.7 cm funnel; rainfall accumulated biweekly
    - Considered more robust than AWS data due to logger/power issues
  - Throughfall data (plot-level rainfall)
    - Biweekly collection using funnels and bottles per plot
    - Data processing: compute seasonal/annual plot rainfall by applying percent change from throughfall to site-level rainfall; exclude data from plots with measurement loss; occasional infilling with year-average reductions
  - Data availability and contact
    - Not all micro-dataset stored in EIDC; contact Sabine Reinsch or Bridget Emmett (enquiries@ceh.ac.uk) for details
  - Data processing notes
    - Data quality checks include consistency across years and handling of missing or corrupted measurements
    - Throughfall data require adjustments to align with site-level rainfall for comparative analyses

- Appendix and site layout
  - Figures referenced (site layout and quadrat measurements) illustrate plot arrangement and measurement areas
  - Each quadrat is 0.5 m^2; layout used for vegetation and measurement areas

- Key takeaways for data use
  - A single CSV (CLM_AWS_2022-2023_summaryQA.csv) provides core AWS meteorological data for the site, with explicit missing-data codes
  - Comprehensive, multi-faceted data exist beyond AWS, including plot-level microclimate, rainfall, throughfall, rainfall chemistry, soil/vegetation metrics, and long-term climate manipulation records
  - Data quality considerations include equipment maintenance history, sensor outages (e.g., rainfall sensor 2018 onward), COVID-related gaps, and the need to harmonize throughfall with site rainfall for treatment effect analyses
