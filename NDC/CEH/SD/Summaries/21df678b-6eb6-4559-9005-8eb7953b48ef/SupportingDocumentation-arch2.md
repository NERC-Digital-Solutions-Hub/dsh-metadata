# Groundwater level information for 10 locations within the Gandak River Basin, in Bihar, India

## Overview
- Groundwater level data collected in the Gandak River Basin, Bihar, India as part of the CHANSE project (Coupled Human and Natural Systems Environment).
- Timeframe: April 2017 to February 2019.
- Instrumentation: Troll automatic groundwater level loggers recording at 15-minute intervals; data corrected to local barometric pressure using a Troll barometer.

## Data collection and methodology
- Purpose: Provide groundwater level information across multiple sites to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Data verification and quality: Data have been corrected for barometric pressure; fields may contain blanks where values are missing.
- Outputs: The dataset supports standardised analysis and visualization (e.g., reports, maps, charts); datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Variables and data description
- DateTime: Date and time of the recording.
- Temp: Water temperature.
- mbgl: Depth to water level below ground level recorded by the logger.
- man_mbgl: Manually measured depth to groundwater level (dip meter).
- PT: Pressure transducer.
- Baro: Barometric pressure reading.
- Missing values: Represented by blanks.

## Site locations and metadata
- Ten locations in the Gandak Basin with associated coordinates and site-specific metadata:
  - Chinta Manpur
  - Bagaha 1
  - Bagaha
  - Bagaha 3
  - Bettiah 1
  - Bettiah 2
  - Bettiah 3
  - Lalganj Basanta
  - Bettia4
  - Chalabhar
- For each site, metadata includes:
  - Geographic coordinates (longitude, latitude)
  - Depth to base (mbgl) and depth to water level at installation (mbgl)
  - Installation date
  - Last download date
  - Months of record
- Note: Some site records contain inconsistent formatting in the original data (e.g., mixed punctuation and typographical errors), but the essential metadata (location, installation date, and record duration) is present.

## Data handling and accessibility
- Data management: Data from installed loggers are cleaned, validated, and transformed for standardised use.
- Access: Data are stored and made available through appropriate portals to enable broader access and reuse by other stakeholders.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and challenges
- Relevance: Provides a multi-site, time-series view of groundwater levels critical for assessing groundwater conditions, trends, and policy impact.
- Challenges and opportunities:
  - Increasing the value of the datasets by integrating with other relevant environmental and hydrogeological data.
  - Enhancing accessibility of underlying data to support broader analyses and decision-making.
