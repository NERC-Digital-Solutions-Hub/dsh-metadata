# Groundwater level information for 10 locations within the Gandak River Basin, in Bihar,    India

## Overview
- Groundwater level data for 10 locations in the Gandak River Basin, Bihar, India.
- Collected under the CHANSE (Coupled Human And Natural Systems Environment) project.
- Recording period: April 2017 to February 2019.
- Measurements obtained with Troll automatic groundwater level loggers at 15-minute intervals.
- All data corrected to local barometric pressure using Troll barometer data.

## Data contents and variables
- DateTime: timestamp of each recording.
- Temp: water temperature.
- mbgl: depth to water level below ground level as recorded by the logger.
- man_mbgl: manually measured depth to groundwater level (dip meter).
- PT: pressure transducer.
- Baro: barometer reading.
- Missing values are represented as blank.

## Site locations and metadata
- Data cover 10 sites with geographic coordinates (longitude and latitude) and related well metadata.
- For each site, metadata includes:
  - Installation date
  - Last download date
  - Depth to base (mbgl) and depth to water level at installation (mbgl)
  - Months of record
- Example sites include Chinta Manpur, Bagaha 1, Bagaha 3, Bettiah 1/2/3, Lalganj Basanta, Bettia4, Chalabhar (names appear in the dataset with corresponding coordinate and metadata fields).

## Data quality and GIS relevance
- Data are suitable for map-based visualization and GIS analyses of groundwater levels across the basin.
- The dataset provides spatial coordinates and per-site metadata to support GIS integration and temporal analysis.
- Data consistency relies on cross-site standardization; some metadata entries show formatting irregularities, but core fields (coordinates, installation/last download dates, depths, and record duration) are available for GIS use.

## Temporal coverage
- Time window: April 2017 through February 2019.
- Data captured at 15-minute intervals during the recording period.
