# Susceptibility of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) to Dothistroma septosporum following natural inoculation at Torrs Warren, Galloway 2013-2015

## Overview
- Dataset from a common garden trial of Scots pine trees transplanted from CEH Edinburgh to Torrs Warren, Galloway in April 2013.
- Aims to study natural infection by Dothistroma septosporum and related growth/phenotypic traits over 2013–2015.
- Data collected through regular assessments, plus detailed needle-level measurements.

## Dataset contents and structure
- Detailed_assessment_Sep_2013.csv
  - Raw needle-level data for infected trees sampled Sept 2013.
  - Measurements: length of lesions, number of lesions per needle, needle length; up to 11 needles per tree.
- Detailed_assessment_Oct_2014.csv
  - Raw needle-level data for infected trees sampled Oct 2014.
  - Measurements: lesion length, lesions per needle, needle length, presence of visible fruiting bodies on lesions.
- Mean_phenotype_per_tree.csv
  - Per-tree raw data for all assessments (infection, height, chlorophyll fluorescence, branching, defoliation).
  - Also contains mean values for detailed needle assessments from Sep 2013 and Oct 2014.

## Measurements and variables
- Infection assessments (percentage of current-year needles with symptoms, recorded semi-annually).
- Growth and architecture: tree height (end of season), branching counts (main stem and total), defoliation of previous-year needles.
- Physiological metric: chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) measured in July 2013 to assess stress.
- Needle-level metrics (from detailed assessments):
  - Sep 2013: lesion length (LNL), lesions per needle (LPN), needle length (LL).
  - Oct 2014: total needle count, lesion length (LL), length of needles with lesions (LNL), lesions per needle (LPN), presence of visible fruiting bodies on lesions (FBV).
- Per-tree metadata in Mean_phenotype_per_tree.csv include: population of origin, family, block, position, original tree number, fungicide treatment in 2015, geographic coordinates, altitude, and yearly height data from 2009–2015.

## Site, origin, and experimental design
- Origin: eight Scottish Scots pine populations with four families per population, six individuals per family (192 trees total).
- Transplant site: Torrs Warren, adjacent to infected Corsican and lodgepole pines; trees in six randomized blocks, one tree per family per block.
- Planting and maintenance: potted seedlings transplanted in 2013, guard row around the experimental area, annual weeding.
- GPS coordinates for key corner trees provided.

## Assessments and timing
- Assessments conducted biannually (autumn and spring) from 2013 to 2015.
- Infection measured as a percentage of current-year needles showing symptoms.
- Height measured annually at end of growing season or start of next.
- Branching recorded in March 2015 (two-year post-transplant window).
- Chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) measured in July 2013 to check for pot stress.
- Defoliation assessment of previous year needles recorded in October 2014.

## Data quality and provenance
- Infection assessments conducted by a single person (to ensure consistency).
- Cultures of Dothistroma septosporum isolated from September 2013 needles to confirm presence of the pathogen.
- Data include notes on data quality and consistency, plus documentation linking to the phenotypic measurements.

## Dead and missing trees
- A list identifies trees that died or were removed/missing during 2013–2015, with dates. Missing data are indicated as NA in the dataset.

## Data origin and broader context
- Trees originated from eight populations, with seed collected in the field and germinated in spring 2007; transplanted at age six in 2013.
- The site was part of the PROTREE project and linked to PhD research by Annika Perry.
- In July 2015, three blocks (4–6) were sprayed with copper-based fungicide as part of endophyte research around fungicide treatment.

## Related and supplementary information
- The dataset is accompanied by supporting documentation for the susceptibility study, and connection to broader projects funded by NERC, Forest Research, BBSRC, Defra, ESRC, and other partners.
- Cross-referenced with prior in situ measurements and other researchers’ work on the same trees.
