# Susceptibility of Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) to Dothistroma septosporum following natural inoculation at Torrs Warren, Galloway 2013-2015

## Overview
- A common garden trial of Scots pine trees transplanted from CEH Edinburgh to Torrs Warren, Galloway in April 2013.
- Aims to record infection dynamics (Dothistroma needle blight, DNB), growth (height), branching, chlorophyll fluorescence, and defoliation across time.
- Detailed needle-level measurements were collected for infection-related traits on two dates (Sept 2013 and Oct 2014).

## Dataset contents
- Detailed_assessment_Sep_2013.csv: raw needle-level data for infected trees; measurements per needle include lesion length (LNL), number of lesions per needle (LPN), and lesion length (LL).
- Detailed_assessment_Oct_2014.csv: raw needle-level data for Oct 2014; measurements include total needles examined, presence of visible fruiting bodies on lesions (FBV), lesion length (LL), length of needles with lesions (LNL), and lesions per needle (LPN).
- Mean_phenotype_per_tree.csv: per-tree raw data and mean values for infection assessments, height measurements, chlorophyll fluorescence, branching, and defoliation; includes needle-derived means from the detailed assessments.
- Supporting documentation: context for the study “Susceptibility of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) to Dothistroma septosporum following natural inoculation at Torrs Warren, Galloway 2013-2015” (and related data descriptions).
- Mean_phenotype_per_tree.csv (expanded metadata): includes population, family, block, position, original tree number, fungicide treatment in 2015, geographic coordinates, altitude, multiple height records (2010–2015), branching counts, top missing/missing data indicators, infection measures by season/year, chlorophyll measurements, and defoliation data.

## Experimental design and origin
- Populations: eight Scottish Scots pine populations (Ballochbuie, Blackwood of Rannoch, Beinn Eighe, Coille Coire Chuilc, Glen Affric, Glen Loy, Glen Tanar, Rothiemurcus) with four families per population; six individuals per family (total 192 trees).
- Seed source and age: field-collected seed germinated spring 2007; transplanted in 2013 at age six.
- Site and layout: Torrs Warren site with randomised six-block design; one individual per family per block; 0.5 m spacing; guard row planted around the edge to reduce edge effects; pots of 6 litres; staking to ground.
- Management: annual weeding (brambles/bracken) in summer; GPS coordinates provided for corner trees of several blocks.

## Assessments and measurements
- Infection assessments: conducted every six months (autumn and spring) with estimated DNB severity as percent of current-year needles that are green and healthy; infection levels reported in 1% increments (1% ~ negligible <5%).
- Growth and morphology: tree height measured annually at end of growing season or early spring; branching recorded (March 2015) across 2013–2015.
- Physiological status: chlorophyll fluorescence measured July 2013 using HandyPea fluorometer (Fv/Fm to identify stress; values <0.8 flagged).
- Defoliation: estimated percentage defoliation of previous-year needles recorded October 2014.
- Data quality: all infection assessments conducted by a single observer (Annika Perry); DNB presence confirmed via culture from needles collected Sept 2013.

## Needle-level details and data quality
- Sept 2013 detailed assessment: up to 11 needles per infected tree; measurements per needle include length of lesions (LNL), number of lesions per needle (LPN), and lesion length (LL).
- Oct 2014 detailed assessment: up to 5 needles per infected tree; measurements include total needles examined, lesion length (LL), length of needles with lesions (LNL), presence of visible fruiting bodies on lesions (FBV), and lesions per needle (LPN).
- Data quality and provenance: infection data standardized by single researcher; culture-based verification of DNB to confirm infection presence.
- Data gaps: trees that died or were removed resulted in missing data; a list of dead/missing trees with dates is provided (e.g., tree 2; several others across blocks). Missing data denoted as NA in the dataset.

## Site, management, and geography
- Site context: Torrs Warren located near stands of Corsican and lodgepole pines; proximity to infected hosts; edge protection via guard row.
- Management notes: fungicide treatment applied in July 2015 to blocks 4, 5, and 6 as part of the PROTREE project; impact on endophyte communities studied in subsequent work.

## Purpose and provenance
- Primary purpose: contribute to Annika Perry’s PhD research (chapter 4) funded by NERC and Forest Research; part of the PROTREE project (funded by BBSRC, Defra, ESRC, Forestry Commission, NERC, Scottish Government) under Tree Health and Plant Biosecurity Initiative (grant BB/L012243/1).
- Related datasets: trees previously measured in situ at CEH Edinburgh for chlorophyll fluorescence and needle morphology; same block design retained; collaboration with Matti Salmela and Kevin Donnelly.
- Data usage notes: data used to examine susceptibility to DNB following natural inoculation and to explore relationships between infection, growth, and physiological traits; three blocks were fungicide-treated in 2015 for endophyte studies.

## Additional notes
- GPS coordinates for corner trees provided for several blocks (example coordinates listed for blocks 1, 3, 6, and 4 with associated families).
- Data are suitable for analyses linking infection dynamics with growth, morphology, and physiological responses, with consideration of missing data due to mortality and management interventions (e.g., fungicide).
