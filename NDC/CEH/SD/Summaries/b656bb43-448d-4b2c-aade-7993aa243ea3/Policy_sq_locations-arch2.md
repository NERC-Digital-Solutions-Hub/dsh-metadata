# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope: Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling strategy and future permission to survey land.
- Ensure surveys remain viable for informing environmental policy.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels

- Allowed releases: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) under licence to indicate which grid squares contain CS squares.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references only in VERY exceptional circumstances, after CEH processes to avoid direct release; exceptional external release requires demonstration that accompanying data/IP is equally or more confidential.
- Within-squares data (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals for the approved project.
- Licences are time-limited and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; never use data to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality level.
- A clause prohibits attempts to deduce exact square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; sign-off must be by authorized senior personnel.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising access applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; case-by-case for requests from other organizations.
- Partners are encouraged to consult with CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be as part of collaboration or paid support.

## Practical guidance for analysts monitoring the environment

- Use released four-digit grid references to identify which larger grid squares contain CS squares, without exposing precise locations.
- For precise location needs, request exceptional access through CEH and be prepared to justify high confidentiality needs.
- Plan data use to avoid impacts on landowner relations and future survey viability; adhere strictly to licence terms and destruction requirements.
- Seek CEH guidance on data handling, security, and project management standards (JCOP-equivalent) as part of the licensing process.
