# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise utility of CS spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Goal for data leaders: establish clear governance around sensitive location data, balancing public benefit with scientific integrity and landowner goodwill.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; FOI/Environmental Information Regulations apply for information requests.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Data access allows identifying whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (approximate location) can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise location) may be released only in very exceptional circumstances after CEH pre-processing, under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and require the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- Releasing precise location data by external parties requires demonstrating that the requester’s data/IP is equally or more confidential than CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality; data stored securely and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should compromise square confidentiality or be used to visit CS squares.
- Data must not be used to check individual landowner compliance within squares.
- If requested, evidence of project management standards equivalent to JCOP may be required.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; spatial data releases include a clause prohibiting attempts to derive precise locations from the data.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate terms; licences signed by authorised senior representatives of licensee organisations.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications and decision rationale.
- CEH may provide pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be as part of collaboration or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
