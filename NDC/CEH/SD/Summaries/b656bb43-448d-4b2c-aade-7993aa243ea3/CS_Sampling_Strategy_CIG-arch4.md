# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A detailed description of the sampling framework and evolution of the ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Core goal: produce representative, policy-relevant estimates of habitat and land-use features across Great Britain through a stratified, random sampling approach tied to an environmental land classification.
- Emphasizes the long-running, time-series nature of CS data and the need to understand how changes in classification affect national estimates.

## Key concepts and approach

- Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples represent variation across land types and avoid bias.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental-attribute–based system developed over time to stratify GB into land classes; originated from a Quadrat-based vegetation approach scaled to 1 km squares.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares; initial strategy used the centre of a 15 × 15 km grid; classification of surrounding squares also applied.
- Estimates: national habitat areas derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within a land class by the land class’s total area; results linked to maps and land-class descriptions.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and CS (timeline)

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used on 1228 central 1 km squares to define 32 land classes; surrounding squares allocated to classes.
  - 8 squares per class surveyed (total 256); national estimates based on class area and mean habitat per square.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the earlier classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to CS1990.
  - National estimates recalculated using the updated (1990) Land Classification.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Class count increased to 40 to enable Scotland reporting; 569 squares surveyed.
  - Emphasis on regionalization and policy use; national estimates aligned with Scotland reporting.
- 2000 (CS2000; Separate Country Estimates)
  - Addresses the need for England, Scotland, and Wales country units; classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata expanded to 40–45 with aggregations.
  - Additional squares added to ensure representation in each country; introduction of upland habitat sampling module.
- 2007 (CS2007; Wales-focused Reporting)
  - Wales reporting requirements lead to country-unit sub-divisions creating five new Welsh classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Welsh sampling increased to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; England sampling adjusted correspondingly.
  - Wales uplands continue to be emphasized; a Wales-focused revised map set used for England/Wales/Scotland.

## Sampling framework and methodology

- Land Classification as the stratification basis:
  - Original 32 classes (1978) expanded to 40 (1990) and then to 45 (2007) to accommodate country-specific reporting.
  - Classes defined by climate, geology, altitude, slope, and other environmental attributes.
- Sample allocation and size:
  - CS1978: 8 squares per class (256 total).
  - CS1984: 12 squares per class (384 total).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all squares classified; repeat vegetation quadrats).
  - CS2000: expanded to ensure country-unit representation; additional samples added (up to 30 for some classes; detailed in tables).
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments increased classes and Welsh squares; minimum 6 squares per Welsh class.
- Separate country estimates:
  - To support England+Wales and Scotland reporting, class definitions were subdivided by country unit; some aggregations used where class representation was sparse within a country.
- Upland module:
  - An extra module added in CS2000 to improve estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales, with 30 additional squares in relevant land classes.

## Country reporting and Wales/Uplands

- England, Scotland, and Wales treated as separate reporting units, requiring adjustments to sampling design to provide robust country-specific estimates.
- Wales required more intensive sampling due to devolution and policy needs; Wales-only classes introduced (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Uplands module focused on improving estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales, enhancing precision in those areas.

## Data outputs, maps, and calculation methods

- National estimates are derived from:
  - Mean habitat area per square within each land class.
  - Total area of each land class.
- Outputs include:
  - Tables and maps illustrating the distribution and sampling frames (e.g., revised land-class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; sample square maps).
  - Tables showing the number of squares surveyed per class and per survey year.
- Important note on consistency:
  - Changing the basic land classification affects the consistency of national estimates; for internal consistency, the latest classification is preferred, while for cross-survey consistency, older classifications may be used.
- The document includes extensive appendices and references detailing the evolution of the classification and rationale for methodological decisions.

## Data governance, quality, and challenges (implied for Data Leaders)

- Data standardization and metadata:
  - Clear documentation of land classifications, sample allocation, and estimation methods is essential for discoverability and reuse.
- Data gaps and granularity:
  - Representational challenges in certain countries (e.g., Wales) and the need for country-specific reporting led to class subdivisions and additional sampling.
- Cross-system comparability:
  - Shifts in classification across CS iterations complicate longitudinal comparability; researchers must consider classification version in trend analyses.
- Community and coordination:
  - The historical approach reflects a need for coordination across regions and policies; updates were driven by devolved administrations and policy requirements.
