# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Purpose and scope
- Establishes guidelines for a field-based ecological survey of Great Britain (Project 424) to create a quality baseline for land use, habitat, and physiography.
- Aims to compare ground survey results with aerial photography and previous surveys to assess changes over time.
- Defines a standardized data collection framework for future monitoring, including data quality and openness considerations.

## Sampling design and data content
- 1976–78 Project 424 created land classes; 1 km squares used for stratified sampling.
- 1984 plan expands to 384 squares across Great Britain (12 per class, 32 classes), with some exceptions.
- Each square collects land cover, land use, habitat features, and physiographic data to support landscape objectives.
- Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectares and 0.5 km length; emphasis on consistent, reproducible mapping.
- Data items are organized to be practical, compatible with prior surveys, and relevant for grid-based analysis.

## Planning and logistics
- Squares divided into seven groups; survey teams travel from research stations with liaison support.
- Each square typically requires about one person-day; travel time is a major cost factor.
- Three planning approaches discussed (local travel, short overnight stays, or longer groupings) to balance efficiency and coverage.
- Emphasis on minimizing revisits to reduce cost and time, while ensuring complete square coverage.

## Equipment
- Minimal field equipment; focus on mapping and recording rather than measurement.
- Provided items: FAB data recording booklets, 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, field handouts, coloured pens, maps for site locations, navigation gear, ID card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.

## Field procedure and permissions
- On arrival: quickly assess access, problems, and acquaint with the area.
- Obtain permissions for the entire square before beginning recording.
- Choose a route that enables full square coverage; ensure time to review and verify data after surveying.
- Permissions: essential for legal access, farmer goodwill, and background information; prior contact recommended to minimize delays.
- Maintain an up-to-date owner/tenant/contact list to support access and future surveys.
- Surveyors should conduct at least one farmer interview per square when possible to gather contextual information.

## Data recording, coding, and FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
- Mapping-centric data recording using a structured coding system to annotate 6" maps.
- Data codes are combined into alphanumeric entries to describe features efficiently (e.g., boundary types, vegetation combinations).
- Small boundary and feature details are distinctly coded; if complex, colours are used to distinguish categories.
- Each FAB summarizes a square with sections that mirror data categories and include series numbers, ownership, farmer information, physiography, land cover, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography, and post-survey procedures.
- Map units and categories are defined with extensive coding schemes to capture cover types, species, age, management, and land-use details.
- An emphasis on field decision-making: surveyors should make in-the-field calls with qualifying notes rather than deferring decisions to later processing.

## Section-by-section overview of FAB pages (structure and purpose)
- Cover: all sections completed; relates to the square’s identity and location.
- Ownership: identify and code land ownership and tenant status; record cooperative potential with a rating.
- Farmer/Landowner Information: contextual conversations; capture pertinent information without overburdening the farmer.
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliffs, rocks, peat, erosion, drainage, water bodies, and coast-related features.
- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: land cover categories (grazing, crops, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, etc.); curtilage rules; notes on species and management; specific crop and livestock codes.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland types, tree sizes, density, age, regeneration, plantations, belts, hedgerows, and related management descriptions; distinctions between individual trees, coppice, scrub, and belts.
- Boundaries: classify boundary types (walls, hedges, fences, gates) and describe conditions (stockproof, gaps filled, derelict sections); focus on boundary delineation and curtilage relevance.
- Recreation: formal vs informal recreation areas, including golf courses, playgrounds, and other amenities.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, descriptions of buildings (residential, industrial, public services, religious, institutional), new developments, derelict sites, and infrastructure (pipelines, signs, roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers).
- Photography: five photographs per square with specified viewpoints; precise marking of photo locations and directions.
- Procedure Subsequents to Survey: post-survey checks, data integrity, and guidance on data transfer (prefer originals; only transfer if necessary); reporting batch completion to Merlewood and logistics for transporting FABs.

## Coding conventions and color guidance
- Extensive numeric and alpha coding to capture complex land-cover and land-use information.
- A color-coding scheme is provided to facilitate quick interpretation of map features (e.g., residential buildings, curtilages, green for agriculture, yellow for residential areas, etc.). Colors are intended to complement the numeric codes and avoid clutter.

## Data governance, quality, and openness considerations
- The handbook emphasizes consistent, high-quality data capture at the source, with clear definitions and field qualifications to support comparability over time.
- Encourages sharing of underlying data where possible (aligned with later monitoring framework principles), while noting practical and ethical considerations around permissions and ownership data.
- By design, the framework supports reproducibility and future partial replacement sampling to increase statistical confidence for long-term monitoring.

## End notes and practical implications
- The handbook provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for documenting rural environments across Great Britain, enabling longitudinal analyses of land use, habitat change, and landscape structure.
- It demonstrates early attention to field-based data quality, metadata-like record-keeping, stakeholder permissions, and the need for consistent classifications to support policy-relevant environmental monitoring.
