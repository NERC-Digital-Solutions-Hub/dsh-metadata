# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Document describes the field survey sampling strategy used by Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Built on the ITE Land Classification stratification framework to produce representative national and country-specific environmental habitat estimates across Great Britain (GB): England, Scotland, and Wales, with later Wales-specific reporting.
  - Emphasizes the long-standing linkage between sampling design and the ability to detect change over time in environmental features.

- Core methodology
  - Stratified random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to divide GB into discrete strata (land classes) with similar environmental attributes.
  - Sample unit: 1 km square; sampling frame based on centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, later expanded to classify all squares in GB.
  - Initial approach (1978): 32 land classes; 8 samples per class (256 total); field surveys of vegetation, soils, and habitat areas.
  - Temporal progression:
    - 1984: 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification with added emphasis on land use and habitat mapping.
    - 1990 CS1990: All GB squares reclassified within a revised Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; incorporation of the Land Cover Map (satellite-derived).
    - 2000 CS2000: Land Classification expanded to allow separate country estimates; 40 strata; sub-division into country units (England with Wales, Scotland); additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
    - 2007 CS2007: Wales-focused reporting further refined; creation of Wales-specific land classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; added 43 Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); English classes adjusted (some with 4 squares) to preserve comparability and reporting needs.
  - National estimates and reporting
    - Estimates of habitat areas are derived by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
    - Country-level estimates are produced by aggregating across squares classified within each country unit (England with Wales, Scotland, and later Wales-specific reporting).
  - Outputs
    - Maps and tables detailing the distribution of Land Classes and sample squares.
    - Documentation of the number of squares per class and per country, plus sampling rates and stratum areas (tables and figures referenced throughout).

- Developments and adjustments over time
  - The Land Classification evolved from 32 classes (1978) to 40 (1990) to 45 (2007), with consequential impacts on sampling balance and the ability to report country-specific results.
  - Separate country units were introduced to support England with Wales and Scotland reporting, necessitating subdivisions and re-aggregation of classes to maintain adequate representation in each country.
  - Wales-specific reporting required additional Welsh samples and sub-division of certain Land Classes to reflect Wales’ habitat composition, while some English classes faced reduced sampling to maintain overall balance.
  - An uplands module for CS2000 improved estimation accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Data consistency and comparability
  - Acknowledges that changing the basic Land Classification can affect consistency of national stock estimates across surveys.
  - Recommends maintaining a consistent approach within a survey while acknowledging cross-survey differences; the report includes guidance on using the latest classification for internal consistency versus the original classification for cross-survey comparability.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a robust approach to designing long-term environmental monitoring with evolving classifications to meet policy needs (country-specific reporting) while preserving a coherent timeseries.
  - Highlights trade-offs between increasing regional specificity (country units) and maintaining statistical precision, requiring careful allocation of additional sampling.
  - Provides a detailed accounting of sample numbers, strata definitions, and geographic coverage that informs replication and governance of monitoring datasets.
  - Underlines the importance of documenting classification changes and their impact on comparability to support transparent decision-making and data governance.
