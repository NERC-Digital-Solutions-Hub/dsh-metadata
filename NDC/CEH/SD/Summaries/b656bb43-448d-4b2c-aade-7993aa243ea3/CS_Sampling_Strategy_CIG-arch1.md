# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The field survey component of Countryside Survey 2007 uses the ITE Land Classification as its sampling framework and is built on three decades of methodological development. The goal is to stratify the landscape into representative units to enable robust national, regional, and eventually country-specific estimates of habitats and land use change.

- Core ideas
  - Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across ecological variation.
  - The ITE Land Classification correlates environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) with land-use and habitat types to create discrete strata (land classes).
  - The sampling framework has evolved from a 32-class system to more refined schemes (ultimately 40–45 classes) to support country-level reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and Wales-only reporting.

- Evolution of the sampling framework and key milestones
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 central 1 km squares.
    - Sampling: eight 1 km squares per land class (total 256 squares) surveyed in summers 1977–1978.
    - national habitat estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square with the area of each land class.
  - 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384) to improve precision.
    - Results published later; continued use of the 1978 Land Classification as the basis for national estimates.
  - 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990): All Squares Land Classification
    - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB; urban and sea corrections applied.
    - Field survey included 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats from 1978 and additional features were recorded.
    - national estimates based on the revised, all-squares classification; results linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - Outcome: recognition that full GB-wide classification at high detail was not scalable; led to further refinement strategies.
  - Early 1990s–2000 – Developments toward a scalable, regional/local framework
    - To enable regional and local estimates, major factors were captured for each GB square and multiple classification approaches tested.
    - The best simulation achieved 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classification; non-matching squares generally mapped to neighboring classes with similar characteristics.
  - 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000): Separate country estimates and expanded classes
    - Motivation: policy needs for separate England, Scotland, and Wales estimates; improved accuracy for upland habitats; address under-representation of some classes.
    - Framework adjusted to create “country units” (England with Wales; Scotland) with 40 strata through sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes.
    - Additional samples added (19 squares in total for Wales coverage; 11 more across England to balance sampling rates); a dedicated uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
    - Wales’s sample was more intensively represented than Scotland or England to support Wales-only reporting.
    - Summary: substantial re-mapping and reallocation of samples to support country-specific reporting; total GB sample squares in CS2000 varied by class and country.
  - 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007: Welsh-only reporting and further refinements
    - Wales required Wales-only habitat status reporting; England and Wales classes were split into country-unit variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Class system expanded to 45 strata; 43 additional squares allocated to Wales to ensure a minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
    - England saw adjustments where Welsh squares were removed from certain classes, with two English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares each; overall, the precision of English estimates was deemed acceptable for reporting.
    - England, Wales, and Scotland were represented with revised Land Class maps for the CS2007 framework.
    - Summary: Wales-focused reporting was implemented, with refined country-unit classifications and targeted additional sampling in Wales to improve Wales-specific estimates.

- Data usage and reporting
  - National estimates have historically used the Land Classification framework to convert square-level data into area estimates per land class, then scaled by the land class area.
  - For consistency across surveys, there is a preference to use the latest Land Classification for country estimates, but older classifications were used to maintain comparability across surveys. Table 4 demonstrates how sample sizes differ when using the original 1990 classification versus the latest classification for each survey.
  - The CS2000 and CS2007 iterations emphasized country-level reporting (England & Wales together, and Scotland separately) and then Wales-only reporting, with explicit sub-division and aggregation of land classes to maintain representative sampling within each country unit.

- Sample sizes and structure (high-level)
  - GB-wide sampling scale evolved from 256 squares (1978) to larger, country-specific schemes (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - In CS2007, the overall GB sampling rate reached a total of 591 sample squares, with separate country-level allocations to support Wales-only estimates and Wales-specific land-class sub-divisions.
  - The document provides detailed class-by-class and country-by-country tallies (including total GB squares, stratum areas, and sample counts) to justify precision and representation, as well as notes on adjustments required for Wales reporting and upland habitat estimation.

- Additional context and notes
  - A 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the basic national-estimation classification affects consistency with past stock estimates, hence a balance between country-specific adaptability and cross-survey consistency.
  - An uplands module was incorporated in CS2000 to improve upland habitat estimates by allocating extra squares to upland classes.
