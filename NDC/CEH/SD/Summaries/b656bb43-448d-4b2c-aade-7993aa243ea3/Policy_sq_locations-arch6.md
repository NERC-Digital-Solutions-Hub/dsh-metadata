# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest aligned; handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.

## Governance and responsibilities
- Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences; annual reporting on applications and grounds for decisions.
- CEH may provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data.

## Access framework: precision and circumstances
- Licenced access can reveal approximate locations via four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid square).
- Six-digit (precise) locations are only allowed under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform preprocessing to avoid release where possible.
- Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and is subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licencees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; licensees must not use data to identify square locations.

## Licensing process and guidance
- Hardcopy licences containing confidentiality clauses are issued and signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under relevant acts and regulations.
- CEH provides an annual summary of applications and decisions.
- Where feasible, CEH assists with preprocessing for internal CS uses; external requests evaluated case-by-case.
- Prospective users are advised to engage with CEH early to define requirements and appropriate use, potentially via collaborative or paid arrangements.
