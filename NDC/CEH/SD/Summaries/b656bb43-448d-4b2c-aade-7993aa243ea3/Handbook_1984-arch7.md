# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and context
  - Guidelines for a GB-wide ecological survey (Project 424) that built on Land Classes from a multivariate classification of 1 km squares.
  - Aims to establish a quality baseline for future monitoring of habitats, land use, and landscape features, using ground surveys and aerial photography for comparison.
  - Data items are designed to be practical and compatible with previous surveys while allowing future relevance and grid-based analysis.

- Sampling design and organization
  - Survey of 384 squares (12 per each of 32 land classes) across Great Britain (apart from a few exceptions).
  - Squares divided into seven groups and surveyed by teams from six ITE research stations, with liaison teams for coverage.
  - Typical survey time per square estimated as one day; travel time is a key cost factor; planning supports routes that minimize repeated visits.
  - Field procedures emphasize permissions, route planning, and full square coverage.

- Field workflow and permissions
  - Early on-site assessment of access and potential problems; obtain permissions for the entire square before surveying.
  - Maintain goodwill with landowners/farmers; carry identity and explain the project to facilitate access.
  - A farmer/landowner information sheet and ownership data sheet help with background context and follow-up surveys.
  - Permits are essential; refusals can waste completed work, though past experience shows permissions are usually obtainable.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Minimal equipment: mapping and recording focus rather than measurement-intensive work.
  - Equipment categories:
    - Provided: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), square maps, film, handouts, colored pens, location maps, navigation tools, ITE ID card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.
  - Emphasis on field practicality and mobility; aim to complete surveys efficiently in the field.

- Data recording and the coding system
  - Data are annotated on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a predefined set of options; numeric codes are combined into single alpha characters to save space.
  - Field decisions are made in the moment; if necessary, qualifiers or notes are added to ensure clarity.
  - Boundaries and different boundary types are explicitly coded; where needed, maps are annotated with notes or color to reduce clutter.
  - The survey emphasizes recording at the smallest possible field corner and ensuring complete coverage to the square edge.

- FAB structure and data items
  - Each square’s data are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), which accompanies the 6" maps.
  - Key FAB sections and their purposes:
    - Cover: Complete location, series number, and basic metadata.
    - Ownership: Identify ownership for all parts of the square; mark tenants and owners; rate cooperative potential of landowners for future surveys.
    - Farmer/Landowner Information: Anecdotal background and conversation notes; aim to engage at least one farmer per square.
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: Document physiographic features (cliff, rock outcrop, peat, erosion, ground leveling), inland water features (rivers, lakes, ponds), and coastal features.
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: Describe ground cover types, crops, natural vegetation, moorland, heath, marsh, and aquatic vegetation; include notes on species and habitat proportions; record fertility and land use patterns; provide height or density qualifiers where relevant.
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: Record woodland units, tree and shrub cover, coppice, age classes, proportions, and management status; distinguish between scattered trees, lines, belts, and individual trees; capture species and use (amenity, recreation, shelter, etc.).
    - Boundaries: Classify boundary types (walls, hedges, fences), describe conditions, and annotate gaps or changes in stockproofing; record boundaries where relevant to curtilages.
    - Recreation: Map formal and informal recreational uses of land; document public access features.
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications: Capture built covers, buildings by use (residential, industrial, public services, educational, religious, institutional), and associated structures (pipelines, signs, barriers); include color-coding conventions for map clarity.
    - Photography: Five photographs per square from specified viewpoints; record exact photo locations on the FAB with directional arrows.
  - Notes on coding
    - Use a combination of cover-type codes with sub-codes for species, height, age, and management where applicable.
    - Use X marks for specific features (e.g., hedgerow trees); use color coding to represent complex areas when necessary.
    - Some sections reference detailed code lists (e.g., species, boundary descriptions, boundary conditions) to support consistent data capture.

- Data quality, interpretation, and field decisions
  - Emphasis on making field decisions locally; post-survey processing should not override field judgments.
  - Where information is uncertain, use qualifying notes on the FAB rather than delaying decisions.
  - For edge cases or atypical features, provide commentary and rely on the stated coding guidelines to preserve data integrity.

- Photography and post-survey workflow
  - Photographs are intended to reflect the square and nearby countryside, with careful framing to avoid excessive sky or distant features.
  - After surveying, review FAB pages for omissions; avoid transcription to fresh maps unless absolutely necessary to protect originals.
  - Report completion batches to Merlewood and arrange transport of completed FAB squares as logistics allow.

- Map scale, units, and data integration
  - Mapping is conducted on 1:10,000 scale with formal minimum mapping units defined within the FAB; data are intended to be compatible with prior surveys and suitable for integration with aerial photography results (ITE 899) for change detection.
  - The approach supports building grid-based data products that can be combined with other data sources while preserving legacy comparability.

- Practical outcomes for GIS specialists
  - A comprehensive, code-driven methodology for capturing landscape, land-use, habitat, and infrastructure data at a standardized, square-based grid.
  - A robust field data collection framework designed to produce detailed, multi-layer GIS-ready attributes tied to precise map features.
  - Explicit guidance on data quality, field decision-making, and post-survey workflows to support repeatable, auditable GIS datasets over time.
