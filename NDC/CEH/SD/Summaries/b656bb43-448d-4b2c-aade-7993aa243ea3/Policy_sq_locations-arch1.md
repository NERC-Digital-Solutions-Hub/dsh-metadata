# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The aim is to maximise the public value of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. This policy covers only survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners, which sustains the scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and permission to survey land in the future.
- Public interest rationale: confidentiality supports ongoing survey capability and informed environmental policy.

## When and how locations may be released
- Access can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate locations are valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid release.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, linear features) can potentially identify square locations and thus are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Exceptional access criteria
- To receive six-digit location data externally, the requester must demonstrate in legal terms that their IP behind the CS data requires equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- For four-digit grid references, the IP confidentiality criteria are less stringent than for six-digit releases.
- Any attempt to derive precise square locations from released data or related materials is prohibited.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite, tied to specific projects, and data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at the end of the licence.
- No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the highest IP confidentiality, and are designed to prevent attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences.
- Written licences must be signed by an authorised senior official from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow relevant Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH will provide an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and outcomes.
- For internal CS partner use, CEH will provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for a negotiated fee.
