# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners listed (CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act/Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- General access allows identifying whether squares fall inside predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate square location at coarse resolution.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations; licensing requires demonstration that dependent IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to identified individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences granted for finite periods for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- End-of-period: written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
- No data/derived information should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit release licences are similar but do not require the same IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences signed by authorised senior representatives; must reflect policy terms.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for other organisations.
- Partners and potential data users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
