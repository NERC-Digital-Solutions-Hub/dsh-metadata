# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Document detailing the sampling strategy used for the field survey element of Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Traces the development of the ITE Land Classification and its application across CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Emphasizes the link between sampling design and the ability to detect change over time in the British countryside.

- Data governance, standards, and comparability
  - The ITE Land Classification provides the stratification framework for sampling GB countryside; classifications evolve across surveys (32, 40, then 45 classes).
  - Changing classifications affect the consistency of national estimates; two approaches discussed:
    - Use the latest classification for GB-wide estimates (preferred for consistency within a survey).
    - Use the original classification (e.g., CS1990) for cross-survey comparability.
  - Acknowledges need for consistent metadata, documentation, and traceability when classifications change.

- Sampling framework and design
  - Core principle: stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and minimize bias.
  - Early approach (CS1978): center squares of a 15x15 km grid classified into 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class (256 total).
  - 1984 update: expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve estimates.
  - 1990: Land Classification revised to include all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; additional data re-recorded from 1984; Land Cover Map linked to satellite data.
  - 2000: further refinements to enable separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) with 40 strata; additional 1 km squares added to adjust representation.
  - 2007: Wales-specific adjustments to enable Wales-only reporting; creation of country-unit versions of classes (five new Welsh-focused classes); total strata increased to 45; 43 Welsh extra squares added; England adjustments maintained precision in some classes.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - After devolution, increased emphasis on country-specific reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) to satisfy policy needs.
  - Implementation included class subdivision by country unit and targeted sampling in Welsh and upland/marginal upland areas.
  - Upland habitat module added in CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland estimates in England and Wales.

- Data products, documentation, and accessibility
  - Field survey data and results are published in multiple reports:
    - Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
    - Accounting for nature (CS2000) and related publications.
    - Countryside Survey UK Results from 2007 (CS2007) and associated CEH reports.
  - Annexes and appendices include a brief history of the ITE Land Classification and evolution across surveys (e.g., Appendix i, landscape classification history).
  - Figures and tables (e.g., Land Class maps, sample square distributions, and class summaries) accompany the narrative to document sampling frames and changes.

- Data quality, limitations, and considerations
  - Land Classification reconciliation: 1990 reclassification caused some squares to move classes; around 62% correspondence with prior classifications in some comparisons, with most moves into neighboring classes.
  - Representation imbalances: some classes under-represented after revisions necessitated additional sampling (CS2000 and CS2007).
  - Wales reporting: Welsh sampling initially underpowered for Wales-only reporting; addressed by introducing Welsh-specific sub-classes and additional Welsh squares.
  - Cross-survey comparability: ongoing tension between adopting new classifications for internal consistency and maintaining cross-survey comparability; recommendation to use latest classification for national estimates within a survey while acknowledging cross-survey consistency issues.

- Methods and methodological evolution (highlights)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to inform land-class groupings at smaller scales and then scaled to national stratification.
  - 1 km square sampling as the fundamental unit, balancing field survey practicality with ecological representativeness.
  - Use of class-level areas to estimate national habitat areas (area of class × mean habitat area per square within class).
  - Adjustments to sampling rates and class structure over time to reflect policy needs and improved understanding of land-use patterns.

- Challenges and ongoing considerations for data stewards
  - Maintaining time-series integrity amid evolving land classifications and country-focused reporting requirements.
  - Ensuring adequate sample sizes across all Land Classes, particularly for Wales and upland regions.
  - Documenting classification changes, sampling amendments, and their impact on estimates and uncertainty.
  - Providing clear guidance on preferred practices for national vs. country-specific reporting when using historical and contemporary classifications.
  - Coordinating cross-agency collaboration and ensuring transparent metadata to support reuse and discovery of historical and current survey data.

- Historical context and references
  - The document provides a concise history of the ITE Land Classification and its application across five major CS surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) and outlines the resulting data products and national estimates.
