# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- A field survey handbook (1984) detailing the planning, collection, recording, and management of data across Great Britain for ecological and land-use assessment.
- Core aim: establish a quality baseline for land use, habitat, and landscape change via ground surveys and aerial photography, enabling future comparisons and potential partial replacement sampling.

## Purpose, scope, and design

- Defines a standardized set of guidelines to survey 1:10,000 scale squares derived from a grid of 1 km squares (Land Classes) to capture land cover, land use, habitat features, and landscape components.
- Data items are selected to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant for grid-based analysis and nationwide comparisons.
- The 1984 program covers 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes) with some exceptions, intended to improve statistical confidence and future partial re-surveys.

## Study design and coverage

- Survey teams: six ITE research stations, with ~56 squares per team; some liaison with Merlewood teams.
- Each square planning emphasizes travel efficiency and avoiding double visits, with schedule and cost considerations driving the distribution of survey days.
- Planning explores multiple options: daily travel for single squares, overnight stays for two squares, or longer blocks for groups of squares.

## Planning and logistics

- Emphasizes the cost and time implications of field travel, the need to gain permissions before surveying, and the practicalities of access to all parts of a square.
- Aims to minimize delays from permissions refusals; prior contact can help but may cause delays.
- Survey teams operate with local ownership information and a directory of owner/tenant interactions to facilitate access.

## Equipment

- Minimal field gear: data recording booklets (FABs), 6" (1:10,000) maps, photo films, color pens, maps for locating sites, navigation tools, identity card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, and a camera.

## Suggested field procedures

- On arrival: assess access, potential problems, and acquaint with the area.
- Obtain permissions for the entire square before beginning.
- Plan a route to ensure full coverage of the square.
- After surveying: review records for omissions and ensure clear, complete presentation.

## Permissions

- Permissions ensure legal access and goodwill with farmers/owners and access to background information.
- Before survey, obtain permission for all parts of the square; refusals are rare but would waste already gathered work.
- Prior contact is common but may cause delays; surveyors carry identity and background information to facilitate access.

## Data recording and coding

- The survey is essentially a mapping exercise; data are annotated on 6" maps (1:10,000) with a structured set of codes.
- Data codes support combination of information across categories (e.g., boundaries, vegetation, land use) and are designed to be linked in a way that preserves data integrity and interpretability.
- Data sheets (FAB) include coding boxes to allow compact, linked numerical and alpha codes that describe features (e.g., boundary characteristics, habitat types, and cover).
- Decisions about recording are made in the field by the surveyor; explicit notes or qualifying comments are encouraged where the code does not fit neatly.

## The FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)

- Each square’s data are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), intended to be used with the 6" maps.
- Page structure and essential data:
  - Cover: series number, location, and basic metadata.
  - Ownership: mark ownership of all land units; tenant vs. owner; cooperative level of owners (0–3 scale) for potential follow-up.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: contextual conversation prompts; interviewer notes to capture background commentary without overbearing the farmer.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: codes for cliffs, rocks, boulders, peat, drainage, water bodies, shores, and related features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: broad cover types, natural and agricultural vegetation, crops, habitat types, and quantifiable measures (e.g., % cover, height classes).
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: recording of woodland units, tree/stem data, species, age classes, regeneration, and management status.
  - Boundaries: documentation of boundary types, descriptions, and gaps; focus on stockproofing and boundary integrity.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreational uses and facilities.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, descriptions, and relationships to curtilages; roads, tracks, footpaths, and other infrastructure.
  - Photography: five photographs per square with precise location and direction notes; to minimize extraneous imagery.
  - Procedures Subsequent to Survey: post-survey checks and data handling policies, including avoiding transcription if possible and notifying Merlewood when batches are finished.

## Data categories and coding conventions (highlights)

- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliff types, rock outcrops, peat (including eroding peat), drainage signs, lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, springs, ditches, levees, etc.
- Cover types and vegetation (Agriculture/Natural Vegetation): codes for amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, various aquatic and marsh communities, and major crop types. Specific notes on curtilage recording, hedges, and mosaics.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: coverage of scattered trees, coppice, woodland/forest, scrub, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, age classes, regeneration, and management status (unmanaged, planted, underplanting, etc.).
- Boundaries: identification and classification of boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, stockproof boundaries) with notes on gaps and fill-ins.
- Recreation: formal and informal recreational features and land uses.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, purposes (residential, industrial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional), and associated infrastructure (roadways, pipelines, signs, fences, gates, etc.).
- Colour conventions: recommended colors to represent various land-use categories to reduce coding complexity on maps.

## Photography and post-survey procedures

- Photography protocol: five slides per square; mark exact photo locations and directions on FAB.
- Post-survey: verify completeness; avoid transcription unless absolutely necessary; report batches to Merlewood and arrange transport of completed FAB squares when feasible.

## Data usage, challenges, and considerations

- Outputs are designed to enable self-service data exploration through standardized maps and coded data; outputs support longitudinal analyses of rural environments and land-use change.
- Key challenges include obtaining permissions, dealing with patchy or variable data, and maintaining consistent communication of complex information through simple summaries.
- The handbook underlines a strong emphasis on data consistency, metadata clarity, and the ability to compare field data with aerial photography to establish a robust baseline for future monitoring.

## End-to-end data lifecycle implications for a Data Support role

- Data capture: standardized FAB-based recording with explicit coding to support cross-square aggregation and comparison.
- Data quality: field decisions documented; explicit comments and qualifiers encouraged to preserve data nuance.
- Data integration: codes designed to be combinable across categories (e.g., vegetation, boundaries, and land use) for cohesive datasets and grid-level analysis.
- Data products: map-based outputs, summarized statistics by land class, and potential for dashboards or pivot-like reports enabling end users to explore outputs themselves.
- Data sharing: batch submission workflows and coordination with the Merlewood team for continuity and future re-surveys.
