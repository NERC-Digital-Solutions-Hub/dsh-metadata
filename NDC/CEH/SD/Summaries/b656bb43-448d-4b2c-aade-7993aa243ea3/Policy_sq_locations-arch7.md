# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview and scope
- Aims to maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Protects capacity to inform environmental policy in the public interest.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- Access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit (precise) grid references: CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid release; exceptionally, release may occur under licence if justified legally and IP/confidentiality criteria are met.
- Spatial data from within squares could indirectly reveal square locations and therefore are released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing terms and confidentiality
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorized personnel.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained beyond the project’s scope.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.

## Four-digit vs six-digit releases
- Four-digit releases follow similar licensing terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level.
- Four-digit releases still prohibit attempts to identify precise CS square locations.

## Roles, responsibilities, and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under applicable Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual public report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH strives to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
