# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview
- A 1984 field survey framework for assessing rural environments across Great Britain.
- Part of Project 424; establishes a quality baseline to compare ground surveys with aerial photography.
- Sampling design uses 32 land classes, with 384 squares (12 per class) surveyed 1 km grid-wide; aims to standardize data for future comparisons.
- Intended to produce compatible data across past and future surveys, with prospects for partial replacement sampling and increased statistical confidence.

## Data Collection Framework
- Field teams: Six ITE research stations with a roving liaison team; roughly 56 squares per team; coordination with Merlewood.
- Scheduling: Each square planned for about one day in many cases; cost constraints favor travel-based surveying (no overnight subsistence) and flexible planning (one day per square, or short roving blocks).
- Planning considerations: Accessibility, travel time, and the efficiency of completing squares to avoid re-visits.

## Data Standards and Recording
- Minimal equipment: Maps (6" x 1:10,000), FAB data recording booklets, photos, pens, clipboards, identity cards, and weather gear.
- Data recording approach: Square-centered, using 6" maps annotated with coded data; numeric and alpha codes combine to describe land features, with data boxes supporting multi-code entries.
- Map unit scale and boundaries: Minimum mappable unit defined (1/2 hectare; about 1/5 km), with clear boundary delineation (fences, hedges, etc.) and edge-square completeness.
- FAB structure: Per-square booklet containing series/plot identifiers, ownership, farmer information, physiography, land cover, vegetation, buildings, boundaries, recreation, and photography notes; emphasis on consistency and traceability.
- Color conventions and coding: Use of color to distinguish complex groupings when numeric coding becomes impractical; explicit guidance on where codes apply (e.g., curtilages, built-up areas).

## Permissions and Governance
- Permissions required to access all parts of each square; emphasis on farmer/landowner cooperation and background information collection.
- Ownership and tenancy: Marks on ownership data sheets; T for tenants; C for owners with changes since 1977/78.
- Stakeholder engagement: Encourage interviews with at least one farmer per square; maintain a non-intrusive approach to data capture.
- Identity and records: Carry ITE identity, maintain updated ownership names and addresses, and document cooperative levels (0–3 scale) to gauge potential for further surveys.

## Data Items and Coding Schemes
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: Codes for cliffs, rocks, peat, erosion, drainage, rivers, lakes, ponds, ditches, levees, shores, and related features.
- Cover Types and Vegetation (Agriculture/Natural Vegetation): Codes for amenity grassland, pasture, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, farmland crops, fallow/abandoned land, and species-specific registers (e.g., major grasses and non-native species). Includes crop recognition guidance and height/age modifiers.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: Codes for woodland types, tree groups (scattered trees, coppice, lines of trees, belts, hedgerows), regeneration, age classes, species, and management status (unmanaged, underplanting, plantation).
- Boundaries: Various boundary types (walls, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries) with descriptive notes to add context; recording emphasis on curtilage boundaries.
- Recreation: Formal and informal recreation sites and uses, including public spaces and amenities.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: Built cover types, descriptions, and associated infrastructure (roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers, signs, pipelines, etc.), with color-coding guidance for map readability.
- Photography: Five slides per square, with explicit guidance to capture representative views and precise geolocation/direction indicators on the FAB.
- Data Integration: Instructions for combining and reconciling complex mosaics into representative unit codes; guidance on avoiding map clutter by using color and consolidated coding where necessary.

## Data Management Workflow
- Post-survey procedures: Review data for omissions; avoid data transposition onto new maps unless necessary; batch submission to Merlewood; arrange transport of completed FABs and squares promptly.
- Documentation and provenance: Emphasis on maintaining consistent documentation for traceability and future data sharing.
- Long-term goals: Ensure data are discoverable, reusable, and comparable with earlier surveys and future data collections; document work performed on datasets for reuse.

## Data Quality and Reuse
- Emphasis on field judgment: Surveyors must make in-field decisions and qualify unusual observations, recognizing that field interpretation can differ from codified categories.
- Consistency and comparability: Definitions and categories are designed to be compatible with prior surveys and later ones, supporting longitudinal analyses.
- Transparency of limitations: Clear guidelines on when to note limitations, changes, or uncertainties on the FAB.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges
- Anticipated challenges for data stewardship include incomplete user needs, timely data acquisition, standard adherence across multiple systems and formats, large dataset handling, and legacy database interoperability.
- The handbook directly addresses these through standardized protocols, explicit data codes, structured data sheets, permissions governance, and a rigorous, auditable workflow for field data capture and post-survey processing.
