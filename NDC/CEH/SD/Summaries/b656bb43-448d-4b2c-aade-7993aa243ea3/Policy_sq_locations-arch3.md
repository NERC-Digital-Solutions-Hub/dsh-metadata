# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Scope: Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future surveying permissions.
- Public interest rationale to protect these elements; requests for location data handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Conditions under which locations may be released
- Access may indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Precise six-digit grid references require CEH preprocessing to avoid release; in very exceptional cases, location information may be released externally under licence if the requester demonstrates IP confidentiality at least equal to CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify a square and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit location data.
- Release levels are governed by strict licensing terms and confidentiality considerations.

## Specific conditions of licence and release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality and store data securely; access limited to named individuals for approved purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at license end.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; no use to plan landowner visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have slightly less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; approvals follow the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; requests from non-partner organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use location data covered by the policy; CEH may assist as a scientific lead and support use of the data, potentially involving collaboration or payment.
