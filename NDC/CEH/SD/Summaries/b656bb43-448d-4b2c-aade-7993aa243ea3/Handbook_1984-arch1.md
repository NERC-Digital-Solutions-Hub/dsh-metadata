# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - A field methodology guide for Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain, aiming to establish a baseline for land use and habitats by comparing ground surveys and aerial photography.
  - Provides a standardized approach to collect comparable data across GB, including land cover, land use, habitat features, and landscape context, with an eye to later reuse and metadata tracking.
  - Emphasizes the creation of a quality baseline for future monitoring and potential partial sampling in the future.

- Planning and sampling design
  - Land classes: 32 strata defined from a multivariate classification; data collection focuses on 1 km squares within these classes.
  - Sample design: initial work in 1977/78 used 256 1x1 squares (8 per land class). The 1984 effort expands to 384 squares (12 per class) across GB to improve statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling.
  - Survey teams: six ITE research stations with a roving liaison team; each size-up and schedule to balance thoroughness with cost/time (travel between sites emphasized).
  - Practical planning notes: avoid visiting a site twice if possible; daily travel-based costings; several planning options (e.g., one square per day, one night away for two squares, etc.).

- Equipment
  - Minimal but essential gear: FAB data recording booklets, 1:10,000 maps, field films, cameras, color pens, navigation tools, ITE identity card, weather gear, and reference materials.
  - Equipment organization supports map-based recording and on-site coding of features.

- Field procedures
  - On arrival: quickly assess access, identify potential problems, and secure permissions for the whole square.
  - Route planning: choose a route that ensures full square coverage.
  - Review: after completion, read through records for omissions and ensure clear, consistent presentation.

- Permissions
  - Securing access is essential for legal and background information, and to avoid wasted effort if permission is refused later.
  - Prior contact is advised, though not strictly required; surveyors carry identity and background materials to explain the project.
  - Maintain an owner/occupier contact list and update ownership details for future surveys.

- Data recording and FAB (Field Assessment Booklet) structure
  - The survey is a mapping exercise: annotating 6" maps with standardized data codes; use of numeric codes that can be combined into single alpha characters to summarize complex features.
  - Decision-making in the field is the surveyor’s responsibility; codes should be used with notes or qualifiers when needed.
  - The FAB collects data in a defined sequence and pages, with emphasis on consistency and the ability to cross-link codes with map features.
  - Minimum mappable unit: 1/20 ha with length units defined; ensure edge of square is fully recorded.
  - Mosaic and complex vegetation areas may require multi-code representations to reflect composition and cover percentages.

- Coding conventions and map notation
  - Codes are combined in boxes to encode multiple attributes; color conventions recommended for readability when necessary.
  - Boundaries, boundary types, and boundary conditions are recorded with specific codes; perpendicular marking used to delineate components where relevant.
  - Dominant land cover or habitat type should be listed first, with subsequent components recorded as additional codes.

- Data sheets and categories (page-by-page guidance)
  - 1. Cover: general land-cover types and qualifiers; built environment excluded from certain curtilage categories.
  - 2. Ownership: identify ownership and occupancy; indicate tenant farmers and owners; capture respondent cooperation levels.
  - 3. Farmer/Landowner Information: informal conversations to capture contextual information; steer conversations to posed questions when possible.
  - 4. Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: landforms, cliffs, outcrops, peats, water bodies, drainage, springs, rivers, ditches, levees, shores, substrates; detailed codes for multiple features.
  - 5. Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: ground cover categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorlands, heaths, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow, abandoned land, etc.); species lists and proportions; height classes and agricultural practices; specific codes for stock types and farmed products.
  - 6. Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland types, tree and shrub categories, individual trees, belts, hedgerows, regeneration, age, planting, and management status; use of specific sub-codes for canopy cover, regeneration, and management.
  - 7. Boundaries: boundary types (walls, fences, hedges, stockproof boundaries, gaps filled, etc.); descriptive codes to add information about boundary condition and stockproof status.
  - 8. Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas or uses.
  - 9. Buildings/Structures/Communications: built-cover types, specific uses (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, education/cultural, religious, institutional), new developments, derelict or vacant buildings, and associated infrastructure (pipelines, signage, roads, tracks, footpaths, airports, etc.); color-coding recommendations for common curtilage and building types.
  - 10. Photography: five slides per square, with precise location and direction marks; front cover photo and representative views.
  - 11. Procedure following survey: post-survey data checks; avoid unnecessary transcription if possible; batch communication with Merlewood; organize transport of FABs.

- Photography and post-survey handling
  - Five photographs per square to capture key features; precise geolocation and directions must be annotated on FAB.
  - After-survey checks to minimize omissions; if transposition is necessary, do so only if essential to preserve original maps; batch submission and reporting to Merlewood are required.

- End-of-document notes
  - The handbook documents the grid layout, sample sizes, and cross-referencing with earlier surveys to ensure temporal comparability.
  - Emphasizes data quality, traceability of sources, and making derived datasets discoverable with metadata.

- Relevance for data analysts
  - Provides a detailed, codified data-collection framework designed for large-scale, standardized ecological surveys.
  - Enables systematic cross-tabulation of land cover, land use, physiography, vegetation, and man-made features across GB.
  - Supports longitudinal analysis by aligning with earlier field work and enabling future partial sampling and re-visit plans.
  - Highlights the importance of metadata, provenance, permissions, and data quality in large environmental datasets.
