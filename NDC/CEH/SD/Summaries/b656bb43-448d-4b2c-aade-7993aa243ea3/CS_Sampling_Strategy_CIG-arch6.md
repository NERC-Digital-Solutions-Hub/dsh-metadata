# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose
  - Document the evolution of the sampling strategy and ITE Land Classification used to frame Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
  - Show how stratification, classification, and country-specific adjustments underpin national estimates of habitat features.

- Key concepts for data support
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representativeness and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to create land classes that stratify GB.
  - National estimates are derived by combining class-level statistics (mean habitat area per square) with the total area of each class.

- Evolution at a glance (chronological highlights)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - Indicator Species Analysis used to define 32 land classes from 1228 center 1km squares; 4 surrounding squares per centre classified.
    - Final frame: 6039 km squares classified; 256 field samples (8 squares per class).
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 km squares per class (384 total); results published later.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Land Classification updated to cover all GB 1km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; expanded data collection to include prior quadrat data.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 classification; results published in 1993.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 retrospective alignment)
    - Classification extended to classify every GB square with a streamlined approach (surrogate drivers for some variables); 40 classes.
    - 569 squares surveyed; resulted in better regional comparability, including Scotland reporting.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; CS2000)
    - Introduced separate country estimates (England&Wales vs Scotland) with country-unit versions of land classes.
    - Sub-division of classes and aggregation to create 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure representation; upland habitat module added to improve accuracy in upland England and Wales.
    - Wales receiving enhanced sampling due to policy/legislation needs.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007; CS2007)
    - Wales-focused reporting requirements led to Welsh-only class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and 43 additional Welsh squares.
    - Total strata increased to 45; Wales targeted representation with a minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; England adjustments maintained overall precision.
    - England retained most classes but in some cases (5e, 15e) dropped to 4 squares per class.

- Sampling framework and class structure
  - Land Classes
    - Original: 32 classes (1978 framework).
    - Expanded in subsequent surveys to 40 classes (1990 alignment; Scotland reporting).
    - Further subdivisions for country-unit reporting increased to 45 strata for CS2007.
  - Country-unit approach
    - England & Wales as one unit; Scotland as a separate unit (with Isle of Man adjustments over time).
    - Welsh and English-class sub-divisions created to enable Wales-only reporting.
  - Sample sizes and distribution
    - CS1990: 508 squares; continued refinement in CS2000 and CS2007 to balance representation across country units and new classes.
    - Table summaries show per-class and per-country allocations, with targeted minimums to ensure statistical reliability.

- Uplands and special modules
  - CS2000 included an uplands module: an additional 30 squares in upland/marginal upland classes to improve habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Implications for data use and comparability
  - Changing the basic Land Classification affects consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
  - Two options for national estimates:
    - Use the latest classification (preferred for survey consistency, with country-specific adaptations).
    - Use the original 1990 classification (more consistent across surveys but less aligned with country-specific refinements).
  - National reporting has progressively become country-specific (England&Wales, Scotland, and Wales) with policy-driven sampling adjustments.

- Outputs and documentation
  - National and country-specific habitat estimates released after each major survey (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Supporting figures and tables (maps of Land Classes; lists of sample squares per class) accompany the main reports.
  - Acknowledgements and extensive references provide methodological and historical context.

- End note
  - The Sampling Strategy demonstrates a long-running, data-driven framework designed to produce robust, policy-relevant habitat estimates while accommodating devolution-driven, country-specific reporting needs and ongoing methodological evolution.
