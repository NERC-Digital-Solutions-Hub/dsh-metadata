# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

## Overview
- Long-term field study at WildCrickets, Asturias, Spain, monitoring Gryllus campestris over twelve consecutive years (with emphasis on long-term trends).
- Focus on actuarial and phenotypic senescence through individual-level data, behavioral observations, and environmental measurements.
- Data collection combines automated video monitoring, manual field observations, and physiological samples to build comprehensive individual life histories.

## Study site and population
- Location: meadows near a river valley in Asturias, 9 km south of the Atlantic; altitude 60–270 m.
- Habitat: ~20,000 m2 meadow; crickets occupy ~800 m2 on the flat portion; prefer sunny, open areas and avoid shaded zones.
- Surroundings: bordered by railway and roads; adjacent meadows with scattered trees and crops.
- Population dynamics: high density relative to cameras; limited migration due to shading and borders.

## Monitoring design and schedule
- Consistent annual meadow management: mowing in mid-March and July–August; ongoing short grass outside growing season.
- Burrow-focused monitoring: weekly searches Feb–July to locate active burrows and record occupancy.
- Camera deployment: infrared cameras installed around burrows before adult eclosion; 64 cameras in 2006 escalating to around 140 by 2017; continuous 24/7 recording during the breeding season.
- Data collection window: from first adult emergence through the end of the season when activity ceases.

## Data collection and sampling
- Individual handling: trap each newly emerged adult, weigh (±0.01 g), photograph, and mark with a unique PVC tag for later video identification.
- Biological sampling per individual: cuticular hydrocarbons, a small haemolymph sample, and a small leg tip fragment for pheromone and DNA profiling.
- Behavioral and life-history data: recordings include basking, moulting, singing, mating attempts, spermatophore transfer/removal, fights, feeding, oviposition, arrivals/departures, burrow use, and predator interactions.
- Reproductive metrics: singing activity quantified in 5-minute samples per hour; mating success inferred from presence of spermatophore on females.
- Additional observations: burrow use by other fauna (slugs, isopods, beetles, earwigs, spiders, bees); varied predator groups (mammals, birds, insects, spiders).

## Field instrumentation and environmental monitoring
- Burrow-level instrumentation: infrared cameras clustered around burrows to monitor entrances and surrounding activity; coverage adapted as occupancy and cameras changed over years.
- Weather data: a central weather station logs variables at 10-minute intervals; seven additional temperature sensors placed in meadow surface and simulated burrows (open-ended PVC pipes buried in the ground).
- Calibration: all instruments factory calibrated.

## Data processing and analysis workflow
- Video data processing: two-stage extraction per day.
  - Stage 1: rapid screening of 16-camera streams to distinguish burrows in use from empty ones.
  - Stage 2: detailed viewing of smaller camera sets (often 4 at a time; sometimes up to 9–16 during adverse conditions) with event-by-event logging into spreadsheets.
- Data integration: events exported from spreadsheets into a MS Access database for downstream processing.
- Integrity checks: quality control queries in Access detect inconsistencies (e.g., a cricket assigned to two burrows simultaneously); data are not used until cleaning is complete.

## Quality control and data management
- Rigorous validation to ensure consistency across observations and video records.
- Systematic storage of video, sensor data, and derived datasets; cameras are rotated to maximize informative coverage when more burrows exist than cameras or vice versa.
- Data and metadata management designed to support long-term monitoring and potential data sharing with external researchers.

## Key implications for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates how long-term, standardized monitoring of small vertebrates/invertebrates can be achieved with integrated behavioral, physiological, and environmental data.
- Shows scalable data workflows (sampling, video analysis, database management) suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy-relevant indicators over time.
- Highlights challenges and strategies for increasing data value (e.g., integrating with other datasets) and improving data accessibility for broader scrutiny and reuse.
