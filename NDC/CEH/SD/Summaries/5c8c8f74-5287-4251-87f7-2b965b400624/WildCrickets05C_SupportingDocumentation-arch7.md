# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

- Spatial and site context
  - WildCrickets field site located in Asturias, North Spain, near the Atlantic, in a river valley.
  - Meadow area around 20,000 m2; cricket population occupies ~800 m2 on the flattest portion.
  - Perimeter of the property is surrounded by railway and roads (about 70% of the boundary); surrounding meadows still provide habitat.
  - Habitat features include meadows, orchards, eucalyptus patches, and varied slope aspects influencing cricket distribution (crickets avoid shady areas).

- Sampling regime and timeline
  - Ten consecutive years of monitoring with a consistent mowing regime and seasonal fieldwork cadence.
  - Grass mowing in mid-March and July-August; additional mowing outside the breeding season.
  - Weekly burrow searches from February through July; adults die by late June/early July.
  - Population dynamics tied to emergences, breeding season, and diapause timing.

- Collection and individual data
  - Each emerging adult cricket is trapped, weighed (±0.01 g), photographed, and marked with a unique PVC tag glued to the pronotum.
  - Biological samples collected per individual: cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and a leg tissue fragment for pheromone and DNA profiling.
  - A unique 1–2 character code on the tag enables individual identification from video.

- Monitoring infrastructure and data types
  - Infrared day/night cameras installed at burrow entrances (64 initially, increasing to 133 by later years; 140 in 2017).
  - Cameras provide continuous 24/7 recording around burrows; videos stored on a DVR system across multiple computers.
  - Weather data collected via a central weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) with ten-minute intervals; seven additional temperature sensors placed around and inside simulated burrows.
  - A network of burrow-specific data collection enables tracking of occupancy, emergence, behaviors, and interactions around burrow entrances.

- Fieldwork and observational methods
  - Each burrow is labeled with a unique annual identifier; direct observation supplement for non-videoed burrows to confirm occupancy and emergence events.
  - Video review workflow includes staged viewing: broad pass to identify burrow use, followed by detailed review of specific cameras to log events.
  - Behavioral observations logged include basking, moulting, singing, mating attempts and success, spermatophore transfer/removal, fights, oviposition, predator encounters, and movement patterns.
  - Predators and non-cricket participants recorded (mammals, birds, insects, spiders); singing activity quantified as presence/absence in 5-minute samples per hour.

- Data management and processing
  - Data extraction conducted per day in two steps: initial screening of burrow use across cameras, then detailed logging of events.
  - Data imported into an MS Access database for downstream processing and analysis.

- Calibration and quality assurance
  - All instruments are factory calibrated.
  - Quality control involves a series of Access queries to detect inconsistencies (e.g., a cricket recorded as using two burrows simultaneously).
  - Data are not used until consistency checks pass to ensure dataset integrity across observations and time.

- GIS relevance and potential data products
  - Spatial layers possible from the data include burrow locations, camera coverage zones, and occupancy status by time.
  - Integration of behavioral events with geospatial context (e.g., proximity to predator sightings, sun exposure, and habitat features).
  - Temporal GIS applications to visualize emergence, movement between burrows, and diary-like event timelines across years.
  - Weather and microclimate sensor data can be spatially linked to burrow sites to explore environmental influences on activity and senescence patterns.
  - The dataset supports multi-resolution analysis by combining precise burrow-level data with meadow-wide environmental context for GIS-based visualization and exploration.
