# ACTUARIAL AND PHENOTYPIC SENESCENCE IN A WILD FIELD CRICKET ( Gryllus campestris ) POPULATION OVER TEN YEARS

## Overview
- Long-term, field-based study of actuarial and phenotypic senescence in Gryllus campestris at the WildCrickets site in Asturias, Spain.
- Data span roughly a decade, with detailed longitudinal monitoring conducted over twelve consecutive years.
- Multi-modal data collection includes individual biometrics, chemical/DNA profiling, behavioral observations, and environmental context.

## Data Assets and Coverage
- Individual-level data: unique PVC tag codes, weight (to ±0.01 g), photographs, and biological samples (cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, leg tissue) for pheromone and DNA analyses.
- Burrow- and site-level data: unique burrow IDs; occupancy status; emergence dates of adults.
- Behavioral data: recorded activities around burrow entrances (basking, moulting, singing, courtship, mating, spermatophore transfer/removal, fights, feeding, oviposition, movements, predation events).
- Reproductive metrics: presence/absence of spermatophores, time spent singing, and quantified mating success.
- Video data: infrared cameras (initially 64, up to 140 over time) covering burrows; continuous recording around burrow entrances during the breeding season.
- Environmental data: a central weather station (10-minute interval logs) plus seven additional sensors (soil/ground-level and burrow-simulated locations).
- Temporal and geographic scope: meadow ~800 m2 within a managed landscape; monitoring from larval/juvenile emergence through adult activity and seasonal diapause; annual mowing regime and habitat features.

## Data Collection Methods
- Capture and biometric sampling: adults trapped soon after emergence, weighed, photographed, and marked with a unique PVC tag; samples collected for biochemical and genetic profiling.
- Camera-based monitoring: installation of 64–140 infrared cameras to continuously record around burrow entrances; cameras reallocated annually to maximize data capture as occupancy changes.
- Direct field observations: supplementary checks for burrows not covered by cameras to ensure complete occupancy and emergence dating.
- Phenology and behavior recording: post hoc video review to document emergence events, social interactions, singing, mating outcomes, oviposition, and predator encounters.

## Field Infrastructure and Instrumentation
- Burrow tagging: each burrow labeled with a unique identifier to track occupants across the season.
- Video and data storage: videos stored on Digital Video Recording (DVR) systems distributed across multiple computers; cameras and burrows mapped to maintain traceability.
- Weather and microclimate sensors: centralized weather station plus distributed sensors in and around burrows to capture environmental context.
- Calibration: all instruments described as factory-calibrated to maintain measurement consistency.

## Data Processing, Handling, and Quality Control
- Data extraction workflow: two-step day-by-day viewing—first to identify burrow usage, then detailed event-level annotation across multiple camera streams.
- Data integration: event data transcribed into spreadsheets and imported into MS Access for analysis.
- Quality control: automated query-based checks to detect inconsistencies (e.g., a cricket recorded in two burrows simultaneously); data not used until study-wide consistency checks are satisfied.
- Documentation of workflow: clear procedures for handling video data, event coding, and data consolidation to support reproducibility.

## Temporal and Environmental Context
- Life history and phenology: adults emerge in spring; reproduction begins in May; eggs hatch by mid-summer; adults die by late June/early July; overwinter as late-instar nymphs with diapause resumes in spring.
- Habitat and movement: crickets favor sunny meadow areas; limited migration across shaded zones and roads; meadow management includes seasonal mowing that influences activity and occupancy.
- Environmental coupling: continuous weather and microclimate data linked to behavioral and phenotypic observations to enable analyses of how environment interacts with senescence and life-history traits.

## Data Management, Reproducibility, and Accessibility
- Multi-year data management approach combines biometric, chemical, behavioral, video, and environmental data into centralized workflows.
- Use of standardized identifiers (tag codes, burrow IDs) and explicit data collection protocols to support cross-year analyses.
- Emphasis on data quality, consistency checks, and thorough documentation to enable reproducibility of findings and potential future reuse of the dataset.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates the value of designing a data system for long-term, multi-modal biological monitoring, balancing field practicality with data integrity.
- Highlights the importance of robust metadata, unique identifiers, and traceable data lineage across years and data types.
- Illustrates scalable storage and processing approaches (video-heavy datasets, camera reallocation, automated QC) that support complex analyses of life-history traits and senescence.
- Provides a blueprint for coordinating diverse data streams (biometrics, chemistry, behavior, environment) to enable comprehensive, user-centered analyses and potential cross-study collaboration.
