# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

## Study setting and data scope
- Long-term field study conducted in the WildCrickets site, Asturias, North Spain, near a river valley.
- Population monitored for twelve consecutive years in a meadow of about 800 m2 (surrounded by roads and railway; ~70% perimeter fenced).
- Data collected include individual life history, phenotypic measurements, behaviors around burrows, social interactions, and environmental context (weather).

## Data collection and measurements
- Individual-level data
  - Capture shortly after adult emergence; weigh to ±0.01 g; photograph; mark with a unique PVC tag on the pronotum.
  - Collect samples for chemical (cuticular hydrocarbons), haemolymph, and a leg tissue piece for pheromone and DNA profiles.
- Behavioral and ecological data
  - Install 64–140 infrared cameras to monitor activity around burrow entrances (continuous recording during the breeding season; camera allocation among burrows is adjusted yearly).
  - Record a wide range of behaviors: basking, moulting, singing, courting, mating attempts, spermatophore attachment/removal, fights, feeding, oviposition, and movement in/out of burrows; note predator events.
  - Quantify singing activity as presence/absence in 5-minute samples each hour; estimate time spent singing.
  - Document burrow occupancy by both crickets and other fauna; assess mating success via presence of spermatophore.
- Field observations and temporal coverage
  - Direct observations of non-videoed burrows to determine adult emergence dates and occupancy.
  - End-of-season video review to record key events (emergence, encounters, mating outcomes, oviposition, predation, movement).
- Environmental context
  - Weather data logged by a central weather station with ten-minute interval readings; additional temperature sensors placed in meadow and simulated burrows.

## Field equipment and instrumentation
- Tagging and sampling gear for individual crickets; infrared cameras and DVR systems for continuous recording; video stored on a DVR network.
- Weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) and multiple temperature sensors (in meadow and simulated burrows) for environmental covariates.
- Materials for sample collection: filter paper for hydrocarbons, haemolymph collection tools, and tissue sampling tools.

## Data processing workflow
- Data extraction from video (per-day basis) in two steps:
  - Step 1: Quick pass to identify burrows in use across a large number of cameras (high-speed view).
  - Step 2: Detailed viewing of a subset of cameras (often 4 at a time; sometimes up to 9–16) with event-by-event annotation recorded into a spreadsheet.
- Data consolidation
  - Export event data to Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and import into Microsoft Access for downstream processing and integration.
  - All instruments are factory calibrated to ensure measurement accuracy.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Data undergo rigorous consistency checks using Access queries to detect errors (e.g., a cricket recorded as occupying two burrows simultaneously).
- Data are only used after completing quality control to ensure dataset consistency.

## Data formats and storage
- Video data stored on DVR systems; event data stored in Excel spreadsheets.
- Metadata and relational records maintained in Access databases.
- Biological samples (HCs, haemolymph, tissue) cataloged for downstream analysis; camera and weather data logged with corresponding timestamps.

## Potential data products and analysis implications
- Longitudinal, individual-level datasets enabling analyses of actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild population.
- Self-serve data possibilities for end users: per-individual life histories, burrow occupancy dynamics, singing effort, mating success, emergence timing, and responses to environmental covariates.
- Integrative analyses combining behavioral events, phenotypic measurements, and environmental context across multiple years.
- Opportunities to develop dashboards or reports summarizing annual dynamics, survival estimates, and behaviorally-driven fitness components.
