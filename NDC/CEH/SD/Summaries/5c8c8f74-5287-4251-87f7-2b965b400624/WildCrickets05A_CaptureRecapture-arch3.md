# WildCrickets05A-CaptureRecapture

## Overview
- This file provides basic information on each male adult cricket tagged in the population for a capture–recapture study.

## Key Fields
- Year: the year when the cricket was alive
- ID: unique individual identifier
- Birth: day of birth relative to the first adult cricket emerging that year; 0 indicates unknown birth date
- Death: date of death relative to the birth date of the first adult cricket emerging that year
- 2-99: Recapture days (recapture history)

## Data Handling and Quality
- Birth dates may be unknown (Birth = 0)
- Recapture days document capture histories used for estimating survival or population dynamics

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Illustrates a structured dataset for population monitoring via capture–recapture methods
- Highlights needs and opportunities for metadata clarity, data provenance, and governance to support data sharing and reuse in policy evaluation and decision-making
