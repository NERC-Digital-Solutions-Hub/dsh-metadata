# WildCrickets05A-CaptureRecapture Description of content

## What this file contains
- Basic information on each male adult cricket tagged in the population for the following traits:
  - Year: the year when the cricket was alive
  - ID: individual identification
  - Birth: day of birth relative to the day of birth of the first adult cricket emerging that year; zeroes indicate individuals with unknown date of birth
  - Death: date of death relative to the date of birth of the first adult cricket emerging that year
  - 2-99: recapture days

## Data structure and interpretation
- Each record corresponds to a tagged male adult cricket
- Time references center on the first adult cricket emerging in the given year
- Birth values of 0 indicate unknown birth dates
- Death is expressed relative to the birth reference point used for that year
- Recapture days (2–99) indicate the span or count of recapture events/days observed

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, time-bound life-history data essential for assessing population dynamics and emergence patterns
- Supports consistent environmental health indicators over time when integrated with other datasets

## Data management and quality considerations
- Data verification and quality assurance are implied to ensure accuracy
- Cleaning and transformation may be required to align with standardized monitoring formats
- Outputs can be presented as reports, maps, and charts
- Datasets should be stored properly and uploaded to appropriate data portals

## Implications for data sharing and value
- Facilitates later integration with other relevant datasets to increase utility beyond a single study
- Enables access to underlying data to promote transparency and reuse in environmental monitoring and policy evaluation
