# SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION: Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

- Purpose and scope
  - Presents long-term, multi-faceted monitoring of a Gryllus campestris population at WildCrickets field site in Asturias, Spain.
  - Covers twelve consecutive years of data collection focusing on actuarial and phenotypic senescence, with detailed methodologies for sampling, instrumentation, data capture, and quality control.

- Study site and population context
  - Location: meadows in a river valley near Asturias, 9 km south of the Atlantic.
  - Habitat characteristics: meadow ~20,000 m2, surrounding hills, proximity to railway; management includes regular mowing (mid-March and July-August with extended mowing to maintain short grass).
  - Population focus: Gryllus campestris occupying a ~800 m2 flat meadow area, with crickets living in burrows among grass; limited migration due to shade and barriers.

- Monitoring regime and data types
  - Population and behavior data collected through:
    - Mark-release: each adult trapped, weighed (±0.01 g), photographed, and tagged with a unique PVC pronotum tag.
    - Individual sampling: cuticular hydrocarbons, small haemolymph sample, and a leg fragment for pheromone/DNA profiling.
    - Continuous video monitoring: 64–140 infrared cameras (increasing over time) recording burrow entrances and surrounding activity; operation from early adult emergence through the end of the breeding season.
    - Behavioral metrics: basking, moulting, singing, courtship, mating attempts, spermatophore attachment/removal, fights, feeding, oviposition, burrow movements, predator interactions, and time spent in/out of burrows.
    - Reproductive and social measures: singing activity quantified as presence of singing in 5-minute samples per hour; mating success inferred from spermatophore attachment.
  - Supplementary observations: direct in-field observations for burrows not covered by cameras to confirm emergence dates and occupancy.
  - Environmental context: a weather station logs ten-minute interval data; additional temperature sensors placed in meadow and simulated burrows to capture microclimate conditions.

- Instrumentation and data capture
  - Cameras and video: network deployed yearly with moving cameras among burrows to maximize informational yield; images stored via DVR systems and later analyzed.
  - Weather and microclimate: Davis Vantage Pro2 weather station plus seven temperature sensors in meadow and burrows.
  - Data handling: video data collected continuously and stored on local servers; calibration performed using factory defaults; unique burrow numbering and camera assignments maintained for the season.

- Data processing and quality assurance
  - Two-stage video analysis workflow:
    - First pass: rapid screening to separate burrows in use from empty ones across multiple cameras.
    - Second pass: detailed viewing of selected cameras to log events (emergence, encounters, singing, matings, fights, oviposition, predator interactions).
  - Data integration: events extracted per day and recorded into a database (initially MSAccess) for downstream processing.
  - Quality control: consistency checks to detect contradictions (e.g., a cricket recorded as using two burrows simultaneously); data are only used after passing QC checks to ensure dataset integrity.
  - Data validation practices: direct observations used to corroborate camera data; emergence dates inferred from occupancy changes and confirmed through video review.

- Timeline and scalability
  - Initiation and evolution: pilot in 2005 with 16 cameras; began continuous monitoring in 2006 with 64 cameras; expansion to 140 cameras by 2017.
  - Longitudinal ambition: twelve consecutive years of data collection, enabling actuarial and phenotypic analyses across multiple cohorts and environmental conditions.

- Key outputs for monitoring framework insights
  - Demonstrates end-to-end monitoring workflow: site characterization, standardized capture/marking, intensive video-based behavior monitoring, biological sampling for individual profiling, and rigorous data processing with QC.
  - Highlights the integration of behavioral ecology metrics (singing, mating success, burrow use, predation) with environmental context (microclimate data) to inform analyses of senescence and population dynamics.
  - Emphasizes data governance through clear data provenance (unique IDs, burrow tagging, camera assignments) and transparent QA processes to ensure reliable, repeatable measures.
