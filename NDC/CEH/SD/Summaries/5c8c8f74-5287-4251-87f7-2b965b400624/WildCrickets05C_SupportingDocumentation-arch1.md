# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

## Study site and population
- WildCrickets field site located in Asturias, North Spain, near the Atlantic, at 60–270 m altitude.
- Meadow area about 20,000 m2; cricket population occupies around 800 m2 on the flattest portion.
- Crickets are flightless, overwinter as late instar nymphs, emerge in spring, and have a May–July breeding season.
- Site features surrounding meadows, orchards, eucalyptus, and a nearby railway; migration between adjacent meadows is limited by shade and roads.

## Sampling regime and life cycle context
- Population monitored for twelve consecutive years.
- Meadow management: mowing in mid-March and July–August; grass kept short elsewhere from August to March.
- Burrows are monitored weekly from February through July; adult emergence and peak activity tracked.

## Collection methods and individual sampling
- Each adult captured days after emergence, weighed (±0.01 g), photographed, and tagged with a unique PVC code glued to the pronotum.
- For each crickety, collected: cuticular hydrocarbons (via filter paper rubbing), haemolymph (~10 µL), and a small hind-leg tip sample for pheromone/DNA profiling.
  
## Monitoring equipment and data types
- Infrared day/night cameras deployed: starting at 64 (pilot 2005; increased to 140 by 2017) and later between 64–133 per year depending on occupancy.
- Cameras record around burrow entrances 24/7 during adult eclosion period; movements between burrows are tracked by shifting camera coverage.
- Behavioral data recorded from video: basking, moulting, singing, courting, mating attempts, spermatophore attachment/removal, fighting, eating, oviposition, and predator events; burrow entries/exits and inter-individual movements noted.
- Singing activity quantified as presence/absence of singing within 5-minute samples per hour; mating success inferred from presence of spermatophore on females.
- Additional field observations cover non-videoed burrows to ensure complete occupancy data.

## Fieldwork, instrumentation, and environmental context
- Each burrow flagged with a unique identifier for the season; direct observations supplement video data for non-videoed burrows.
- Video review includes post hoc coding of events and interactions; cameras managed by DVR systems (multiple computers) with motion-triggered recording.
- Weather data collected via a central weather station with ten-minute interval readings and additional sensors placed in meadow microhabitats (simulated burrows) to capture local thermal conditions.

## Calibration, data handling, and analytic workflow
- All instruments factory calibrated prior to use.
- Data extraction performed in two steps per day: (1) quick pass to separate burrows in use from empty ones across multiple cameras; (2) detailed viewing of selected cameras to record events with time-stamped annotations.
- Data imported into a MS Access database for subsequent processing; per-day consolidation ensures consistent event tallies and metadata.

## Quality control and data integrity
- Data quality checks using Access queries to ensure consistency (e.g., preventing a cricket from being recorded as using two burrows simultaneously).
- Data are only used after passing thorough consistency checks to minimize recording errors and discrepancies.
