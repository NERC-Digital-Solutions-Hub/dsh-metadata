# Field level headings: Date Date Time GMT Temperature °C - range - 17 to +60 Discharge m 3 sec - 1

## Overview
- Metadata snapshot for a site monitoring water discharge and temperature, including temporal, spatial, and instrumentation details.

## Temporal and spatial context
- Date range: 11/03/2008 13:00 - present
- Location: Grid ref SH 79152 45207
- Latitude: 52.990527
- Longitude: -3.8018167
- Elevation: 410 m

## Measurements and units
- Temperature: range -17 to +60 °C
- Discharge: measured in cubic metres per second (m3/s)
- Time stamps: recorded in GMT

## Instrumentation and data capture
- Starflow Ultrasonic Doppler Instrument with Micrologger Model 6526B
- Flowtracker: SonTek FlowTracker Handheld ADV (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter), Serial/S/N P2086
- Data logger: Integrated Unidata Starflow logger

## Data governance and accessibility considerations
- The record provides instrument and field metadata but does not specify data sharing or governance policies; highlights need for clear data accessibility, metadata completeness, and data management standards to avoid silos and facilitate open data where feasible.

## Implications for policy monitoring
- The setup supports continuous hydrological and thermal monitoring, enabling evaluation of environmental health policies and informing future decisions.
