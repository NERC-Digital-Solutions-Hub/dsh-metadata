# Field level headings

## Overview
- Metadata and field-level data headers for hydrological measurements, including date/time, temperature, and discharge.

## Data fields
- Date and Time: fields named Date and Time with GMT reference.
- Temperature: °C, with a recorded range of -17 to +60.
- Discharge: cubic meters per second (m^3/s).

## Date range
- Date range begins 11/03/2008 13:00 and continues to present.

## Location
- Grid reference: SH 79152 45207
- Latitude: 52.990527
- Longitude: -3.8018167
- Elevation: 410 m

## Instrumentation
- Starflow Ultrasonic Doppler Instrument with Micrologger, Model 6526B
- Flowtracker: SonTek FlowTracker Handheld ADV (Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter), Serial No. P2086
- Data logger: Integrated Unidata Starflow logger

## GIS relevance
- Precise geospatial coordinates and elevation enable map-based visualization of flow observations.
- Time-stamped measurements (date/time and GMT) support temporal GIS analyses and trend mapping.
- Multi-instrument metadata facilitates data integration and provenance tracking in GIS workflows.

## Data considerations
- Data spans multiple fields and instruments, requiring cleaning and standardization for GIS use.
- Ongoing data range suggests potential updates; maintain metadata to reflect data availability and timeliness.
