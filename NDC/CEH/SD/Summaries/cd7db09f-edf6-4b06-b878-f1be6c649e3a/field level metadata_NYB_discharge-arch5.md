## Data management and sharing
- Workflow implications for Data Stewards:
  - Ensure data meet standards for accuracy, metadata completeness, and consistent formats.
  - Perform quality assurance, cleaning, and any necessary data transformation before sharing.
  - Respect sharing limitations and implement update mechanisms.
  - Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue holdings.
  - Document work performed on datasets where appropriate.

## Data governance considerations
- Identify data availability and potential limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes) for this dataset.
- Ensure comprehensive metadata to support discovery and reuse.

## Challenges and considerations for this dataset (typical for Data Stewards)
- Balancing incomplete user needs with dataset capabilities.
- Securing timely data submissions from producers.
- Achieving and maintaining metadata completeness and standardization.
- Interoperability across diverse systems and formats.
- Handling large datasets and legacy data sources; ensuring scalable updates.
