# EDCAT stickleback data 2005-2008. Pottinger, T. G., Cook, A., Matthiessen, P. (2017)

## Overview
- Time-series dataset from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) collected in the River Ray downstream of Rodbourne Waste Water Treatment Works (WWTW) before (2005–2007) and after (2008) remediation with granular activated carbon (GAC) tertiary treatment; plus samples from neighbouring reference rivers (River Ock, Childrey Brook).
- Objective: monitor environmental health and chemical exposure using standardized biomarkers; supports evaluation of sewage effluent impacts and remediation effects.
- Data intended for standardised presentation and enabling cross-study analysis and policy scrutiny.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fish captured with a hand net; humane euthanasia using 2-phenoxyethanol (1:1000); specimens frozen for transport.
- On arrival, measurements recorded: weight (mg) and total length (mm).
- Dissections: heart and kidney stored for VTG and spiggin analyses (data not presented here); remainder minced and homogenised.
- Preparation: homogenate stored at -20°C until assay; separate portions allocated for downstream analyses.

## Analytical methods
- CYP1A activity: ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD) activity measured in liver tissue using a microplate kinetic assay (96-well plates), with protein-normalised results.
- Cortisol: extracted from whole homogenate and quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA) after ethyl acetate extraction.
- Glucose: quantified in homogenate using a hexokinase-based microplate assay.
- Nucleic acids: extracted with 1% sarcosyl and quantified by fluorescence (RiboGreen); RNase treatment used to separate RNA and DNA contributions.
- Outputs include: EROD activity, RNA:DNA ratio, whole-body cortisol (ng/g), whole-body glucose (mg/g), and basic morphometrics (length, weight, sex, conditional factor).

## Sampling locations
- River Ray: Rodbourne WWTW (site), Elborough Bridge, Tadpole Bridge, Seven Bridges; coordinates and distances from Rodbourne WWTW provided.
- River Ock: Charney Basset, Garford; coordinates provided.
- Childrey Brook: Venn Mill, (and Marcham Mill inferred from data).
- Data include precise grid references, latitude/longitude, and distance from Rodbourne WWTW (where applicable).

## Relevance to environmental monitoring aims
- Demonstrates standardized data generation, quality assurance, and data transformation into comparable outputs (biomarkers, morphometrics).
- Facilitates storage and sharing of datasets, and cross-study comparisons through clear data structure and metadata.
- Addresses challenges of maximizing dataset value by enabling integration with other data sources and broad accessibility of underlying data for stakeholders and policy evaluation.
