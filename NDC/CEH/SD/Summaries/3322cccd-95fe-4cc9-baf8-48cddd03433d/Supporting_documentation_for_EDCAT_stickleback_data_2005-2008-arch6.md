# EDCAT stickleback data 2005-2008. Pottinger, T. G., Cook, A., Matthiessen, P. (2017)

## Overview
- Datasets from three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) collected in the River Ray (southwest England) downstream and upstream of Rodbourne wastewater treatment works (WWTW) before (2005–2007) and after (2008) remediation with granular activated carbon (GAC) tertiary treatment.
- Complementary sampling from reference rivers: River Ock and Childrey Brook.
- Aims to measure biological responses to wastewater effluent and remediation, including biomarker endpoints such as EROD activity, cortisol, and nucleic acid content.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fish captured with a 38 cm D-frame net; euthanized with 2-phenoxyethanol (1:1000); tissues preserved for analysis.
- Measurements recorded: weight (mg) and total length (mm); heart and kidney stored for VTG and spiggin analyses (not included in this dataset).
- Remainder homogenized in buffer, then stored frozen until assay.

## Analytical methods
- EROD (ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase) activity measured in liver homogenate using a microplate assay; results expressed as pmol/min/mg protein.
- Cortisol extracted from whole homogenate and quantified by radioimmunoassay (RIA); dextran-coated charcoal used in the assay buffer.
- Glucose quantified in homogenate using a hexokinase microplate method.
- Nucleic acids extracted from tissue using sarcosyl buffer; total RNA + DNA quantified with a fluorescence dye (RiboGreen); RNA and DNA separately quantified after RNase treatment to derive RNA:DNA ratio.

## Data structure
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with the following columns:
  - Sampling_date, River, Site_within_river, Fish_code, Length_mm, Weight_mg, Sex, KF (K-factor), EROD_pmol_min_mg_protein, RNA_DNA_ratio, Whole_body_cortisol_ng_g, Whole_body_glucose_mg_g
- Descriptions accompany each column (sampling date of the first day of the two-day sampling period; river and site identifiers; fish metrics; biochemical endpoints).

## Data usage and publications
- This dataset has informed multiple publications examining wastewater effluent effects and remediation:
  - Katsiadaki et al. (2012): field surveys using stickleback biomarkers to detect anti-androgens.
  - Pottinger et al. (2011, 2012): effects of sewage effluent remediation on body size, RNA:DNA ratio, and exposure markers; indices of stress in sticklebacks related to extreme weather and effluent exposure.
- The data enable cross-site comparisons of biomarker responses before and after remediation, supporting assessments of environmental impact and data-driven policy decisions.
