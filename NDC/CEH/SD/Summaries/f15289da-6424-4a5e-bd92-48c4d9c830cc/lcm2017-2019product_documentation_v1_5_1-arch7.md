# The UKCEH Land Cover Maps for 2017, 2018 and 2019 v1.5.1 30/06/2020

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for three UKCEH Land Cover Maps: LCM2017, LCM2018, LCM2019.
  - Land cover represented by 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on BAP Broad Habitats) with automatic production and validation.
  - Annual production aims to enable rapid UK-wide mapping with minimal manual corrections.
  - Visual checks and formal validation indicate map quality comparable to the latest predecessor (LCM2015).

- Production approach and key concepts
  - Bootstrap Training and Random Forest (RF) classifier used to generate the maps.
  - Seasonal Sentinel-2 imagery: Seasonal Composite Images (median TOA reflectance per season) derived from Google Earth Engine.
  - Classification Scenes are formed by combining Seasonal Composite Images with 20m Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Context information helps distinguish spectrally similar classes (e.g., proximity to buildings, roads, terrain).
  - Bootstrap Training samples come from historic LCMs (primarily LCM2015) to train the RF classifier, enabling a self-starting learning process without new field data.
  - Training samples are balanced across classes to avoid bias toward common classes.

- Dataset structure and products
  - Dataset suite comprises 42 datasets (per year, Great Britain and Northern Ireland), with 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes or 10 UKCEH Aggregate Classes.
  - 20m Classified Pixels
    - New in LCM2017–2019; RF classification results from 20m Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images.
    - 2-band, 8-bit rasters: Band 1 = most likely class; Band 2 = class probability (0–100) for confidence.
    - Preserves fine landscape detail (does not generalise via Land Parcels), suitable for detecting narrow features.
  - Land Parcels
    - Generated by intersecting 20m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
    - Attributes (per parcel): gid, _hist (list of class frequencies), _mode, _purity, _conf, _stdev, _n.
    - Note: gid values differ from LCM2015; use gid for cross-year comparisons.
    - Minor attribute changes since LCM2015; _hist format updated for readability.
  - 25m Rasterised Land Parcels
    - Rasterised version of Land Parcels at 25m resolution; 3-band raster: _mode, _conf, _purity.
    - Purity and confidence features added to support assessment of classification reliability.
  - 1km Rasters (per 1km grid)
    - 1km Percent Cover: 21-band raster (8-bit) showing percentage cover per class in a 1km cell.
    - 1km Percent Aggregate Cover: 10-band raster (8-bit) showing percentage for UKCEH Aggregate Classes.
    - 1km Dominant Cover: single-band raster (8-bit) showing the dominant class per 1km cell.
    - 1km Dominant Aggregate Cover: 1-band raster (8-bit) showing the dominant Aggregate Class per 1km cell.
  - Seasonal Composite Images and Classification Scenes
    - Sentinel-2 seasonal TOA-based composites (bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,11,12) at 20m.
    - GB uses 100x100 km tiling to form 74 overlapping Classification Scenes; NI uses a single 43-band scene per year.
    - Some seasons may have gaps due to cloud; the RF classifier tolerates partial spectral information.
  - The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
    - Fixed framework with approximately 0.5 ha MMU; designed to represent discrete land units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.).
    - Used to summarise 20m Classified Pixels for downstream products; enables change detection over time.
    - gid remains the stable parcel identifier within the framework, but parcel geometries are unchanged from LCM2015.
  - Data extents and coordinate systems
    - Great Britain: GB British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).
    - Northern Ireland: NI Irish Grid (EPSG: 29903).
  - Data processing and software
    - RF classifier implemented with a bespoke production pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open-source tools).
    - Overlaps between Classification Scenes are resolved by visual/manual prioritisation of best results.

- Validation, accuracy, and limitations
  - Product validation against GB countryside survey data, National Forest Inventory, IACS, and bespoke validation points (22,325 points).
  - Reported overall accuracy at UK scale (compared to validation data):
    - LCM2017: 78.6%
    - LCM2018: 79.6%
    - LCM2019: 79.4%
  - Validation data are not exact truth; transformations and class-mapping differences exist between sources and UKCEH classes.
  - Approximately 80% overall correspondence considered strong for automatically produced, annual land cover maps.
  - Manual corrections were not performed in this release to enable annual timeliness; visual checks and validation remain in place.
  - Some inter-class confusion persists (e.g., among upland and peatland vegetation; Saltwater vs Freshwater in tidal areas); context rasters help mitigate but cannot wholly eliminate confusion.

- Practical considerations and usage notes for GIS specialists
  - The 20m Classified Pixels dataset preserves fine detail and is ideal for detailed mapping and analysis at sub-hectare scales.
  - Land Parcels provide a structured summary with descriptive attributes but are not designed for cross-year parcel ID continuity with LCM2015 (gid is the linking field within the new spatial framework).
  - The 25m Rasterised Land Parcels generalise parcel data and are useful for coarser analyses and mapping workflows.
  - The 1km products enable rapid, grid-based analyses of land cover composition and dominance at a coarse scale.
  - The dataset suite is designed for rapid release; plans include annual LCM updates (LCM2020 planned with bootstrap from 2017–2019; 2021 from 2018–2020 majority signal).
  - For cross-year change detection, rely on the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework structures and gid-based comparisons where possible.
  - Appendix 1 and Appendix 2 provide notes on the UKCEH Land Cover Classes and the Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats; Appendix 3 provides recommended RGB color mappings; Appendix 4 contains validation details; Appendix 5 lists full datasets per year.
