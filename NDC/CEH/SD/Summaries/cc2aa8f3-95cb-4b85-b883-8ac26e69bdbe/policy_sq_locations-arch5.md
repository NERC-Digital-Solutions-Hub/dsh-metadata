# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and permission to survey land.

## Governing framework and authorities
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE.
- Policy managed by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners; released under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- UKCEH decisions on exceptional release, with annual reporting to CS partners.

## Release circumstances and data protection levels
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- Six-digit grid references: provided only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; requires demonstration that associated IP/data has equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; UKCEH may process to avoid direct release.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated as equivalent to location data and released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- In all cases, the data release must not compromise confidentiality or enable location identification by third parties.

## License terms and usage restrictions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; data must not be used to visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH supports decision under the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with annual reports detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis support within reasonable timeframes; requests from organizations outside CS partnership are handled case-by-case.
- CS partners are advised to consult with UKCEH prior to committing to use data; support may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
