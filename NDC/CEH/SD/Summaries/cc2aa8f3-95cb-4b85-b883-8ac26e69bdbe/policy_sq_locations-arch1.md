# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising the risk to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Policy specifically concerns survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), award NE/R016429/1, as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- These elements are essential to the survey’s scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission to survey.
- Public interest rationale: confidentiality supports ongoing, reliable environmental policy informatics.
- Requests for information are managed by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Access may identify whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) can be released under licence when approximate location suffices.
- For precise locations (six-digit grid references), UKCEH may perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external release occur under licence.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need for the approved project.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in ways that could compromise square confidentiality; no use to locate individual landowners or plan visits.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, but both prohibit attempts to identify exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions using the policy principles.
- Approved licenses are issued as hardcopy documents with clauses reflecting the policy, signed by a senior signatory from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow the Freedom of Information Act/Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partner use, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to data covered by this policy; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated case by case.
