# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of survey square locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Funding and partners: 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1, UK-SCaPE National Capability); 2007 CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why confidentiality matters
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, both crucial for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and securing future land access for surveys.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by UKCEH for NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release: when and how locations may be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains each CS square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references are ONLY released under VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; organisations must show legal protections for IP/data requiring equal/higher confidentiality than CS data; UKCEH-preprocessing to avoid release is preferred.
- Within-squares data (e.g., habitat maps) could help identify square location and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
- Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.

## Specific licensing and usage restrictions
- Licensees must: preserve confidentiality, store data securely, restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need, and ensure data is not used for other organisational purposes.
- Data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period; no third-party release that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Licences for four-digit and six-digit/grid/ spatial data include clauses preventing attempts to derive precise locations or claim to have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with agreed clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH supports decision under Act/Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decisions.
- For internal CS partnership use, UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are case-by-case.
- Recommendation to consult UKCEH before committing to data use covered by this policy; collaboration with UKCEH may involve scientific leadership or support, potentially via collaborative or paid arrangements.
