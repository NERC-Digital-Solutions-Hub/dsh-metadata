# Sampling design

- Purpose and scope
  - Longitudinal soil sampling within the Countryside Survey (CS) framework across years: 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019+.
  - 2019 marks the start of a rolling survey aiming to measure about 100 squares each year for five years before repeating.
  - Power analyses were used to determine the required number of samples to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling framework
  - Soils are sampled from CS x-plots, with five x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - The five x-plots within a square are not replicates; they may reflect different land uses and soil types.
  - Over time, x-plots may be relocated due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty in relocation; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Samples with the same unique identifier are from the same location, though exact sampling points are typically 2–3 meters apart around a permanently marked 2m × 2m plot.

- Sample location and repeatability
  - Each CS square contains multiple permanently marked plots; relocation can occur for practical reasons, but a repeat location is tracked via the identifier.
  - Sampling within each location uses fixed reference points around the plot corners to maintain consistency where possible.

- Sampling procedure
  - Depths: top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples); in 1998, 2007, and 2019 sampling used soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit.
  - In some soils, full core collection was not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: laboratory measurements included pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping was conducted.
  - 1998, 2007, 2019: multiple cores were taken per x-plot; different cores could have different measurements; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI analyses (no horizon-specific chemical analyses).
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2019 (not following ISO bulk density methods, which would require a whole core).
  - A full methodological description and discussion of implications are provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Statistical analysis considerations
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while accounting for them yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS design emphasizes using a structure-aware approach.
  - A mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - In CS-like designs, where spatial structure is not the primary interest, a dispersed set of observations can improve overall precision and regional coverage.
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Data governance and accessibility notes
  - The methodology emphasizes thorough documentation and reference to the technical reports (Emmett et al. 2008) and CS publications for context.
  - Changes in sampling methods across years highlight the importance of consistent metadata and transparent reporting to enable valid trend analyses.
