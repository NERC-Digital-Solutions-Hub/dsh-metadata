# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximises public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background and governance
- 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE.
- Partners include multiple environmental and governmental bodies (e.g., CEH, Defra, NE, devolved governments, and related agencies).

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.

## What can be released and under what conditions
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid a square falls in.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must show that related IP/data cannot be released to UKCEH and that CS data require equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares: release under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- Four-digit releases: generally less stringent than six-digit releases; still governed by licence terms.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained after the licence ends.
- End of licence: written confirmation that data was secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could reveal square locations.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Where provided, evidence of project management standards (at least JCOP-level) may be required.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorised senior official.
- If a request is denied, processes under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 are followed.
- UKCEH provides an annual report summarising applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS partner use, UKCEH aims to offer pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data support
- Clarify the client’s need and assess whether a four-digit grid reference suffices.
- Consider requesting UKCEH pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations.
- If precise locations are necessary, prepare to justify confidentiality and manage licensing conditions, including destruction on completion.
- Engage UKCEH early to define requirements and potential collaboration or payment arrangements.
- Ensure compliance with licensing terms, data security, and JCOP-aligned project management standards.

## Legal and ethical context
- Data requests and releases are governed by the FOI Act (2000) and Environmental Information Regulations (2004).
- The policy includes explicit prohibitions on using location data to identify square locations or to monitor individual landowners.
