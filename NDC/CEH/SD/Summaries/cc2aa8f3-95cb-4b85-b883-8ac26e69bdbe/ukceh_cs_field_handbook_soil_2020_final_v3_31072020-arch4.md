# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

## Purpose and Scope
- National rolling soil and vegetation survey to assess soil change and function at the landscape scale.
- Resurvey approximately 500 squares over a 5-year rolling programme (about 100 squares per year).
- Data collected from five X-plots per square to build a national soil-vegetation dataset as part of UK-SCaPE.

## Data Collection Design
- Five X-plots per square, randomly located within the dominant vegetation and away from field boundaries.
- In each X-plot, five 15 cm cores are collected: two white (storage), two grey (biology), one black (chemistry).
- Cores are taken along the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2×2 m vegetation quadrat.
- In peat/organic soils, depth to the O horizon is recorded using an avalanche rod at multiple marked locations; record depth if the organic layer exceeds 2 cm.
- All cores are labeled and placed in a single bag per X-plot with specific core-type labels.

## Equipment and Sampling Procedures
- Comprehensive field gear: coring device with replaceable guards, knives for roots, hammers, crowbar/levers, trowel, trays, scissors, extruder, markers, depth rulers, and cooling storage (electric cool box, fridge).
- Detailed mineral soil sampling: core insertion, hammering to 15 cm depth, UV/observer notes for incomplete cores, and methods to extract and reseat cores to minimize sample distortion.
- Organic soil procedures differ when the corer is unsuitable; cores may be placed directly on soil and cut to size, with careful extraction to avoid excessive compression.
- For rocky/scree soils, collect as feasible or label as scree; fill holes after sampling to prevent livestock hazards.
- Surface vegetation removal and litter handling guidelines to avoid contaminating samples; specific handling rules for forest floor and peat samples.

## Cores, Labels, and Packaging
- Core types and bag labels:
  - Core C (Chemistry): 1x long black core (15 cm) for chemistry.
  - Ada/Adb (Storage): long white cores (15 cm) for storage.
  - Ba/Bb (Biology): long grey cores (15 cm) for biology.
- Labeling: per-plot bags contain five labels corresponding to the cores; top red cap, bottom black cap on cores; annotate if cores are shorter than 15 cm as “short” or “comp” (compressed) to support lab analyses.
- Plot layout reference: cores positioned on the WEST corner of the X-plot quadrat.

## Data Capture, Scanning, and Metadata
- After sampling, scan core labels with a tablet using plot-specific headers. If scanning fails, manually enter barcodes.
- If no barcode exists, generate one using a consistent scheme: CS(year) + SQ number + X1 + C/Ba/Bb/Ada/Adb.
- Record any sampling problems (e.g., large roots, obstacles) in the software and on the plastic bags to preserve context for later data processing.

## Sample Storage, Packaging, and Dispatch
- Transport cores to accommodation or lab in a cooled setup; store appropriately (cool box or fridge) until dispatch.
- Packing and posting rules:
  - Post cores by SQ together in the same bag.
  - Use leak-proof primary and secondary containers, and a sturdy outer package with a surface ≥100 mm × 100 mm; include absorbent material if leakage is possible.
  - Do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate and ship on the next available day.
- Destination for cores:
  - Black and White cores: Bangor (4 °C storage).
  - Grey biology cores: direct posting to Lancaster (freeze at -20 °C upon arrival).
  - Lab handling and storage specifics are documented for each destination site.

## Data Quality, Transparency, and Governance
- Encourage notes on sampling issues (e.g., root/boulder interference) to ensure accurate interpretation in lab analyses (bulk density, core integrity).
- Record depth if the core did not reach 15 cm (depth from base of cross bar to ground) and mark the bag accordingly to differentiate from compressed samples.
- Maintain clear separation of organic, mineral, and scree samples and follow soil-horizon guidance for forest floor and peat.
- Ensure surface vegetation is appropriately cleared, with clear instructions for forest, peat, and mineral soils to preserve sample integrity.

## Roles for Data Management and Community Co-ordination
- Data leaders can use the standardized core-type labeling and metadata practices to support discoverability, traceability, and reuse.
- The workflow integrates field data collection with tablet-based labeling, centralized storage in multiple labs, and defined shipping routes to maintain data quality and timeliness.
- The handbook supports ongoing system-wide data quality and collaboration across sites (Bangor, Lancaster, Wallsingford/Edinburgh) to sustain national soil-vegetation data assets.
