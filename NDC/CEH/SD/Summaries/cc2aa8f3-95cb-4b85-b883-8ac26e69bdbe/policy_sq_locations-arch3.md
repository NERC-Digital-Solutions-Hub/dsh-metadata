# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Background and participants
- 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE National Capability.
- 2007 CS partners include: NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Confidentiality rationale
- CS square locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
- Confidentiality protects the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.

## Release and access levels
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances under licence; external processing can be used to avoid release where possible.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- If precise location data are essential, UKCEH will perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations; exceptional release requires demonstrating equal or higher confidentiality/IP protection than CS data.

## Licensing terms and safeguards
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes after the period ends.
- At the end of the licence, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; the data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; a clause prohibits attempts to derive precise locations from provided data.

## Governance, approvals, and responsibilities
- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences; approvals signed by a senior authorised official.
- UKCEH provides an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical use, CS partners should have a reasonable expectation that UKCEH can perform required pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe.
- Requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before using any data covered by this policy; UKCEH involvement (collaborative or paid) is negotiated case-by-case.
