# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

## Overview and purpose
- Guides rolling national soil and vegetation surveying to assess soil change over time.
- Resurvey of former Countryside Survey squares (1978) plus selected 1998/2007 squares; ~500 squares over 5 years (about 100 per year).
- Focuses on collecting soil cores and vegetation data from five X plots per square to support soil function and landscape change analyses.

## Sampling design and locations
- Each surveyed square contains five X plots, randomly located within the dominant vegetation and away from field boundaries.
- Cores are taken on the WEST line of the X plots, positioned 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
- Core types per plot: five cores total (two white, two grey, one black), with dedicated labelling and storage designations.

## Core types, labeling, and GIS-ready data capture
- Core types and labels:
  - Core 'C' (Chemistry): 1x LONG BLACK core
  - Core 'Ada' and 'Adb' (Storage): LONG WHITE cores
  - Core 'Ba' and 'Bb' (Biology): LONG GREY cores
- Bags are labeled with corresponding core types; labels (and plots) are scanned with a tablet to link to GIS/field data records. If scanning fails, manual entry using a standardized code is allowed.
- Labels include SQ number, X-plot number, and core type; all data logged to support lab workflow and GIS datasets.

## Field procedures and core collection
- Equipment and setup:
  - Coring device with interchangeable guards, hammer options, knife, trowel, crowbar, extruder, sleeves, and labeling tools.
  - Trays for loose material, cool box for sample cooling, and optional fridge for accommodation storage.
- Mineral soils:
  - Core insertion and extraction procedures, with notes on depth if full 15 cm penetration is not possible.
  - Record depth from the base of the cross bar to the ground if depth is insufficient; include a short note on the bag to indicate “short” or “compressed” cores.
  - Ensure proper core handling to avoid losing soil at either end; use tools as needed to release the core.
- Organic/peat soils:
  - Core may not always work; place core directly on surface and cut around bottom edge if needed.
  - Avoid excessive compression; use knife, trowel, and crowbar as required to minimize disturbance.
  - For thick organic layers, cut the bottom end of the core to match size and ensure adequate sampling.
- Peat depth measurement:
  - Use an avalanche rod to test O horizon depth at three marked locations; record depth if deeper than 2 cm.
  - After coring, measure O horizon depth by pressing the rod about 20 cm beyond the cores (up to 3 m rod).
- Special soils:
  - Scree or rocky soils: use the trowel to collect fine material when feasible; do not collect if stones are too large; clearly label as scree.
- Vegetation and surface material:
  - Clear surface litter and fresh vegetation; forest floor guidance distinguishes between fresh litter and fermented/fibric material.
  - Do not remove or disturb mineral vegetation; ensure surface material is appropriately captured in the sampling.

## Core handling, labeling, and lab packaging
- Cores and labels assembly:
  - Each X-plot bag contains five labels corresponding to the five cores (C, Ada/Adb, Ba/Bb) with proper color coding and order.
  - Caps: RED top cap on extraction (to be removed first) and BLACK bottom cap; label notes to differentiate full-length, short, or compressed cores.
- Post-field procedures:
  - Scan all labels after sampling; if scanning issues occur, enter barcode data manually or generate a surrogate label per standard format.
- Post-collection storage and dispatch:
  - Cores returned to accommodation or lab and stored in a cooled environment (cool box or fridge).
  - Post shipment: pack cores from the same SQ together; avoid posting on Thursdays/Fridays or weekends; refrigerate if delays are anticipated.
  - Packaging requirements:
    - Primary leak-proof container: plastic core
    - Secondary leak-proof container: sealed plastic bag
    - Outer packaging: sturdy (e.g., Tyvek), with absorbent material if liquids are possible
    - Ensure at least one surface is 100mm x 100mm
- Destination of cores:
  - BLACK and WHITE cores to Bangor (4°C storage)
  - GREY biology cores to Lancaster (freeze at -20°C; or shipped via chain as per lab protocol)
  - Additional handling notes for distribution of specific core types (e.g., Bangor, Lancaster, or other labs as per year’s arrangement)

## Data quality, notes, and field data management
- If sampling problems arise (e.g., large tree roots, rock, or unusual vegetation), record a short note in the field software and/or on the bag.
- If core cannot reach full depth, document the height from the cross bar to the ground and add a bag note indicating “short” or “comp” (compressed) to support later bulk-density calculation.
- Record peat depth and O horizon depth, plus all measurements in centimeters.
- After sampling, ensure surface vegetation is properly cleared and labeled to reflect forest-floor sampling guidelines.

## Forest floor and horizon guidance
- Vegetation-free sampling surface and forest-floor material guidelines ensure correct interpretation of litter and organic horizon samples.
- Definitions of organic-layer horizons (e.g., F, H) are provided to aid consistent classification during sampling and later lab analysis.

## General notes
- This handbook supports a national-scale soil-vegetation monitoring program under UK-SCaPE with funding from the Natural Environment Research Council.
- Emphasizes consistent data capture, robust labeling, sample integrity during transport, and clear field-to-lab data workflows to support GIS-based analysis and map-based data products.
