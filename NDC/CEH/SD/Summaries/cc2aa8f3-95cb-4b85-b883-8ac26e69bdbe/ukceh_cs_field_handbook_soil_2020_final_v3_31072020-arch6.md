# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - Rolling national soil and vegetation survey to assess soil change over time by re-surveying former Countryside Survey squares (approx. 500 squares over 5 years; ~100 per year).
  - Data collection supports understanding soil function and change at national scale; part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.

- Data collection design and data types
  - X plots: five cores per plot (1 black for chemistry, 2 white for storage, 2 grey for biology) taken from the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - Vegetation measurements recorded in the same squares as soil sampling.
  - Peat/organic layer depth measured with avalanche rod at three marked locations; depths recorded in centimeters.
  - Core labeling scheme: C (Chemistry) on black core, Ada/Adb (Storage) on white cores, Ba/Bb (Biology) on grey cores; bags and labels correspond to plot and core type.

- Equipment and packing
  - Comprehensive field kit: corer with accessories, hammers, guards, knives, rulers, trowels, extruder, trays, scissors, PPE, markers, and cooling/storage gear (cool box, fridge).
  - Packing list ensures safe transport, cooling, and contamination prevention.

- Sampling procedures and handling
  - Mineral soils: insert core with hammer, cut bottom edge, extract core; if depth insufficient, relocate slightly and retry; record depth from cross bar if unable to achieve full 15 cm.
  - Organic soils: if core cannot be driven, place core on surface and cut around bottom edge; aim to minimize compression and recover soil; use tools to free core without losing material.
  - Scree/rocky soils: use trowel to collect fine material; label as scree if sampling isn’t feasible; backfill and cap holes to prevent injuries.
  - Core handling: extract, cap top (red) and bottom (black); if extraction is difficult, use crowbar or muddler; use trays to prevent contamination; note if sample is shorter than 15 cm as “short” or “comp” on the plastic bag.
  - unusual conditions: note any issues (roots, large vegetation, animals, obstacles) in the software and on the bag.

- Data capture, labeling, and metadata
  - After sampling, scan labels with tablet; if scanning issues occur, manually enter the barcode; if no barcode, generate one using a defined logic (year, square, X-plot, core type).
  - Labels follow a standardized bag format; ensure correct core-to-bag mapping and plot identifiers (SQ number, year, X-plot number, core type).

- Data quality assurance and notes
  - Clear surface vegetation, aggregate litter rules; record O horizon/peat depth; document partial cores with notes to enable correct lab interpretation (bulk density, avoidance of misclassification between compressed and short cores).
  - Record any deviations or problems in software and on bag labels to maintain data traceability.

- Sample storage, storage conditions, and dispatch
  - Post-sampling storage: keep cores cool in a vehicle cool box or portable fridge; refrigerate if posting is delayed; avoid posting on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends.
  - Packaging guidelines: leak-proof primary (core), leak-proof secondary (sealed bag), outer packaging with sufficient strength; include absorbent material if leakage is possible.
  - Core destinations and storage conditions:
    - Black and White cores: Bangor; stored in a cold room at 4°C.
    - Grey biology cores: posted to Lancaster and frozen at -20°C; current practice may involve interim storage at Wallingford before final processing in Lancaster.
  - Addresses and logistics for Bangor, Lancaster, and Edinburgh/Wallingford as per protocol.

- End-to-end workflow and outputs
  - Aligns physical sampling with digital data capture to enable national-scale soil-change analyses.
  - Data products may include chemistry and biology analyses from core types, with self-serve access through appropriate data platforms; early prototypes may be shared with stakeholders.

- Additional notes and context
  - Survey years referenced: 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019–2022 rolling survey.
  - Forest floor sampling and organic-layer definitions are documented for consistent data interpretation.
  - Site coordination and support through UKCEH and UK-SCaPE program.
