# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- An historical and practical account of how the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification have been developed and applied from 1978 through 2007 to provide robust environmental data for national, regional, and country-specific reporting.
- Emphasises the use of stratified, random sampling of 1 km squares to ensure representative ecological and land-use information across Great Britain and its constituent countries.
- Describes the evolution of the ITE Land Classification system (from 32 classes to expanded classifications) and how classifications underpin the sampling framework and national estimates.

## Key concepts

- Stratified random sampling: To reduce bias and ensure representative coverage of land types and ecological conditions.
- ITE Land Classification: A multivariate framework grouping land into environmental classes to drive sampling strata.
- Field survey units: Initially 1 km squares (core sampling), with surrounding squares allocated to classes for context.
- National estimates: Derived by combining mean habitat areas per square within each Land Class with the total area of each class.
- Country-specific reporting: Framework adapted to produce England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only (and later upland) estimates.

## Historical development and milestones

- 1978 (The Beginning)
  - Development of the original ITE Land Classification using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified; surrounding squares included).
  - 8 squares per Land Class surveyed (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Field survey expanded to 12 squares per Land Class (384 total) to improve estimates.
  - Acknowledges potential improvements in allocation to reduce sampling error.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1984 vegetation data included.
  - Results linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to enable separate reporting for Scotland; number of Land Classes increased to 40.
  - Results published; CS1990 estimates used as a baseline for this revision.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; Fifth Field Survey)
  - Addressed policy needs to produce separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates; adjustments to enable country-unit reporting.
  - Sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40 strata; additional sampling implemented to ensure representation across country units.
  - Introduction of a Wales-adjusted sampling framework and a plan to improve UK-wide consistency.

- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; Sixth Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting needs further addressed post-devolution; added Welsh class sub-divisions (creating five new Wales-oriented classes) and increased Wales sampling to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments maintained to preserve overall precision; detailed country-specific sampling maps and tables provided.

## Sampling framework and data structure

- Land Classes and strata
  - Original 32 Land Classes (1978) expanded over time (to 40 in 1990; 45 in 2007 with Wales-specific subdivisions).
  - Each Class represents a stratum used to allocate sample squares across GB.
- Sample sizes and allocation
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (broader inclusion of all GB squares; some class changes).
  - CS2000: 569 squares (expanded to support England & Wales reporting; 40 strata).
  - CS2007: 591 squares (further Wales-focused subdivisions and country-unit considerations).
- National estimates
  - Based on mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land area of that class.
  - Tables and figures (CS2000 and CS2007) illustrate the distribution and sampling rates by class and country.
- Separate country estimates
  - Framework subdivides Land Classes into country-unit versions for England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only reporting.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country.
  - Some repurposing of classes (aggregation of rump classes) to maintain robust representation when country-specific counts are low.
- Wales and uplands emphasis (CS2007)
  - Wales-specific class subdivisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to improve Wales reporting precision.
  - An upland module added to CS2000 (30 additional squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

## Policy and governance implications for monitoring

- The strategy provides a transparent, repeatable framework for measuring environmental change over time, enabling policy scrutiny and decision-making at GB and country levels.
- The evolution of classifications and sampling allocations demonstrates an ongoing effort to:
  - Improve representativeness and reduce statistical error.
  - Meet devolved governmental needs for Wales- and Scotland-specific reporting.
  - Balance historical continuity with methodological improvements to support robust trend analysis.
- The approach highlights the importance of adaptable data stratification and country-specific reporting to inform environmental policy and management decisions.
