# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the UK-SCaPE programme to resurvey former Countryside Survey squares and monitor soil change over time.
  - Rolling program: ~500 squares over 5 years, about 100 squares per year.
  - In each X plot, collect soil cores and vegetation data to assess soil function and landscape change at national scale.

- Sampling design and targets
  - Five 15 cm soil cores per X plot: two white (storage), two grey (biology), one black (chemistry).
  - Cores positioned on the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - If sampling is not possible or problems arise (roots, large objects, etc.), record a note in the software and adjust location as needed.
  - If cores cannot reach full 15 cm depth due to obstacles, record the depth from the base of the cross bar to the ground and mark the bag as 'short' or 'comp' for lab processing.

- Peat and organic soil considerations
  - In peat/organic soils, depth of organic layer (O horizon) is measured with an avalanche rod at 3 marked locations; record depth if > 2 cm.
  - After coring, measure O horizon depth by probing beyond the core (up to 20 cm beyond cores) using a 3 m pole, avoiding clay layers.
  - Organic soils may require alternative core handling to avoid compression; follow specific procedures to preserve sample integrity.

- Core labeling, types and handling
  - Core types and corresponding labels:
    - C (Chemistry): 1x long black core
    - Ada/Adb (Storage): long white cores
    - Ba/Bb (Biology): long grey cores
  - Packaging: cap top red, bottom black; seal in appropriate bags; note if sample is short or compressed on the bag.
  - In forest/litter contexts, only decayed surface material is sampled; avoid collecting green vegetation; follow forest floor sampling guidance.
  - Mineral soils: core insertion and extraction steps described; if hard layers or obstacles prevent full penetration, record the issue and use alternate extraction aids (crowbar, wood muddler, etc.).
  - Scree/rocky soils: if stones prevent core collection, label as scree and, if possible, collect fine material with a trowel; do not collect oversized stones.
  - For very peaty soils, avoid forcing cores; use knife and alternate methods to minimize compression.
  - After sampling, fill holes to prevent livestock injuries; do not mix material from other locations.

- Data management and field notes
  - Record problems (e.g., roots, large objects) as notes in the data system.
  - If unusual vegetation or other site issues occur, document in the field and on the plastic bag as needed (short/comp notes).
  - Scanning labels: after sealing, scan plot-specific labels with a tablet; if scanning is not possible, manually enter the barcode. If no barcode exists, generate one using a defined logic (year, SQ number, X plot, core type).

- Sample storage, packaging and dispatch
  - Storage: cores kept in a cool environment (cool box in vehicle or a fridge at accommodation/lab) until dispatch.
  - Packaging requirements (priority for lab safety and transport):
    - Primary leak-proof container: the plastic core
    - Secondary leak-proof container: sealed plastic bag
    - Outer packaging: Tyvek or equivalent with a minimum surface of 100 mm x 100 mm; include absorbent material if liquids are possible
  - Cold chain destinations:
    - Black and white cores: Bangor (4°C cold room)
    - Grey biology cores: Lancaster (post and storage; -20°C on arrival or as directed)
  - Destination addresses:
    - Bangor: UKCEH, Environment Centre Wales, Deiniol Road, Bangor, LL57 2UW
    - Lancaster: UKCEH, Lancaster Environment Centre, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster, LA1 4AP
    - Edits in 2020 indicate coordination between Bangor and Lancaster (Lab-specific handling and shipping routes)
  - Post timing: do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate if unit is not sent until Monday. Follow postal guidelines for leak-proof packaging and absorbent materials.

- Post-processing and labouratory data alignment
  - After delivery to labs, cores are allocated to appropriate analyses (Chemistry, Storage, Biology) according to core labels (C, Ada/Adb, Ba/Bb).
  - Cores and labels are tracked to ensure correct association with the corresponding plot, X plot, and year.

- Equipment and field logistics (summary)
  - Comprehensive field kit includes: coring device with accessories (handle, crossbar, hammer, block), knives, guards, rulers (15 cm and 30 cm), trowel, extenders, trays, scissors, extruder, pliers, markers, tape, gloves, bags, and a cooling/storage system (cool box and/or fridge).
  - Avalanche rod for peat depth checks; extension cables and power options for cooling equipment.
  - Clear guidance on how to handle obstructed cores, sample extraction, and loss prevention during fieldwork.

- Administrative and coordination notes
  - The program is supported by NERC and UK-SCaPE; results contribute to national capability in soil and vegetation surveys.
  - Documentation includes detailed figures and step-by-step procedures to ensure consistency across field teams and years.
  - Clear emphasis on data quality, traceability, and the accessibility of underlying data for wider use.
