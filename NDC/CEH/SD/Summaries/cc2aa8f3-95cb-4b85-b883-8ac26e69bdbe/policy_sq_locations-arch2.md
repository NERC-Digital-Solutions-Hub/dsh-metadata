# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- CS partner organizations (2007) include: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and obtaining landowner permission for surveying.
- Public interest to maintain confidentiality; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Location data can be released to show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (to identify 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; the requester must demonstrate that their IP/data requires equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; UKCEH may pre-process instead of releasing raw locations.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could help identify square location and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; no data retention to fulfill other obligations.
- End of licensing: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- 4-digit releases have less stringent IP protections than 6-digit releases but still prohibit attempts to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorized senior representative of the licensee organization.
- If access is denied, procedures under FOI/Regulations are followed.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For practical use within CS, UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organizations are cases-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH involvement may be as collaboration or paid support, depending on case-by-case negotiations.
