# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Purpose and context
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007 and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification that underpins it.
- Emphasizes that the current methodology is built on three decades of prior work and is essential for producing time-series environmental estimates.
- Highlights aims aligned with environmental monitoring: transparent data, standardised outputs, and supporting policy-relevant assessments.

## Core concepts: stratification and land classification
- Stratification is used to ensure samples represent the range of land types and reduce bias from purely random sampling.
- The ITE Land Classification groups areas by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to create discrete strata for sampling.
- Initial approach (1970s) classified 1 km squares, then used surrounding squares to expand the classification context.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate classification formed the basis for creating land classes that underpin national surveys.

## Timeline and evolution of sampling and classification

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification (CS1978)
  - Developed a 32-class ITE Land Classification from environmental data for 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 classified).
  - Created surrounding-square classifications to extend context, resulting in 6039 km squares classified.
  - Field survey sampled 8 squares per land class (total 256); focused on vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat areas mapped.
  - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by land-class area.

- 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey (CS1984)
  - Used the same sampling framework but increased sample size by 50% (12 squares per class; total 384, including previously visited eight).
  - Aimed to improve estimates of land use and habitat mapping.

- 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and All Squares Land Classification
  - Integrated data for every GB square into an updated Land Classification; added urban/sea corrections.
  - Field survey comprised 508 squares; re-recorded features from CS1984 plus repeats of 1978 quadrats.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB (from satellite imagery).

- 1990–2000 – Refinement and extension of the Land Classification
  - Recognised need to classify all GB squares, but computing limits prevented perfect replication of the 1970s scheme.
  - Implemented a surrogate, class-based approach for all squares; compared to the original classification with 62% class agreement.
  - Non-matching squares largely fell into neighboring classes; overall characteristics of classes remained stable.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) and country reporting
  - Need to produce separate estimates for England & Wales vs Scotland, with Wales-specific reporting driven by devolved policy needs.
  - Adjustments included subdividing Land Classes into country-unit variants (England with Wales and Scotland), aggregating rare sub-classes, and adding squares to ensure representation.
  - Introduced 40 strata (vs 32 previously) and allocated 19 additional squares; adjusted to maintain representation across new classes.
  - Wales-specific sampling enhanced, including a Wales uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England/Wales contexts.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) and Wales-only reporting
  - Responded to Wales-only reporting needs post-devolution; added Wales-focused sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) for country-unit delineation.
  - Increased total strata to 45; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes; two English classes remained with four squares each due to precision considerations.
  - Revised maps (England with Wales and Scotland) and a new England-Wales Scotland sampling framework summary provided to support country-specific outputs.
  - Tables detail per-country sampling rates and square counts; Wales showed greater sampling intensity than Scotland or England prior to 2007 adjustments.

## Country-specific framing and upland sampling
- England, Scotland, and Wales are treated as separate units for national estimates, with sample allocation adapted to each country’s needs.
- Wales required targeted Welsh-class subdivisions and upland habitat sampling to improve estimates for Welsh and upland England/Wales contexts.
- An uplands module in CS2000 added 30 squares to better quantify upland habitats and improve country-specific accuracy.

## Outputs, maps, and data handling
- Outputs include habitat area estimates by Land Class and time-series comparisons, presented in reports, maps, and charts.
- Figures and tables (e.g., land-class maps and sample-square distribution) illustrate the evolving sampling framework and country-specific stratification.
- Note on national estimates: changing classifications across surveys affects consistency; two approaches exist (latest country-specific classifications vs the original 1990 classification). The document indicates preference for using the latest country-specific framework for internal consistency, with awareness of cross-survey comparability issues.

## Appendix and references
- Appendix I (Brief History of the ITE Land Classification) provides a detailed lineage of the land-class framework and its applications across surveys.
- The document includes acknowledgments and a comprehensive bibliography detailing methodological development, cross-survey comparisons, and country-specific reporting work.

## Relevance for environmental analytics
- The sampling strategy provides a transparent, time-series framework for monitoring environmental conditions and policy performance across GB and its constituent countries.
- Standardised stratification and linkage to land-class outputs enable consistent tracking of habitat change, land-use trends, and landscape-scale environmental indicators over multiple decades.
- The approach also highlights ongoing challenges in data integration, cross-country comparability, and expanding data value through broader data sharing and integration with other environmental datasets.
