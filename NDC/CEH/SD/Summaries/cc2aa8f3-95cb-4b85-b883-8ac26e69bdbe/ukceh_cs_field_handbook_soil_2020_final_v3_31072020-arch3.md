# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

- Purpose and context
  - Re-survey former Countryside Survey squares to assess soil change and function at national scale.
  - Part of UK-SCaPE research platform; serves as a rolling data collection framework to inform policy-relevant environmental health insights.
  - ~500 squares surveyed over a 5-year rolling programme (about 100 per year); soil and vegetation measurements taken only from the X plots in each square.

- Sampling design and targets
  - Five X plots per square; plots randomly located within the dominant vegetation and away from field boundaries.
  - In each X plot, five soil cores (two white, two grey, one black) are extracted on the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat.
  - Cores are designated for different analyses: chemistry (C), storage (Ada/Adb), and biology (Ba/Bb).
  - If sampling issues arise (e.g., large roots, obstacles), notes are entered in the database; if needed, adjust location to achieve meaningful, homogeneous samples.

- Core types and labeling
  - Core types and intended destinations:
    - Black core: Chemistry (C)
    - White cores (Ada/Adb): Storage
    - Grey cores (Ba/Bb): Biology
  - Pre-labelling and bagging aligned with the core type; each plot bag contains five labels corresponding to its cores.
  - Core processing includes specific cap colors (red on top, black on bottom) and careful handling to avoid contamination or loss of soil.
  - Notes on bag content (short or compressed) must be added when the full 15 cm is not achieved, to support accurate bulk density interpretation.

- Field equipment and procedures
  - Comprehensive field kit and coring system with multiple tools to handle root interference, loose soils, and clays.
  - Equipment lists include corer assembly, hammer options, crowbars, trowels, knives, guards, rulers, trays, extruders, scissors, gloves, markers, and storage boxes.
  - Depth measurement and sampling guides provided; depth from cross bar to ground documented if a full 15 cm core cannot be achieved.

- Peat depth and organic layer assessment
  - Avalanche rod used to test peat/O horizon depth at three star-marked locations when soil is peaty.
  - Record depth if the organic layer exceeds 2 cm and measure O horizon depth beyond cores (up to 20 cm from the core area; rod extends up to 3 m).
  - Organic-rich soils may require alternative core techniques (e.g., cutting around the bottom edge) to minimize compression and loss in the sample.

- Handling of different soil types
  - Mineral soils: follow standard coring procedure; if full 15 cm depth is not reached, note depth and adjust sampling location as needed.
  - Organic soils: core may not fit; core on the surface and cut around the bottom edge to fill, ensuring minimal disturbance and preventing loss.
  - Very peaty soils: avoid compressing the sample by using cutting methods rather than coring; meticulously trim cores as needed.
  - Scree/rocky soils: may not yield a usable core; collect fine material with a trowel if possible and label as scree.

- Surface preparation and vegetation handling
  - Clear surface debris (green vegetation) but not fermented plant material; in forests, avoid pulling live plants except where required to access the core.
  - Litter sampling guidance provided for forest floors (F/H horizons); ensure surface residues and horizons are properly identified and described.

- Post-sampling data capture and scanning
  - After cores are sealed in bags, input measurements and notes into software; use a tablet to scan labels into the plot’s header data.
  - If scanning issues occur (e.g., weather, camera problems), manual entry of barcodes is allowed; if no barcode exists, generate one using a defined logic (year, square, X-plot, core type).

- Sample storage, packaging, and shipping
  - Cores returned to accommodation or laboratory for cold storage (cool box or fridge) to maintain sample integrity.
  - Packaging requirements for mailing include leakproof primary and secondary containers, sturdy outer packaging (Tyvek envelopes), and absorbent material if liquids may be present.
  - Post-sampling dispatch:
    - Black and White cores to Bangor (stored cold at 4°C).
    - Grey cores to Lancaster (frozen at -20°C; some years via Wallingford logistics, depending on pipeline).
  - Handling and routing rules emphasize timely posting to enable lab processing, with guidance to avoid posting on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends.

- Destination specifics and contacts
  - Bangor (UKCEH Environment Centre Wales) handles Black and White cores; storage includes cold room conditions.
  - Lancaster (Lancaster Environment Centre) handles Grey biology cores; short-term storage with freezing; occasional intermediary steps via Wallingford depending on the year.
  - Edinburgh/Wallingford hub locations referenced for broader program coordination.

- Data governance, metadata, and quality considerations
  - Emphasis on ensuring traceability of samples, accurate metadata (sampling location, depth, core type, and bag notes), and clear data stewardship.
  - Importance of transparent data sharing, proper data management, and adherence to standardized labelling to facilitate cross-year comparisons and national-scale analyses.
  - Clear notes on handling unusual field conditions, preserving sample integrity, and avoiding cross-contamination or mislabeling.

- Administrative and historical context
  - The handbook documents the 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019–2022 survey framework as part of a long-term Soil and Vegetation Monitoring Platform within UKCEH-Countryside Survey and UK-SCaPE.
  - Version history highlights iterative improvements, including scanning workflow additions and process refinements up to 2020.
