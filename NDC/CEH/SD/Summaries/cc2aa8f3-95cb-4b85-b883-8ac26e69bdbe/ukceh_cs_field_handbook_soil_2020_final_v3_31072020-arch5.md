# Soil Cores

## Purpose and scope
- UK-CEH Countryside Survey aims to resurvey former Countryside Survey squares to assess soil change and understand soil function at national scale.
- Approximately 500 squares surveyed over a 5-year rolling programme (~100 squares per year) on five X-plots per square (randomly located within the dominant vegetation, away from boundaries).
- Each X-plot core set comprises five 15 cm cores (2 white for storage, 2 grey for biology, 1 black for chemistry).
- Cores and vegetation are linked to a square (SQ) and plot, with data captured in software and labels for traceability.
- Work supported by NERC under UK-SCaPE programme; aims to provide a consistent national data platform.

## Experimental design and core types
- Five plastic cores per X-plot: Black (Chemistry), White (Storage, 2), Grey (Biology, 2).
- Cores are labeled Ada/Adb (white), Ba/Bb (grey), and C (black) with corresponding storage/distribution roles.
- Cores are aligned on the WEST line of the X-plot quadrat, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation plot.
- Documentation and labeling follow a standardized scheme to enable downstream lab analyses (bulk density, soil chemistry, biology).

## Equipment and field handling
- Comprehensive field kit including corer assembly (with crossbar and hammer), knife, guards, rulers, trowel, extruder, scissors, crowbar/lever, gloves, and a range of containers and markers.
- Trays for loose material, and a cool storage system (Electric Cool Box; optional small fridge at accommodation) to maintain sample integrity.
- Clear instructions to prevent cross-contamination and to manage challenging soils (peat, organic, scree), with guidance to log field notes in software.

## Sampling procedure (mineral, organic, peat, and special cases)
- Mineral soils:
  - Insert corer to 15 cm depth with hammer, ensure cross bar is flush; if depth is insufficient, relocate slightly and retry.
  - If full 15 cm core cannot be obtained due to rocks/roots, record the height from the cross bar to ground and note in software; mark bag with a short note distinguishing compressed vs short cores.
  - Twist/pull to extract core; use crowbar or wood muddler if extraction is difficult; trim and cap as core emerges (RED cap on top, BLACK on bottom).
  - If soil is very loose/dry, use tray and keep soil contained; ensure correct end caps.
- Organic soils:
  - Core may not penetrate fibrous organic layers; place core on soil surface and cut around bottom edge with knife; push core in and cut above as needed; use trowel/pliers to free core without losing soil from ends.
  - If organic layer exceeds ~15 cm, avoid compression; use alternative method and handle carefully to minimize compression.
- Peat/organic horizons:
  - Use avalanche rod to assess O horizon depth at three marked positions; record depth if organic layer > 2 cm depth on core exit; depth measurements in cm.
  - In peat, press the rod 20 cm beyond the core to gauge organic layer depth.
- Scree/rocky soils:
  - If core extraction is not feasible, collect the maximum feasible material with a trowel; label as scree and avoid introducing large stones.
- Surface vegetation:
  - Remove loose surface material (green leaves/needles) but retain fermented/fresh residues as required by forest floor guidelines.
- Sample integrity and labeling during collection:
  - After extraction, cap and seal cores promptly; ensure correct end orientation (red on top, black on bottom).
  - Record notes for unusual obstacles (e.g., large tree roots, cow pats, boulders) and log in software.
  - Document any partial cores as “short” or “comp” (compressed) to support lab corrections for bulk density.

## Labeling, documentation and data capture
- Cores and bags are pre-labeled with core type and location identifiers:
  - C (Chemistry): 1x long black core
  - Ada/Adb (Storage): long white cores
  - Ba/Bb (Biology): long grey cores
- Bags are labeled with plot identifiers and SQ numbers; five labels per X-plot bag corresponding to the five cores.
- After sampling, scan labels with a tablet (plot-specific headers from Vegetation Handbook) and associate with the correct X-plot; if scanning is problematic, manually enter the barcode.
- If no barcode exists, generate one using a standardized logic (e.g., CS20year SQ17 X plot C/Ba/Bb/Ada/Adb).
- Include notes on core length (15 cm) and any “short” or “comp” distinctions on the plastic bag to support lab processing and bulk-density calculations.
- Record any field anomalies (e.g., vegetation present, soil anomalies) as notes in the software to preserve provenance.

## Post-collection handling, storage, and dispatch
- Transport cores to accommodation or lab in a cooled container; store in a plug-in cool box or fridge as appropriate.
- Packing and posting guidelines:
  - Pack all cores from the same SQ in the same bag; ensure leak-proof primary (core), secondary (sealed bag), and outer packaging with appropriate surface area; include absorbent material if liquid risk exists.
  - Do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate if awaiting next posting window.
- Core destinations:
  - BLACK and WHITE CORES: Bangor (UKCEH Bangor, Environment Centre Wales)
  - GREY BIOLOGY CORES: Lancaster (envelopes; freeze at -20°C as soon as possible)
- Storage specifics by core type:
  - Black and White cores: stored at approximately 4°C in a cold room
  - Grey cores: posted in envelopes; may be frozen upon arrival or sent via intermediary steps to Lancaster
- Post-processing and traceability:
  - Record SQ numbers on bag exterior and ensure the same SQ cores stay grouped together
  - Maintain documentation on how many plots were surveyed within each SQ
  - Ensure all labels are scanned or manually entered for database trackability

## Special considerations for field contexts
- Forest floor sampling guidance for vegetation-free surface and litter layers; categorize organic residues as F (Fermented) or H (Humic) per horizon descriptions.
- Organic and peat soils require careful handling to avoid core compression and to preserve sample integrity for subsequent analyses.
- If encountering separators or unusually thick organic horizons, adjust techniques accordingly and document deviations.

## Data governance and quality considerations for Data Stewards
- Standardization:
  - Use consistent core type codes and plot labeling across all surveys for interoperability.
  - Maintain a consistent barcode scheme and ensure linkage to SQ, X-plot, and core type in the data system.
- Provenance and traceability:
  - Capture exact field conditions, core depths, and any deviations with field notes; ensure notes are linked to the corresponding lab sample IDs.
  - Record peat depth measurements and O horizon depth when applicable; ensure these metadata are stored with the core dataset.
- Data capture and accessibility:
  - Use tablet-based scanning where possible; fallback to manual entry with explicit logic when barcodes are missing.
  - Ensure that all sample metadata (core type, depth, bag code, notes) are captured in a central data repository to support discovery and reuse.
- Quality and consistency:
  - Apply the “short” vs “comp” designation consistently to distinguish partial cores and compressed samples; use this to inform bulk-density lab analyses.
  - Log problems encountered in the software (e.g., root obstruction, thick rocks) to support data interpretation and future methodological improvements.
- Storage, retention, and sharing:
  - Maintain cold-chain integrity for black/white cores and appropriate storage for grey cores; ensure timely posting to support lab workflows.
  - Document packaging and shipping details to enable reproducibility of sample handling in future studies.
- Compliance and safety:
  - Follow field safety practices (e.g., covering holes after sampling) to prevent injuries and ensure environmental responsibility.

## Summary of key takeaways
- The Soil Cores procedure codifies a standardized, traceable approach to collecting five 15 cm cores per X-plot across rolling national surveys, with defined core types, labeling, and field procedures.
- Peat and organic soils require special handling to avoid compression and to accurately capture horizon depth.
- Labeling, barcode scanning, and software-based provenance are central to data governance, enabling reliable data discovery and reuse.
- Post-collection handling emphasizes cold-chain storage, timely dispatch, and consistent packaging while preserving sample integrity.
- Data Stewards should focus on metadata completeness, standardized naming conventions, and robust documentation of any deviations or anomalies to ensure data quality and interoperability.
