# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Managed on behalf of NERC by UKCEH; 2019 program funded under NERC award NE/R016429/1 as part of UK-SCaPE.

## Confidentiality rationale

- CS square locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels

- Location data can be used to determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (approximate locations within a 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) can be released only in very exceptional circumstances, after UKCEH determines that pre-processing analysis cannot be done without revealing data; applicant must demonstrate that their IP/data requires equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) carry the same confidentiality considerations as location data and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Licence terms and usage restrictions

- Licences must preserve confidentiality, require secure storage, and grant access only to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties after the licence ends.
- Licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure during the project and has been destroyed afterward.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult UKCEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check compliance by landowners.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; four-digit spatial releases include clauses preventing attempts to identify exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance

- UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If release is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under FOI/Regulations.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; collaboration or support may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for potential users

- Consider whether pre-processing by UKCEH can address needs to avoid disclosing precise locations.
- Seek early consultation with UKCEH to define requirements and appropriate use of the data.
- Understand that any access will be governed by a formal licence with strict confidentiality and usage constraints.
