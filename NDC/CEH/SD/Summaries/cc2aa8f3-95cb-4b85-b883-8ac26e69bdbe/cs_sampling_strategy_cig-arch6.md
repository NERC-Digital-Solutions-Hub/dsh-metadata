# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the sampling framework and land classification (ITE Land Classification) used for Countryside Survey field surveys up to 2007.
- Emphasizes the link between current methodology and its predecessors, and why the sampling framework is essential for representative national estimates of habitat and land-use features in Great Britain.
- Documents the progression from a 1 km square-based stratification to country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and inclusion of upland modules.

## Core Concepts and Goals
- Use stratified random sampling to minimize bias and ensure representativeness across diverse ecological conditions.
- Stratification is driven by environmental attributes (not just geography), similar to how opinion polls sample across demographic strata.
- Land Classification (ITE Land Classification) serves as the primary stratification framework for GB-wide sampling.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification
- 1970s: Initial development in Cumbria using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group 1 km squares by environmental attributes; produced 32 land classes.
- Centre-square approach (1978 CS): Classified the centre square of a 15x15 km grid plus surrounding squares to form a broad classification system; used to select 256 (8 per class) sample squares for the first national survey.
- 1984 CS: Expanded to survey 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve national estimates.
- 1990 CS: Land Classification updated to classify every GB square (all squares); allowed land-cover and habitat data integration; 508 squares surveyed; national estimates recalculated using the new scheme.
- 1998 CS: Land Classification revised to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
- 2000 CS: Adjustments for separate England and Wales reporting; creation of 40 strata reconfigured into country-specific units with additional squares to ensure representation; upland habitat sampling module introduced subsequently.
- 2007 CS: Wales-specific reporting needs led to further subdivision into country-unit classes (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares implemented; some English classes reduced in square counts to maintain precision.

## Sampling Frameworks and Country-Level Reporting
- Early surveys (CS1978, CS1984): national estimates based on a GB-wide Land Classification derived from a subset of classified squares.
- CS1990: full GB-wide Land Classification for all squares; more extensive data collection and national estimates at regional levels.
- CS2000: introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) with class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation in each country; added 19 extra squares and upland sampling module to England & Wales.
- CS2007: refined Wales-only reporting by creating country-unit Land Classes (5 new Welsh classes) and increasing overall strata to 45; expanded Wales sampling to ensure robust Wales-specific estimates; maintained English class counts with a few reductions where necessary.

## Upland and Special Modules
- An uplands module added to CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales, enhancing country-specific accuracy.

## Data Representation and Outputs
- Tables and maps document the distribution of sample squares by class and country, and the sampling rates (1:x) for each stratum across survey years.
- The approach supports national estimates of habitat areas by combining per-square data within each Land Class and multiplying by the class’s total GB area.
- Wales and Scotland receive tailored sampling intensities to meet country-specific policy and reporting needs, while the Isle of Man squares are replaced or reallocated as needed for country-unit reporting.

## National Estimates and Consistency
- Changing the Land Classification for national estimates can affect stock consistency across surveys.
- Two options for GB estimates: use the latest Land Classification (with country-specific sub-divisions) or apply the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
- The 2006 scoping study notes the trade-off between consistency across surveys and country-specific relevance; the preferred approach is to align with the latest classification for current surveys.

## Documentation and History
- The document includes:
  - A chronological account of Land Classification development and associated field surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
  - Acknowledgements and references to key methodological papers and CS main reports.
  - An appendix summarizing the history and evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey.

## Practical Data Support Implications
- Data products likely include stratified sampling plans, Land Classification maps, per-class area estimates, and country-specific estimates (England, Wales, Scotland).
- Data management challenges for data support include aligning datasets across multiple survey years, reconciling changes in classification, and ensuring consistency in outputs when classification schemes evolve.
- Potential dashboards or self-serve outputs could cover: map-based strata representations, sampling coverage by country and year, and change statistics for habitat areas across survey cycles.
