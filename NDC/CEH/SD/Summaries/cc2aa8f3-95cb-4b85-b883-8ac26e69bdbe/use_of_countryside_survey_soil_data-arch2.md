# Sampling design

- Sampling years and scope
  - Soils sampled in CS in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019+.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares (not all measurements on all samples); 2019 began a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
  - Some plots are relocated over time (destruction, permission issues, or relocation uncertainty).
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1); indicates square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Same location samples are from the same location (2–3 m apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot).

- Sampling method and depth
  - Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998, 2007, 2019 used a soil core hammered into the soil and pulled out.
  - 1978 used a soil pit with top 15 cm sampled from the pit side.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping undertaken.
  - Multiple cores per x-plot in 1998, 2007, 2019; different cores have different measurements.
  - No chemical analyses conducted by soil horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2019, but not using ISO bulk density method (would require a whole core).
  - A report on implications and full method description is available (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should consider statistical issues such as land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population rather than national estimates.
  - If land classes are accounted for, results are weighted towards national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; CS structure should be considered, and at minimum a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - Only one core per location is typically taken; however, design-based approaches (with dispersed observations) can improve overall precision and regional coverage.
  - For analysis and interpretation of CS soils data, consult CEH prior to analysis and review publications on the CS website for previously exploited data.
