# UK-CEH Countryside Survey Soil Handbook 2020

## Aim
- Establish a national-scale, time-series dataset by re-surveying former Countryside Survey squares to assess soil change and function over time.
- Revisit ~500 squares over a 5-year rolling programme (about 100 per year).
- Collect soil cores and vegetation data from five X-plots per square (located on the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central 2x2 m vegetation quadrat) as part of the UK-SCaPE national capability.

## Survey Design and Data Focus
- X plots: five cores per plot from each square, with cores color-coded by analysis type (two white for storage, two grey for biology, one black for chemistry).
- Temporal coverage includes 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019–22 sampling to enable change detection.
- Cores are 15 cm long; sampling location is fixed relative to the X-plot quadrat.

## Equipment and Materials
- Comprehensive field kit including: coring device with guards, knives, rulers (15 cm and 30 cm), trowel, hammers (3 lb and 4 lb), crowbar/levers, extruder, scissors, gloves, markers, and bags.
- Desiccation/temperature control: Electric cool box (car/cottage power), small fridge for accommodation, extension cables.
- Data and labeling: tablets for barcode scanning, labels, and mapping references.
- Additional items: trays for loose soil, avalanche rod for peat depth measurement, and a pack list table detailing tools and accessories.

## Core Sampling Protocol
- Per X-plot, collect five 15 cm cores (2 white, 2 grey, 1 black).
- Layout: cores aligned along the WEST line, 15 cm outside the central vegetation quadrat.
- Stepwise procedure:
  - Step 1: Locate X-plot and coring positions on the WEST line.
  - Step 2: For peat/organic layers, use the avalanche rod at three marked locations to measure O horizon depth; record depths in cm.
  - Step 3: Retrieve labeled core bags; assign the five cores to core types (C, Ada/Adb, Ba/Bb) and prepare for lab analysis.
- Surface preparation: remove surface vegetation (except organic layer material in peat), ensure clean cores, and handle roots with care.

## Core Types and Analytical Labels
- Core formats and labeling:
  - C (Chemistry): 1x long black core, 15 cm x 5 cm.
  - Ada/Adb (Storage): 1x long white core, 15 cm x 5 cm.
  - Ba/Bb (Biology): 1x long grey core, 15 cm x 5 cm.
- Labeling and packaging: top cap red, bottom cap black; seal in a labeled bag; note if a core is shorter than 15 cm (short) or compressed (comp) for lab bulk-density calculations.

## Data Capture and Recording
- Record core depths when full 15 cm penetration is not achieved (height from crossbar to ground).
- Add short notes on bags for deviations (e.g., rocks, dense roots) to aid Lab bulk-density interpretation.
- After sampling, scan soil labels with a tablet; if scanning is not possible, manually enter the barcode.
- If no barcode exists, generate one using the documented logic and later reconcile.

## Organic, Peaty, Mineral, and Rocky Soils
- Mineral soils: standard coring; use knife to cut around the bottom edge; hammer to drive; if cores won’t reach depth, adjust position and retry; use trays to prevent contamination.
- Organic soils: cores may be difficult; place core on surface and cut around bottom edge; push core into soil with knife, trim, and extract carefully to minimize disturbance.
- Peat/boggy soils: avoid excessive compression; cut the core or use the knife to create an acceptable core, minimizing compression.
- Very rocky/scree soils: use a trowel to collect finer material; if stones are too large, skip; label as scree.

## Sample Handling, Storage, and Dispatch
- Immediately store cores in a cool environment and transport to accommodation or lab in a cool box.
- Posting guidelines:
  - Pack cores from the same square and plot into the same bag.
  - Do not post on Thursdays, Fridays, or weekends; refrigerate if needed and post on the next available day.
  - Use leak-proof primary and secondary containers and strong outer packaging; include absorbent material if liquid is possible.
- Lab destinations and storage requirements:
  - Black and white cores: Bangor; stored at 4°C.
  - Grey cores: Lancaster; frozen at -20°C as soon as possible.
- Addressing and routing: cores to Bangor, Lancaster, or Wallingford/Lancaster depending on core type (as specified in the handbook).

## Data Management, Metadata, and Accessibility
- After collection, ensure appropriate labeling and place data in accessible datasets with metadata.
- Reference plot-specific headers from the Vegetation Handbook for X plots; use consistent SQ numbers for frozen samples.
- Maintain traceability of sampling sources and data provenance for future analyses and cross-time comparisons.

## Forest Floor and Horizon Considerations
- Define and identify litter and horizon types (F - fermented, fibric; H - humic) to determine organic layer depth and sampling approach.
- Depths and horizon details are captured to support interpretation of soil function and carbon dynamics.

## Endnotes and Contacts
- The handbook provides lab and regional contact points for Bangor, Lancaster, and Wallingford CEH centers to coordinate sample processing and storage.
