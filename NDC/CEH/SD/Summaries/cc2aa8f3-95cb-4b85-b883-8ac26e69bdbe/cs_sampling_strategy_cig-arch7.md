# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and core concept
  - Defines how the field survey element of Countryside Survey up to 2007 was sampled.
  - Uses a stratified, random sampling framework based on the ITE Land Classification to ensure samples represent different land types and ecological contexts across Great Britain.
  - Sampling units are 1 km squares; the classification guides how squares are selected and analyzed.
  - Data collected include habitat, land use, landscape features, and related ecological information which feed national and country-level estimates.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (historical context)
  - Origin in the 1970s: classify land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than species alone.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group environmental attributes into land classes.
  - Early work classified a subset of GB squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid; 1 km squares) to produce a practical, repeatable framework.
  - Initial output: a set of land classes used to stratify sampling and to estimate national habitat areas.

- Survey timeline and major changes (beginning, middle, end)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1228 classified centre squares; surrounding squares allocated to classes.
    - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) in total; national habitat estimates calculated from class proportions.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Sample size increased by 50%: 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Classification extended to every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; full quadrat and habitat data collected.
    - National estimates based on the revised all-squares classification.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification)
    - GB-wide refinement increased to 40 land classes; prepared for Scotland reporting; 569 squares surveyed in CS1990 framework.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) using country-unit versions of land classes.
    - Created 40 strata; added 19 squares to ensure adequate representation; upland habitats module added for England and Wales.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs prompted further adjustments.
    - Sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions for England & Wales (five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Increased to 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares; some English classes retained lower sample sizes due to Wales-focused design.
    - Upland sampling module retained to improve upland habitat estimates.

- Sampling design, numbers, and outputs
  - GB-wide sample sizes over time:
    - CS1978: 256 squares
    - CS1984: 384 squares
    - CS1990: 508 squares
    - CS2000: 569 squares
    - CS2007: 591 squares
  - Wales and England/Scotland adjustments:
    - Wales received expanded Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to support Wales-only reporting.
    - England and Wales combined vs Scotland reporting maintained; country-unit estimates required additional squares and class refinements.
  - Class structure and representation:
    - Land Classes expanded from 32 (1978) to 40 (1990) to 45 (2007) to improve regional and country-specific estimates.
    - The sampling framework aims to balance representation across classes and countries, while maintaining comparability with historical surveys.
  - Outputs and references:
    - National habitat estimates are derived from class means and class areas, with country-specific reporting for England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only outputs.
    - Key results published in major reports: CS1990 main report; CS2000 reports; CS2007 Wales reporting documents.
    - Supplementary materials include detailed tables of squares per class and per country, and notes on classification consistency and cross-survey comparability.

- Data handling, consistency, and GIS implications
  - The land classification serves as a robust GIS-based stratification framework to guide sampling, data collection, and later estimation.
  - Changes in classification across surveys can affect cross-survey comparability; decisions on using latest vs original classifications impact national estimates.
  - Wales and Scotland require tailored class subdivisions to achieve reliable, country-specific results, which has implications for map production, data layering, and time-series analyses.
  - The strategy integrates field data with satellite-derived land cover maps (notably around CS1990) to enrich the classification framework.

  - Acknowledgments for statistical guidance, data synthesis, and graphic production are noted for both pre-2007 and 2007 sections.
  - Extensive reference list covers methodological developments, land classification studies, and Countryside Survey reports, underscoring a long-running data framework for GIS-based ecological assessment.

- Practical takeaways for GIS specialists
  - Use the ITE Land Classification to define stratified sampling schemes and to structure map-based habitat estimates.
  - Be aware of evolving classifications; document the version used for each survey to maintain time-series validity.
  - Leverage country-unit subdivisions to produce Wales-only, England & Wales, and Scotland outputs; ensure maps reflect these subdivisions for policy and reporting needs.
  - Ensure data integration across years accounts for changes in class definitions and class counts (32 → 40 → 45) to maintain consistency in GIS analyses and visualization.
