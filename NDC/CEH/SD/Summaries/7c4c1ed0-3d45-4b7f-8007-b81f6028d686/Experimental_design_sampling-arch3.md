# We tested our hypotheses about controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska.

## Overview
- Objective: test hypotheses about controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional sequence formed by deglaciation.
- Location and scale: Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, ~11,000 km2, along a Y-shaped tidal fjord ~100 km long.
- Chronosequence and sampling: six catchments (ca. 10–30 km2 each) with 38–207 years since deglaciation.
- Timing: soil and vegetation sampling conducted in June–August 2011 or 2012.

## Study area and chronosequence details
- Glacial history: near glacial maximum around 1700 CE, followed by rapid recession exposing progressively younger surfaces moving northward up the fjord.
- Climate: maritime with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Catchments sampled: Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).

## Vegetation gradient and classification
- Vegetation-age progression:
  - >150 years since exposure: near fjord mouth, dominated by Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock).
  - 50–150 years: Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood).
  - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuata ( alder) and Dryas drummondii (Drummond’s Avens) dominate younger sites.
- Vegetation groupings for analysis: N-fixer (A. sinuatta and D. drummondii), deciduous (P. trichocarpa and Salix spp.), coniferous (P. sitchensis or T. heterophylla).
- Site characteristics recorded: elevation and slope categorized as low (<5°), medium (5–15°), or high (>15°).

## Methods: Sampling design and collection
- Site selection: chosen to represent the range of vegetation types and topographies across the chronosequence; Landsat imagery used to assess catchment vegetation and topography.
- Soil and plant sampling: for each vegetation type, composite soil samples collected from three locations; at each location, three soil samples taken within 1 m2 and combined to account for small-scale heterogeneity.
- Depth and handling: soil collected to 10 cm depth; samples stored in Ziploc bags for transport.
- Timing of collection: single collection per site during June–August of 2011 or 2012.
- Plant material: leaves collected from dominant vegetation types; riparian zones excluded as defined by terraces bordering the active floodplain.
