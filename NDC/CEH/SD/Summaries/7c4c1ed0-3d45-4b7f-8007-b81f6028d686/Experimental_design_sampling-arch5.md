# We tested our hypotheses about controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska.

## Overview
- Investigates controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
- Glacier Bay spans ~11,000 km2 along a Y-shaped tidal fjord; neoglacial ice retreated since ~1700 CE, exposing progressively younger surfaces.

## Study Area and Chronosequence
- Maritime climate with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Vegetation gradient along the chronosequence:
  - Mouth of fjord: long-exposed sites (>150 years) with Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock).
  - 50–150 years: Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood) dominant.
  - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuatta (alder) and Dryas drummondii dominate.
- Six catchments studied: Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).
- Ages since deglaciation: 38 to 207 years.

## Study Design and Sampling
- Site selection aimed to capture the range of vegetation types and topographies across the chronosequence; based on Landsat imagery.
- Excluded riparian zones defined by active floodplain terraces.
- For each vegetation type, collected composite soil samples from three locations per site.
- At each location, combined three soil samples taken within 1 m² to address small-scale heterogeneity.
- Soil collected to a depth of 10 cm with a hand trowel and soil corer; combined samples stored in Ziploc bags for transport.
- Sampling occurred once per site during June–August of 2011 or 2012.

## Vegetation Classification
- Three classes:
  - N-fixer: Alnus sinuatta and Dryas drummondii.
  - Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
  - Coniferous: Picea sitchensis or Tsuga heterophylla.
- Site elevations and slopes manually surveyed and categorized:
  - Elevation: not specified beyond inclusion in analyses.
  - Slope: low (<5°), medium (5–15°), high (>15°).

## Data and Metadata Considerations for Data Stewards
- Explicit sampling protocol details enable reproducibility and cross-site comparability (depth, composite sampling, within-site pooling, collection timing).
- Vegetation type groupings linked to data files via standardized nomenclature; common names provided in data files for clarity.
- Clear documentation of site identities (SFC, WPC, IVS, NFS, BBS, RPC) and their ages supports temporal interpretation along the chronosequence.
- Exclusion of riparian zones and explicit measurement methods help ensure consistent data governance and metadata quality across datasets.
