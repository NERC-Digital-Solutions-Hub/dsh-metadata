# We tested our hypotheses about controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska.

## Context and Objective
- Investigate controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay, SE Alaska.
- Study involves soil and vegetation sampling across six small catchments (≈10–30 km²) spanning 38 to 207 years since deglaciation.
- Aims to relate soil properties and vegetation to patterns in C and N cycling.

## Study Area and Chronosequence
- Glacier Bay: ~11,000 km², Y-shaped tidal fjord, ~100 km long; maritime climate with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Post-glacial vegetation gradient along the chronosequence:
  - More than 150 years: Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock) near mouth.
  - 50–150 years: Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood).
  - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuatta (alder) and Dryas drummondii (Drummond's Avens) near the current terminus.
- Catchment identifiers: Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).

## Data Collected and Variables
- Soil samples from each vegetation type; leaves collected from dominant vegetation types, excluding riparian zones.
- Sampling units:
  - For each vegetation type: composite soil samples from three locations.
  - At each location: three soil samples within 1 m² combined to address small-scale heterogeneity.
  - Depth: 10 cm.
- Timeframe: samples collected once per site during June–August 2011 or 2012.
- Vegetation classification: three classes
  - N-fixer: Alnus sinuatta and Dryas drummondii
  - Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
  - Coniferous: Pinus sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla
- Common names for species provided in brackets in data files.

## Sampling Design and Procedures
- Site selection based on Landsat imagery to capture vegetation types and topography; include plots from past studies.
- Exclusion of riparian zones (defined by terraces bordering active floodplain).
- Elevation and slope measured; slope categorized as:
  - Low < 5°
  - Medium 5–15°
  - High > 15°

## Data Organization and Metadata Considerations
- Data files reference dominant vegetation types with common names noted for clarity.
- Site-level metadata includes:
  - Site code (SFC, WPC, IVS, NFS, BBS, RPC)
  - Elevation
  - Slope category
- Relationships to C and N cycling to be explored by integrating soil data with vegetation class, topography, and chronosequence age.

## Temporal and Spatial Context
- Chronosequence ages span 38–207 years since deglaciation.
- Six study catchments cover a broad spatial scope within Glacier Bay’s landscape.
- Climate context described to contextualize soil processes and potential C/N dynamics.

## Data Use Possibilities and Outputs
- Enable analysis of how vegetation type, age since deglaciation, and microtopography influence soil C and N dynamics.
- Support creation of self-serve data products (e.g., dashboards) showing soil properties by vegetation class and chronosequence stage.
- Facilitate integration with additional datasets (e.g., broader C/N cycling measurements, climate data) for comparative or longitudinal studies.

## Quality, Limitations, and Practical Considerations
- Cross-sectional design with a single sampling event per site; temporal variability not captured.
- Data restricted to 10 cm soil depth; may limit understanding of deeper soil processes.
- Patchy data across sites and reliance on composite samples to address small-scale heterogeneity.
- Data files include species common names, aiding cross-study data alignment but require careful mapping to scientific nomenclature.
