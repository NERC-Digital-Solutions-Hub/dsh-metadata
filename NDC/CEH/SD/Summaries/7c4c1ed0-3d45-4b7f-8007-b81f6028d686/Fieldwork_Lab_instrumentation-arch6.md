# Soil pools and properties

## Overview
- Describes field collection, lab processing, and multi-method analyses to quantify soil moisture, organic matter, pH, bulk density, grain size, nitrogen species, nitrification/denitrification potentials, and stable isotopes (C and N) across soil samples from Glacier Bay.
- Emphasizes data quality controls (limits of detection, accuracy, and precision) and cross-lab analysis (samples sent to University of Birmingham and Paris for specific measurements).

## Sampling and sample processing
- Soils were kept shaded and cool and processed within four days of collection at Glacier Bay field station.
- Field moist soils were sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and large detritus; a separate hand-corer sample was used for bulk density after drying.
- Gravimetric soil moisture and organic matter content (loss on ignition) were measured on the 2 mm fraction; pH determined using standard methods.
- Grain size determined with a laser-based instrument (Mie scattering principle).
- Total soil water content calculated by multiplying gravimetric moisture by total soil weight from Chapin et al. (1994).
- Additional sample processing included removing organic matter from dried subsamples using 0.1 M NaClO, heating, and re-dispersion for grain-size analyses.

## Nitrogen extraction and chemical analyses
- N species extracted from soil slurries (10 g dry weight equivalent soil; 80 mL 2 M KCl).
- Extraction: continuous agitation, filtration to 0.2 μm, freezing, and transport to an external lab.
- NH4+ measured by buffered hypochlorite method; NO3− measured by cadmium column reduction to NO2− followed by Griess reaction; NO2− also measured by Griess reaction.
- Colorimetric analyses performed on a Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
- Detection limits and accuracy: limit of detection 0.05 μg mL−1 for all N species; accuracy ≥90%; coefficient of variation <1%.

## Nitrification and denitrification assays
- Potential nitrification assessed via 30-hour incubation monitoring nitrite consumption after adding NaNO2 (100 mg L−1) to soil slurries; post-incubation filtrates analyzed colorimetrically.
- Complementary measurements: net N mineralization and net nitrification assessed by 24-day incubation of unamended soils.
- Denitrification potential measured with and without acetylene (C2H2) to distinguish N2 from N2O production. Anaerobic incubations (4 hours at 20°C) used 10 g soil, 10 mL water, and substrate additions (10 μg NO3-N L−1 and 4 mg C6H12O6).
- Headspace sampled at 1 and 4 hours; N2O quantified by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector. Coefficient of variation was <2%.

## Isotopic analyses
- Measured natural abundance of C and N isotopes in soil and plant tissue to assess turnover and loss processes (δ13C and δ15N).
- Isotopic measurements conducted on an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS) at Paris (Vario PYRO cube and Isoprime).
- Reported CVs: δ13C = ±0.2‰; δ15N = ±0.3‰.
- Calculated enrichment factor (εf-s) as the difference between foliar and soil δ13C and δ15N to assess fractionation between litter inputs and soil organic matter.

## Data quality and outputs
- Emphasizes robust QA/QC across methods: detection limits, accuracy benchmarks, and instrument-specific precision.
- Outputs include:
  - Soil physical/chemical properties: moisture, organic matter content, pH, bulk density, grain-size distribution.
  - Nutrient metrics: NH4+, NO3−, NO2− concentrations; nitrification and denitrification potentials; net mineralization/nitrification rates.
  - Isotopic signatures: δ13C and δ15N in soil and leaves; enrichment factors (εf-s) for source-traceability analyses.
- Data collected across samples with cross-lab verification to ensure reliability for broader data use and interpretation.
