# We tested our hypotheses about controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska.

## Context and Scope
- Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, southeast Alaska; about 11,000 km2; maritime climate with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Post-glacial history: neoglacial ice sheet retreated starting around 1700 CE, exposing a chronosequence of surfaces as it receded northward.
- Objective: test hypotheses about controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional chronosequence.

## Study Design and Sites
- Six small catchments (ca. 10–30 km2) with 38–207 years since deglaciation.
- Sites: Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).
- Site selection aimed to capture the range of vegetation types and topographies; based on Landsat imagery analysis.

## Vegetation and Climate Context
- Vegetation transitions along the chronosequence:
  - Older sites (>150 years): temperate rainforest near fjord mouth, dominated by Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock).
  - 50–150 years: Picea sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood) dominate.
  - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuata (alder) and Dryas drummondii dominate younger sites.
- Common names noted in accompanying data files.

## Sampling Methods
- Collected soil and leaves from the dominant vegetation types within each catchment, excluding riparian zones.
- For each vegetation type: composite soil samples from three locations.
- At each location: combined three soil samples from within 1 m2 to address small-scale heterogeneity.
- Soil depth: 10 cm; samples stored in Ziploc bags for transport.
- Sampling occurred once per site during June–August 2011 or 2012.

## Vegetation Groupings
- N-fixer: Alnus sinuatta and Dryas drummondii.
- Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
- Coniferous: Picea sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla.

## Measurements and Data Scope
- Focus on controls on C and N cycling through soils and leaves, aligned with the chronosequence design.
- Vegetation type identifiers used in data files; common names included to aid interpretation.
- Site elevation and slope recorded; slope categories: low (<5°), medium (5–15°), high (>15°).

## Data Management Considerations for Data Leaders
- Chronosequence approach provides temporal context for C and N cycling comparisons.
- Standardized sampling design across multiple locations and vegetation types enhances data comparability.
- Clear metadata potential: site names, years since deglaciation, vegetation classifications, elevation, slope, and sampling window (2011–2012).
- Data assets linked to specific plots and vegetation groups facilitate reuse in broader network analyses and cross-site collaborations.
