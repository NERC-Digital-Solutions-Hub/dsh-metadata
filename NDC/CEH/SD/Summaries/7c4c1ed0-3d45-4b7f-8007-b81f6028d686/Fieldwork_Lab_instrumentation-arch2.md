# Soil pools and properties

- Field collection and handling
  - Soils kept shaded and cool; processed within four days at Glacier Bay field laboratory station.
  - Field-moist soils sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and large detritus for analyses.

- Basic soil properties measured in 2 mm fraction
  - Gravimetric soil moisture and organic matter content via loss on ignition.
  - pH measured using standard methods.
  - Bulk density estimated from a separate hand-corer sample after drying.
  - Grain size determined with a laser particle sizing instrument (Mie scattering).

- Organic matter removal and dispersion for particle-size analysis
  - Dried subsamples (0.1–1 g) treated with 0.1 M NaClO, heated to 80°C, and centrifuged to remove OM.
  - Repeated until OM-free; dispersed with 50 ml dispersion solution and final dispersion in 600 ml dispersion solution circulated in the laser instrument.
  - Ultrasonic burst (1 minute at 10.50 Hz) to improve dispersal; grain-size distribution derived from Mie theory.

- Calculation of total soil water content
  - Gravimetric moisture multiplied by total soil weight (from Chapin et al. 1994).

- Nitrogen extraction and colorimetric analyses
  - NH4+, NO2-, and NO3− extracted from slurries of 10 g soil (dry weight) with 80 ml 2 M KCl; shaken for 1 hour.
  - Extracts filtered to 0.2 μm, frozen, transported to University of Birmingham.
  - NH4+ measured with buffered hypochlorite method; NO3− reduced to NO2− via cadmium column, then Griess reaction; NO2− measured by Griess reaction.
  - Colorimetric analyses performed on a Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
  - Detection limit 0.05 μg mL−1 for all N species; accuracy ≥90%; coefficient of variation <1%.

- Nitrification and denitrification assays (potential activities)
  - Rationale: potential activities reflect microbial metabolic capacity; nitrifiers are slow-growing, so enzyme abundance integrates prior conditions.
  - Nitrification proxy: measure potential nitrite oxidation by nitrite consumption during a 30-hour incubation with 10 g soil and 15 ml of 100 mg L−1 NaNO2; after incubation, 80 ml 2 M KCl extracted and filtered for colorimetric analysis.
  - Net mineralization and net nitrification: unamended soils incubated for 24 days; NH4+ and NO3− accumulation tracked.
  - Denitrification (total and partial) assessed with and without acetylene (C2H2) to distinguish N2O from N2 production.
    - Anaerobic incubations: 10 g soil, 10 ml deionized water, in 100 mL gastight jars; 20°C, dark; substrates added (10 µg NO3-N−1 and 4 mg C6H12O6).
    - For partial denitrification: headspace enriched with acetylene-free C2H2 to 10 kPa (10% V/V) and 90 kPa He; anoxic conditions achieved by vacuum and He flushing.
    - Headspace sampling at 1 and 4 hours; N2O quantified by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector; CV < 2%.

- Isotopic analyses (C and N)
  - Natural abundance isotopes used to infer turnover and loss processes in soil and plant tissue.
  - δ15N and total N, δ13C and total C measured in soil and leaves using an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (EA-IRMS).
  - Analyses conducted at Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris.
  - Precision: δ13C ≈ 0.2‰; δ15N ≈ 0.3‰.
  - Enrichment factor (εf-s) calculated as the difference between foliar and soil δ13C and δ15N to assess fractionation and openness of the N cycle.

- General data quality and outputs
  - Standard methods applied across analyses; detailed instrument settings provided for reproducibility.
  - Outputs include soil moisture, organic matter, pH, bulk density, grain size distribution, inorganic N pools (NH4+, NO2−, NO3−), nitrification/denitrification potential rates, and isotopic signatures (δ13C, δ15N) for soil and foliage.
