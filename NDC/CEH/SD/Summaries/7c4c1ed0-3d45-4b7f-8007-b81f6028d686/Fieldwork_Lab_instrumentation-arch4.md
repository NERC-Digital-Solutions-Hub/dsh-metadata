# Soil pools and properties

- Purpose: Quantify soil carbon and nitrogen pools, microbial potential activities (nitrification and denitrification), and isotopic signatures to understand nutrient cycling and plant inputs across sites.

## Sample collection and preparation

- Soils kept shaded and cool; processed within four days of collection at Glacier Bay field laboratory.
- Field moist soils sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and large detritus for analyses.
- Separate hand-cored sample used to estimate bulk density after drying.
- Gravimetric soil moisture measured; total soil water content calculated using moisture and total soil weight estimates from Chapin et al. (1994).

## Analytical methods and instrumentation

- Grain size: determined with a laser Melvern Mastersizer.
- Organic matter: removed with 0.1 M NaClO, followed by heating and repeated centrifugation to obtain organic-free material; dispersal enhanced by dispersion solution, ultrasonic burst, and controlled pumping.
- Organic matter and texture analyses follow standard procedures; measurements rely on Mie scattering for grain size distribution.
- pH, organic matter content (loss on ignition), and bulk density determined from appropriate subsamples.
- Colorimetric analyses performed with a Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
- Data quality: limit of detection 0.05 μg mL^-1 for all N species; accuracy ≥90%; coefficient of variation (CV) <1%.

## Nitrogen measurements and fluxes

- NH4+, NO2-, and NO3- extracted from 10 g (dry weight equivalent) soil with 80 mL of 2 M KCl; extracts filtered to 0.2 μm and frozen for transport.
- NH4+ determined by buffered hypochlorite method; NO3- reduced to NO2- via cadmium column before Griess reaction; NO2- also measured by Griess reaction.

## Nitrification and denitrification assays

- Nitrification potential: 30-hour incubation of 10 g soil with 15 mL NaNO2; post-incubation extracts analyzed colorimetrically.
- Net mineralization and net nitrification measured by 24-day incubation of unamended soils.
- Denitrification potential: measured with and without acetylene (to block reduction of N2O to N2) in anaerobic incubations (10 g soil, 10 mL water) at 20°C for 4 hours; headspace sampled at 1 and 4 hours; N2O quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detector; CV <2%.

## Isotopic analyses

- Isotopic composition (δ^13C and δ^15N) of soil and plant leaves analyzed to assess carbon and nitrogen cycling and openness of the N cycle.
- Measurements done with an elemental analyzer coupled to an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer; samples processed at Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris.
- Reported CV: δ^13C 0.2‰; δ^15N 0.3‰.
- Additional metrics: total N and total C, plus enrichment factor (ε_f-s) calculated from leaf and soil δ^13C and δ^15N to assess fractionation between litter inputs and soil organic matter.
