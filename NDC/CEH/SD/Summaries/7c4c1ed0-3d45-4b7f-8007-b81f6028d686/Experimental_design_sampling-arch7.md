# Controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, Alaska

## Overview
- Investigates how controls on carbon and nitrogen cycling vary across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay, southeast Alaska.
- Glacier Bay spans about 11,000 km2 with a Y-shaped tidal fjord; the area was covered by a neoglacial ice sheet that receded around 1700 CE, exposing younger surfaces over time.

## Study area and chronosequence
- Six small catchments (approx. 10–30 km2) with names: Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).
- Ages since deglaciation range from 38 to 207 years.
- Maritime climate: cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Vegetation succession by age:
  - >150 years: Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock) near fjord mouth.
  - 50–150 years: Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood).
  - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuatta (alder) and Dryas drummondii (Drummond’s Avens).

## Sampling design and data collection
- Site selection based on Landsat imagery to capture vegetation and topographic variation across the chronosequence.
- Collected soil samples and leaves from dominant vegetation types per catchment, excluding riparian zones defined by active floodplain terraces.
- For each vegetation type, composite soil samples from three locations; within each location, three soil samples from 1 m2 to account for small-scale variability.
- Soil depth sampled to 10 cm using a hand trowel and soil corer; samples combined and stored in Ziploc bags.
- Sampling occurred once per site during June–August of 2011 or 2012.

## Vegetation classes and site measurements
- Vegetation types categorized into three classes:
  - N-fixer: Alnus sinuatta and Dryas drummondii
  - Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
  - Coniferous: Pinus sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla
- Measured site elevation and manually classified slope: low (<5°), medium (5–15°), or high (>15°).
