# Controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve

- Objective
  - Test hypotheses about controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay, Alaska.
- Study area
  - Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, southeast Alaska.
  - Maritime climate with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
  - Area ≈11,000 km² along a Y-shaped tidal fjord, originally glaciated with neoglacial ice retreating since ~1700 CE.
- Chronosequence and sites
  - Six catchments (ca. 10–30 km² each): Stone Fly Creek (SFC), Wolf Point Creek (WPC), Ice Valley Stream (IVS), North Fingers South Stream (NFS), Burge Bay South Stream (BBS), Rush Point Creek (RPC).
  - Surfaces exposed for 38 to 207 years since deglaciation, representing progressively younger ecosystems up fjord.
  - Vegetation types associated with age gradients:
    - Near mouth (older sites, >150 years): Tsuga heterophylla (hemlock) – temperate rainforest.
    - 50–150 years: Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood).
    - 5–50 years: Alnus sinuatta (Alnus) and Dryas drummondii (Drummond's Avens).
- Site selection and layout
  - Selected to span vegetation types and topographies across the chronosequence.
  - Site selection based on Landsat imagery analysis of catchment vegetation and topography.
  - Excluded riparian zones defined by terraces bordering the active floodplain.
- Sampling design
  - For each vegetation type, collected composite soil samples from three locations.
  - At each location, combined three soil samples taken within 1 m² to account for small-scale heterogeneity.
  - Depth of soil collection: 10 cm with a hand trowel and soil corer.
  - Sampling occurred once per site during June–August 2011 or 2012.
- Vegetation classification
  - Three broad classes:
    - N-fixer: Alnus sinuatta and Dryas drummondii.
    - Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
    - Coniferous: Pinus sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla.
- Data and reporting notes
  - Common names used in accompanying data files.
  - Site elevation and slope manually surveyed and categorized as low (<5°), medium (5–15°), or high (>15°).
