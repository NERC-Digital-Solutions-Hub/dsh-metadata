# Soil pools and properties

- Field handling and processing
  - Soils kept shaded and cool; processed within four days at the Glacier Bay field laboratory.
  - Field-moist soils sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and large detritus; separate hand-corer sample used to estimate bulk density after drying.
  - Soil grain size determined with a laser Melvern Mastersizer; gravimetric soil moisture and organic matter content (loss on ignition) measured; pH determined using standard methods.
  - Total soil water content calculated by multiplying gravimetric moisture by estimates of total soil weight (Chapin et al. 1994).

- Organic matter removal and dispersion
  - Dried soil subsamples (0.1–1 g) weighed into 50 mL tubes; treated with 0.1 M NaClO to remove organic matter.
  - Samples heated (80°C) and centrifuged (5 min at 3646 G); repeated until OM removal.
  - Samples subjected to 50 mL dispersion solution, then introduced into 600 mL dispersion solution circulating in the laser instrument.
  - Instrument settings: 2000 pump speed, 15–25 optical obscuration, 1 min ultrasonic burst at 10.50 Hz for dispersal.
  - Grain size distribution determined by the Mie scattering principle.

- C and N soil properties
  - Total soil water content derived from gravimetric moisture and total soil weight ( Chapin et al. 1994 ).

- Nitrogen extraction and analysis
  - N species extracted from 10 g (equivalent dry weight) field-moist soil with 80 mL of 2 M KCl; slurries agitated for 1 h and filtered to 0.2 μm; extracts frozen and shipped to University of Birmingham.
  - NH4+ determined by buffered hypochlorite method; NO3− via cadmium column reduction to NO2− followed by Griess reaction; NO2− measured by Griess reaction.
  - Colorimetric analyses performed on a Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
  - Detection limit: 0.05 μg mL−1 for all N species; accuracy ≥ 90%; coefficient of variation < 1%.

- Nitrification and denitrification potentials
  - Potential nitrification: inferred from nitrite consumption during a 30-hour incubation of soil slurries (10 g soil + 15 mL NaNO2 solution, 100 mg L−1); after incubation, slurries filtered and processed as above; colorimetric analysis of filtrate.
  - Net mineralization and net nitrification: measured as NH4+ and NO3− accumulation in unamended soils over 24 days.
  - Denitrification (total and partial): assessed with and without acetylene (C2H2) to block reduction of N2O to N2.
    - Anaerobic incubations: 10 g soil, 10 mL deionized water, 4 h in 100 mL gas-tight jars, dark at 20°C.
    - Substrate additions: 10 μg NO3-N L−1 and 4 mg C6H12O6 to ensure substrate sufficiency.
    - For partial denitrification: headspace adjusted to 10 kPa C2H2 (10% v/v) and 90 kPa He; anoxia established by vacuum/helium flush.
    - Headspace gas sampled at 1 and 4 hours; analyzed for N2O by gas chromatography with an electron capture detector.
  - Coefficient of variation for denitrification measurements < 2%.

- Isotopic analyses
  - Assessing natural abundance of C and N isotopes in soil and plant tissue to gauge turnover and loss processes.
  - δ13C and δ15N measured for soil and leaves; total C and N measured with an elemental analyzer (Vario Pyth) coupled to an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime).
  - Instrumentation: Vario PYRO cube (Elementar) + Isoprime mass spectrometer (Paris, France).
  - Precision: δ13C CV ≈ 0.2 ‰; δ15N CV ≈ 0.3 ‰.
  - Enrichment factors (εf-s) computed as the difference between foliar and soil δ13C and δ15N to assess fractionation and openness of the N cycle; zero indicates no change in signature.
  - Sampling context: analyses conducted at University facilities (Paris); data used to evaluate plant–soil N sources and turnover along a chronosequence.
