# Soil pools and properties

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes a comprehensive suite of soil physical, chemical, microbial activity, and isotopic measurements to quantify soil pools, processes, and their controls for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

- Sampling, processing, and storage
  - Soils kept shaded and cool; processed within four days at Glacier Bay field laboratory.
  - Field moist soils sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and large detritus; separate hand-core sample used for bulk density after drying.
  - Samples prepared for gravimetric moisture, organic matter (loss on ignition), and pH analyses.

- Physical properties and soil structure
  - Bulk density determined from a separate dried sample.
  - Grain size distribution measured with a laser Mie-scattering instrument (Melvern Mastersizer) after removing organic matter and dispersing the soil.

- Organic matter and dispersion chemistry
  - Organic matter removed using 0.1 M NaClO; repeated until free of organic matter.
  - Dispersed soil used in conjunction with laser analysis; ultrasonic treatment to enhance dispersion.

- Water content
  - Total soil water content calculated by multiplying gravimetric moisture by estimates of total soil weight (Chap in et al. 1994).

- Nutrient extraction and inorganic nitrogen analyses
  - 10 g (equivalent dry weight) of field-moist soil mixed with 80 mL of 2 M KCl; slurries shook for 1 h.
  - Extracts filtered to 0.2 μm, frozen, and transported to a partner lab.
  - NH4+, NO2-, and NO3- measured by colorimetric methods:
    - NH4+ with buffered hypochlorite method; NO3- via cadmium column reduction to NO2- followed by Griess reaction; NO2- via Griess reaction.
  - Instrument: Jenway 6800 UV/Vis spectrophotometer.
  - Analytical performance: detection limit 0.05 μg mL^-1 for all N species; accuracy ≥ 90%; coefficient of variation < 1%.

- Nitrification and denitrification potential assays
  - Nitrification potential (nitrite oxidation) inferred from nitrite consumption during 30-hour incubation of soil slurry with NaNO2; end-point analysis after 30 h.
  - Net mineralization and net nitrification: 24-day unamended soil incubations to measure NH4+ and NO3- accumulation.
  - Denitrification (total and partial) assessed with and without acetylene to block N2O→N2 reduction:
    - Anaerobic incubations using 10 g soil and 10 mL water in 100 mL jars at 20°C for 4 h.
    - Substrates added (10 μg NO3-N per g C and 4 g C per g soil equivalent).
    - Partial denitrification method uses acetylene headspace (10% v/v) to inhibit N2 production; headspace sampled at 1 and 4 h.
    - N2O quantified by gas chromatography with electron capture detector; coefficient of variation < 2%.

- Isotopic analyses
  - Isotopic composition (δ^15N and δ^13C) of soil and plant leaves to evaluate N sources and carbon turnover.
  - Measurements of total N and total C, plus δ^13C and δ^15N, performed with an elemental analyzer (Vario PYRO cube) coupled to an isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (Isoprime).
  - Analyses conducted at a separate facility (Pierre and Marie Curie University, Paris).
  - Precision: δ^13C ~ 0.2‰; δ^15N ~ 0.3‰.
  - Enrichment factor (ε_f-s) calculated as the difference between foliar and soil δ^13C and δ^15N to assess litter–soil isotope exchange.

- Data quality, standards, and reporting
  - Use of standard, documented methods for all analyses (e.g., colorimetric assays, GC for N2O, isotopic analysis by EA-IRMS).
  - Explicit performance metrics provided (LOD, accuracy, CV) to gauge data reliability.
  - Clear documentation of sample handling, instrument models, and analytical steps to support comparability and reproducibility.
