# We tested our hypotheses about controls on C and N cycling across a successional chronosequence in Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve in southeast Alaska.

## Objective
- Test hypotheses about controls on carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling across a successional chronosequence.

## Study Area and Chronosequence
- Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, southeast Alaska; ~11,000 km2; Y-shaped tidal fjord 100 km long.
- Neoglacial ice sheet retreated to expose progressively younger surfaces since around 1700 CE.
- Six catchments (SFC, WPC, IVS, NFS, BBS, RPC) spanning 38 to 207 years since deglaciation.
- Maritime climate with cool summers (10–20°C) and mild winters (-2 to 5°C).
- Vegetation varies with age: near mouth (hemlock Tsuga heterophylla), mid-recently exposed sites dominated by Pinus sitchensis (spruce) and Populus trichocarpa (cottonwood), and young sites dominated by Alnus sinuata (alder) and Dryas drummondii (Drummond’s avens).

## Study Design and Sampling
- Site selection aimed to capture the range of vegetation types and topographies across the chronosequence; based on Landsat imagery.
- Collected soil samples and leaves from dominant vegetation types at each catchment, excluding the riparian zone on active floodplains.
- For each vegetation type, collected composite soil samples from three locations; at each location combined three soil samples within 1 m2 to account for small-scale heterogeneity.
- Soil depth sampled to 10 cm using a hand trowel and corer; samples stored in Ziploc bags.
- Sampling occurred once per site during June–August 2011 or 2012.

## Vegetation Classification
- N-fixer: Alnus sinuata and Dryas drummondii.
- Deciduous: Populus trichocarpa and Salix spp.
- Coniferous: Pinus sitchensis and Tsuga heterophylla.

## Site Measurements
- Elevation recorded; slope manually surveyed and categorized as:
  - Low: < 5°
  - Medium: 5–15°
  - High: > 15°

## Data Organization and Output
- Data linked to vegetation type and chronosequence age to evaluate C and N cycling controls across successional stages.
