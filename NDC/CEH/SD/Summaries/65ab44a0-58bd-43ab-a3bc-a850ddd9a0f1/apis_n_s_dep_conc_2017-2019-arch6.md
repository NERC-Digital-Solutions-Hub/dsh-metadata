# Step 1: Spatial Mapping of Deposition and concentration to UK protected sites (SAC, SPA, SSSI)

- Objective
  - Map deposition and pollutant concentrations to UK protected sites (SAC, SPA, SSSI) using CBED and PCM models.
  - Produce gridded (5x5 km) data across the UK tied to site boundaries; generate site-level deposition/concentration statistics and enable downstream analysis.
- Modelling approaches
  - CBED Modelling: Generates 5x5 km resolution maps of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised/reduced nitrogen, and base cations using measured air concentrations, precipitation data, and habitat-specific deposition velocities.
  - PCM Modelling: Produces 1x1 km grid background maps of pollutant concentrations (NOx, NO2, SO2, PM, etc.) with additional road-side values; supports policy analysis and exposure assessments.
- Data sources and inputs
  - CBED data derived from the UKEAP network; precipitation map from the UK Met Office; habitat deposition velocities for five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban).
  - Distinctions between wet (including occult deposition) and dry deposition; sea-salt separation for sulphur and calcium components.
  - Orographic enhancement factor used to account for upland precipitation concentration.
  - Inter-annual variability acknowledged; CBED values are averaged over rolling 3-year periods (2017–2019) to smooth fluctuations.
- Step 1 workflow (grid creation and site clipping)
  - Create a UK-wide 5x5 km grid and clip to boundaries of SAC, SPA, and SSSI/ASSI.
  - Merge clipped grid data with 3-year CBED outputs (2017–2019) to produce a UK protected sites CBED dataset.
  - Repeat the process for 1x1 km concentration datasets for NOx and SO2 (PCM-derived).
  - Data boundaries and feature lists are sourced from national datasets for protected sites.
- Step 2 workflow (minimum, maximum, and grid-average values)
  - Use SQL on the gridded dataset to compute per-site statistics: minimum, maximum, and grid-average deposition/concentration.
  - Grid-average calculation: CBEDDepositionValue × (GridArea / TotalSiteArea); values for overlapping grids are summed to produce the site-level figure.
  - Outputs include multiple ecosystem-specific and grid-averaged estimates for each site.
- CBED modelling details (core concept)
  - Deposition values cover multiple components:
    - Dry deposition: gases (SO2, NO2, HNO3, NH3) and PM to vegetation; deposition to moorland vs. forest varies by habitat type.
    - Wet deposition: deposition from precipitation plus occult deposition to vegetation; includes key ions (sulphate, ammonium, nitrate) and acidity.
  - Component separation and calculations:
    - Anthropogenic vs total sulphur and calcium are derived via sea-salt ratio methods.
    - An orographic enhancement factor improves precipitation-concentration estimates in upland regions.
  - Temporal aspects:
    - Deposition values are annual but provided as rolling 3-year means (except non-marine Ca+Mg for 2019 only).
    - Outputs include ecosystem-specific scenarios (moorland, forest) and a grid-average, with year interpretation clarified.
- PCM modelling details (core concept)
  - Produces background pollutant concentration maps on a 1x1 km grid for the UK, with base year and projection model components per pollutant.
  - Outputs support policy development, TEN (Time Extension Notification) applications, and exposure calculations.
  - Includes ~9,000 representative roadside values to capture spatial variability.
- Outputs and data structure
  - Data are organized as multiple APIS files (3-year means 2017–2019) at 5x5 km and 1x1 km resolutions, covering:
    - Deposition: forest vs moorland vs grid-average for nitrogen and sulphur compounds; coverage includes NH3/NH4 (reduced N), NO2/NO3 (oxidised N), SO2/SO4 (non-marine), and Ca/Mg.
    - Concentrations: ammonia (NH3), nitrogen oxides (NOx/NO2), and sulphur dioxide (SO2) at 1x1 km or 5x5 km resolutions as appropriate.

    - Concentrations: expressed as micrograms per cubic meter (µg m-3).
