# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

## Overview
- Long-term ecological observation of aquatic macrophytes in a chalk-stream SSSI/SAC in southern England.
- Study area: 600 m of river and 24 acres of water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.
- Focus on macrophyte communities and their role in hydraulic roughness and ecosystem function.

## Data scope and variables
- Target taxa: Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (plus a Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans x Ranunculus peltatus hybrid), Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia), and Berula erecta.
- Measurements:
  - Macrophyte cover via 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats (25 sub-squares per quadrat). Recorded per species; counts can exceed 25 if vegetation occurs at different heights.
  - Macrophyte stand dimensions: water depth at stand, height of top/bottom of stand, measured at 30 cm intervals along transect centerline.
  - Channel metrics: wetted channel area approximated from measurements; channel width and depth data at survey points (depth at 50 cm intervals).
  - Overhanging vegetation (OHV) at channel edges.
  - Photographs of each transect.
- Additional context: weed cutting events; dates and potential impact on macrophyte patterns.

## Spatial and temporal coverage
- Four transects along the River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, with distinct reach characteristics (shaded/unshaded, depth/flow variation).
- Exact site coordinates provided for transects (left/right bank at Sites 2, 3, 4a, 5a).
- Temporal span: monthly surveys from March 2009 to October 2014.
- Data gap: one missing survey due to high flow.

## Data collection protocol
- Transect setup: stakes on river banks; a tape defines the transect center. Quadrats placed at consecutive 50 cm intervals across the channel.
- Quadrat method: fixed 50 cm x 50 cm frames; counts of macrophyte presence within 25 sub-squares per position; allows overlapping tall growth to be captured.
- Subaquatic measurements: depth and stand dimensions recorded along transect centerline at 30 cm and 50 cm intervals, respectively.
- OHV and terrestrial vegetation at edges recorded.
- Weed cuts: twelve recorded dates between 2008 and 2014, influencing macrophyte abundance patterns.
- Documentation: site photographs accompany transects; associated references to hydraulics data for cross-dataset context.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations
- Species-level identification limited by flowering state; some taxa not resolved to species level, affecting fine taxonomic analyses but enabling quantitative vegetation assessments.
- Data affected by hydrological variability (water level, flow) and weed-cut schedules, which can alter cover and distribution patterns.
- One missing survey reduces continuous time-series completeness; restoration and maintenance events (weed cuts) introduce potential confounding factors.
- Channel width and measurement contexts vary with water level, which should be accounted for in analyses.

## Data governance, storage, and sharing
- Primary location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford; data are linked to a long-term ecological monitoring program.
- Related datasets: hydraulics data for the River Lambourn at Boxford (2008–2014) referenced in NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; potential linkage opportunities for integrated hydrology-vegetation studies.
- Data should be stored with comprehensive metadata detailing transect IDs, site coordinates, measurement intervals, units, survey dates, and methodological notes.
- Aims to upload datasets to relevant data portals; documentation and provenance should accompany data releases to enable reuse.

## Documentation and provenance
- Methodological description provides detailed survey design, transect layout, and measurement procedures.
- Clear notes on species occurrences, taxonomic limitations, and data collection cadence.
- Photographic records and a figure illustrating the observatory setup enhance spatial understanding and reproducibility.

## Implications for data stewardship and reuse
- Ensure standardized metadata schema to support cross-study integration (taxon resolution notes, measurement units, transect IDs, spatial coordinates, timestamps).
- Maintain traceable lineage from raw quadrat counts through to derived metrics of cover and wetted-area estimates.
- Link macrophyte data with hydraulics datasets to support ecosystem-function analyses (e.g., relationship between vegetation cover, water depth, and flow).
- Capture and preserve weed-cut event data as potential covariates in time-series analyses.
- Provide clear limitations and caveats in data releases regarding species resolution and environmental variability to guide appropriate reuse.
