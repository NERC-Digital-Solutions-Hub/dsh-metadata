# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

## Overview
- Chalk stream in southern England; designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC).
- Hydrology driven by the chalk aquifer; observatory comprises 600 m of river and 24 acres of associated water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.
- Macrophyte communities are ecologically valuable, influence hydraulic roughness, provide habitat, and are affected by nutrient levels and flow; weed cutting is used to manage vegetation for flood risk and fisheries.

## Location and Site
- Four transects along the CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Sites 2, 3, 4a, and 5a; each site has left and right bank sampling with precise coordinates.
- Channel width varies: ~10 m at Sites 2–3, ~14 m downstream at Site 4/5.
- Transect descriptions:
  - Transect 2: unshaded
  - Transect 3: shaded
  - Transect 4a: limited shade, shallow and fast-flowing
  - Transect 5a: unshaded, deep and slow-flowing

## Data Collection Method
- Monthly surveys from March 2009 to October 2014; one missing survey due to high flow.
- Target species (not always identified to species level): Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (and a Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans x R. peltatus hybrid), Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia), and Berula erecta.
- Quadrat surveys: 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats, 25 squares per quadrat; counts recorded for each macrophyte; OHV (overhanging vegetation) at edges noted.
- Subaquatic vegetation and channel area: measured stands along a centerline at 30 cm intervals; depth at 50 cm intervals; top and bottom of each stand recorded; area of vegetation and wetted channel estimated in m^2; photographs taken at each transect.
- Location and sampling controlled via stakes on bank sides and a tape as the transect centerline.

## Data Recorded and Outputs
- Quantitative estimates of area and cover for the three most common aquatic macrophytes.
- Detailed measurements of stand dimensions, depths, and extent of vegetation to derive wetted channel area (in m^2).
- Photographic documentation for each transect.

## Temporal Coverage and Data Gaps
- Data span: March 2009 – October 2014 (monthly cadence); one missing survey due to high flow.
- Weed cuts influence vegetation dynamics; dates of weed-cut events spanning 2008–2014 are recorded (12 dates listed).

## Management Implications
- Vegetation dynamics show spring-summer growth with peaks in weed-cut years; water levels are influenced by aquatic vegetation management.
- Data supports river management decisions (e.g., flood risk reduction, fisheries enhancement) and understanding of habitat conditions across spatial and temporal scales.
