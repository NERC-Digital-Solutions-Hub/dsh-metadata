# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

- Overview and context
  - The River Lambourn is a chalk stream in southern England, designated as a Special Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).
  - Features clear, nutrient-rich water with characteristic macrophyte communities; basal flow is primarily driven by the chalk aquifer.
  - The CEH River Lambourn Observatory comprises a 600 m river reach and 24 acres of water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.

- Ecological significance of macrophytes
  - Macrophyte communities influence hydraulic roughness and habitat structure.
  - Ranunculus species are typically most abundant; nutrient enrichment can promote epiphytic algae that reduce macrophyte abundance.
  - Weed cutting is used to manage flood risk and support fisheries.

- Study site and transect layout
  - Four transects along the River Lambourn Observatory (Boxford) to capture varying conditions:
    - Site 2 – Left Bank (SU4293672185) and Right Bank (SU4292872190)
    - Site 3 – Left Bank (SU4296772133) and Right Bank (SU4296172134)
    - Site 4a – Left Bank (SU4297471925) and Right Bank (SU4296871932)
    - Site 5a – Left Bank (SU4295171858) and Right Bank (SU4294371869)
  - Channel width: approximately 10 m at Sites 1–3, about 14 m at the downstream site.
  - Transects designed to represent a mix of shallow/fast-flowing, deep/slow-flowing, shaded, and unshaded reaches.

- Methods and data collection
  - Temporal scope: monthly surveys from March 2009 to October 2014, with one missing survey due to high flow.
  - Quadrat surveys (macrophyte cover)
    - Quadrat size: 50 cm x 50 cm, divided into 25 squares.
    - Sampling along the channel at consecutive 50 cm intervals; counts recorded for each macrophyte present.
    - Maximum per point: 25 squares per species, with possible higher totals if plants occur at different heights (e.g., Ranunculus over Callitriche); overhanging vegetation (OHV) recorded at channel edges.
    - Approach repeated from one bank to the other; channel width varies with water level.
  - Subaquatic macrophyte and channel area measurements
    - After quadrats, measured the extent of each vegetation stand along the survey tape.
    - Recorded water depth at points and the top/bottom height of each stand at 30 cm intervals; depth recorded at 50 cm intervals across the channel.
    - Used measurements to approximate the wetted channel area and macrophyte area (reported in square meters); photographs taken at each transect.
  - OHV (overhanging vegetation) and other terrestrial/amphibious vegetation recorded near channel edges.
  - Data alignment with hydraulic surveys conducted elsewhere in the same period.

- Species recorded (identification scope)
  - Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (plus a Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans x Ranunculus peltatus hybrid)
  - Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia)
  - Berula erecta
  - Species identification for Ranunculus and Callitriche often not to species level without flowering material; focus on quantitative presence/area.

- Weed cuts and management context
  - Water levels and macrophyte cover are influenced by weed cuts; the river is managed with 1–3 cuts per year depending on growth and river flow.
  - Weed cut dates (2008–2014):
    - 09/07/2008
    - 20/05/2009
    - 05/05/2010
    - 06/07/2010
    - 18/11/2010
    - 18/05/2011
    - 23/05/2012
    - 13/11/2012
    - 01/05/2013
    - 17/07/2013
    - 21/05/2014
    - 23/07/2014

- Data integration and references
  - Surveys designed to accompany monthly hydraulic data; aligns with hydraulic datasets for the River Lambourn at Boxford (Rameshwaran et al., 2015).
  - Data and methods are documented to support analysis of macrophyte area/cover, seasonal dynamics, and the impact of weed management on hydraulics and habitat.

- Site photographs
  - Visual documentation available from multiple dates (e.g., December 2010, May 2011, August 2013, June 2010, January 2010, May 2011, April 2010, August 2011).
