# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

## Overview and Context
- Chalk stream in southern England; designated as SSSI and SAC.
- River Lambourn is a tributary of the Kennet, itself feeding the Thames; basal flow mainly from the chalk aquifer.
- CEH River Lambourn Observatory comprises a 600 m reach and 24 acres of associated water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.
- Macrophyte communities in chalk streams are ecologically important and influence hydraulic roughness; typical species include Ranunculus and Callitriche.
- Macrophytes support invertebrates and fish but can be suppressed by increased nutrients and silt from low flows; weed cutting is used to manage vegetation and flood risk.

## Study Design and Location
- Four transects along a 600 m reach to represent a range of flow, depth, and shading conditions.
- Sites include:
  - Site 2 – Left Bank (SU4293672185) and Right Bank (SU4292872190)
  - Site 3 – Left Bank (SU4296772133) and Right Bank (SU4296172134)
  - Site 4a – Left Bank (SU4297471925) and Right Bank (SU4296871932)
  - Site 5a – Left Bank (SU4295171858) and Right Bank (SU4294371869)
- Channel width: about 10 m at sites 1–3, ~14 m downstream.
- Four transects were selected to cover shallow/fast, deep/slow, shaded, and unshaded reaches.

## Aims and Target Species
- Estimate area and cover of the three most common aquatic macrophytes:
  - Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (and a hybrid with Ranunculus peltatus)
  - Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia)
  - Berula erecta
- Species not identified to species level when flowering material was unavailable; focus on quantitative characteristics of macrophyte stands.

## Methods and Data Collection
- Survey period: March 2009 to October 2014 (monthly), with one missing survey due to high flow.
- Quadrat surveys:
  - 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats, divided into 25 squares (10 cm each).
  - Quadrats moved along the channel across both banks in 50 cm increments; record presence of each macrophyte (max 25 per quadrat, with possible multiple heights recorded if overlapping).
  - Overhanging vegetation (OHV) recorded at channel edges (e.g., Glyceria fluitans, Mentha aquatica, grasses).
- Macrophyte and subaquatic channel measurements:
  - After quadrats, measure stand dimensions along the centreline; record water depth, top and bottom of each stand at 30 cm intervals.
  - Depth measurements across the channel at 50 cm intervals.
  - Calculate approximate wetted channel area and macrophyte area from measurements; photographs taken at each transect.
- Weed management:
  - Macrophyte cover increases through spring and peaks in summer, but weed cuts reduce abundance; one to three cuts per year are typical, depending on growth and river flow.
  - Weed cut dates within 2008–2014 include 12 dates (examples: 09/07/2008; 20/05/2009; 05/05/2010; 06/07/2010; 18/11/2010; 18/05/2011; 23/05/2012; 13/11/2012; 01/05/2013; 17/07/2013; 21/05/2014; 23/07/2014).

## Data Management and Outputs
- Data produced include estimates of macrophyte area and cover, subaquatic channel area, stand depth and height, and OHV presence.
- Methods designed to be repeatable and consistent across surveys; results linked to hydraulic data where possible.
- Hydraulics and related data for the River Lambourn at Boxford (2008–2014) are available in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (Rameshwaran et al. 2015).

## Ecological Significance and Implications
- Macrophytes contribute to hydraulic roughness, nutrient cycling, and habitat complexity; stable water temperature and nutrients in chalk streams support sustained macrophyte growth.
- Vegetation traps silt and creates habitats for invertebrates, supporting fish populations.
- Increases in nutrients and low flows can reduce macrophyte abundance due to epiphytic algae; weed management can influence ecological and hydraulic outcomes.
