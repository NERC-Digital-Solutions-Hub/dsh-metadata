# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

## Overview
- Chalk stream in southern England; designated SSSI and SAC.
- Clear, nutrient-rich water with characteristic macrophyte communities; important for invertebrates and fish.
- Macrophytes influence hydraulic roughness and sediment trapping; crowding by nutrients or low flows can reduce macrophyte abundance due to epiphytic algae.
- Primary focus of the study: estimate area and cover of the three common aquatic macrophytes along four transects.

## Study Area and Ecological Context
- River Lambourn tributary of the Kennet, then the Thames; shallow and fast-flowing with fine sediment at margins.
- River basal flow mainly driven by the chalk aquifer.
- CEH River Lambourn Observatory comprises a 600 m reach and 24 acres of associated water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.
- Target macrophyte communities: Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (plus a hybrid with Ranunculus peltatus), Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia), and Berula erecta.
- Species were not identified to full species level when flowering material was unavailable; emphasis on quantitative cover and area.

## Location and Transects
- Four transects along the CEH River Lambourn Observatory to represent a range of hydraulic conditions:
  - Site 2 – Left Bank: SU4293672185
  - Site 2 – Right Bank: SU4292872190
  - Site 3 – Left Bank: SU4296772133
  - Site 3 – Right Bank: SU4296172134
  - Site 4a – Left Bank: SU4297471925
  - Site 4a – Right Bank: SU4296871932
  - Site 5a – Left Bank: SU4295171858
  - Site 5a – Right Bank: SU4294371869
- Channel width context: approximately 10 m at sites 1–3 and about 14 m downstream.
- Stakes and tape used to mark transects; quadrats collected across the channel from bank to bank; some transects had additional quadrats.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Survey period: March 2009 to October 2014; monthly cadence with one gap due to high flow.
- Alignment with monthly hydraulic surveys where possible.
- Survey objectives: estimate area and cover of three aquatic macrophyte groups at four transects.

### Quadrat Surveys (Macrophyte Cover)
- Quadrat size: 50 cm x 50 cm, subdivided into 25 squares (10 cm x 10 cm).
- Quadrats placed at consecutive 50 cm intervals across the channel; each macrophyte’s presence counted per square.
- Each macrophyte could have a maximum count of 25 per quadrat; multiple counts possible if plants occurred at different heights (e.g., Ranunculus over Callitriche).
- OHV (Overhanging Vegetation) recorded for edges (e.g., Glyceria fluitans, Mentha aquatica, grasses).
- Procedure repeated from one channel side to the other; minimal disturbance due to timed intervals.

### Macrophyte and Subaquatic Channel Area
- After quadrats, stands of vegetation measured along the centreline tape.
- For each stand: water depth, top and bottom of the stand height recorded at 30 cm intervals until stand ended; subsequent stands recorded similarly.
- Depth measurements: 50 cm interval across the channel.
- Area estimation: approximate wetted channel area and macrophyte area derived from the measurements and recorded positions.
- Photographs taken at each transect to document conditions.

## Data Details and Outputs
- Three primary macrophytes monitored for area and cover across transects.
- Water levels and shifts in vegetation managed by river operations; weed cuts occur between 1–3 times per year depending on growth and flow.
- Weed cut dates (01/04/2008–30/09/2014):
  - 09/07/2008
  - 20/05/2009
  - 05/05/2010
  - 06/07/2010
  - 18/11/2010
  - 18/05/2011
  - 23/05/2012
  - 13/11/2012
  - 01/05/2013
  - 17/07/2013
  - 21/05/2014
  - 23/07/2014
- Data supporting hydraulic context available in Hydraulics data for the River Lambourn at Boxford (2008–2014).

## Temporal Coverage and Data Quality
- 6-year monthly dataset (Mar 2009–Oct 2014) with one missing survey due to high flow.
- Survey design ensured consistency by locating transects using fixed markers and recording precise positions.

## Site Documentation
- Site photographs captured to accompany survey data (various dates across 2010–2013) for visual reference of transect conditions.
