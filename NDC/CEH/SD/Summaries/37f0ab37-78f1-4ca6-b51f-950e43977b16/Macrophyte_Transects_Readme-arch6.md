# The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

- The River Lambourn is a chalk stream in southern England, designated as SSSI and SAC, with macrophyte communities that influence ecological value and hydraulic roughness.
- The CEH River Lambourn Observatory covers a 600 m river reach and 24 acres of water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.

## Location and Site Description

- Four transects along the observatory representing a range of flow, depth, shade, and channel conditions.
- Sites include left and right banks with specific locations (examples: Site 2 Left Bank SU4293672185, Site 2 Right Bank SU4292872190, Site 3 Left Bank SU4296772133, Site 3 Right Bank SU4296172134, Site 4a Left Bank SU4297471925, Site 4a Right Bank SU4296871932, Site 5a Left Bank SU4295171858, Site 5a Right Bank SU4294371869).
- Channel widths vary along transects (approximately 10 m at Sites 1–3, ~14 m at the downstream site).

## Objectives and Macrophyte Focus

- Aim: estimate area and cover of the three most common aquatic macrophytes over four transects.
- Target taxa (not identified to species level due to flowering constraints): Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (and a hybrid with R. penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans x R. peltatus), Callitriche platycarpa (with some Callitriche obtusanglia), and Berula erecta.
- Focus on quantitative characteristics of macrophytes to support understanding of river ecology and potential management actions.

## Sampling Design and Transects

- Four transects distributed along the River Lambourn Observatory to represent shallow/fast and deeper/slower, shaded and unshaded reaches.
- Transect descriptions include: Transect 2 (unshaded, average depth/flow), Transect 3 (shaded), Transect 4a (limited shade, shallow, fast), Transect 5a (unshaded, deep, slow).

## Data Collection Methods

- Monthly surveys from March 2009 to October 2014, with one missing survey due to high flow.
- Quadrat surveys (macrophyte cover):
  - 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats, divided into 25 squares.
  - Quadrats placed at consecutive 50 cm intervals across the channel; record presence in squares for each macrophyte (maximum 25 per quadrat per species, but multiple heights may yield higher counts).
  - Conducted from one bank to the other; OHV (Overhanging Vegetation) includes terrestrial/amphibious vegetation at channel edges.
- Macrophyte and subaquatic channel area surveys:
  - After quadrats, measure stand dimensions along a centre tape; record water depth at points where vegetation occurs and the top/bottom heights of stands at 30 cm intervals.
  - Record position, start/end of each stand; water depth measured at 50 cm intervals across the channel.
  - Use measurements to approximate the area of submerged vegetation and wetted channel (reported as square meters in associated tables).
- Photographs taken at each transect.
- Weed management context: river weed cuts affect macrophyte cover, with 1–3 cuts per year aligned to river flow and growth; a list of weed cut dates is provided (2008–2014).

## Measurements and Variables

- Primary outputs:
  - Macrophyte cover per transect and time point from quadrat data.
  - Area estimates of the subaquatic channel and macrophyte stands (m²).
- Variables recorded:
  - Depth at vegetation points, height of stands (top/bottom), grid-based species counts in quadrats.
  - Channel width and reach characteristics; OHV presence.
- Species not identified to species level in some cases due to flowering constraints; emphasis on quantitative characteristics over species-level taxonomy.

## Temporal Coverage and Data Gaps

- Data span: March 2009 – October 2014 (monthly).
- One missing survey due to high flow conditions.

## Weed Management Data

- Weed cut dates (2008–2014) include:
  - 09/07/2008; 20/05/2009; 05/05/2010; 06/07/2010; 18/11/2010;
  - 18/05/2011; 23/05/2012; 13/11/2012; 01/05/2013; 17/07/2013;
  - 21/05/2014; 23/07/2014.
- Weed cuts influence seasonal patterns of macrophyte cover and may affect subsequent measurements.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Context

- Techniques showed little disturbance to the macrophyte communities and captured a consistent set of macrophyte metrics.
- Species identification limited by flowering constraints; analysis focuses on functional metrics (cover and area) rather than detailed taxonomy.
- Channel width and depth vary with water level, requiring careful interpretation of area estimates.

## Potential Data Uses and Outputs

- Time-series analyses of macrophyte cover and subaquatic area by transect, season, and year.
- Integration with hydraulics data (e.g., hydrological and flow context from related studies) to explore relationships between macrophyte dynamics and river flow (see Rameshwaran et al., 2015).
- Basis for dashboards or reports to inform river management, weed-cutting strategies, and habitat assessments for chalk-stream ecosystems.
- Data could support ecological status assessments, habitat suitability analyses for invertebrates and fish, and evaluation of management interventions on macrophyte communities.
