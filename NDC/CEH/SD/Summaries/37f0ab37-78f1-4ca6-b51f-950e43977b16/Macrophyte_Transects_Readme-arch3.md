# 1. The CEH River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford

- Context and purpose
  - The River Lambourn is a chalk stream in southern England, designated as a Special Site of Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).
  - The CEH River Lambourn Observatory covers a 600 m reach and 24 acres of associated water meadows at Boxford, Berkshire.
  - Macrophytes in chalk streams are ecologically valuable and influence hydraulic roughness; they support invertebrates and fish by trapping silt and providing habitat.
  - Common macrophyte species studied include Ranunculus penicillatus ssp. pseudofluitans (with some hybrids), Callitriche platycarpa (and C. obtusanglia), and Berula erecta; flowering was not always available for precise species-level ID, so the focus was on quantitative characteristics.

- Location and transects
  - Four survey transects along the River Lambourn Observatory, with fixed stakes and a central tape to define transect centers.
  - Transect specifics and coordinates:
    - Site 2 – Left Bank: SU4293672185
    - Site 2 – Right Bank: SU4292872190
    - Site 3 – Left Bank: SU4296772133
    - Site 3 – Right Bank: SU4296172134
    - Site 4a – Left Bank: SU4297471925
    - Site 4a – Right Bank: SU4296871932
    - Site 5a – Left Bank: SU4295171858
    - Site 5a – Right Bank: SU4294371869
  - Channel characteristics varied along the length: generally shallow and fast at some sites, deeper and slower at downstream sites; site widths ranged from about 10 m (sites 1–3) to about 14 m downstream.

- Survey methodology
  - Sampling period: monthly surveys from March 2009 to October 2014 (one missing due to high flow).
  - Macrophyte cover surveys (quadrat method)
    - Quadrat size: 50 cm x 50 cm, divided into 25 squares (10 cm each).
    - Surveyed at consecutive 50 cm intervals across the channel from bank to bank.
    - For each quadrat, the number of squares containing each macrophyte was recorded; maximum per species per point was 25, with counts recorded for overlapping vegetation at different heights.
    - Overhanging vegetation (OHV) at channel edges recorded.
  - Macrophyte and subaquatic channel area assessments
    - After quadrats, the dimensions of each vegetation stand were measured along the centerline.
    - For each stand: water depth at the point, and the top and bottom heights of the stand were recorded at 30 cm intervals until the stand ended, then restarted for the next stand.
    - Channel depth measured at 50 cm intervals across the channel.
    - Used to approximate the wetted channel area and macrophyte areas along each transect; photographs were taken at each transect.
  - Data handling and reporting
    - Relative abundance data collected alongside spatial position and stand geometry to inform area and volume estimates.
    - The dataset supports analysis of how vegetation structure relates to hydraulic conditions and channel morphology.
  - Additional context on management
    - Weed cuts are used to manage aquatic vegetation and influence river flow; typical seasonality shows increasing cover through spring and summer, with intentional cuts reducing excessive growth.
    - Weed cut dates recorded from 01/04/2008 to 30/09/2014 (twelve events listed).

- Outputs and references
  - Hydraulics data for the River Lambourn at Boxford (2008–2014) referenced to support interpretation of vegetation-hydraulics interactions (Cited: Rameshwaran et al., 2015; DOI provided).
  - Site photographs documented at multiple time points (December 2010 to August 2013) to accompany the field data.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured, repeatable protocol for tracking spatially distributed macrophyte coverage and the corresponding channel hydraulics over multiple years.
  - Combines quantitative vegetation metrics (quadrats, stand dimensions) with hydraulic context (depth measurements, flow-related observations) to inform management decisions.
  - Highlights practical considerations for data quality and governance in monitoring programs, including standardised survey design, precise geolocation of transects, handling of missing data (one gap due to high flow), and integration with broader hydrological datasets.
