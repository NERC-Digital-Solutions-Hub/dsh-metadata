# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook

## Overview
- Field handbook for the National Woodland Survey 2002, adapted from the 1971 baseline survey.
- Provides standardized methods for locating sites, surveying plots, recording vegetation, soils, habitats, and site characteristics.
- Aims to produce comprehensive, verifiable data products for analysis and future use.

## Data collection framework and datasets
- Per site: four main data forms plus a site description, totaling data for 16 plots.
  - Vegetation plot: Ground Flora (presence/absence across five quadrats; percent cover for largest quadrat).
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs: species, DBH, height, and quadrant-based measurements.
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes within the 14.14 x 14.14 m plot.
  - Soil sampling: one composite soil sample per plot from the top 15 cm.
- Per site: an additional site description and habitat form for the overall site.
- Recording approach emphasizes: documenting major bryophytes, abundance/cover, and presence of regeneration; comprehensive plot-level data to enable self-contained analyses.

## Field procedures and data quality
- Plot layout: five-quadrat vegetation method within a 14.14 x 14.14 m plot; quadrats increase in size from 2 x 2 m to the full plot.
- Ground flora recording prioritized first to capture less-disturbed conditions.
- Data entry guidance: use clutch pencils on waterproof forms; estimate cover to nearest 5%; use “1” for substantial but <5% cover and “+” for very small occurrences; canopy not included in ground flora cover.
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs:
  - Trees: >5 cm DBH; multiple stems recorded per tree but bracketed on forms.
  - Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite plot quarters (1 NE and 3 SW).
  - Shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters with same data conventions.
  - Height measurement options: clinometer or hypsometer; calibration notes required if not using a hygrometer.
- Plot descriptions and habitats: frequency data for site-level attributes; notes in comments for interpretation.
- Soil sampling: center of plot, top 15 cm, careful labeling, and protection from contamination; double labeling recommended; samples stored cool and dispatched to CEH Merlewood within about a week.
- Relocation and accuracy:
  - Plot locations are random and ground-relocated using compass bearings and scaled map distances.
  - Cautions against excessive relocation bias or subjective bias; GPS discouraged to avoid misalignment with 1971 plot locations.
  - Be mindful of major land-use changes since 1971; do not record plots on built-over areas; note changes.

## Permissions, location, and relocation logistics
- Surveyors must obtain land access permissions; may require owner contact details on Site Description sheets.
- Permissions are typically obtainable within a half-day; landowners receive copies of results.
- Location aids include 1:50,000 OS maps and enlarged plot-location maps; plot locations are fixed by ground truthing rather than relying on GPS.

## Data forms and data fields
- Site Description and Habitats form: site-wide attributes, boundary details, and marginal land-use context.
- Plot Description and Habitats form: plot-level attributes with corresponding attribute codes; cross-checks ensure site-plot attribute consistency.
- Data integrity checks emphasize confirming that:
  - All items for a given plot are recorded.
  - Plot attributes align with site attributes.
  - No significant site areas are omitted.
- Appendices define attribute codes, provide example forms, and list field definitions.

## Soil analysis and laboratory protocols
- Appendix VI outlines standard soil processing and laboratory steps:
  - Soil pH measurement from sieved, air-dried samples.
  - Loss on ignition (LOI) procedures to determine moisture and organic matter.
  - Detailed procedural steps for sample preparation, drying, ashing, and calculations.

## Appendices and supporting materials
- Appendix Ia, Ib: bryophyte species lists for pilot woods and Great Britain.
- Appendix II: example vegetation plot data templates (ground flora and associated categories).
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling and shrub data recording templates.
- Appendix IV: extended site and plot attribute definitions and recording guidelines.
- Appendix V: field equipment lists and per-site/plot requirements.
- Appendix VI: soil laboratory protocols (pH, LOI) and calculation details.

## Practical considerations and data products
- Emphasis on creating robust, self-serve data products (e.g., site- and plot-level datasets) for researchers and policymakers.
- Data products include presence/absence, cover estimates, species lists, DBH/height measurements, habitat classifications, soil properties, and site descriptors.
- Weather, safety, and field logistics considerations highlighted (e.g., staying safe, marking/recording correctly, avoiding disturbance to plots, and ensuring complete data capture before leaving a site).

## End notes
- The handbook provides comprehensive guidelines to ensure consistency, reproducibility, and future usability of woodland survey data across sites and years.
- It combines methodological rigor with practical field instructions, equipment lists, and data-management guidance to support data collection, validation, and subsequent analysis.
