# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose: Provides standardized methods for field surveying to update and extend the National Woodland Survey (baseline GB woodland data from 1971) through 2002 fieldwork.
- Audience relevance for GIS specialists: Defines spatially explicit data collection processes, plotting design, and attribute coding needed to create map-based data products of woodland structure, composition, and habitats.

## Scope and context

- Document covers general survey methodology, site and plot selection, data recording forms, soil sampling, and specimen handling.
- Builds on earlier 1971 baseline; emphasizes data comparability and relocation of plots over decades.
- Includes appendices with bryophyte lists, vegetation and tree data structures, and soil analysis protocols.

## Planning, permissions, and positioning

- Survey teams receive site/location materials (maps, sketch maps, equipment checklists) before departure.
- Key requirement: obtain permission to enter and survey each site; document landowner details on Site Description sheet.
- Location references provided: 1:50,000 OS map extracts, original 2½" map, and enlarged plot location maps.
- GPS use is discouraged for plot relocation to avoid introducing bias; relocation relies on compass bearings, pacing, and map-ground correspondence.

## Plot design and relocation

- Each site contains 16 random sampling points (plots) arranged within a defined area; plots are identified on enlarged ground maps.
- Ground relocation uses a 1 km square on map to scale distances (e.g., 1 mm = 10 m on a 1:10,000 map).
- Given potential landscape changes since 1971, plots may no longer be woodland; records may be taken where land-use changed, except where access is restricted.
- Absolute markers for plots do not exist; relocation relies on careful procedures to avoid bias and maintain reproducibility.

## Data collection workflow

- For each site: collect four data sets per plot plus one soil sample; complete site-level description after all plots.
- Recommended order: vegetation plot (ground flora) first to capture undisturbed conditions, then other datasets.
- Data collection forms per plot:
  - Vegetation plot: ground flora across nested quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m), with presence/absence and % cover estimates; bryophyte data limited to common soil-borne species.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, DBH (cm), height, and other attributes across plot quarters; special handling for multi-stemmed trees and dead individuals.
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes; includes margins for free-text notes.
  - Soil sampling: composite top 15 cm soil sample from plot center; meticulous labeling and field handling.
- Data handling: use clutch pencils; waterproof forms; ensure consistency across site and plot datasets.

## Recording forms and data types

- Site Description and Habitats: per-site form capturing general site attributes, habitat types, boundary features, and landscape context.
- Plot Description and Habitats: per-plot form mirroring site form but focused on plot-scale attributes; number codes align with site coding.
- Vegetation plot (Ground Flora): five quadrats (2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m) with presence/absence across species and % cover for the full plot; includes major bryophytes on soil.
- Trees, saplings and shrubs: species, DBH, height, and status (live/dead) per plot; saplings and shrubs recorded in designated quadrants; largest tree height measured.
- Soil sampling: labeling, sample size, and top-soil handling; notes on sampling difficulties.
- Data integrity: cross-checks for consistency between site and plot forms; ensure full coverage of site attributes; use comments to capture contextual information.

## Soil analysis and sample handling

- Soil samples: approximately 2 kg collected per plot; labeled and dispatched to CEH Merlewood; stored cool until analysis.
- Lab protocols (summary): soil sieved; pH measured on fresh and air-dry samples; loss on ignition performed to determine moisture/organic content; standard lab procedures documented.

## Site completion, dispatch, and data management

- After completing all plots (16 per site), collect and verify all data sheets and soil samples; staple together and prepare for data entry.
- Dispatch soil samples to CEH Merlewood promptly (within a week if possible); prepare shipping boxes and labels; consider local courier options.
- Per-site and per-plot data use consistent code numbering; forms are designed to be analyzed collectively, with site-level and plot-level datasets linked.

## Data quality, biases, and limitations

- Emphasizes minimizing subjective bias in plot relocation and data recording.
- Acknowledges potential changes in land use since 1971 (e.g., motorway construction); notes when plots are no longer woodland or when permission constraints apply.
- GPS relocation is discouraged to reduce bias; reliance on map-scale methods and careful relocation procedures.
- Consistency checks between site and plot forms are essential; any significant gaps or omissions should be noted and addressed.

## Equipment and field logistics

- Equipment list includes: maps (1:50,000 and 2½" copies), plot marking gear, sighting poles, compass, clinometer or hypsometer, DBH tapes, 30 m tapes, labeling tools, and field forms.
- Per-site and per-plot provision of recording forms, soil bags, labels, and site description sheets.
- General field gear includes protective clothing, field keys, hand lens, weather writers, and organizational materials.

## Appendices and ancillary content

- Appendix Ia/Ib: Lists of bryophytes common to pilot woodland sites and to Great Britain, supporting ground flora identification.
- Appendix II: Example vegetation plot data sheet (woodlands re-survey 2000) illustrating data layout and variable codes.
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling, and shrub data structure; example data entry format for trees, height measurements, and regeneration data.
- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats – detailed attribute definitions, data entry instructions, and code numbers for site and plot attributes.
- Appendix V: Field equipment inventory and per-site provisioning requirements.
- Appendix VI: Soil laboratory protocols for pH, moisture (loss on ignition), and related procedures.

## GIS implications and how this informs data products

- Defines standardized, spatially explicit data capture for woodland indicators across multiple plots per site.
- Enables creation of map-based products showing vegetation structure, species composition, regeneration, habitats, and soil properties at plot and site scales.
- Encourages rigorous data governance through cross-form consistency, precise plot relocation records, and explicit metadata for each site and plot.
- Highlights constraints and biases to document in GIS metadata (changes in land use, non-woodland plots, relocation accuracy, and data completeness).
