# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview and Aim
- Provides a standardized protocol for surveying woodlands managed by the Nature Conservancy (Merlewood and regional offices).
- Focuses on obtaining comprehensive site- and plot-level data to classify woodlands and describe habitats.
- Data collected include: ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description and habitats, soil data, and site-level habitat information.
- Includes guidance on field logistics, permissions, data recording, herbarium collection, and equipment.

## Data Governance, Standards, and Metadata (Data Steward Perspective)
- Uses a fixed set of data collection forms with predefined attributes and coding (Site Form, Plot Form, Ground Flora, Trees/Saplings/Shrubs, Soil Data, Site Description and Habitats).
- Data entry relies on coded fields (Code No, Plot No, Site No, Recorder initials, Date) to enable consistent data punching and later integration.
- Documentation is explicit: sequence of data collection, order of forms, and cross-checks to ensure data provenance and traceability.
- Herbarium specimens are collected and linked to field records, enabling verification and taxonomic reproducibility.
- Data packaging and archiving are defined: site data assembled in four forms plus two soil samples per site; samples packed into designated boxes and mailed (with labeling and tracking).
- Public-facing access and sharing are encouraged through standardized metadata and portal-ready data structures (data discoverability and reuse emphasized conceptually).

## Data Collection Workflow and Roles
- Preparation: Outline the survey plan to minimize travel, confirm access/permission, and gather necessary maps and equipment (maps, sampling points, forms, equipment).
- Permission to Survey: Determine ownership/access per site; liaise with Regional Staff, landowners, or occupants; use tact and clear communications; if refused, switch to backup sites.
- Access and Movement: Identify optimal entry points to minimize disturbance; use marked tracks; avoid damaging fences or disturbing game.
- Sampling Points: Locate 16 random sampling points per 22" site map; space and locate with accuracy and minimal bias (aim within 20 m of true location).
- Data Recording Order: Collect four data sets per point (Ground Flora, Trees/Saplings/Shrubs, Plot Description/Habitats, Soil Data) plus two soil samples; order: ground flora first to reduce disturbance.
- Site-Level Procedures: After completing plots, complete a separate Site Description and Habitats form for the entire site, including boundary and marginal land use.
- Completion and Dispatch: Review forms for completeness, package all data and samples, label, and dispatch to Merlewood or designated archive facilities.

## Data Collection Details (Key Data Types)
- Ground Flora (2 x 2 m up to 14 x 14 m quadrats; presence/absence and percent cover; bryophytes collected separately from the full plot; specimens kept for herbarium).
- Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs: Record species and diameter for trees >5 cm DBH; saplings and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters; measure height of the largest tree; note dead stems.
- Plot Description and Habitats: Record slope, aspect, and a detailed description of habitat features; include a centre line sketch and ground profile; capture attributes defined in Appendix IV.
- Soil Data: Center pit and auger cores; collect top 10–15 cm composite soil sample; measure pH, loss on ignition, and perform a simplified mechanical analysis (% sand/silt/clay); document horizon sequence (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) and interpret pedological processes; determine underlying material where possible.
- Site Description and Habitats (Site-level): Comprehensive description of site-wide habitats and land-use categories; important for understanding mosaic of vegetation, soils, and hydrology at larger scale.

## Data Quality, Bias, and Challenges
- Locational Accuracy: A 20 m radius acceptable for sampling point location; reliance on objective, mechanically defined locating procedures to reduce subjective bias.
- Data Completeness: Emphasis on complete data capture across all forms and plots; office-use code fields support post-field data validation and data punching.
- Resource Constraints: Soil data limited to practical, field-friendly measurements; horizon interpretation relies on standard pedological procedures but remains time-efficient for large numbers of plots.
- Ownership and Access: Public relations and permission issues can affect site inclusion; back-up sites and clear communication reduce data gaps.

## Data Structure and Data Management
- Hierarchical data collection: Site Description and Habitats (site-level) -> 16 Plots per site -> Data for each plot (Ground Flora, Trees/Saplings/Shrubs, Plot Description/Habitats, Soil Data) plus two soil samples per plot.
- Separate but linked forms: Site Description Form and Plot Description Form use sequential, non-overlapping attribute codes, enabling integrated analysis across site and plots.
- Herbarium and Specimens: Dedicated instructions for collecting and labeling herbarium specimens; specimen IDs cross-referenced with field codes to ensure taxonomic accuracy.
- Equipment and Logistics: Comprehensive field equipment list; structured workflow for packing and shipping data and samples to central facilities.

## Appendices, Forms, and Equipment (Impact on Data Stewardship)
- Appendix I–VI: Detailed instructions for herbarium collection and forms completion, ensuring consistency in species identification and data recording.
- Site and Plot Description Forms: Template structures with standardized attribute codes to streamline data capture and ensure comparability across sites.
- Ground Flora and Habitat Coding: Predefined codes and matrices facilitate consistent classification and downstream data analysis.
- Equipment List: Standardized field kit enabling reproducible data collection and traceable data provenance.

## Particular Considerations and Site Management
- Distinguishing planted vs. naturally regenerated features to infer management history (e.g., planted hardwoods, coppice, pollards) and man-made habitat features.
- Documentation of management actions (brashing, pruning, coppicing) and multiple habitat types within larger sites for accurate ecological interpretation.
- Boundary types, marginal land use, and human-made features (paths, rides, walls, embankments, quarries) are systematically recorded to contextualize habitat data.

## Endnotes and Practicalities
- The handbook provides concrete, procedural guidance for field teams to ensure consistent data collection, documentation, and sample handling across large woodland survey projects.
- Designed to support long-term data utility, comparability, and integration into woodland classification and management monitoring efforts.
