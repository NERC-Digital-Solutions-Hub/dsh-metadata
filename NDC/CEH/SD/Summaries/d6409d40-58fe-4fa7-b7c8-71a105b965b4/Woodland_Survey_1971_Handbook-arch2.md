# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Aims: Provide a consistent, data-driven framework to assess environmental condition and policy performance over time; enable data verification, quality assurance, transformation, and clear outputs (reports, maps, charts); ensure datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals for long-term use and scrutiny.

## Scope and Context
- Practical manual for conducting standardized woodland surveys across multiple sites.
- Emphasizes data quality, standardised methods, and auditable workflows to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Access, Permissions, and Planning
- Prepare an outline plan to survey assigned woods with minimal travel; coordinate with Regional Staff; obtain owner/occupier permission with tact and clear explanation.
- If permission is refused, use backup sites from Merlewood; maintain good relations to avoid impacts on wider monitoring.
- Public relations are important; ensure owners understand the survey is not a purchase or compulsory process.
- Access points, base locations, and routes should minimize disturbance and comply with local constraints.

## Survey Organisation and Point Location
- Locate each site using road and site maps; determine best access points to minimise walking distance and disruption.
- Sampling points are mapped on 22" site maps; aim to locate points within a 20 m accuracy.
- Locating points involves a fixed procedure using a control point, bearing from map/compass, and a distance from the control point; pace-out distances with limited slope corrections.
- Avoid subjective bias in point placement; predetermined, mechanical methods ensure unbiased sampling.

## Order of Recording Data
- For each site and plot, collect four data sets from each sampling point and two soil samples:
  - Ground flora: presence/absence in successive quadrats with % cover/abundance estimates.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, measurements in defined plot quarters.
  - Plot description and habitat attributes: presence/absence of defined habitat features.
  - Soil data: soil pit and auger samples to profile the upper 25–30 cm and deeper horizons as feasible.
- Data can be collected in any order, but ground flora data should be first to minimise trampling effects.

## Ground Flora (Quadrat System)
- Plot layout: 14.14 x 14.14 m central plot with nested 2 x 2 m quadrats expanding outward to 14.14 x 14.14 m.
- Procedure: start with the 2 x 2 m plot; record all vascular plants (monocots, dicots, ferns) and any tree/shrub seedlings <25 cm tall; repeat for larger quadrats up to full plot.
- Bryophytes: collect a comprehensive bryophyte sample for herbarium (not recorded by bryophyte species in the 2 x 2 m; recorded for vascular plants with bryophyte sampling outside the bryophyte-specific section).
- Identification and specimens: collect unidentified specimens in labelled bags; herbarium specimens linked to field codes; return or merge later if identification changes.
- Cover/abundance: provide a 100-point-style cover estimate across the whole plot for each species; record in the designated columns; “office use” codes for punch data.
- Special notes: search spirally outward from the centre with two operators to cover all quadrats efficiently; ensure samples are properly labeled and stored.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Plot: same 14.14 x 14.14 m plot.
- Trees (>5 cm DBH): record species and diameter, per quadrant; account for multi-stemmed trees and dead specimens (denoted with D in the data cell).
- Saplings and shrubs: recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); diameter/height data as for trees, with same dead/multi-stem conventions.
- Tree height: measure the tallest tree in the plot; use the provided height instrument.
- Final form example provided in Appendix III.

## Plot Description and Habitats
- Record presence/absence of habitat attributes using a defined attribute list (Appendix IV for definitions).
- Include significant habitat features (glades, slopes, clearings, etc.) with a consistent threshold for presence within the plot.
- Plot-level data are complemented by a full description and a ground-profile sketch, including a section on slope and aspect.

## Site Description and Habitats (Whole Site)
- Separate form from the plot form; captures site-wide characters and inter-plot differences.
- Includes site-level attributes, boundary features, marginal land use, and overall management context.
- Used to derive site-scale interpretation and cross-plot comparisons.

## Soil Data and Interpretation
- Rationale: large surveys (1648 plots) require a limited, yet informative, set of soil measurements plus a descriptive horizon-based method.
- Physical/chemical measurements:
  - pH
  - Loss on ignition
  - Mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) using a simplified method
- Horizon-based soil description:
  - Identify and describe horizons A0, A1, A2, B1/B2, and C (underlying material) with depth to horizon limits recorded as from-to or from-to-depth where applicable.
  - Horizon attributes cover color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of organic/mineral mixing; transition and deposition layers (e.g., Al, A2, B) described with specific criteria.
  - Underlying material documented when present; depth limits noted if auger depth is insufficient to fully describe the profile.
- Soil profile interpretation:
  - Concepts of Mull, MODER, MOR humus types based on A horizons and organic layering.
  - Podzolic soils vs. calcareous soils; influence of drainage, rainfall, mineral base content, vegetation, time, and erosion.
- Field procedures:
  - Dig a shallow pit (approx. 30 cm) or use auger to explore horizons; collect composite soil sample from 10–15 cm top layer for laboratory analysis if feasible.
  - Record horizon depths, color, texture, moisture, structure, and presence of features (mottling, iron deposits, etc.).
- Sample handling:
  - Store soil samples with clear labels; ensure samples accompany corresponding field sheets.
  - If insufficient samples are collected, note the issue and record the closest possible substitutions.

## Completion of the Plot and Site
- After data collection, ensure forms are complete and correctly labeled (site code, plot numbers, recorder initials, date, slope, aspect, etc.).
- Pack and tag soil and bryophyte samples for transport; three soil boxes and one bryophyte box per site; keep packaging under weight limits.
- Perform a final field check to confirm no major data or equipment is left behind; data quality and completeness are emphasized.
- Site-level data (Site Description and Habitats) and plot-level data (Plot Description and Habitats) are compiled and stored as matched form sets.

## Herbarium Collection
- Each team must prepare a comprehensive herbarium collection to demonstrate species records accuracy.
- Obtain type or representative specimens for all species observed in quadrats; label specimens with correct nomenclature and field codes.
- Collect flowering shoots when possible; if uncertain, collect a specimen and merge later if duplicate identifications arise.
- Ensure a robust, high-quality herbarium submission for verification.

## Data Forms, Codes, and Outputs
- Site Description and Habitats Form; Plot Description and Habitats Form; Soil Data Form; and site-level data structures (with analogous codes and entries) form the core data collection toolkit.
- Attribute codes are defined and sequenced to allow consistent data entry across sites and plots; forms are designed to minimize data entry errors and maximize comparability.
- Outputs are designed to be integrated into standardized reports, maps, and charts for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.

## Equipment and Field Logistics
- Detailed equipment lists for data collection (plot layout equipment, compasses, tapes, stakes, mats, augers, trowels, hypsometers, rulers, bags, labels, herbarium supplies, etc.).
- Organization of field bags and site bags to separate clean and dirty gear and samples.
- Layout diagrams (Figure 1 and Figure 2) illustrate sampling organization and the layout of ground flora quadrats.

## Appendices and Reference Materials
- Appendix I–VI provide instructions for herbarium specimens, completed example forms, plot/site description forms, soil data collection, and equipment checklists.
- Clear guidance on the preparation, labeling, and submission of field specimens, as well as examples of completed forms and checklists.

Overall, the National Woodlands Classification 1971 Handbook of Field Methods outlines a comprehensive, standardized approach to monitoring woodland health and habitat condition through carefully planned site access, unbiased sampling point location, multi-scale vegetation sampling, detailed soil profiling, site- and plot-level habitat descriptions, and rigorous data management designed to support longitudinal environmental monitoring and policy analysis.
