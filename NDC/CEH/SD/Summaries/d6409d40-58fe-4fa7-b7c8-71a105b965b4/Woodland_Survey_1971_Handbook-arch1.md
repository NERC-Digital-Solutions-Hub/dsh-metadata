# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDHOW OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview
- Comprehensive field handbook for surveying and classifying woodlands in Britain.
- Focuses on standardized data collection to support subsequent data analysis, correlations, and modelling.
- Emphasizes planning, permission, ethical relations with landowners, and meticulous data capture for large datasets (e.g., 1648 plots).

## Purpose, Scope and Objectives
- Provide a reproducible methodology to describe woodland sites, plots, habitats, soils, flora, fauna, and management.
- Create datasets suitable for statistical analysis, comparison across sites, and habitat–data integrations.
- Include detailed instructions for recording, herbarium collection, and site-level descriptions to ensure consistency and comparability.

## Survey Design, Access, and Planning
- Prepare an outline survey plan to minimize travel while respecting access constraints.
- Secure permission to survey each site; follow region-specific access rules and back-up site arrangements if permission is denied.
- Use fixed map references (Ordnance Survey, 22" site maps) to locate sampling points with high accuracy.
- Arrangement to survey multiple sites from a common base when efficient.

## Site Access and Permissions
- Permission handling ranges from pre-approved access to direct contact with landowners or occupants.
- Emphasizes tact, public relations, and explaining non-purchasing intentions to alleviate owner concerns.
- If permission cannot be obtained, supply necessary site information for back-up sites and proceed accordingly.

## Sampling Framework and Point Location
- Each site has a 22" map with 16 sampling points (1–16) to be located on the ground.
- Target location accuracy: within a 20 m radius of the true point.
- Locate points using pre-determined control points, bearings, compass variation adjustments, and measured distances.
- Procedure designed to minimize subjective bias and ensure repeatable point placement.

## Order of Recording Data (Per Plot)
- Four data sets and two sample series per sampling point:
  - Ground flora presence/absence across five quadrat sizes (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) with % cover estimates.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameter at breast height (DBH), heights, and status (live/dead), with diagonally opposite quarters recording saplings and shrubs.
  - Plot description and habitat attributes (presence/absence of defined features).
  - Soil data: small pit and auger borings at plot center; composite top 10–15 cm sample.
- Zero-order priority: record ground flora first to minimize trampling effects; then trees/saplings/shrubs and soil data.

## Ground Flora Quadrats (Layout and Recording)
- Centre point established; four corner posts delineate 2x2 m, then successive extensions up to 14.14 m x 14.14 m.
- Random orientation via right-angle gauge to avoid bias.
- Species listed per quadrat size; use standardized codes; collect unidentified material for herbarium (Appendix I).
- Bryophyte data are collected comprehensively for vascular plants; bryophytes themselves are not tallied by quadrat size but documented for the full plot.
- After finishing presence data, estimate cover/abundance for the full plot across categories (litter, wood, rock, water, bare ground, bryophytes).
- A “Code No” column reserved for office use to insert species identification codes.

## Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs
- Record trees >5 cm DBH; saplings (<5 cm DBH, >25 cm height) and shrubs are recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
- For trees, measure DBH, species, and note dead trees with a D prefix.
- For saplings and shrubs, record species and DBH/height as appropriate; trees with multiple stems counted per stem but tied to the same record.
- Height of the largest tree in the plot measured with the provided height instrument.
- An example form is provided (Appendix III).

## Plot Description and Habitats
- Record plot-level attributes (slope, aspect, major habitat features) with standardized definitions (Appendix IV).
- Include a ground profile sketch and a site-wide description of major habitat features.
- Address provisions for areas with substantial glades, clearings, or other defined habitat complexes.

## Site Description and Habitats (Site-level Data)
- A separate but related form captures site-wide attributes and habitats between plots.
- Ensures compatibility with plot-level data through aligned code schemes for site and plot attributes.

## Soil Data Collection and Interpretation
- Rationale: large survey scope (1648 plots) necessitates a practical soil data approach.
- Measurements collected from limited physical/chemical properties to support numerical analyses:
  - pH
  - Loss on ignition (LOI)
  - Mechanical analysis (% sand/silt/clay)
  - Retain sub-samples for future analyses
- Soil description uses horizon-based interpretation (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) to reflect pedological processes.
- Horizons are coded and interpreted with standardized definitions for colour, texture, structure, moisture, and composition.
- Horizon-specific data collection involves a field procedure for digging pits, describing horizons, and recording horizon depth using the from-to method.
- Underlying material and horizon boundaries are identified where possible; if auger depth is insufficient, bracket depths and note limitations.
- The soil interpretation framework emphasizes podzolic, brown earth, and calcareous soil types, including the influence of drainage, base content, climate, and vegetation on horizon development.
- A two-sample method is used for soil description: one deep profile and a complementary horizon-focused description for robust numerical representation.

## Soil Types: Major Woodland Soil Types in Britain
- Podzolic soils: acid, leached, often podzolic horizon development; influenced by rainfall, drainage, base status, and vegetation.
- Brown earths and brown forest soils: well-developed eluviated and mineral horizons with mixed organic/mineral layers.
- Calcareous soils: soils with free calcium carbonate, linked to chalk/limestone regions; complex regional variations with transitions to podzols.
- Soil formation is dynamic and immature in many woodland settings, producing transitional profiles.

## Data Management, Quality Assurance, and Documentation
- Emphasizes comprehensive, carefully labeled data sheets and proper packaging of soil and bryophyte samples for transport.
- Includes explicit instructions for herbarium specimen collection (type specimens, identification accuracy, labeling, and archiving).
- Data sheets and forms are designed for compatibility and later data punching (office use codes and metadata).

## Appendices, Forms, and Equipment
- Appendix I–VI provide:
  - Instructions for herbarium specimen collection and usage of codes.
  - Examples of completed ground flora, tree/sapling/shrub, plot and site description forms.
  - Instructions for soil data collection and completing soil data forms (plus examples).
  - Equipment checklists and kit contents for fieldwork.
- Field equipment list includes sampling point layout tools, compasses, tapes, augers, trowels, habitat sketch sheets, herbarium sheets, and post-field packaging materials.

## Data Output and Analytic Readiness
- Designed to produce standardized, codified data suitable for statistical analysis, modelling, and cross-site comparisons.
- Data are intended to be discoverable, well-documented, and usable in future analyses through consistent metadata, forms, and coding schemes.
