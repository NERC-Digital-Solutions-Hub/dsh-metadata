# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose: A comprehensive field-methods guide (Shaw and McBunce, 1971) for surveying British woodlands to classify woodland types and habitats, with standardized data collection forms and procedures.
- Scope: Covers permissions, site selection, sample-point location, data recording order, plot and site data, ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, soil data, site description and habitats, marginal land use, boundary types, management indicators, and operational logistics.

## Key Data Assets and Variables

- Site-level data: site description, habitats, marginal land use, boundary types, management context, time of survey, and overall impression.
- Plot-level data (per site): 16 plots per site, each with
  - Ground flora data: presence/absence across multiple quadrat sizes (2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m), percent cover estimates, bryophyte collection.
  - Trees, saplings, shrubs: species, diameters at breast height (DBH), heights, quadrant-based recording, dead trees, coppice indicators.
  - Plot description and habitats: slope, aspect, ground features, and a detailed habitat attribute record.
  - Soil data: soil pits/auger samples for horizon descriptions (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C), pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay), texture, colour, structure, moisture, and underlying material; optional rock fragments and other soil features.
- Site-level habitat and management Codifications: explicit coding for habitat types, vegetation communities, coppicing/management history, and presence of elements like epiphytes, lichens, macrofungi, and fauna indicators.
- Documentation and validation: herbarium specimens linked to species codes; two data sheets per plot (plot and site forms) with cross-checks for consistency; specimen codes and field notes to support later data punching.

## Data Collection Framework and Workflow

- Planning and permissions:
  - Prepare an outline survey plan to minimize travel and accommodate access constraints.
  - Obtain entry permissions; if denied, switch to backup sites and notify Merlewood.
  - Emphasize good public relations; provide a brief description of the survey purpose to landowners.
- Site access and logistics:
  - Use road maps and site maps; determine the best access points to minimize walking distance and avoid disturbing owners.
  - If permission is granted, identify specific access points and plan route accordingly.
- Locating sampling points:
  - Each site uses a 22" map with 16 sampling points; locate points within a 20 m radius of true location.
  - Procedure for locating points: select a nearby control point, orient map/compass, measure bearing and distance, find ground control point, and pace to the sample point with slope corrections if needed.
  - Maintain objectivity; avoid bias in point selection; ensure reproducible, unbiased positioning.
- Order of data recording:
  - Collect data in a defined order, prioritizing ground flora first to minimize disturbance, then trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitats, and soil data.
  - Capture four data sets per plot and corresponding soil samples; complete the site in a structured sequence.
- Plot construction and data recording:
  - Establish a central point with a right-angle orientation and extend four corner posts to form 2x2 m, 4x4 m, 5x5 m, 10x10 m, and 14.14x14.14 m plots.
  - Record ground flora species in each quadrat size; collect bryophyte samples; don’t overly fragment vegetation during sampling.
  - For trees/saplings/shrubs: record species, DBH, height, and status (live/dead); weigh in on single vs. multi-stemmed individuals; measure the largest tree height when possible.
  - Plot description and habitats: log slope, aspect, and a detailed topographic sketch; describe vegetation attributes and notable habitat features.
  - Soil data: extract small pit and use auger; collect 10–15 cm composite soil sample; obtain horizons Ao, Al, A2, B1/2, C with horizon nomenclature and descriptive attributes.
- Site completion:
  - After all data and samples are recorded/packed, perform a final check for omissions, label all forms, and securely package soils and bryophyte/herbarium materials for transport.

## Data Standards, Coding, Documentation

- Standardized forms:
  - Site Description and Habitats Form (for the whole site) and Plot Description and Habitats Form (for each plot); both use sequential attribute codes to enable data punching and cross-site comparisons.
  - Appendices provide detailed instructions for herbarium collection, example completed forms, and soil data collection procedures.
- Coding and data integrity:
  - Distinct code series for site and plot attributes; cross-form consistency checks (site attributes that must be present on plot forms, but not vice versa).
  - Deterministic data entries (e.g., soil horizon names Ao/Al/A2/B1/B2) with clear guidance on missing horizons and how to handle uncertain horizons.
- Validation and verification:
  - Herbarium specimens used to validate species identifications; recommended to collect type specimens where feasible.
  - Two data sheets per site and per plot aid in verification and data punching accuracy.

## Data Packaging, Archiving, and Dissemination

- Data packaging:
  - Complete site data, including four data sets per site and soil samples across multiple boxes; ensure labeling is robust and matches site/plot identifiers.
  - Use pre-paid labels and secure packaging for postal submission to central repositories.
- Archiving and transfer:
  - Store bryophyte and soil samples in designated boxes; ensure samples are clearly labeled and traceable to field forms.
  - Ensure all forms are stapled, bagged, and securely sealed for long-term archival.
- Equipment and field support:
  - Reference equipment lists (plot marking, compasses, tapes, calipers, soil tools, herbarium supplies) to standardize data collection and ensure repeatability.

## Appendices and Supporting Tools

- Appendices provide:
  - Herbarium specimen collection procedures and examples of completed herbarium sheets.
  - Examples of completed plot and site data forms for reference.
  - Instructions for collecting soil data and completing the soil data form, including horizon interpretations and soil types.
  - Equipment checklists to ensure field teams are prepared.
- Supporting figures:
  - Flow-chart for site sampling organization and division of responsibility.
  - Layout diagrams for ground flora quadrats (2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m).

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Designing scalable data systems:
  - The handbook demonstrates early adoption of standardized data capture across multiple sites, enabling cross-site analytics and comparability.
  - Clear data provenance: site/plot IDs, recorder initials, date, and formal coding facilitate traceability and auditability.
- Data governance and access:
  - Permissions and stakeholder engagement are embedded in the data collection process, highlighting governance considerations for field data.
- Data quality and reuse:
  - Emphasis on objective sampling, predefined procedures, and validation via herbarium specimens supports data quality and long-term reusability.
- Metadata and discoverability:
  - Parallel site and plot forms with consistent attribute coding improve discoverability and interoperability for future analyses.
- Operational readiness:
  - Detailed equipment lists, back-up sites, and routing strategies illustrate how to maintain data collection continuity in field conditions.
