# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and background
  - National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook, amended and adapted from earlier 1971 GB woodland surveys.
  - Provides standardised field methods to update baseline woodland data, ensuring data are usable, comparable, well-documented, and discoverable.
  - Emphasises rigorous data governance considerations: provenance, metadata, consistency, and clear processes for storage, sharing, and updates.

- Data collection framework and datasets
  - Per site, 16 sampling plots and associated data collection comprising multiple datasets:
    - Vegetation plot: ground flora (presence/absence across nested quadrats with % cover estimates), bryophyte notes, and overall plot cover.
    - Trees, saplings and shrubs: species, DBH measurements, heights, and status (live/dead) across plot quarters.
    - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes, with free-text comments for interpretation.
    - Site description and habitats: site-wide data, including habitat types and site features.
  - Soil sampling: one composite soil sample per plot (top 15 cm), labeled and stored with site/plot identifiers.
  - Deliverables per site: four data forms (site + plot levels) and 16 soil samples, assembled into a site folder for data entry and archive.

- Data governance, metadata, and standardisation
  - Use of predefined templates and codes for all forms; consistent layout of site and plot data to enable integrated analyses.
  - Documentation emphasis: recording forms serve as metadata carriers for each dataset; codes are sequential and referenced across site and plot forms.
  - Clear attribution of data provenance: site number, plot number, recorder initials, and date captured on every form.
  - Designed to preserve comparability with the 1971 baseline, including explicit notes on potential changes in land use since 1971.

- Location, permission, and bias avoidance
  - Strict requirement to obtain permission to access survey sites; owner contact details recorded with results.
  - Emphasis on locating sampling points with high accuracy and minimal subjective bias; discourages GPS use to avoid geographic bias relative to 1971 plot locations.
  - Relocation approach relies on map-to-ground scaling, compass, pacing, and reference marks; document relocation accuracy and potential biases.

- Data capture, quality control, and workflow
  - Recording order prioritises undisturbed vegetation (ground flora) before other measurements.
  - Four main recording forms per plot, plus a site-level form; cross-checks to ensure consistency between site and plot data.
  - Completion checklist before data submission: verify form completeness, plot/site codes, dates, and ensure all soils and equipment are accounted for.
  - Printing on waterproof forms; clutch pencils recommended for field reliability; thorough documentation of anomalies or changes (e.g., land-use changes, plots no longer within permission).

- Sample handling, labeling, and storage
  - Soil samples labeled with site and plot identifiers; double labeling to prevent data loss.
  - Samples stored in per-site plastic boxes and kept cool; dispatched to CEH Merlewood within a week when possible (avoid weekend delays).

- Data handling and sharing considerations
  - Landowners receive copies of results (1971 and 2002 assessments) as part of the permission and engagement process.
  - Per-site data assembled into plots and site descriptors for data entry; a separate but linked site-level folder ensures traceability.
  - Appendices and calibration sections provide deeper context for data interpretation (e.g., bryophyte lists, vegetation plot exemplars, field equipment lists).

- Appendix references and laboratory protocols
  - Appendix IV:SITE DESCRIPTION AND HABITATS detailing attribute codes and data capture guidance for site and plot forms.
  - Appendix V: FIELD EQUIPMENT checklist to support reproducible data collection.
  - Appendix VI: SOIL ANALYSIS LABORATORY PROTOCOLS covering pH measurement, loss on ignition (LOI), and sample preparation for soil analysis.

- Particular challenges and cautions relevant to data stewardship
  - Changes over time (e.g., motorways or other land-use changes) may affect plot relevance; note changes and avoid recording on restricted areas (e.g., railways, motorways without permission).
  - Ensuring complete, consistent data across multiple datasets and plots; reconciling site and plot attributes to avoid logical inconsistencies.
  - Handling large volumes of field data with standardized coding to enable reliable longitudinal comparisons and downstream discovery.

- Endnotes: practical guidelines for auditors and data managers
  - Ensure per-site folder completeness (four data sets + two soil sample sets per 16 plots, plus site descriptor).
  - Maintain consistent documentation of measurement methods, calibration, and any deviations from standard procedures.
  - Preserve data lineage by maintaining original field sheets alongside digital data entry for future verification and reuse.
