# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose
  - Provide a standardized, field-based methodology for surveying woods to classify woodland types, habitats, and related data for analysis and data sharing.

- Key data categories collected
  - Ground flora: presence/absence across five quadrat sizes with percent cover/abundance estimates; comprehensive bryophyte collection; herbarium specimens.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameters (diameter at breast height) for stems >5 cm; saplings and regenerating shrubs; dead trees noted; tallest tree height measurement.
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined habitat attributes; slope and aspect; ground features; sketch of ground profile.
  - Soil data: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay), horizon-level descriptions (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C), moisture, texture, structure, color, and underlying materials; sampling from a central pit and auger cores; composite topsoil sample collected.
  - Site description and habitats: broader site-level descriptions for 16 plots and inter-plot areas; boundaries and marginal land use; site management notes.
  - Marginal land use: land-use categories at >400 m distance (e.g., orchard, arable, road, river, industry, etc.).
  - Boundary types: hedges, banks, ditches, fences, walls, gates; distances and conditions.
  - Subjunctive and overall impression: subjective assessment of the site.
  - Fauna and Birds: signs and signs-based recording (e.g., droppings, tracks, nests) within plots.
  - Habitat and vegetation categories: groves, glades, bracken, fern banks, rocky knolls, water bodies, and other defined habitat types.
  - Equipment and field logistics: detailed field equipment and forms for data capture and transport.

- Plot design, layout, and sampling workflow
  - Site access and permission
    - Obtain permission to survey each site; follow local owner instructions; use tact and good public relations.
  - Site access points
    - Determine access points to minimize walking distance; use marked tracks to avoid disturbing surroundings.
  - Sampling points and location accuracy
    - Each site map marks 16 random sampling points; locate points with a control point, compass bearing, and pre-set distances to within ~20 m accuracy.
  - Data collection order
    - Record ground flora first to minimize disturbance; record trees/saplings and then soil data; data collection order can be adjusted for convenience.
  - Quadrat layout and plot expansion
    - Start with a 2 x 2 m plot at the centre; expand outward to larger plots (up to 14.14 x 14.14 m) using marked corner pegs and distance strings, recording species in each nested plot.
  - Data forms and codes
    - Use standardized forms: plot and site description/habitat forms; codes are pre-defined and sequenced; recorder initials, date, slope, magnetic bearing, and other metadata are captured.
  - Herbarium and specimen collection
    - Collect representative specimens for herbarium to verify identifications; attach labels and ensure specimen naming is consistent with field codes.
  - Soil data collection and handling
    - Small pit and auger cores collected at plot center; 10–15 cm composite soil sample; horizon-by-horizon recording for Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C; moisture indicators; earthworm notes; ensure samples are properly labeled and returned for later analysis.
  - Site and plot completion checks
    - Ensure all forms are complete and correctly labeled; collect and label samples; verify equipment and site coverage; prepare for transport.

- Soil data interpretation and data recording
  - Soil survey framework
    - Limited set of physical/chemical measurements (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) combined with a descriptive, horizon-based soil profile approach.
  - Major soil types highlighted
    - Podzolic soils (acid, leached, often podzolized) and calcareous soils (base-rich, calcium carbonate presence) with transitions and mosaics depending on drainage, rock type, and vegetation history.
  - Horizon interpretation
    - Ao (litter/organic surface), Al (leached/eluviated mineral layer), A2 (further leached/mineral layer), B1/B2 (deposition and weathering), C (underlying material); transition zones described; horizon thickness and colour/mottling recorded.
  - Measurements and documentation
    - Horizon depth (from-to), texture (clay/silt/sand/rock fragments), structure (powder, crumb, clod), moisture, colour, mottling, and presence of organic/ mineral mingling.
  - Practical notes
    - In difficult profiles, diagrammatic representations may be used; if augering depth is limited, underlying material is noted; earthworm presence and other field indicators are recorded as comments.

- Outputs and data products
  - Site Description and Habitats form (one per site) and Plot Description and Habitats form (per plot) for standardized data capture.
  - Complete site package: four data sheets per site, two soil sample sets, bryophyte/voucher materials, and herbarium sheets; packed in labeled boxes and shipped.
  - Standardized specimen handling
    - Use field codes consistently across forms and herbarium specimens to ensure accurate post-field identification and data integration.

- Appendices and field support materials
  - Appendix I–VI
    - Instructions for collecting herbarium specimens; examples of completed forms; instructions for completing plot and site descriptions; soil data collection and form completion; equipment checklists.
  - Equipment and forms
    - Detailed field equipment list; kit components for plotting, sampling, and label management; data sheets and backup materials.

- Data quality, consistency, and reuse
  - Emphasis on minimizing subjective bias in locating sampling points and timing of data collection.
  - Mechanical accuracy is balanced against efficiency; data should be consistent across all plots and forms to enable robust analysis and cross-site comparisons.
  - Reproducibility and transparency ensured by standardized codes, explicit horizon interpretation rules, and comprehensive herbarium documentation.
