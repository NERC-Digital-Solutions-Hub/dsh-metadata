# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and audience
  - Provides a standardized field methodology for surveying woodlands to classify and describe sites and habitats.
  - Produces spatially-referenced data and map-like documentation suitable for GIS-style data products.

- Site planning and permissions
  - Prepare an outline survey plan to minimize travel and coordinate with regional staff.
  - Obtain permission to enter and survey each site; use tact and local knowledge of land ownership.
  - If permission is refused, have backup sites ready and maintain good public relations.

- Data collection framework (spatially explicit)
  - Each site is mapped with base maps (road maps and 1" or 22" site maps). The 22" site map marks 16 random sampling points (1–16).
  - For ground truthing, use a portable layout that includes:
    - Center point, right-angle gauge, four corner posts, distance strings, and markers to define nested plots.
    - Ground sampling points located within a 20 m accuracy radius; methods emphasize unbiased placement and repeatability.
  - Plot geometry and nesting
    - Nested plots from smallest to largest: 2 m x 2 m; then up to 5 m x 5 m; 10 m x 10 m; and a largest 14.14 m x 14.14 m (approx. 200 m²) plot.
    - Each sampling point yields data for multiple plot sizes, with data entered in corresponding quadrat columns (2 x 2 m often entered under 5 x 5 m column).

- Data to be collected at each sampling point (four data sets + two soil samples)
  - Ground flora
    - Presence/absence in increasing quadrat sizes (2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, 10 x 10 m, and largest) with percent cover estimates for the largest quadrat.
    - Collect herbarium specimens for unidentified or notable species; heel of bryophytes captured as a comprehensive soil/ground flora sample.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs
    - Trees with DBH > 5 cm: species and diameter by quadrant; notes on dead trees.
    - Saplings (height > breast height and < 5 cm DBH) and shrubs: same data, limited to diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
    - Measure the height of the tallest tree in the plot.
  - Plot description and habitats
    - Record presence/absence of defined habitat attributes (slope, aspect, substrates, micro-habitats, etc.) and provide a narrative description and a ground-pro files sketch.
  - Soil data
    - Obtain small pit and auger samples from the plot center; composite 10–15 cm sample.
    - Limited suite of measurements due to scale: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical soil analysis (sand/silt/clay), plus horizon-level notes (Ao, Al, A2, B, C concepts).
    - Document horizon depths and transitions, moisture, texture, color, structure, and underlying materials. Include notes on any difficulties or deviations.

- Site-level data
  - Site Description and Habitats form to capture characteristics across the whole site (between and within plots).
  - Marginal land use and boundary types are recorded with standardized codes.
  - A separate but compatible Site Description and Habitats form is completed for the entire site.

- Data integrity, coding, and quality assurance
  - Data entry relies on predefined codes for attributes to support later data punching and GIS integration.
  - Cross-checks between Plot and Site forms to avoid inconsistencies; ensure plots are fully covered.
  - Record details with sufficient clarity for interpretation and future data use; keep specimens and herbarium material organized for verification.

- Post-survey handling and logistics
  - After completing 16 plots at a site, compile four data sheets per plot plus two soil samples per plot, then assemble into boxed parcels with species vouchers and soil samples.
  - Ship parcels using provided pre-paid labels; include site and plot identifiers to maintain traceability.

- Appendices and supporting materials
  - Appendices provide:
    - Instructions for herbarium collection (Appendix I) and examples of completed forms (Appendices II–IV).
    - Soil data collection procedures and form filling instructions (Appendix VI).
  - Equipment checklist and field layout guidance to ensure consistent data collection.

- Reference tools for GIS translation
  - Clear, repeatable field procedures enable consistent georeferencing and alignment with map data.
  - Systematic data collection supports production of map-based data layers (species presence, vegetation structure, habitat attributes, soil types, and site-level habitat descriptions) suitable for GIS analyses and visualization.
