# Woodlands Survey Site Information 1971-2001

## Overview
- 103 broadleaved woodlands surveyed across Britain in 1971, with detailed ecological data from 16 randomly placed plots per site.
- Re-surveyed in 2000, 2002, and 2003 (referred to as 2001) using the same field methods to assess ecological change.
- Analyses examined principal drivers of change, including atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen, climate, canopy changes, and woodland management.
- Key results published in Kirkby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004); users should consult these publications for methodological and analytical details.

## Aims for monitoring and policy relevance
- Identify measures that provide useful insight for scrutinising and evaluating policy and informing future decisions.
- Long-term, standardized data enable assessment of ecological change and drivers over time, supporting policy evaluation and landscape management planning.
- Data linked to external drivers (deposition, climate, management) to inform environmental health monitoring frameworks.

## Survey design and methods
- Stratified sampling across the study area following Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized survey methods.
- 103 sites with 16 plots per site; field handbook included in supporting documentation.
- Consistent field methods applied across baseline (1971) and resurvey years, enabling comparability.

## Data structure and variables
- Site-level, plot-level, and description fields capturing:
  - Site code, site name; plot number; descriptive codes and descriptions; notes.
  - Groupings to construct indices for woodland management (wm), tree/shrub regeneration (r), open habitats (o), and adjacent land cover (l).
  - Score field for open habitat features with weighting (e.g., 1 for narrow paths, 5 for wide rides) to reflect openness in the final index.
  - Year of survey and field-sheet context (Site header, Plot descriptions, etc.).
  - Physical descriptors: slope and aspect for 1971 and 2000s (Slope71, Slope03; Aspect71, Aspect03).
  - Geographic coordinates: Easting and Northing (OSGB GB National Grid).
  - Originators and surveyors (1971 and 2001-3), with notes on survey dates (Date1971, Date2003; Date2003 standardized to 2002).
  - Country location (England, Scotland, Wales) and site usage (e.g., managed vs unmanaged).

## Temporal coverage and data availability
- Baseline data collected in 1971; resurveyed in the 2000s (2000, 2002, 2003; standardized to 2002 in records).
- Some plots may not have been surveyed in the later period, with explicit reasons recorded (Reason_for_nosurvey).

## Outputs and references
- Findings and methodological details tied to long-term ecological change and drivers published in:
  - Corney et al. (2004): landscapescale drivers on vegetation composition
  - Kirkby et al. (2005): measuring long-term ecological change (1971-2001)
  - Related methodological context in Haines-Young et al. (2003) and Avery (1973)
- Related datasets include Countryside Survey and earlier woodland surveys ( Steele, 1968).

## Access, metadata, and governance considerations (policy-monitoring perspective)
- Detailed metadata and supporting documentation accompany the dataset; users should consult the project handbooks and cited publications for field methods and analytical approaches.
- The dataset emphasizes transparency (codes, groupings, scoring rules) to support verification and reuse, though some metadata and methodological details are contained within linked publications.
- Suitable for informing environmental health monitoring frameworks through long-term, repeatable, standardized monitoring with documented drivers of change.

## Practical takeaways for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates the value of long-term, standardized monitoring across multiple sites and years to evaluate policy impacts and environmental health.
- Use of well-documented field methods and explicit data structures (indices for management, regeneration, open habitats) enables consistent interpretation over time.
- Linking ecological change to external drivers (deposition, climate, management) provides actionable insights for policy decisions.
- Highlights importance of comprehensive metadata, data governance, and accessible publications to enable data reuse and policy-relevant analyses.
