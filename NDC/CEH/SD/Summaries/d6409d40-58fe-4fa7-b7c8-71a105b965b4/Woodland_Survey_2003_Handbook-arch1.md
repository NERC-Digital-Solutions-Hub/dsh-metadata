# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and scope
  - National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook detailing methods to collect data for woodland indicators.
  - Focus on ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot/site descriptions, habitats, soils; aim to support analysis of correlations, patterns, and potential predictions about woodland condition.
  - Survey design involves 16 random sampling plots per site with accompanying site-level data; data are intended to be comprehensive and reusable.

- Survey design, location, and permissions
  - Site location relies on maps (1:50,000 OS extracts and enlarged originals) with 16 plot locations; relocation is critical and must be unbiased and reproducible.
  - GPS use is discouraged to avoid bias from historical plot locations; relocation is by pace/compass using map-ground correspondence.
  - Access permissions must be obtained from landowners; a introduction letter is provided to ease negotiations; owners receive copies of results.
  - Anticipated variability over 30 years: sites may have changed (e.g., motorways, built structures); record changes and avoid recording plots now on land without permission.

- Sampling framework and relocation approach
  - 16 random sampling points per site are marked on a map; relocation relies on ground-tracing from the map using compass bearings and distances.
  - Accuracy and avoidance of subjective bias are prioritized; there are no permanent ground markers for plot relocation.
  - Map-to-ground correspondence must be calculated per plot due to varying map scales and enlargement.

- Data collection framework (recording forms)
  - For each site: four datasets and one site-level description form per plot; total per site includes 16 plots and a site description sheet.
  - Data types and forms:
    - Vegetation plot: Ground flora — presence/absence across five nested quadrats (from 2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m), with % cover estimates for the full plot; common bryophytes recorded (major bryophyte list provided).
    - Trees, saplings and shrubs — species, DBH for stems >5 cm, and location data within the 200 m² plot; trees, saplings, and shrubs recorded with species, height/DBH, and quadrant-based placement; dead trees flagged.
    - Plot description and habitats — presence/absence of habitat attributes within the plot; frequency data for attributes; open space for comments.
    - Soil sampling — composite sample from plot center; top 15 cm; label clearly; avoid contamination; store in cool conditions; double-labeling recommended.
  - Site-level data (Site Description and Habitats) — broader habitat and site attributes, ensuring consistency with plot data; includes field sketches and owner comments.

- Vegetation plot specifics
  - Plot layout: largest plot is 14.14 x 14.14 m with four corner posts; four markers along diagonals define smaller quadrats (2x2 m; quadrats 2–5 progressively larger).
  - Ground flora surveying protocol: search each quadrat size outward in a spiral by two operators; record presence/absence by Quadrat number; identify and bag uncertain specimens; record major bryophytes only for ground flora.
  - Cover estimates: total vascular plant cover and other categories (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes) to nearest 5%; signs of layering may exceed 100%.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs specifics
  - Trees: >5 cm DBH; species and DBH recorded for stems across the whole plot; multi-stemmed individuals recorded per stem but aggregated on the form.
  - Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 NE, 3 SW); same data as trees.
  - Shrubs: recorded similarly to saplings; same quarters as saplings.
  - Height measurement: largest tree height measured with clinometer or hypsometer; horizontal distance along same contour; alternative height methods noted; calibration required if not using standard instrument.

- Plot description, habitats, and related data
  - Presence/absence approach for habitat attributes within the 200 m² plot; detailed definitions in Appendix IV; partial areas may qualify if a defined habitat is present within the plot extent.
  - Marginal land use (section L) and boundary type (section M) documented; field walking around boundaries is often required.

- Soil sampling and handling
  - One representative soil sample per plot, from the plot center when possible; collect within 1 m of plot center.
  - Use labeled bags; double-labeling recommended to prevent misidentification; samples stored in site-specific boxes and kept cool until shipment to CEH Merlewood.
  - If sample collection is difficult, supplement from the nearest possible point within 1 m; note any deviations; fill holes after sampling.

- Site completion and data integrity
  - After completing all plots and data, perform checks to ensure all forms are complete and consistent (site vs. plot data alignment).
  - Ensure soil samples and equipment are logged and secured; perform final site walk-through to avoid omissions.
  - An additional site-wide dataset (site description and habitats) is collected to capture broader context between plots.

- Data management and reporting considerations
  - Data collection emphasizes reproducibility, traceability, and the potential for later data discovery (metadata and data portals are encouraged).
  - Recording forms are designed to be processed together, with consistent attribute coding across site and plot forms.
  - Observational notes from landowners and site sketches are encouraged to aid interpretation, though anecdotal data may be less consistently recorded.

- Practical notes and cautions
  - Ground rules emphasize consistent methodology across teams, avoidance of subjective plot placement, and strict adherence to permission and safety guidelines.
  - The survey acknowledges potential landscape changes since 1971 and the need to document any major land-use changes affecting plots.
  - Field methods stress thoroughness and data completeness, even when taking extra time in the field to ensure data quality and future usability.
