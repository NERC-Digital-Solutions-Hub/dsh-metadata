# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides standardized environmental health measures for woodland monitoring, describing how to survey woodlands to classify habitats, monitor vegetation and soils, and inform policy decisions.
  - Aims to produce comparable, auditable data across sites for assessing woodland condition, management history, and habitat quality.

- Survey planning and permissions
  - Prepare an outline plan to survey woods with minimal travel and consideration of access constraints; plan base locations when possible.
  - Obtain site access permission through owners or land managers; exercise tact and public-relations best practices; have backup sites ready if access is refused.
  - Maintain clear communication about survey aims to reassure owners that surveys are not intended for purchase or compulsory action.

- Sampling framework and data collection design
  - Each site includes a fixed set of sampling points and nested plots to capture vegetation and habitat variation:
    - 16 ground-sampling points marked on a 22" site map.
    - A series of nested plots around each point: 2 x 2 m, 4 x 2 m (4 n2), up to 10 x 10 m, centered on the point.
    - 14.14 x 14.14 m full plot for comprehensive ground flora and tree/sapling sampling.
  - Whole-site data comprise Site Description and Habitats forms, plus per-plot Plot Description and Habitats forms.
  - Data collection order prioritizes minimizing disturbance: ground flora first, then trees/saplings, then plot soil data; soil data collected last but can be reordered for convenience.

- Locating sampling points and accuracy
  - Use a center post and right-angle gauge to randomize plot orientation; extend corner poles to define plot boundaries.
  - Locate each sampling point within approximately 20 m of the true position; employ control points, bearings, pacing, and ground marks to achieve unbiased placement.
  - Use predetermined paces and strict ground-travel rules to avoid bias or distortion by terrain or hedgerows.

- Data collection workflow and organization
  - Four data sets per sampling point plus two sets of samples per site:
    - Ground flora presence/absence across five quadrat sizes with percent cover estimates for the largest quadrat.
    - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameters (DBH) for stems >5 cm, heights, and notes on dead trees; tree height measured for the largest tree in the plot.
    - Plot description and habitat data: presence/absence of habitat attributes (slope, aspect, glades, water bodies, etc.).
    - Soil data from a center pit and augered borings: simplified horizon description and a composite topsoil sample.
  - At the plot level, maintain two diagonal quarters for saplings and shrubs; record data consistently in prepared forms with codes for office punching.
  - Complete site-level habitat data after all plots are finished; assemble site description forms and habitat descriptions for the whole area.

- Ground flora and plant data collection
  - Record all vascular plants and bryophytes within the 2 x 2 m plot, expanding to larger quadrats (up to 14.14 x 14.14 m) for presence/absence and cover estimates.
  - Collect plant specimens that cannot be identified in the field for herbarium verification (Appendix I) and tag specimens with field IDs and codes for later confirmation.
  - Do not break the logjam of identification by delaying specimens; return and verify later if unsure.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs data collection
  - Trees: measure all stems >5 cm DBH; record species and DBH by plot quarter; note dead trees with "D" designation.
  - Saplings: record species and DBH for trees and shrubs within diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); heights noted (< Breast height) with same conventions for dead/multistemed stems.
  - Largest-tree height: measure the tallest tree within the plot using provided height instrument; substitute if necessary if tallest is inaccessible.

- Plot descriptor and habitats data collection
  - Record slope, aspect, and a center-line description of the plot; draw a ground profile sketch showing major topographic features.
  - For each attribute, use standardized definitions (see Appendix IV) and provide a narrative in the comments where needed.

- Site description and site habitats forms
  - Complete Site Description and Habitats form for the entire site; complete Plot Description and Habitats forms for each 16 plots.
  - Use the site and plot code sequences to synchronize forms; check for logical consistency between site and plot forms; ensure coverage or re-survey any missed areas.

- Soil data collection and interpretation
  - Collect limited soil data to support large-scale monitoring with 1648 plots: pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) from dried sub-samples; retain sub-samples for potential future analyses.
  - Extract horizon data using a pit and auger approach to model a pedological profile, focusing on Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, and C horizons with a horizon-by-horizon form (depths recorded as from-to; “from” depths used to minimize cumulative errors).
  - Interpret horizons using standardized descriptors (Aoo, Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) and categorize soils into principal British woodland types (Podzolic, Brown Earth/Brown Forest, Calcareous, Gley, Skeletal) with explanations of leaching, base status, and horizon development.
  - Record horizon properties: color, texture (clay/silt/sand), structure, moisture, presence of organic matter, iron deposition, and signs of gleying or mottling.
  - For underlying material, document depth and composition where the horizon transitions to parent material or bedrock; use auger depth as a practical limit and note depths where measurement ends.

- Site packaging, data integrity, and dissemination
  - Once plots are completed, stack and staple sheets, seal in polythene bags, and ship soil and bryophyte specimens in designated boxes using prepaid labels.
  - Ensure all forms are complete and consistent; check for omissions, equipment, and soil samples; verify site and plot numbers on every form.
  - Data are intended to form a long-term, “forever” dataset; emphasize comprehensive, accurate recording even if it takes extra time.

- Herbarium and specimen handling
  - Collect type specimens for all species encountered; label herbarium sheets with species name and field code; attach specimens securely.
  - Provide instructions on identifying uncertain specimens and logging in the herbarium for later verification; ensure uniformity of species identification across teams.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Detailed lists of field equipment, including plot-marking gear, compasses, tapes, hypsometer, auger, trowel, center posts, corner poles, calipers, and labeling materials.
  - Define two haversacks for fieldwork plus site bags for forms, labels, maps, and sample handling; provide spare labeling, tapes, stapler, and general supplies for field operations.

- Appendices and supporting instructions
  - Appendix I: Instructions for collecting herbarium specimens; Appendix II–V: Examples and instructions for completing plant, tree/sapling, plot, and site forms; Appendix VI: Equipment checklists.
  - Appendix on soil data: detailed methodology for soil description, horizon interpretation, and integration of field descriptions with numerical soil attributes.

- Management and interpretation notes for monitoring frameworks
  - The handbook emphasizes standardized, repeatable data collection across sites to support monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - It highlights the need to document management history (e.g., coppicing, planted stands, stumps, timber extraction) to interpret habitat changes and regeneration data.
  - It acknowledges data limitations and practical constraints (e.g., limited lab analyses, need for horizon-based descriptions) while providing a rigorous framework to compare woodland health, composition, and soil status over time.

- Key takeaways for monitoring framework authors
  - Use a clear, repeatable sampling design with nested plot structure to capture fine-scale and landscape-level biodiversity and habitat data.
  - Establish standardized data collection procedures (species coding, quadrat sizes, DBH/height measurements, soil horizon descriptors) to enable cross-site comparability and long-term trend analysis.
  - Integrate biological, habitat, and soil data within linked site and plot forms to support coherent, analyzable datasets.
  - Include specimen verification (herbarium) and explicit data quality controls (checklists, code schemes, back-up sites) to reduce misidentification and data gaps.
  - Provide practical guidance for permissions, logistics, and data packaging to ensure timely, secure, and auditable data submission and sharing.
