# Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and soil organic carbon content from three paired upland woodland and grassland sites in northern England, July 2019-April 2021

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset compares soil properties between woodland and adjacent pasture across three paired upland sites in northern England to indicate potential impacts of upland tree planting as part of natural flood management.
  - Targets saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density, and soil organic carbon content in the upper 50 cm of soil.
  - Timeframe of sampling: July 2019–April 2021 (COVID-19 caused disruptions).

- Experimental design
  - Sites and pairings:
    - JF (Jerusalem Farm): old mature deciduous woodland with adjacent pasture
    - MW (Midgelden woods): about 15 years since planting deciduous woodland with adjacent pasture
    - IF (Inchfield): newly planted deciduous woodland (<5 years) with adjacent pasture
  - Sampling framework:
    - Each site includes woodland (T) and grassland/pasture (P) areas
    - 10 sampling points per area, total of 60 points
    - Random sampling within woodland and grassland, with a 20 m buffer from edges
  - Depths and sampling
    - Upper 50 cm sampled using 5 cm increments, mid-point depths: 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45 cm
    - Depth intervals: 2.5–7.5 cm, 12.5–17.5 cm, 22.5–27.5 cm, 32.5–37.5 cm, 42.5–47.5 cm
    - Some points lacked data at all depths due to shallow soils

- Data collection methods
  - Bulk density
    - 5.3 cm diameter soil bulk density rings used to collect 5 cm long samples
    - Depth-specific sampling depths as above
    - Samples dried and weighed for bulk density (g/cm3)
  - Saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat)
    - Measured with Eijkelkamp permeameter on bulk density rings after saturation
    - Readings taken from discharge into burettes under a known hydraulic gradient
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC)
    - Upper two depth intervals analyzed by loss on ignition
    - Samples oxidized at 450 °C for 5 hours; SOC expressed as percent of dry soil mass
    - Conventional assumption: soil organic matter contains 58% carbon (conversion factor 0.58 available)
  - Contextual notes
    - Descriptive soil interpretation provided for each sample (e.g., silt, sand, structured clay)

- Quality control and data validation
  - Instrument and lab procedures follow manufacturer manuals (Eijkelkamp) and standard lab practices
  - Replicates for SOC: random 10% of samples re-analyzed; if two replicates agree within 10%, mean used; otherwise a third replicate used and mean calculated
  - Data recording precision
    - Bulk density measured to two decimal places
    - SOC reported to two decimal places
    - Ksat reported in metres per day

- Variables, units, and data structure
  - Site codes: IF = Inchfield, MW = Midgelden, JF = Jerusalem Farm
  - Tree/Pasture: T = woodland, P = grassland
  - Soil type: descriptive terms
  - Mid-point depth: centimetres (5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45)
  - Bulk density: g/cm3
  - Ksat: metres per day
  - SOC: % of dry soil mass
  - Data columns include: Site, Mid point depth, Trees/Pasture, Soil type, Bulk density, Ksat (K), SOC % (SOC %)

- Data interpretation and usage notes
  - SOC values reflect carbon content in upper depths; conversion to organic matter is possible using the 0.58 factor
  - Data can support comparisons of soil physical and chemical properties between woodland and pasture to infer effects of upland tree planting on soil health and hydrological properties
  - COVID-19 disruptions resulted in incomplete data for some depths/points

- Relevance to monitoring and data practices
  - Provides site-specific, standardized measurements suitable for environmental monitoring and policy assessment
  - Structured dataset with clearly defined depth intervals and units facilitates integration with other environmental data
  - Supports broader aims of making datasets more valuable and accessible for secondary analyses and cross-site comparisons.
