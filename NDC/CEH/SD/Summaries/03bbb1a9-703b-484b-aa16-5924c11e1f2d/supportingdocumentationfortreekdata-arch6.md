# Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and soil organic carbon content from three paired upland woodland and grassland sites in northern England, July 2019-April 2021

## Objective and scope
- Provides measurements of saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content from three paired upland woodland and grassland sites in northern England.
- Aims to compare woodland and pasture soil properties as indicators of potential impacts of upland tree planting for natural flood management.
- Samples collected from the upper 50 cm of soil at random points; processing occurred in subsequent months.

## Experimental design
- Three sites with paired habitats:
  - JF = Jerusalem Farm (mature woodland)
  - MW = Midgelden woods (deciduous woodland ~15 years since planting)
  - IF = Inchfield (newly planted deciduous woodland <5 years)
- At each site, permanent grazed grassland adjacent to woodland; both habitats sampled.
- 10 sample points per habitat per site (woodland and grassland), totaling 60 points.
- Random sampling with a 20 m exclusion from edges.

## Data collection methods and depths
- Bulk density rings (5.3 cm diameter) used to collect 5 cm long samples at depths: 2.5–7.5, 12.5–17.5, 22.5–27.5, 32.5–37.5, 42.5–47.5 cm (mid-point depths: 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45 cm).
- Some depths missing where soil was too shallow.
- Sampling occurred between July 2019 and April 2021; processing followed in the subsequent months.

## Measurement methods
- Ksat measured with an Eijkelkamp 25-place permeameter; readings taken as discharge at a known hydraulic gradient after saturation.
- Bulk density determined by gravimetric oven-drying at 105°C for 24 hours.
- SOC measured by loss on ignition at 450°C for 5 hours; assumed OM is 58% carbon (conversion available if needed).

## Quality control
- Adherence to instrument manuals for all measurements; mass accuracy to 0.01 g.
- SOC replicates: 10% of samples re-measured; if two replicates differ by >10%, a third replicate is used; mean of all replicates reported.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Ksat: metres per day
- Bulk density: grams per cubic centimetre
- SOC: percent of dry soil mass
- Mid-point depth: centimetres
