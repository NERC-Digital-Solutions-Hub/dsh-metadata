# Supporting documentation for dataset: Saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density and soil organic carbon content from three paired upland woodland and grassland sites in northern England, July 2019-April 2021

## Purpose and scope
- Describes a dataset measuring saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat), bulk density, and soil organic carbon (SOC) content from three paired upland woodland and grassland sites in northern England.
- Aims to compare woodland and pasture soil properties as an indicator of potential impacts of upland tree planting on natural flood management.
- Sampling occurred from July 2019 to April 2021, with processing in subsequent months; COVID-19 caused some disruption.
- Supports analysis of how soil properties vary with land use (woodland vs pasture) across different stages of woodland development.

## Experimental design
- Three sites coded JF (Jerusalem Farm), MW (Midgelden Woods), and IF (Inchfield) with distinct woodland ages: mature woodland, ~15 years since planting, and <5 years since planting respectively.
- Each site has adjacent permanent grazed grassland (P) and woodland (T); 10 sample points per land use per site, totaling 60 samples.
- Random sampling within woodland and grassland areas; sampling excluded within 20 m of edges.

## Data collection and lab methods
- Soil sampling: bulk density rings (5.3 cm diameter) to a 5 cm length; samples taken at depths with mid-point values of 5, 10, 15, 25, 35, and 45 cm.
- Some depths missing at certain points due to shallow soil.
- Ksat measured using an Eijkelkamp permeameter after slow saturation; readings collected at a known hydraulic gradient.
- Bulk density determined gravimetrically by oven-drying at 105°C for 24 hours.
- SOC determined by loss on ignition for the upper two depths: furnace at 450°C for 5 hours; carbon assumed to be 58% of organic matter (factor 0.58); SOC values provided as % of dry soil mass.
- Descriptive soil interpretation recorded (e.g., silt, sand, structured clay) for context.
- Mid-point depth expressed in centimetres; SOC concentrations and other measurements reported with two-decimal precision where applicable.

## Quality control
- Ksat procedures followed per Eijkelkamp manual used in University of Leeds lab.
- Mass and measurements for bulk density recorded to two decimal places.
- SOC replication: random replicates for 10% of samples; if replicates within 10% of each other, mean used; if not, a third replicate was added and mean of three values used.

## Data content and structure
- Key variables and codes:
  - Site: IF = Inchfield, MW = Midgelden, JF = Jerusalem Farm
  - Mid point depth: depth bin midpoints in cm (5, 10, 15, 25, 35, 45)
  - Trees/Pasture: T = woodland, P = grassland
  - Soil type: descriptive terms
  - Bulk density: numeric (g/cm³), two decimals
  - K (saturated hydraulic conductivity): numeric (m/day)
  - SOC % (soil organic carbon): numeric, two decimals

## Data coverage and limitations
- Data cover upper 50 cm of soil; some depths missing at certain points due to depth constraints.
- COVID-19 disruption affected sampling timeline.
- Spatial coverage limited to three site pairs in northern England; results specific to upland grassland-woodland interfaces adjacent to grazed grassland.

## Potential uses and implications
- Enables comparison of soil physical and carbon properties between woodland and pasture across varying woodland ages.
- Supports assessment of the potential role of upland tree planting in flood management through soil property indicators.
- Provides a structured dataset with clear metadata, suitable for inclusion in broader data ecosystems, enabling discoverability and reuse by policymakers, researchers, and data practitioners.

## Governance and provenance
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council’s Natural Flood Management research programme.
- Data collected using standardized protocols with documented processing, quality checks, and units, aiding reproducibility and integration with other datasets.
