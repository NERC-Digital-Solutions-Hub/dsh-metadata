# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2014 to 2018

## Overview
- Long-term, fortnightly monitoring dataset from Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England (Jan 2014 – end of 2018).
- Measures key limnological parameters to support environmental health assessment and policy scrutiny.

## Variables and units
- TEMP: surface temperature, °C
- OXYG: surface oxygen saturation, % air-saturation
- SECC: Secchi depth, m
- ALKA: alkalinity, µg CaCO3 per L
- pH: pH
- NH4N: ammonium, µg N per L
- NO3N: nitrate, µg N per L
- PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate, µg P per L
- TOTP: total phosphorus, µg P per L
- SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon, µg SiO2 per L
- TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a, µg per L
- All data are from integrated 0–5 m water samples; some shore samples used when buoy sampling was not possible.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Sampling conducted from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (buoy location); when not feasible, samples collected from the shore.
- Sampling regime is fortnightly and spans January 2014 to 2018.

## Data quality and caveats
- Data provided are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data largely due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data provided as a comma-separated values (CSV) file with:
  - Date: measurement date
  - Variable Description: name of the measured parameter (TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA)
  - Value: measured value for each variable
  - Sign (if<LOD): indicates if value is below detection limit with a < sign
  - Flag: 1 = sample taken at buoy location; 2 = shore sample (buoy sampling not possible)

## Access, sharing and governance
- Data are available to download as a CSV file (data availability implied by the documentation).
- The accompanying documentation notes that sharing data publicly can be a barrier in some contexts, underscoring broader data governance considerations.

## Funding and usage
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Notable uses and context
- Recent publications using the dataset include:
  - Modelling lake cyanobacterial blooms and climate-driven impacts (Freshwater Biology, 2019)
  - Coupling of carbon and silicon geochemical cycles in rivers and lakes (Scientific Reports, 2016)
  - Lake surface temperatures (State of the Climate in 2015, Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society, 2016)
- Contextual overview references highlight the role of long-term ecological data in generating ecological knowledge and informing monitoring frameworks.

## Relevance to monitoring framework considerations
- Demonstrates integration of multiple environmental health indicators (temperature, oxygen, clarity, chemistry, nutrients, and phytoplankton) for policy appraisal.
- Highlights practical data governance needs: data quality control, metadata sufficiency, and data sharing considerations.
- Provides a model for transparent data structure, documentation, and long-term continuity essential for evaluating policy outcomes and informing future decisions.
