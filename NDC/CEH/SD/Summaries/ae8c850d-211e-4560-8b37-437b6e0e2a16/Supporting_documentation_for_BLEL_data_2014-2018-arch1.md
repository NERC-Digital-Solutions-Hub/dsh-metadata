# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Blelham Tarn 2014 to 2018.

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset (2014–2018) from Blelham Tarn, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling of: surface temperature (TEMP, °C), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG, % air-saturation), Secchi depth (SECC, m), alkalinity (ALKA, µg CaCO3 per L), pH, ammonium (NH4N, µg N/L), nitrate (NO3N, µg N/L), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P, µg P/L), total phosphorus (TOTP, µg P/L), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2, µg/L), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA, µg/L).
- Water samples integrated from 0–5 m; collected from a buoy at the deepest part of the lake; if buoy sampling not possible, samples taken from shore.
- Data cover January 2014 to end of 2018.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Sampling performed from a boat at the buoy or from the shore when access to buoy was not possible.
- Measurements include a suite of physical, chemical, and biological parameters from surface waters.
- Data are provided in a comma-separated values (CSV) file with columns: Date, Variable (measurement description), Value, Sign (if value is below detection limit), Flag (1 = buoy location, 2 = shore visit).

## Quality control
- The dataset presented is raw data and has not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data are due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure and variables
- Date: measurement date.
- Variable: measurement type (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA).
- Value: numeric measurement for each variable.
- Sign: indicates below detection limit with a < sign.
- Flag: 1 = sample taken at buoy location; 2 = sample taken from shore (buoy visit not possible).

## Data availability and metadata
- Data are downloadable and include clear variable descriptions and units as listed above.
- Annotations clarify sampling method (0–5 m integration, buoy vs shore) and data limitations (raw status, LOD indicators, and flags).

## Funding
- Natural Environment Research Council award NE/R016429/1 as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
