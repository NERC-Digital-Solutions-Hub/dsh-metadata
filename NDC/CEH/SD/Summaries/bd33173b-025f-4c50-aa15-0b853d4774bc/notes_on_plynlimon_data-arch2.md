# Plynlimon Hydrochemistry Sampling Data Description (March 2023 – March 2024)

## Sampling regime
- Data cover period March 2023 to March 2024.
- Samples collected every four weeks.
- Additional details available in Plynlimon_site_information.csv.

## Collection methods
- Refer to Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv for collection procedures.

## Sample sites
- Refer to Plynlimon_site_information.csv for site locations and details.

## Laboratory instrumentation
- Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for instrumentation details.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for measurement units and data types.

## Analytical methods
- Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for analytical techniques used.

## Details of data structure
- Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for dataset structure and field definitions.

## Notes on reported values
- For hydrochemical values below the limit of detection (LOD), reported value is halfway between 0 and the LOD.
- LOD values are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
- Some chemicals have LOD changes over the sampling period, resulting in multiple rows with specific LODs per subperiod.
- Determinants and methods described using CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST) where possible.

## Quality control and calibration
- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measured at UKCEH Bangor laboratories.
- Bangor lab participates in LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing QA scheme.
- Other chemical analyses conducted at UKCEH Lancaster; ISO 17025:2005 UKAS accreditation for many analyses.
- Data checked for missing values (left blank) due to insufficient sample, instrument failure, or fieldworker error.
- Some sample IDs are excluded if no sample was collected.
- Example: bottle breakage at Upper Hafren on 05/12/2023 (sample 76247); NPOC values missing for Lower Hore (76267) and Upper Hore (76270) on 04/03/2024.

## Other information useful to interpretation
- To maintain continuity with previous Plynlimon hydrochemistry data, rainfall measurements for Carregwen rain (chemistry C) are recorded from a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) site, not the Carregwen Standard rain gauge (AJ).
