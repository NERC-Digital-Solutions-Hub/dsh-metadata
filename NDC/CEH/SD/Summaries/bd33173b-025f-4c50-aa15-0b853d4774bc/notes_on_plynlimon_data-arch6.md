# Sampling regime

- Coverage: March 2023 to March 2024
- Sampling frequency: every four weeks
- Details and site information available in Plynlimon_site_information.csv
- Collection methods described in Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv

## Collection methods, sites, and instrumentation

- Sample sites: Plynlimon_site_information.csv
- Laboratory instrumentation, nature and units of recorded values, and analytical methods: Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Full data structure details are described in Description_of_column_headings.csv

## Data interpretation and value handling

- Below detection limit (LOD) values: recorded as a value halfway between 0 and the LOD
- LOD values: changed over time; may appear as multiple rows for the same chemical with period-specific LOD
- Descriptions of determinants and methods: available via CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST) at https://vocabs.ceh.ac.uk/cast/en/

## Quality control and calibration

- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity: analyzed at UKCEH Bangor laboratories; participate in LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing
- Other chemical analyses: conducted at UKCEH Lancaster; UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005
- Data quality checks: missing values left blank; gaps may arise from insufficient sampling, instrument failure, or fieldworker error
- Notable data issue: sample 76247 (Upper Hafren, 05/12/2023) bottle broke prior to analysis
- NPOC values missing for Lower Hore (76267) and Upper Hore (76270) on 04/03/2024

## Additional interpretation notes

- Rainfall data for Carregwen rain chemistry (C) is recorded from a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) site, not the Carregwen Standard gauge site (AJ) to maintain consistency with earlier datasets

## Practical use and accessibility for data users

- Data descriptions rely on multiple CSV files; cross-reference Plynlimon_site_information.csv, Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv, and Description_of_column_headings.csv for methods, sites, and column definitions
- CAST/CHE vocabulary link provided for standardized terminology and determinants
