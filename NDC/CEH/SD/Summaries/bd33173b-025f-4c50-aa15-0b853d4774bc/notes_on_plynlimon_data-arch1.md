# Sampling regime

- Data cover period: March 2023 to March 2024
- Sampling frequency: every four weeks
- See Plynlimon_site_information.csv for details on sample sites
- Collection methods: see Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv
- Laboratory instrumentation: see Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Nature and units of recorded values: see Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Analytical methods: see Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Full descriptions of determinants and methods are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CAST (CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus)

## Data structure and supporting files

- Data structure details: see Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Related data and methods referenced via:
  - Plynlimon_site_information.csv (Sample Sites)
  - Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv (Collection methods)
  - Description_of_column_headings.csv (Laboratory instrumentation, nature/units, analytical methods)

## Notes on reported values and data handling

- Values below the limit of detection (LOD) are reported as halfway between 0 and the LOD
- For certain chemicals, LOD values changed over the sampling period, resulting in multiple rows for the chemical with a specific LOD per subperiod
- Full determinant and method descriptions are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv, ideally using the CEH CAST thesaurus

## Quality control, calibration, and data integrity

- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measurements: UKCEH Bangor laboratories
- External QA: UKCEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing scheme
- Other chemical analyses: UKCEH Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group (Lancaster); UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses
- Data checks: missing values left as blank cells; blanks may result from insufficient sample (e.g., rain), instrument failure, or fieldworker error
- Some samples not collected and thus not included in records
- Specific incident: the glass bottle for the Upper Hafren sample on 05/12/2023 broke prior to analysis (sample no. 76247)
- NPOC values missing for Lower Hore (76267) and Upper Hore (76270) on 04/03/2024

## Additional interpretation and consistency notes

- To maintain consistency with previously published Plynlimon hydrochemistry data, rainfall volume measurements for Carregwen rain (chemistry C) are recorded from a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) site rather than the Carregwen Standard rain gauge site (AJ)
