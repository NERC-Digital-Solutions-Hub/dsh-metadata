# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- LCM2023 is UKCEH’s annual land cover map, consisting of seven datasets: three per region (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) plus a 1 km summary raster product.
- The three region-specific datasets are: 10 m classified pixels, classified land parcels, and 25 m rasterised land parcels.
- A single 1 km summary raster product covers both GB and NI.
- Purpose is to enable informed use and monitoring of land cover changes, with attention to data production, validation, and accuracy.

## Product details

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats) used across the datasets.
  - Classes linked to BAP Broad Habitats with some structural adjustments; detailed mappings and notes are in Appendices 1–2.

- Datasets (LCM2023)
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
    - GB and NI: two-band rasters per area
      - Band 1: most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer)
      - Band 2: class probability/confidence
    - Not generalised by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine features.
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
    - Rasterised from the Land Parcel dataset to 25 m pixels.
    - Three bands per parcel: mode (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
  - 1 km Summary Raster datasets
    - Four products: dominant cover (21-class and aggregate versions) and percentage cover (21-class and aggregate versions).
    - Percentage products report integer values; sums may deviate from 100 due to rounding, especially near coastlines.

- Regional specifics
  - Great Britain (GB)
    - GB coordinate system: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
    - Pixel resolutions: 10 m (classified pixels), 25 m (rasterised parcels)
  - Northern Ireland (NI)
    - NI coordinate system: Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG: 29903)
    - Pixel resolutions: 10 m and 25 m similarly represented

## Data content and structure

- 10 m Classified Pixels
  - 32 Classification Scenes for GB; 1 Scene for NI
  - Each pixel has a class and a confidence probability
  - retains high-detail landscape features not captured in parcel-based products

- Land Parcel datasets
  - Parcels grouped by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework (minimum parcel size ~0.5 ha)
  - Enables time-series comparison and noise reduction via fixed spatial units

- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels
  - Per-parcel raster representation with three attributes: _mode, _conf, _purity

- 1 km Summary Rasters
  - Summary of 25 m rasters into 1 km cells
  - Dominant class per 1 km cell plus percentage cover by class

- Seasonality and Context
  - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 (four seasons)
  - Context Rasters (10 m GB and NI-specific) to reduce spectral confusion
  - Training scenes built from a grid of Classification Scenes

## Production and methods

- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2 surface reflectance resampled to 10 m; four seasonal periods computed
  - Context rasters include terrain, proximity to features (buildings, roads, water), foreshore and coastal indicators

- Classification Scenes and Tiles
  - GB classified in 32 tiles; NI in a single 49-band scene
  - Each Classification Scene trained and classified independently to manage regional phenology

- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training dataset constructed from historical LCM maps (LCM2020–2022)
  - Pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across three years used as training data
  - Where rotations create change (e.g., arable vs. improved grassland), Crops data (2023) used for training those classes

- Random Forest Classification
  - Balanced training using bootstrap samples; 10,000 samples per bag for each class
  - RF classifier yields the final 10 m classified pixel product

- UKCEH Tools
  - Bespoke software combining Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source)

## Validation and accuracy

- Validation
  - 33,107 validation points across all 21 classes
  - Data sources: GB countryside survey, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payments Agency, bespoke validation points

- Accuracy
  - Overall accuracy: 83% (LCM2023)
  - Appendix 4 provides detailed confusion matrices, producer’s accuracy, user’s accuracy, and per-class metrics
  - 10 m classified pixels validated against 25 m raster parcels (note: some differences due to pixel-scale validation)

## Known issues and caveats

- Minor missing polygons in the vector land parcel products, causing nodata areas in the 25 m raster parcels (negligible effect on 1 km products; 10 m products unaffected)
- Annual method changes may yield small differences between maps due to methodological updates in addition to real changes

## Access, citations, and resources

- DOIs and citations provided for each LCM2023 data product (10 m classified pixels GB and NI, 25 m rasterised land parcels GB and NI, land parcels GB/NI, 1 km summary rasters)
- Key references: Marston et al. (2023, 2024), Morton et al. (2011), Smith et al. (2007)
- Output includes color recipes for visualization (Appendix 5 and 6) and corresponding QGIS symbol files
  - Color versions include standard and color-blind-friendly options

## Interpretation, usage, and guidance

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes align with UK BAP Broad Habitats (with notes on differences and use of italicized terms to avoid ambiguity)
- General guidance to users:
  - Use the 10 m Classified Pixels for high-detail mapping and change detection at fine scales
  - Use Land Parcel outputs for stable, comparable time-series analyses at ~0.5 ha units
  - Use 1 km summary rasters for broad-scale summaries and cross-region comparisons
  - Be aware of potential classification uncertainties in spectrally similar classes (Appendix notes on class-level confusion and the role of Context Rasters)

- Seasonal and validation notes
  - Seasonal composites help differentiate vegetation types; occasional cloud-related gaps are handled by the classifier
  - Validation indicates robust overall accuracy, with class-level performance varying by habitat type

- Citation and reuse
  - Each dataset has a DOI; users should cite the appropriate DOIs and Marston et al. overview where applicable
