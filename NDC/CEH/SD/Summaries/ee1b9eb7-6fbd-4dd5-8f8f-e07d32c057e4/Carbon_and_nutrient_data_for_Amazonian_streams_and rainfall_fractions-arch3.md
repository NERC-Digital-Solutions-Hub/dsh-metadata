# Sampling Regime

## Overview
- Data collection in the Western Amazonian basin, Tambopata National Reserve, Madre de Dios, Peru.
- Focus on fluvial carbon data: dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and its δ13C-DIC isotopic composition, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and particulate organic carbon (POC); targeted across wet and dry seasons.
- Additional rainfall fractions analyzed for DOC, POC, DIC, and δ13C-DIC (rain water, throughfall, stemflow, overland flow).
- Datasets previously submitted (with DOIs) and data resubmitted here to complete campaigns and expand coverage.

## Study Area and Sampling Points
- Sampling sites in two small streams (NC, MT) and two rivers (LT, TP).
- MT is seasonally active; NC flows during the dry season as well.
- Upstream catchments: LT ~2000 km2; TP ~14000 km2; NC MT sampling points at 4.5–7.5 m and 3.5–5 m wide respectively.
- Rivers at sampling point: LT ~40–80 m wide; TP ~200 m wide.
- Coordinates provided for sampling locations; catchment extents extend toward Andean foothills.

## Data Collected and Variables
- Streams and Rivers: DIC (mg/L), δ13C-DIC (‰), DOC (mg/L), POC (mg/L), Ca, Mg, K, Na (mg/L), P (μg/L), Si (mg/L); sample counts per site listed.
- Rainfall Fractions: DIC (mg/L) and δ13C-DIC (‰) for Rain water, Throughfall, Stemflow, Overland flow; DOC, POC (mg/L), Ca, Mg, K, Na (mg/L), TotP (μg/L), Si (mg/L).
- Data submissions include previously submitted data and resubmissions to address coverage gaps.

## Sampling Methods
- Fluvial sampling conducted in three campaigns (Feb–Apr 2011, Sept–Dec 2011, Mar–May 2012) with targeted flow conditions; MT dries in dry season limiting Sept–Nov 2011 sampling.
- DIC: pre-acidified Exetainers; headspace method for concentration and δ13C; triplicate samples with a backup.
- DOC: filtered water on sampling day; stored refrigerated; acidified to pH ~3.9; degassed; quantified by TOC combustion.
- POC: measured by loss on ignition of filtered materials; OC assumed as 50% for conversion to C.
- Nutrients: Ca/Mg by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS); K/Na by flame photometry; TotP and Si by colorimetric methods.
- Rainfall fractions: throughfall collectors near TAM9 plot; stemflow collected on eight tree species; overland flow collected adjacent to streams; collectors emptied after each event and analyzed for DOC/POC (and some DIC on a subset).

## Analytical Methods and Calibration
- DIC: calibration with six standards covering expected concentrations; δ13C measured with isotopic standards; drift correction standards included.
- DOC: eight-point calibration; blanks and drift checks; calibration replicated at batch start/end to ensure consistency.
- Nutrients: five-point calibrations for Ca/Mg (AAS) and K/Na (flame photometry); TotP and Si analyzed with standard colorimetric methods; dilutions used as needed.
- QA/QC: randomised sample order; repeat analyses for replicate checks; drift checks and long-term instrument performance standards included.

## Data Structure and Accessibility
- Data recorded with NA where not analyzed.
- Two CSV files: "Amazon streams C and nutrients" and "Amazon rainfall fractions C and nutrients".
- 14 columns for Streams and Rivers dataset; 12 columns for Rainfall Fractions dataset.
- Columns include: Time (hh:mm:ss), Date (dd/mm/yyyy), Type (stream/river or TF/SF/OF/RW), Site (MT, NC, LT, TP or sampling collector info), CollectorID (for rainfall data), and analytes (DOC, POC, DIC, δ13C-DIC, Ca, Mg, K, Na, TotP, Si).

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Gaps
- Values within detection limits across measurements.
- MT dries up during dry season, reducing sample availability in Sept–Nov 2011.
- Prior datasets had partial coverage; current submission addresses gaps and includes data from additional campaigns.
