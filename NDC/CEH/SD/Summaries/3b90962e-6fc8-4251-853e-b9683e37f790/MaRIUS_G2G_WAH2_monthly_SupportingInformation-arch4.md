# Supporting information for Grid-to-Grid model estimates of monthly mean flow and soil moisture for Great Britain: weather@home2 (climate model) driving data [MaRIUS-G2G-WAH2-monthly]

- Overview
  - Describes MaRIUS-G2G-WAH2-monthly dataset: Grid-to-Grid (G2G) model estimates of monthly mean river flow and soil moisture across Great Britain at 1 km x 1 km resolution.
  - Part of the MaRIUS project (Managing the Risks, Impacts and Uncertainties of drought and water Scarcity), funded by UK NERC, focusing on drought and water scarcity risk assessment.
  - Uses weather@home2 regional climate model (RCM) driving data to generate ensembles for historical and future periods.

- Data Content
  - Variables provided:
    - Flow (m3 s-1)
    - Soil moisture (mm water per m soil; equivalent to depth-integrated θ)
  - Temporal scope:
    - Historical Baseline (HISTBS: 1900-2006)
    - Baseline (BS: 1975-2004)
    - Near-Future (NF: 2020-2049)
    - Far-Future (FF: 2070-2099)
  - Ensemble structure:
    - 100 G2G simulations per period (ensembles)
    - Historical and future ensemble members are independent; same numbers across periods are not directly comparable
  - Spatial scope:
    - 1 km x 1 km grid across GB; land-only, sea cells set to missing
  - Supporting spatial datasets:
    - Digitally-derived catchment areas (1 km grid)
    - Estimated locations of flow gauging stations (NRFA), on the 1 km grid and in CSV
  - Additional outputs:
    - Example grids and NRFA station locations, catchment areas, and Wales catchment context (Figure 1)

- Driving Data and Hydrological Model
  - Meteorological driving data:
    - MaRIUS weather@home2 (WAH2) RCM dataset; multiple ensembles of historical and projected climates
    - Future periods use RCP8.5 emissions scenario
  - Bias correction and meteorology:
    - Precipitation bias-corrected with monthly multiplicative factors
    - Potential Evaporation (PE) derived via Penman-Monteith; for historical periods, uses stomatal resistance values from MORECS
    - For future periods, two PE schemes exist; here adjusted r_s/PE is used, which moderates projected low-flow decreases
  - Model specifics:
    - G2G is a 1 km x 1 km, 15-minute time-step hydrological model parameterised with soil/land-cover data
    - Urban/suburban land-cover effects on runoff included; calibration by spatial datasets rather than catchment-specific calibration
    - Snow module not used; precipitation assumed rain
    - 30-day months due to 360-day calendar in climate data
  - Inputs and re-projection:
    - WAH2 precipitation and PE re-projected from ~25 km HadRM3P HadAM3P grid to 1 km G2G grid
    - Spatial weighting within RCM boxes to distribute precipitation non-uniformly within box

- Data Format, Organization, and Access
  - File format:
    - NetCDF4; one file per period and ensemble member
  - File naming convention:
    - Historical Baseline: G2G_WAH_var_HISTBS*.nc (1900-2006; spin-up in 1900-1901)
    - Baseline: G2G_WAH_var_BS*.nc (1975-2004)
    - Near-Future: G2G_WAH_var_NF*.nc (2020-2049; 2020-01 onward)
    - Far-Future: G2G_WAH_var_FF*.nc (2070-2099; 2070-01 onward)
  - Grid and time indexing:
    - Domain: 700 km x 1000 kmGB grid; 1 km x 1 km cells
    - Time: 30-day monthly values; time units days since 1900-01-01; months aligned to first day of month
  - Metadata and auxiliary data:
    - CatchmentAreaGrid.nc: catchment area (km2) draining each 1 km cell
    - MaRIUS_G2G_NRFAStationIDGrid.nc: NRFA station IDs mapped to grid cells
    - MaRIUS_NRFAStationIDs.csv: NRFA station IDs for the 1285 stations with grid mapping
  - Usage interfaces:
    - Outputs include both flow and soil moisture for each non-sea grid cell
    - Some grid cells may map to the incorrect real-world catchment for very small basins due to 1 km discretisation

- Data Quality, Assumptions, and Limitations
  - Model limitations:
    - G2G primarily relies on natural (unabstracted) flows; does not account for abstractions and discharges
    - PE-based evaporation requires assumptions; snow module not used
  - Data assumptions:
    - Precipitation bias-corrected; PE not bias-corrected
    - 360-day calendar implies 30-day months
    - 1 km grid captures spatial variability but may misalign with real catchment delineations for small basins
  - Spin-up considerations:
    - Early years in HISTBS and NF/FF may be spin-up; ignore first two years for analyses or use for spin-up checks
  - Comparisons and interpretation:
    - Baseline (BS) is a 30-year subset of HISTBS; avoid direct time-series comparisons between ensemble members or periods
    - Use statistical comparisons (distributions, multi-decadal trends) rather than direct pointwise time-series matches
  - Observational comparisons:
    - Comparisons to observations (e.g., NRFA) should be statistical; alignment of modeled and observed catchments may vary due to discretisation

- Data Use and Collaboration Guidance for Data Leaders
  - Data stewardship:
    - Clearly documented metadata, file naming, and structure support discoverability and reuse
    - Multiple ensembles offer a basis for uncertainty and risk assessment; treat ensemble members as plausible realizations
  - User needs and co-ownership:
    - Datasets serve hydrological drought and drought-risk analyses; can be integrated with impact models (economic, ecological, agricultural)
    - Auxiliary datasets (NRFA locations, catchments) enable targeted comparisons with observations
  - Comparability and integration:
    - Use Baseline vs Future comparisons for assessing changes over time; avoid direct comparisons to observed series
    - When integrating with other data products, ensure consistent spatial reference (1 km grid) and temporal alignment (monthly means)
  - Data standards and quality:
    - NetCDF4 with CEH-dataset conventions; clear documentation facilitates interoperability
    - Be mindful of the 360-day calendar and ensemble IDs to avoid misinterpretation of results
  - Future collaboration and governance:
    - Acknowledge MaRIUS project outputs and NE/NERC funding
    - Reference primary methodological papers for model assumptions and validation context

- References and Acknowledgments
  - MaRIUS project and associated literature cited (development of G2G, bias correction, PE methods, drought analyses, and catchment mapping)
  - Acknowledges contributors and CEH data infrastructure; dataset produced under the UK Drought and Water Scarcity program

- Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - A large, high-resolution, ensemble-based hydrological dataset linking climate inputs to river flow and soil moisture across GB
  - Provides historical and future projections with explicit guidance on how to compare and interpret ensemble results
  - Includes rich ancillary data (catchments, NRFA stations) to support validation and end-user analyses
  - Suitable for risk and impact assessments, with clear caveats about model limitations and appropriate comparison practices
