# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and context
  - Presents a mapping between LCM2000 Broad Habitats (BH) and CS2000 field survey classifications, including Target Class, Subclasses, and Variants.
  - Serves as a basis for cross-walking remote-sensing habitat data to ground-truth survey categories to support environmental monitoring over time.
  - Includes notes on methodology, data quality, and the need to calibrate between datasets for consistent policy and health assessments.

- Classification mapping (highlights)
  - Inshore sublittoral: LCM Target Class Sea/Estuary; Subclasses Sea/Estuary; Variants include sea.
  - Standing water/canals: LCM Target Class Water (inland); Subclasses Water (inland); Variants water (inland).
  - Littoral and supra-littoral categories: various BHs mapped to Littoral rock/sediment, Supra-littoral rock/sediment, Saltmarsh, Dune, Shingle, etc., with numerous Variants (rock, mud, sand, vegetated forms, grazed/ungrazed, etc.).
  - Terrestrial and urban mosaics: Broadleaved woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Mountain habitats, Inland bare ground, Built up areas and gardens, etc.
  - Variants provide finer distinctions within each subclass (e.g., rock types, dune types, grassland seral states).

- Area coverage overview (Table 5)
  - UK total LCM2000 coverage: 246,688 km2; FS totals not consistently available for all categories.
  - Representative totals (examples)
    - Broadleaved/mixed woodland (UK LCM2000): ~15,600 km2; FS total ~15,220 km2 (England, Scotland, Wales, NI totals vary by region).
    - Coniferous woodland (UK LCM2000): ~13,540 km2; FS total ~14,350 km2.
    - Arable and horticulture (UK LCM2000): ~57,630 km2.
    - Improved grassland (UK LCM2000): ~59,073 km2.
    - Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands (UK LCM2000): ~11k–16k km2 each.
    - Bracken (UK LCM2000): ~1,892 km2.
    - Dwarf shrub heath (UK LCM2000): ~25,788 km2.
    - Fen/marsh/swamp (UK LCM2000): variable; included in totals.
    - Built up areas and gardens (UK LCM2000): ~16,637 km2.
  - Coastal and marine components are included but coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inter-tidal area definitions.
  - Note: Total UK LCM2000 does not always align with FS totals; FS data are incomplete or unavailable for some regions in the snapshot.

- LCM2000 vs field survey comparisons (Table 6)
  - Purpose: compare uncalibrated LCM2000 BH cover with CS2000 field survey estimates at 95% confidence intervals (Low/High).
  - Key patterns (illustrative examples)
    - Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland: England LCM2000 ~10,963 km2; FS Low ~8,460 km2; FS High ~11,480 km2; GB LCM2000 ~15,259 km2; FS Low ~12,750 km2; FS High ~16,670 km2.
    - Coniferous woodland: England LCM2000 ~2,990 km2; FS Low ~1,802 km2; High ~4,158 km2; GB LCM2000 ~12,879 km2; FS Low ~10,672 km2; High ~16,808 km2.
    - Arable & horticulture (GB): LCM2000 ~56,638 km2; FS Low ~47,944 km2; High ~57,036 km2.
    - Improved grassland (GB): LCM2000 ~50,024 km2; FS Low ~50,536 km2; High ~59,104 km2.
    - Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grassland categories show more variable alignment, with some FS lows/highs well below or above LCM2000 values.
    - Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, and Built up areas show notable differences in some regions, highlighting calibration needs.
  - Overall takeaway: There is general alignment between LCM2000 and field survey estimates for many broad habitats, but substantial variation exists by habitat type, region, and data source; qualitative agreement is strengthened by regional calibration.

- Summary correspondences and agreement (Tables 8–10)
  - Tables 8–10 present summary correspondences (per 1000) between LCM2000 and CS2000 field survey for GB, England & Wales, Scotland, and Oceanic contexts.
  - Key points
    - Correspondences show moderate alignment overall, with variability by habitat and by how urban/generalised areas are treated.
    - Urban generalisation can improve correspondence for some sectors.
    - Reported totals indicate roughly around two-thirds to three-quarters agreement in aggregate terms, with detailed category-level mismatches driving the remaining differences.
  - Scotland-focused Table 10 and England & Wales-focused Table 9 provide region-specific patterns, using bootstrapping across 40 Land Classes to estimate confidence intervals.

- Methodology and caveats (Footnotes highlights)
  - LCM2000 statistics derived from full 25 m grid counts; FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
  - Coastal coverage varies with tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore intertidal areas.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS explained in accompanying text; NI data may exclude some BHs.
  - CS2000 mappings and bootstrapping across strata used to estimate confidence intervals; urban generalisation is a key factor in cross-walking categories.
  - The document emphasizes the need for calibrated harmonisation to improve temporal monitoring and policy assessment.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data management (Analysts perspective)
  - The Tables demonstrate how to align remote-sensing habitat classifications with field survey data to support consistent environmental health assessments over time.
  - Calibration between LCM2000 and CS2000 is essential to improve accuracy and reduce misclassification, especially in urban and coastal zones.
  - The mapping in Table 1 provides a standardized bridge for reporting outputs and policy performance across time and authorities.
  - Data value can be increased by integrating LCM2000 with CS2000 and other datasets, and by making underlying data more accessible to analysts and stakeholders.
  - Recognize coastal coverage limitations and regional differences (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) when interpreting results for monitoring.

- Practical takeaways for analysts
  - Use the standardized crosswalk (Table 1) to translate outputs into comparable policy-relevant formats.
  - When monitoring change over time, supplement LCM2000 with field surveys (CS2000) to validate and calibrate habitat classes.
  - Be mindful of urban generalisation effects and coastal intertidal inclusion when comparing datasets.
  - Seek accessible, linkable data products and transparent metadata to enable reuse and integration with other environmental datasets.
