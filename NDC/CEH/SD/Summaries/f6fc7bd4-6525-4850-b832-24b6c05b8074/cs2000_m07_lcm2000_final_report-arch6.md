# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Purpose: Connect broad habitats to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants to support interpretation of map outputs and facilitate cross-walks between classifications.
- Class structure:
  - LCM Target class
  - LCM Subclasses
  - Variants
  - Suclasses are indicated by map display colours
- Coverage context: Applies across the UK with mappings and colour-coding intended to aid visual interpretation and subsequent analyses.

## Data and Methods

- Data sources:
  - LCM2000 statistics derived from a full count of cover using a 25 m grid.
  - FS (field survey) statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Classification and mapping:
  - 20+ Broad Habitats (BHs) mapped with associated target classes, subclasses, and variants.
  - Coastal and intertidal areas treated with special consideration due to tidal variability.
- Validation approach:
  - Table 5–6 present broad habitat cover by BHs for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the UK as a whole, using LCM2000 and (where available) FS estimates.
  - Footnotes explain differences between LCM2000 and FS, and note that NI data may be incomplete or excluded in FS comparisons.
- Scale and generalisation:
  - LCM2000 operates at 25 m resolution; FS uses 1 km squares; differences in scale, data sources, and survey coverage are acknowledged as sources of discrepancy.

## Coverage and Key Metrics

- National totals (LCM2000 vs FS where available):
  - UK total LCM2000: 246,688 km2; UK FS total: not always available; FS values reported for England, Wales, Scotland, NI separately or combined where applicable.
  - England: LCM2000 total around 130,362 km2; FS total around 142,355 km2 (for England & Wales combined in some tables).
  - Wales: LCM2000 total around 20,689 km2.
  - Scotland: LCM2000 total around 77,898 km2.
  - Northern Ireland: LCM2000 total around 17,739 km2.
- Key habitat totals (examples from Table 5):
  - Broad-leaved/mixed woodland (UK LCM2000): 15,540–15,259 km2 depending on aggregation; FS values shown for England, Wales, Scotland, NI separately where available.
  - Coniferous woodland (UK LCM2000): ~13,540 km2; FS values available for some regions.
  - Arable and horticulture (UK LCM2000): ~57,630 km2; FS ~53,070 km2 (England & Wales combined in some entries).
  - Improved grassland (UK LCM2000): ~59,073 km2; FS ~60,500 km2.
  - Semi-natural grass and bracken (UK LCM2000): ~41,600 km2; FS ~33,000 km2.
  - Bog (UK LCM2000): ~5,134 km2; FS ~25,664 km2 (where FS data exist).
  - Dwarf shrub heath (UK LCM2000): ~7,527 km2.
  - Fen, marsh and swamp (UK LCM2000): ~197 km2 (FS values shown where available).
  - Standing open water and canals (UK LCM2000): ~2,095 km2.
  - Built up areas and gardens (UK LCM2000): ~16,637 km2 (FS generally not available in all entries).
  - Coastal, littoral and supralittoral components show varied coastal coverage due to tidal states and inclusion criteria.
- FS versus LCM2000 notes:
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics are explained in accompanying text.
  - Total coverage varies with FS population definitions (e.g., 1 km squares) and NI survey exclusions.
  - Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and offshore inter-tidal area inclusion/exclusion.

## Validation and Uncertainty

- Validation framework:
  - Table 6 provides uncalibrated LCM2000 cover for BHs with 95% confidence intervals from FS for England, Wales, Scotland, and GB as a whole.
  - FS Low and High bounds accompany LCM2000 estimates to illustrate uncertainty.
- Representative statistics:
  - Example GB FS ranges (illustrative, not exhaustive): Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland Low ~12,750; High ~16,670; Coniferous woodland Low ~10,672; High ~16,808; Arable & horticulture Low ~47,944; High ~57,036; Improved grassland Low ~50,536; High ~59,104; Bog Low ~18,696; High ~25,664.
- NI and coastal caveats:
  - NI FS data are frequently not available or incomplete in some tables.
  - Coastal and inter-tidal areas carry additional uncertainty due to variable tidal states and definitional differences.
- Interpretation guidance:
  - Differences between datasets are attributed to definitional boundaries, resolution, and survey coverage rather than purely measurement error.
  - The tables explicitly flag where FS data are unavailable, incomplete, or subject to different geography definitions.

## Validation Outputs: Summary Correspondence

- Summary correspondence matrices (Tables 8–10):
  - CS2000 field survey squares were compared with LCM2000 across GB, England & Wales, and Scotland.
  - Analyses are weighted estimates using strata based on 40 Land Classes and bootstrapped to generate confidence intervals.
  - Results are presented per 1000 (Table 8–10) for Broad Habitats, Target Class, and Aggregate Class levels; also include urban generalisation considerations.
  - The matrices indicate varying degrees of correspondence between LCM2000 and CS2000 across habitat types, with some habitats showing relatively higher alignment and others showing greater divergence, particularly where urban/generalisation and coastal/urban interfaces dominate.
- Key interpretation notes:
  - Urban generalisation and scale differences can reduce apparent correspondence for some habitats.
  - Coastal and inter-tidal areas exhibit distinct differences due to tidal state and boundary definitions.
  - Footnotes emphasize that the numbers are weighted estimates with bootstrapped confidence intervals and that discrepancies are explained in the accompanying text.

## Data Products and Outputs

- Products described by the tables:
  - Crosswalks between LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Table 1) to support data integration and interpretation.
  - Quantitative coverage tables (Table 5) for BHs by country and UK totals (LCM2000 vs FS where available).
  - Calibration/validation tables (Table 6) with 95% confidence intervals for selected BHs.
  - Summary correspondence matrices (Tables 8–10) detailing per-1000 correspondences between LCM2000 and CS2000 across broad habitats, with urban/generalisation contexts.

## Practical Implications for Data Support

- For data users:
  - When integrating LCM2000 with CS2000 or field surveys, be mindful of scale differences (25 m vs 1 km) and coastal/intertidal handling.
  - Use the provided correspondence matrices to assess likely alignment by habitat type and consider urban generalisation as a factor in interpretation.
  - Employ bootstrapped confidence intervals to gauge uncertainty around habitat area estimates, especially for cross-dataset comparisons.
- For data stewards:
  - Document and harmonise definitions for target classes, subclasses, and variants to improve cross-dataset comparability.
  - Flag regions with incomplete FS data (notably NI) and clearly communicate associated uncertainties.
  - Consider providing calibrated adjustments or translation rules to reduce systematic differences between LCM2000 and field survey outputs in future analyses.
