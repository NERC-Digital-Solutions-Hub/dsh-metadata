# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

## Overview
- Defines how Broad Habitats relate to the LCM2000 framework: Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants (Suclasses).
- Illustrates the cross-walk between habitat types (e.g., inshore sublittoral, standing water, littoral rock, supra-littoral, montane, arable/horticultural, various grasslands, woodlands, urban areas, etc.) and their corresponding LCM2000 classifications.
- Indicates that many habitat types are represented with multiple levels (Target Class, Subclass, Variant) to support map display and analysis.

## Mapping framework (LCM2000 vs CS2000)
- Presents mappings for a wide range of habitats, including:
  - Inshore sublittoral (Sea/Estuary)
  - Standing water/canals (Water inland)
  - Littoral and supra-littoral rock and sediment (rock, algae, dunes, saltmarsh, shingle, etc.)
  - Bogs, fen, marsh, swamp; fens and bogs with deep peat variations
  - Dwarf shrub heath, montane habitats
  - Broad-leaved and coniferous woodland; arable & horticultural lands; improved/non-rotational grasslands; neutral, calcareous, acidic grasslands; bracken; fen/marsh/swamp; inland bare ground; built-up areas; suburban/urban and continuous urban
  - Supralittoral rock/sediment and Littoral rock/sediment; Littoral rock and Littoral sediment; Oceanic seas
- Highlights how each broad habitat is linked to specific LCM Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants, enabling cross-walking of classifications to map displays.

## Table 5: LCM2000 cover (km2) by Subclasses and Aggregates vs Field Survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries
- Table shows area coverage (km2) for Subclasses from LCM2000 and bolded Aggregate classes, across England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the UK as a whole.
- Demonstrates that:
  - Large, common land-cover types (e.g., broad-leaved/mixed woodland, coniferous woodland, arable & horticulture, improved grassland, built-up areas) occupy substantial portions of the UK’s land surface.
  - UK totals for LCM2000 vs field survey (FS) are provided for many categories, illustrating differences in measured extents between the automated land-cover map (LCM2000) and field survey data.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS vary by habitat type and country, reflecting scale, boundary definitions, and data collection methods.

## Table 6: LCM2000 cover (uncalibrated) vs Field Survey estimates (95% CI) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB
- Compares uncalibrated LCM2000 cover by Broad Habitats with FS estimates, including 95% confidence intervals (Low and High) for GB and constituent countries.
- Key patterns (illustrative examples, not exhaustive):
  - Woodland types (broadleaved/mixed/yew; coniferous) show FS estimates that often fall within or near the LCM2000 ranges, though exact lows/highs vary by country.
  - Arable and horticulture, improved grassland, and some grassland categories generally align to FS ranges with notable variability.
  - Wetland categories (fen/marsh/swamp; bog) and Montane habitats tend to exhibit larger discrepancies, reflecting scale and boundary definition differences.
  - Some categories have limited or no FS estimates in certain countries, yielding gaps in direct comparison.
- The table highlights that uncalibrated LCM2000 tends to deviate in certain habitat groups when compared to field surveys, underscoring the need for calibration and cross-walking for precise local applications.

## Tables 8–10: Summary correspondences between LCM2000 and CS2000 field survey squares (GB, England & Wales, Scotland)
- Provide summary correspondence matrices expressing results per 1000 (and per 1000 for different aggregation levels) by comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares.
- GB (Table 8) indicates:
  - Broad habitats show a general level of correspondence, with some categories matching more strongly than others.
  - The matrices reflect differences in classification schemes and scale, including notable effects from urban generalisation.
- England & Wales (Table 9) and Scotland (Table 10) show:
  - Variable correspondences by habitat type, with some categories aligning more closely than others.
  - Clear evidence that scale, boundary definitions, and urban generalisation influence accuracy and cross-walk performance.
- Overall takeaway from the correspondence tables:
  - There is measurable correspondence between LCM2000 and CS2000 at broad/higher levels, but substantial variation exists at finer target-class and subclass/variant levels.
  - Differences are influenced by classification granularity, regional practice, and urban generalisation.

## Footnotes and methodology
- LCM2000 statistics are based on a full count of cover using a 25 m grid.
- FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000.
- Differences between LCM2000 and FS are explained in the text.
- Coastal coverage is variable due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
- Totals differ depending on the inclusion/exclusion of certain BHs and the definition of the FS population (1 km squares) in different regions.
- Tables 8–10 employ bootstrapping and stratification (e.g., 40 Land Classes) to derive weighted estimates and confidence intervals.
- The analysis distinguishes between BHlevel (excluding linear features) and aggregate classifications, and notes where urban generalisation affects results.

## Practical implications for analysis and decision-making
- LCM2000 provides a comprehensive, nationally coherent basis for broad habitat mapping and cross-country comparison, but calibration against field surveys (CS2000/FS) improves local accuracy.
- Differences between LCM2000 and CS2000/FS highlight the importance of scale, boundary definitions, and urban generalisation when using these datasets for local planning or impact assessment.
- For analysts, a careful cross-walk is essential when translating LCM2000 classifications to field-based realities, especially for wetlands, montane habitats, and urban/extensively developed areas.
- The methodological approach (bootstrapped, stratified, 25 m grid, 40 Land Classes) provides a robust framework for estimating correspondences and assessing uncertainty across UK regions.
