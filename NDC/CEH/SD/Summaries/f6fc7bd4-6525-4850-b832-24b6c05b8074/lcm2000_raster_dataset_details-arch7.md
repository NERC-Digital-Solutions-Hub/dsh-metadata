# 25m raster

- Purpose
  - Describes two raster datasets derived from LCM2000 land cover data for Great Britain and Northern Ireland: a 25m raster and a 1km raster.
  - 25m raster: records the dominant land cover per 25m cell using LCM2000 Subclasses.
  - 1km raster: created by summarising the 25m raster within 1km grid.

- Spatial coverage and grid details
  - Across Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI)
  - 25m raster
    - GB: 24,400 columns x 48,400 rows
    - NI: 7,600 columns x 7,200 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing: GB 50,000 m / 10,000 m; NI 180,000 m / 280,000 m
    - Pixel size: 25 m
    - Coordinate system: GB = British National Grid; NI = Irish National Grid
    - Projection: Transverse Mercator; Spheroid: Airy (GB), Airy Modified 1849 (NI)
    - Datum: OSGB 1936 (GB); Ireland 1965 (NI)
    - Note: The values refer to the lower left corner of the lower-left pixel; to get the pixel centre add 12.5 m to each value.
  - 1km raster
    - GB: 700 columns x 1,300 rows
    - NI: 500 columns x 500 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing: GB 0 m / 0 m; NI 0 m / 0 m
    - Pixel size: 1,000 m
    - Coordinate system: GB = British National Grid; NI = Irish National Grid
    - Projection: Transverse Mercator; Spheroid: Airy (GB), Airy Modified 1849 (NI)
    - Datum: OSGB 1936 (GB); Ireland 1965 (NI)
    - Note: The values refer to the lower left corner of the lower-left pixel; to get the pixel centre add 500 m to each value.

- 25m raster details (Table 1)
  - Metadata highlights
    - Great Britain: 24400 columns, 48400 rows
    - Northern Ireland: 7600 columns, 7200 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing and pixel-centre offsets as noted above
    - Pixel size: 25 m for both GB and NI
    - Coordinate systems, projections, spheroids, and datums as described above

- 1km raster details (Table 2)
  - Metadata highlights
    - Great Britain: 700 columns, 1300 rows
    - Northern Ireland: 500 columns, 500 rows
    - Lower left easting/northing: 0 m for both GB and NI
    - Pixel size: 1000 m for both GB and NI
    - Coordinate systems, projections, spheroids, and datums as described above
  - Note: Pixel-centre offset for 1km: add 500 m to lower-left values.

- Encoding and class correspondence (Table 3)
  - 25m Subclass codes are floating point with one decimal place and are stored as unsigned 8-bit bytes by multiplying by 10 (range 0–255).
  - Example: Water (inland) LCM2000 Subclass.25m code = 131 becomes 1310 when scaled? (illustrative): actual storage is 131 for 25m subclass; the key point is scaling to an 8-bit byte (e.g., 22.1 → 221).
  - 1km codes and Aggregate class codes provide a cross-walk from 25m Subclasses to 1km Subclass codes and to 1km Aggregate class codes.

- Practical notes for GIS use
  - The 25m dataset provides high-resolution classification suitable for detailed map-based analyses; the 1km raster offers a coarser, synthesis view.
  - The cross-walk in Table 3 enables translation between 25m Subclasses, 1km Subclasses, and 1km Aggregate classes for multi-resolution analyses.
  - The encoding to 8-bit bytes (via scaling) supports compact storage in raster formats.
