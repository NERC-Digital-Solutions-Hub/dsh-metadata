# Supporting information for: Hydraulic properties of peat extracted from 20 locations at Rensjön palsa mire, Sweden in July 2022

- Study aim and scope: Provides laboratory measurements of peat hydraulic properties from degrading palsas at Rensjön palsa mire, Norrbotten, Sweden (July 2022) to support understanding of peat dynamics and degradation.
- Grant support: Natural Environment Research Council (NE/S007458/1).

## Study site and collection methods
- Location: 20 locations on degrading palsas at Rensjön palsa mire (68.0868°N, 19.8314°E), Sweden.
- Sample handling: Peat cores collected in PVC downpipes, transported to the University of Leeds for analysis.
- Subsampling: 82 subsamples analyzed for hydraulic properties.
- Measurements:
  - Horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (Kh) via split-cylinder permeameter.
  - Dry bulk density from immediately adjacent peat core offcuts (Chambers et al., 2011).
  - Degree of peat humification (von Post scale) from adjacent offcuts (Ekono, 1981).

## Data collected and structure
- Primary variables (in the accompanying CSV fewster_2023_wrr_data.csv): seven columns
  - FID: Field identifier (no unit)
  - Subsample_ID: Subsample code (no unit)
  - Kh_m_s: Horizontal saturated hydraulic conductivity (m s^-1)
  - Depth_midpoint_m: Sample midpoint depth (m)
  - Von_Post_score: Degree of peat humification (H-score) on von Post scale
  - Dry_bulk_density_g_cm3: Dry bulk density (g cm^-3)
  - Degradation_stage: Categorical degradation stage (desiccating or collapsed)
- Format: CSV (comma-separated values)

## Quality control
- Measurements conducted by the authors.
- Instrument checks performed; outliers removed (e.g., anomalously high Kh values) and measurements repeated when necessary.

## Data file details
- File: fewster_2023_wrr_data.csv
- Dataset provides a structured, self-contained record of hydraulic properties, depth context, humification, and degradation state for each subsample.

## References and methodological context
- Kh determination: split-cylinder permeameter method.
- Dry bulk density: standard technique per Chambers et al. (2011).
- Humification: von Post classification per Ekono (1981).
