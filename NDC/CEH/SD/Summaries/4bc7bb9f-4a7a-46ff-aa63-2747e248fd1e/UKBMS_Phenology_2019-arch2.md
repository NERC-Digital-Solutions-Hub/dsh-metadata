# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteers and provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity status and policy questions.
  - Operational since 1976, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
  - Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to monitor changes over time.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects at sites, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year), 2–4 km in length, ~5 m wide band, ongoing April–September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1-km transects, 2–3 visits/year, sampling farmland and common habitats (~750 squares/year).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species or life stages.
  - Combines data from all methods for analyses.

- Nature of data collected (phenology)
  - Phenology: timing of adult butterfly flight periods and related life-history stages.
  - Metrics include: first/last observation dates, peak date/count, flight period length, mean flight date, and standard deviation around the mean flight date.
  - For species with multiple generations (multivoltine) or overwintering adults (uni-voltine), separate flight-period metrics may be provided for distinct generations when possible; for some species, data are provided for the entire flight period or two distinct periods when separations are feasible.
  - Limitations exist due to uneven weekly coverage and the UKBMS season (April 1 to Sept 30).

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag abnormal counts and records outside known flight periods.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data, with ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation includes checks against known distributions and typical abundances; corrections are made through queries and coordination with recorders.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides phenology data for all species across all sites/years with sufficient data, in CSV format.
  - For thirteen species, data may include entire flight periods plus separate data for two distinct flight periods per year; others provide data for the entire flight season only.
  - Key columns include:
    - SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF
    - SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME
    - YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD
    - FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT
    - MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE

- Key considerations for analysts
  - The dataset provides standardized, long-term indicators of butterfly population status and phenology across the UK.
  - Useful for monitoring biodiversity health, assessing policy questions, and integrating with other environmental datasets.
  - Data quality is reinforced by multi-tier validation and regional oversight, but phenology metrics must account for uneven sampling and seasonal constraints.
  - The Open Government Licence encourages broad reuse, with required attribution and proper citation.
