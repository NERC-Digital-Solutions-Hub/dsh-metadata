# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Aims and scope
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Recognises volunteers as a key data source.
  - Provides annual population-status data to address policy questions relating to biodiversity status and trends.
  - Data cover multiple sampling methods integrated for a UK-wide view.

- What data is collected: sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects at sites chosen by recorders, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year (April–Sept), recording all butterfly species along a 5 m band.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August), sampling common habitats (farmland) with ~750 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval webs) focusing on specific species.
  - Overall scale: since 1976, over 2500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all methods analyzed together.

- Data types and phenology metrics
  - Phenology focuses on timing of adult butterfly flight periods.
  - Metrics include first/last record dates, peak-count date, duration between first and last observations.
  - Additional metrics: mean flight date and standard deviation to capture timing and synchronisation, especially when weekly sampling is inconsistent.
  - For species with multiple generations (multivoltine) or overwintered adults (uni-voltine), data can be separated by flight period where feasible; limitations exist due to generation overlap and overwintering biology.

- Data quality and validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks detect anomalies (e.g., abnormally high counts, out-of-season records); regional coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Further automated/manual validations check range, flight-period consistency, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; errors corrected through queries and coordinator input.

- Data access and format (data download)
  - Data download is a CSV file containing phenology data for all species, all sites, and all years with sufficient data.
  - For 13 species, full flight-period data and separate first/second flight-period data are provided when possible; other species have full-season data only.
  - Key columns include SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, NUMBER_OF_BROODS, BROOD, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) enables free use with few conditions.
  - Must cite data with its DOI in publications; attribution required: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS Partners offer dataset guidance and interpretation support; potential for co-authorship and intellectual input.
