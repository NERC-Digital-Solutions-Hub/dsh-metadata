# Assessing and Communicating Animal Disease Risks for Countryside Users, 2007-2010

- Purpose and aims
  - Investigate potential impact of the zoonotic disease Lyme borreliosis (LB) on countryside use.
  - Develop risk assessment methods and communication strategies to inform land managers, workers, and the public.
  - Integrate findings into conceptual frameworks to guide policy and practice.
  - Use three case study sites (Richmond Park, New Forest, Exmoor) to explore risk, perception, and communication in different settings.

- Methods and data sources
  - Risk assessment: tick abundance sampling, a population model for Ixodes ricinus (in R), and infection prevalence data; development of case-study risk maps showing spatial and seasonal patterns.
  - Tick sampling (2008–2009): field plots across diverse habitats; sampling included dragging blankets and sampling from leggings/ground probes; 32,371 ticks counted.
  - Tick modelling: environment, hosts (deer, livestock), and acaricide scenarios to assess impacts on questing tick numbers.
  - Risk perception and communication: interviews, questionnaires, and focus groups with the public, land managers, FC staff, and LB patients; ethical and access challenges for patient data.
  - Scenario analysis: deductive development of four future “storylines” around land-use intensity and leisure patterns; two-stage stakeholder review with Project Advisory Board and Practitioner Panel.
  - Interdisciplinary design: collaboration across zoology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and policy; engagement with Project Advisory Board (PAB) and Project Practitioner Panel (PrP).

- Key findings
  - Tick distribution: ticks occur in far more habitats than typically emphasized in risk communication; highest densities often in wooded or bracken habitats; risk is not confined to obvious hotspots.
  - Risk communication implications: preventative advice should emphasize post-visit precautions; avoiding tick habitats is impractical; information should be consistent across organisations but tailored to audiences.
  - Disease incidence data gaps: limited data on LB incidence and pathogen prevalence in ticks; no robust evidence that any single forested site is uniquely hazardous.
  - Deer and hosts: tick abundance is sensitive to host density; management of deer and host balance can influence tick populations, with complex, location-dependent effects.
  - Public perceptions: most countryside users prefer post-visit precautions; fear and unknowns about LB influence communications and experiences of risk.
  - Organisational responses: variability in information provision and perceived responsibility; desire for more coordinated, authoritative information sources; risk communication should consider time and place, as well as biological risk.
  - Scenarios and planning: future challenges include information coordination during outbreaks and the impact of media on public behaviour; audience segmentation and place-specific communication could improve outcomes.

- Conceptual frameworks and outputs
  - Framework 1: five broad organisational responses to disease incidence — targeted control, medical intervention, influencing behaviour, surveillance, and lobbying.
  - Framework 2: guidance for influencing behaviour focused risk communication customized to time and place, underpinned by biological understanding.
  - Key published outputs: Frameworks for risk communication and disease management: the case of Lyme disease and countryside users (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, in press); RELU policy/practice brief on influencing behaviour; data sets archived for sharing.
  - Data and tools: development of risk maps and a structured approach to integrating risk, perception, and communication findings; data management exemplar aligned with ESRC policies.

- Case study sites and data details
  - Sites: Richmond Park (Greater London), New Forest (Southern England), Exmoor (South West England).
  - Tick sampling: conducted March 2008–December 2009; 3-weekly sampling; multiple vegetation types recorded; tick counts by transects; environmental variables (vegetation height, soil moisture, humidity, temperature) collected to relate tick abundance to habitat.
  - Infection prevalence: LB Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. prevalence in nymphs around 2.8% (and higher in adults) across study sites; data contribute to understanding relative risk but are not definitive indicators of hotspots.
  - Human use and exposure: diverse patterns of visitor use; higher exposure in busier sites, though tick densities varied by habitat and site.

- Capacity-building, interdisciplinarity, and knowledge transfer
  - Built interdisciplinary capacity through dedicated days, joint workshops, and cross-training; linked PhD and training activities to strengthen mixed-methods approaches.
  - Engagement with decision-makers and practitioners via three panels; field-shadowing and stakeholder workshops enhanced practical relevance.
  - Outputs disseminated to policy and practitioner audiences; project website maintained; RELU and external conferences contributed to broader uptake.

- Impacts, uptake, and policy implications
  - Emphasises proportionate risk management: influence behaviour through credible, practical information rather than avoidance of countryside use.
  - Calls for an authoritative knowledge base and better coordination between health authorities and land managers to guide risk communication and precautionary actions.
  - Highlights need for place- and audience-specific communication to improve understanding and acceptance of risk and protective measures.

- Challenges and limitations
  - Data access and ethics hurdles delayed data collection (especially LB patient data via Health Protection Agency and GPs; responses from many Primary Care Trusts).
  - Lack of accessible spatial disease-incidence data limited the scope of prospective scenario projections.
  - Personnel changes and budget/virement needs affected project continuity and integration efforts.
  - Integration of different disciplines required time and facilitation; some outputs progressed more slowly due to disciplinary silos.

- Future research directions
  - Investigate diagnosis-to-incidence pathways (GP awareness, help-seeking, testing) to clarify case designation processes.
  - Develop integrated monitoring of tick abundance, infection prevalence, and disease incidence across regions.
  - Refine tick-pathogen transmission models and explore “hotspots” in relation to visitor patterns and diagnostics.
  - Systematically survey LB infection prevalence in ticks nationwide to strengthen disease-incidence data.

- Nominated outputs
  - Academic output: Frameworks for risk communication and disease management: the case of Lyme disease and countryside users (in press).
  - Stakeholder output: Protecting countryside users against zoonotic diseases: the scope for influencing behaviour? (REL U Policy Practice Note, in press).

- Data management and accessibility
  - Data sets prepared and archived; acknowledged as exemplars for ESRC data policy.
  - Additional materials, maps, and tick sampling data associated with three field sites intended for public or partner use.

- Overall takeaway for analysts
  - A robust, data-driven approach linking field biology (tick ecology, pathogen prevalence) with social science (risk perception, communication, and behavior) produces actionable frameworks for managing zoonotic risk without unduly restricting countryside use.
  - Effective risk management requires integrated, co-produced knowledge among health authorities, land managers, and communities, with flexible, time- and place-sensitive communication strategies supported by transparent data sharing.
