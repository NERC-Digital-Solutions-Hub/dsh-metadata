# Assessing and Communicating Animal Disease Risks for Countryside Users, 2007-2010

- A multidisciplinary RELU project (2007-2010) examining the risk of Lyme borreliosis (LB) to countryside use in the UK and how to communicate and manage that risk.
- Three case study sites: Richmond Park (Greater London), New Forest (Southern England), Exmoor (South West England).
- Aimed to integrate biological risk data with social perceptions, risk communication, and management strategies to inform policy and practice.

## Data Collected and Formats

- Tick sampling data ( field methods described in detail)
  - Techniques: dragging a 100 cm x 75 cm blanket; sampling via leggings with sampling squares; ten replicates per plot; counts by life stage (L = larvae, N = nymphs, AM/AF = adult males/females).
  - Habitat types and plot layouts across three sites; vegetation height, soil moisture, relative humidity, and ground-level/near-ground temperatures recorded.
  - Total ticks counted: 32,371; infection prevalence in ticks: 2.8% (nymphs) to 5.9% (adults) within study sites.
  - Outputs include high-resolution tick distribution data and habitat-related risk maps (Figure 2; combined 2-year averages).
  - Data formats: ArcView map documents, ArcView shapefiles (habitat GIS layers), GIS raster/vector components, and accompanying metadata; tick sampling data stored in Excel spreadsheets; field data and lab-verified counts.
- Disease and risk perception data (social science components)
  - Patient data from LB units and GPs; postal questionnaires and interviews with LB patients.
  - Public participants: interviews, questionnaires, focus groups with countryside visitors and staff; content analysis of informational materials from 29 land-based organizations.
  - Outputs include qualitative themes and quantitative analyses of risk perception and precautionary behaviors.
- Information materials and organizational data
  - Content analysis of risk/precaution communications from land-based organizations; 19-29 organizations included in interviews and document analysis.
- Data products and outputs
  - Two conceptual frameworks on risk communication and disease management (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B; in press).
  - RELU policy/practice note on influencing precautionary behaviour.
  - Data sets archived for long-term preservation; project website and RELU-related publications.

## Data Management, Governance, and Access

- Ethical and governance processes
  - Ethical approvals obtained; challenges with obtaining Research & Development (R&D) approvals and contacting 142 Primary Care Trusts, causing delays and a need to extend work packages.
- Data archiving and policy alignment
  - Datasets prepared and lodged for archiving; used as an exemplar for ESRC data policy plan updates.
  - Data management practices aligned with RELU guidelines; data policy and data-sharing plans highlighted in outputs and policy notes.
- Data availability and limitations
  - Spatial disease-incidence data underpinned projections were not made available by the Health Protection Agency (HPA), necessitating reliance on prospective/scenario-based approaches instead of fully projective forecasts.
  - Staffing changes and extended timelines influenced data integration and longitudinal analyses.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Methodology

- Field methodology and provenance
  - Three study sites surveyed March 2008 – December 2009; three-weekly sampling intervals; standardized transects and replicate plots.
  - Habitat sampling tied to precise vegetation types; environmental covariates recorded to support risk modelling.
- Modelling and analysis
  - Tick population modelling implemented in R using a stage-classified Leslie matrix with temperature-dependent development, linked to drivers such as climate, host density, and acaricide use.
  - Resulting models produced risk maps showing seasonal variation and habitat-specific risk to guide communication strategies.
- Data integrity and accessibility
  - Rich metadata and documentation accompany GIS layers and tick data; multiple file types (ArcView documents, shapefiles, Excel datasets) organized to support reuse and replication.

## Findings, Outputs, and Impacts

- Scientific and policy outputs
  - Publication: Frameworks for risk communication and disease management: the case of Lyme disease and countryside users (in press, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B).
  - RELU policy/practice note: Protecting countryside users against zoonotic diseases: the scope for influencing behaviour?
  - Data-driven risk maps and habitat-specific risk characterizations informing targeted communication.
- Stakeholder engagement and knowledge transfer
  - Involvement of Project Advisory Board (PAB) and Project Practitioner Panel (PrP) to translate findings into policy and practice.
  - Presentations at RELU events, Defra workshops, and national networks; project website maintained; data and outputs disseminated to a broad audience including non-academic users.
- Data stewardship and capacity building
  - Demonstrated interdisciplinary data integration across biology, psychology, sociology, and policy; established frameworks intended for broader zoonotic disease management beyond LB.
  - Data management practices highlighted as exemplars for ESRC data policy adoption.

## Challenges and Limitations (Data Stewardship Perspective)

- Data availability gaps
  - Lack of accessible disease-incidence data limited projection capabilities and forced scenario-based analyses rather than fully data-driven forecasting.
- Administrative and logistical hurdles
  - Onerous ethics and R&D approvals; delays in data access; staff turnover affecting continuity and integrative activities.
- Inter-organizational coordination
  - Inconsistent information provision across land-management and health authorities; desire for a common authoritative knowledge base and clearer responsibilities for risk communication.

## Implications for Data Stewards

- Importance of robust data governance
  - Align research data with national data policies; plan for long-term archiving and metadata richness to enable reuse and cross-site analyses.
- Data interoperability and standards
  - Maintain standardized data schemas for ecological (tick and habitat) and social (risk perception, communications) datasets to ease integration and future modelling.
- Documentation and provenance
  - Provide clear methodological documentation (sampling protocols, environmental covariates, GIS schemas) to support reproducibility and future data merging.
- Access, licensing, and collaboration
  - Establish explicit data-sharing agreements across partners to minimize access delays; prepare for cross-jurisdiction data contributions (e.g., deer abundance, host densities, disease incidence) with consistent licensing.
- Future-proofing and reuse
  - Ensure data repositories capture both biological and social data, with linkable identifiers to outputs (journal articles, policy notes), enabling future decision-support tools and scenario planning.

## Future Data Needs and Recommendations

- Expand incidence data integration
  - Seek access to comprehensive, nationwide LB incidence data and tick infection prevalence to enable more robust, projective modelling.
- Integrated monitoring
  - Develop coordinated monitoring of tick abundance, host densities, and pathogen transmission to support dynamic risk assessment.
- Refine modelling and hotspots concept
  - Further refine tick-host-disease transmission models and investigate the relationship between perceived “hotspots” and actual pathogen risk versus visitor-use patterns.
- Institutional links and knowledge base
  - Build authoritative, cross-sector knowledge bases linking health authorities, land managers, and researchers to improve risk communication and decision-making.
- Follow-on tools and dissemination
  - Develop decision-support tools for stakeholders, informed by the conceptual frameworks, to guide management and communication strategies in real time.
