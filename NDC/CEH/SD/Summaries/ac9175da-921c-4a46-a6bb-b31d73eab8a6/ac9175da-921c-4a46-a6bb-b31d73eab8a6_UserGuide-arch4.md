# Assessing the potential risk of, and possible responses zoonotic diseases on the development of recreational use of British forests and wild-lands (Full title); also know as (Short title) to, users

- Multi-disciplinary RELU project (2007–2010) assessing how a zoonotic disease (Lyme borreliosis) could affect countryside recreation and how to communicate risks and manage responses.
- Focus on integrating biology, risk assessment, risk perception, and risk communication to inform land managers and health authorities.
- Study sites: Richmond Park (Greater London), New Forest (Southern England), Exmoor (South West England); three case-study settings spanning peri-urban, accessible lowland, and remote upland environments.

## Aims and Objectives (data-leader perspective)

- Understand how Lyme disease risk affects countryside use and how to respond appropriately without discouraging access.
- Develop and analyse risk scenarios, risk assessment methods, and communication strategies that reflect diverse audiences and site-specific contexts.
- Synthesize results into frameworks to guide organizational responses and risk communication, enabling co-ownership of data products among stakeholders.

## Methods and Data Assets (data-system view)

- Tick sampling and habitat mapping
  - Field work March 2008–December 2009, three-site design, 3–week intervals.
  - Tick collection by dragging a blanket and sampling via leggings; 32,371 ticks counted; larvae, nymphs, and adults recorded.
  - Six to seven plots per site across vegetation types; vegetation height, soil moisture, relative humidity, and temperature recorded.
  - Data stored as GIS-compatible habitat maps (ArcView) with extensive shapefiles for habitats and risk mapping.
- Tick ecology and modelling
  - Population model for Ixodes ricinus in R using a stage-structured approach; temperature-dependent development; scenarios driven by climate change, host (deer) density, and acaricide-treated hosts.
  - Habitat-specific risk maps derived from observed tick distributions.
- Infection prevalence
  - Infection prevalence of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. in nymphs (and adults) measured; overall ticks carried variable prevalence across sites (e.g., 2.8% in nymphs, higher in adults).
- Human use and exposure data
  - Visitor counts, preferred recreational activities, and path usage tracked; exposure varied by site and time.
- Data management and governance
  - Data sets prepared and archived; provided as an exemplar for ESRC data policy; linked to a project website and RELU outputs.

## Key Findings: Risk, Ecology, and Mapping

- Tick distribution and risk
  - Ticks found in far more habitats than commonly emphasized; high-resolution data enabled detailed risk maps showing contact zones between humans and ticks.
  - Highest tick densities consistently associated with trees; ticks present even in short grass near car parks; bracken habitats also important.
- Disease data and limits
  - Limited UK-wide data on Borrelia prevalence; infection prevalence in study sites within expected UK/European ranges.
- Human use patterns and exposure
  - Majority of visitors used paths; exposure to ticks highly site-dependent, with variations in visitor pressure and activity types across sites.
- Implications for management
  - Tick control in designated areas could reduce questing ticks but full eradication is not feasible; changing deer density has complex effects on tick populations.
  - Post-visit precautions emerge as the most robust preventative strategy; selective avoidance of tick habitats is unlikely to be effective.
- Risk maps and communication
  - Spatially explicit risk maps developed to target messaging; timing and seasonality of tick hazards varied by habitat and site.

## Risk Perception and Communication (stakeholder and user perspectives)

- Public and patient views
  - Avoidance or major behavior changes unlikely; preference for post-visit precautions; information about LB obtained from diverse sources, with internet among the most used.
  - Knowledge varied; desire for more consistent information across organizations.
- Staff and organizational perspectives
  - Countryside managers viewed LB as a minor hazard relative to others; emphasis on duty of care and protecting staff and visitors.
  - Call for clearer responsibilities and better coordination between health authorities and land managers; need for an authoritative knowledge base and cross-organizational links.
- Messages and information provision
  - Variation in content and delivery of information; mixed practices across organizations; need for tailored messaging for different audiences without alarmism.

## Scenario Analysis and Frameworks (planning for the future)

- Four storylines
  - Based on axes of land-use intensity and leisure patterns; explored across three sites.
  - Stage 1 basic scenarios; Stage 2 risk-communication developments (new disease or heightened media activity).
- Key insights
  - Scenarios highlighted the value of audience segmentation and place-specific communication.
  - Demonstrated potential tensions between local control and broader information campaigns during outbreaks or media scares.

## Integration for Risk Communication and Disease Management

- Conceptual frameworks
  - Framework 1: five broad organizational responses to disease incidence (targeted control, medical intervention, influencing behaviour, research and surveillance, lobbying/action).
  - Framework 2: guiding risk communication to influence behavior; time- and place-specific guidance.
- Practical implications
  - Results emphasize that managing zoonoses effectively requires more than information provision; behavior change demands cross-disciplinary approaches and collaboration between land managers and health professionals.
  - Need for an authoritative knowledge base and new organizational linkages to support coordinated risk communication and decision-making.

## Interdisciplinarity, Capacity Building, and Stakeholder Engagement

- Capacity building
  - Interdisciplinary days, training in data management and interdisciplinarity; linked PhD work; cross-disciplinary conferences.
- Stakeholder engagement
  - Regular involvement of Project Advisory Board (policy advisers, managers) and Project Practitioner Panel (land-based organizations); fieldwork shadowing to understand practical information flows.
- Outputs and uptake
  - Publications including two major conceptual framework papers (in press), RELU policy/practice note, and numerous articles in preparation.
  - Data management practices adopted as an exemplar; findings shared with Westminster/Holyrood discussions and health/public health networks.
  - Project website maintained for knowledge transfer and access to data and outputs.

## Data Governance, Limitations, and Challenges (archetype-aligned)

- Data limitations
  - Lack of accessible disease-incidence data limited some scenario projections; reliance on prospective instead of fully projective scenarios.
- Ethical and administrative hurdles
  - Recruitment of patients through Health Protection Agency and primary care networks faced extensive R&D and ethics approvals, delaying data collection.
- Resource and staffing challenges
  - Staffing changes and handover impacted integration and continuity; modest resource virements were needed to adapt to extension needs.
- Data integration opportunities
  - The project demonstrates the value of integrating ecological data (tick distribution) with social/behavioral data (risk perception, information needs) for a holistic data system.

## Future Research Priorities

- Pathways from diagnosis to incidence
  - Explore social/organizational processes between diagnosis and official incidence designations; GP awareness and help-seeking behaviours.
- Integrated monitoring
  - Develop co-ordinated monitoring of tick abundance, pathogen prevalence, and disease incidence across devolved regions.
- Model refinement
  - Further refine tick transmission models by integrating pathogen dynamics with host densities and environmental variables.
- Hotspot analysis
  - Examine the relationships between perceived hotspots, actual tick abundance, visitor numbers, and diagnostic processes; consider national-scale infection prevalence surveys.

## Implications for Data Leaders (summary for the archetype)

- Build and manage integrated data systems
  - Combine ecological data (tick distribution, habitat correlates) with human-use data (visitor patterns, risk perceptions) and policy data (communications, guidelines).
- Ensure data quality, discoverability, and standards
  - Maintain high-quality metadata, transparent sampling methods, and accessible data products (risk maps, datasets) for cross-sector use.
- Promote co-ownership and collaboration
  - Engage stakeholders across land management, health protection, and policy communities early; co-create data products and decision-support tools.
- Design data-driven, place-specific risk communication
  - Use site-specific risk maps and scenario-informed communications to tailor messages to diverse audiences without causing alarm or avoidance of the countryside.
- Advocate for authoritative knowledge bases and governance
  - Develop shared repositories of validated information, define responsibilities across organizations, and foster ongoing knowledge exchange between health and land-management sectors.
