# Assessing and Communicating Animal Disease Risks for Countryside Users, 2007-2010

- A multidisciplinary RELU project evaluating how zoonotic disease risks (Lyme borreliosis) affect countryside use and how to communicate and manage those risks.
- Case study sites: Richmond Park (Greater London), New Forest (Southern England), Exmoor (South West England) to cover peri-urban, lowland, and upland settings.
- Core aim: understand disease dynamics, risk perception, and effective risk communication to sustain healthy countryside use.

## Aims and Objectives

- Assess the potential impact of Lyme borreliosis (LB) on countryside use and propose appropriate responses.
- Understand awareness, preventative knowledge, and actions of stakeholders (public, workforce, land managers, disease sufferers) via risk-perception work packages.
- Develop and analyse scenarios to gauge likelihood of increased LB due to environmental changes and contact opportunities; model tick abundance.
- Develop risk assessment methods that account for stakeholder interests; evaluate management and communication strategies for acceptability, efficacy, and practicality.
- Propose a communication strategy targeted to distinct audiences to enable proportionate information exchange and precautionary behavior.

## Background and Rationale

- The UK countryside is a valued space for recreation; policies aim to enhance access while accounting for hazards.
- LB is a tick-borne disease with rising incidence; ticks (Ixodes ricinus) host to various animals and humans.
- Prior approaches often treated environmental risk as low; this project emphasizes integrated, precautionary, and responsive management, not avoidance of outdoor activity.
- Aims to provide a robust basis for policy decisions using explicit data on risk, perception, and communication.

## Methods and Integration

- Three interlinked work packages: risk assessment (biology and ecology of ticks), risk perception (public, staff, patients), and scenario analysis (future land use and communication).
- Integration achieved through two conceptual frameworks:
  - Framework for organisational responses to disease incidence (with emphasis on influencing behaviour).
  - Framework for tailoring risk communication in time and place using biological knowledge.
- Stakeholder engagement via Project Advisory Board (PAB) and Project Practitioner Panel (PrP) with land-based organisations to guide interpretation and applicability.

## Tick Sampling and Ecological Modelling

- Field work at three sites March 2008–December 2009, with three-weekly sampling across multiple plots per site.
- Tick collection via: dragging a white wool blanket over vegetation and sampling leggings worn by researchers; used multiple sampling transects per plot.
- Total ticks counted: 32,371 (excluding larvae on leggings); data collected on vegetation height, soil moisture, humidity, and temperature.
- Tick population model (R language) linked to habitat, host densities (deer, other hosts), and climate variables; explored impacts of climate change, host density changes, and acaricide-treated hosts.
- Findings:
  - Ticks present in a broader range of habitats than commonly assumed; higher densities in tree-present plots; bracken habitats also supported high tick presence in summer.
  - Infection prevalence in nymphal ticks: 2.8% (ranges by site in adults higher).
  - Tick dynamics sensitive to temperature, host densities, and control measures; preventative post-visit precautions are more feasible than try to eradicate ticks.

## Risk Assessment Findings

- High-resolution maps produced showing seasonal and site-specific tick hazards; risk varies by habitat and visitor activity.
- Contact zones between humans and questing ticks identified; maps informed targeted risk communication.
- Data reveal that maintaining access while reducing risk requires emphasis on post-visit precautions and environmental management strategies rather than habitat avoidance.

## Risk Perception and Communication

- General public and LB patients tended not to avoid countryside use; preference for post-visit precautions rather than during-visit measures.
- Information sources for LB varied widely; stakeholders desired more consistency and coordination across organisations.
- Staff perspectives showed a duty of care balanced with perceptions of LB as a relatively minor hazard; staff sought more knowledge about timing of transmission and liability considerations.
- Visitors and residents viewed LB risk through the lens of countryside use and restorative benefits; precautionary measures perceived as intrusive when during-visit activities were involved.
- Organizational communications lacked a single authoritative source; calls for coordinated guidance among land managers, health authorities, and wildlife agencies.

## Scenario Analysis and Interventions

- Four storylines developed around land-use intensity and leisure patterns for two case sites; additional scenarios addressed a hypothetical new disease outbreak and intense media attention.
- Findings highlighted:
  - Variation in audience knowledge and preparedness across sites.
  - Local vs national information efforts interact in complex ways during outbreaks.
  - Opportunities for audience segmentation and place-specific communications.
  - Managers emphasized need for clearer information ownership and responsibilities.

## Integration for Risk Communication and Disease Management

- Four conceptual frameworks identify organizational responses to LB and how to influence visitor behavior.
- A second framework provides cues to tailor risk communication to time and place using biological understanding.
- Key implication: effective response to zoonotic diseases centers on influencing behavior, not just information provision; requires cross-disciplinary collaboration between land managers and health professionals; development of an authoritative knowledge base and new organizational linkages.

## Capacity-Building, Training, and Knowledge Transfer

- Built interdisciplinary capacity via interdisciplinary days, training, linked PhD work, and cross-disciplinary conference participation.
- Engagement with decision-makers through Practitioner and Advisory Boards; work shadowing across organizations to improve risk communication approaches.
- Outputs include joint publications, policy/practice notes, and data management exemplars for ESRC data policy.

## Outputs, Data, and Knowledge Dissemination

- Outputs include two major conceptual frameworks (risk communication and behavioural influence) and multiple publications in preparation or in press.
- Data sets archived for future use; project website maintained; RELU policy/practice brief published; dissemination to Westminster/Holyrood via meetings and newsletters.
- Nominated outputs:
  - Academic: Frameworks for risk communication and disease management (in press, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B).
  - Stakeholder: Protecting countryside users against zoonotic diseases: the scope for influencing behaviour? (in press, RELU policy note).

## Knowledge Exchange and Impacts

- Stakeholder engagement informed policy and practice discussions; tools developed to aid decision-making in disease risk management.
- Some follow-on funding bids to turn frameworks into practical decision tools for stakeholders, with potential adoption by health authorities and land managers.
- Opportunities identified for integrating health protection and land-management knowledge bases to guide risk communication and precautionary actions.

## Nominated Outputs and Data Management

- Nominated academic assessor and user assessor identified for independent review.
- Data management and sharing practices highlighted as exemplary within the ESRC policy framework.

## Challenges and Difficulties

- Data acquisition obstacles: Ethics approvals and R&D approvals caused delays and extended data collection windows; HPA data on disease incidence not made available, limiting scenario accuracy.
- Personnel changes and staff turnover impacted integrative activities and project progression.
- Moderate budget virements were needed due to handover delays and project extension; some administrative challenges noted.

## Future Research Priorities

- Examine social and organizational processes from diagnosis to official incidence designations (including GP awareness and help-seeking behavior).
- Develop integrated monitoring for tick abundance, infection prevalence, and disease incidence across devolved regions.
- Refine tick transmission models to couple pathogen transmission with host densities and habitat dynamics.
- Investigate the concept of “hotspots” for ticks vs. hotspots for human use and disease reporting; pursue broader surveillance data.

## Key Takeaways for Environmental Analysts

- Longitudinal, data-driven approaches linking ecology, human behaviour, and communication are essential to manage zoonotic disease risks without unduly restricting countryside use.
- High-resolution field data (tick distribution by habitat, seasonality, host densities) paired with scenario analysis and stakeholder input informs robust risk maps and tailored communications.
- Effective risk management rests on coordinated information across health authorities and land managers, plus adaptive strategies that emphasize precautionary actions and post-visit safeguards.
- Interdisciplinary collaboration yields actionable frameworks for influencing behaviour and for delivering place- and time-specific risk information to diverse audiences.
