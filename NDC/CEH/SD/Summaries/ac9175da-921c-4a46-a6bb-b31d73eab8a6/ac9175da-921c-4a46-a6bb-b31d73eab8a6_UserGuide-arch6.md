# Assessing and Communicating Animal Disease Risks for Countryside Users, 2007-2010 USER GUIDE

- Focus: Interdisciplinary study of zoonotic disease (Lyme borreliosis) risks to countryside users and how to assess and communicate those risks.
- Studied in three UK sites representing different countryside contexts: Richmond Park (Greater London), New Forest (Southern England), and Exmoor (South West England).
- Integrated three core strands: risk assessment (biological), risk perception/communication (social), and scenario analysis (practical management).

## Data Collection and Management

- Field data collection (March 2008–December 2009) across 6–7 plots per site; total ticks counted: 32,371.
- Tick sampling methods:
  - Drag sampling with a white wool blanket across vegetation.
  - Simultaneous sampling with leggings and Velcro-attached sampling patches to ground level.
  - Life stages recorded: larvae (L), nymphs (N), adult males (AM), adult females (AF).
- Site- and habitat-level data collected alongside ticks:
  - Vegetation height, soil moisture, relative humidity, and ground-level/near-surface temperature.
  - Vegetation types converted to ArcView landcover maps and GIS shapefiles.
- Infection prevalence in ticks (UK context): Borrelia burgdorferi s.l. detected with 2.8% (nymphs) and 5.9% (adults) prevalence across sites; data limited to tick infection prevalence, not human disease incidence.
- Data management and archiving:
  - Large data sets and GIS maps prepared; datasets lodged for archiving.
  - An exemplar of data management adopted to support ESRC data policy plans.
- Data limitations:
  - No readily available disease-incidence data for the study area; reliance on prospective/scenario-based projections.
  - Delays and administrative burden in obtaining R&D approvals; ethical approvals required for patient recruitment.
  - Staff changes and turnover affected integration and progress timelines.

## Tick Ecology Modelling and Risk Mapping

- Tick population modelling:
  - Implemented in R using a stage-structured (Leslie matrix) framework with temperature-dependent development and other biological processes.
  - Scenarios explored: climate change shifts, host (deer/other large hosts) density changes, and acaricide-treated hosts.
  - Key findings:
    - Earlier spring questing with warming temperatures increases contact with humans.
    - Deer density increases can raise tick populations; effects depend on initial host densities.
    - Reducing tick abundance locally may be possible by host management and acaricide treatment, but complete eradication is not feasible.
- Risk mapping:
  - Produced high-resolution risk maps showing spatial and seasonal variation in tick hazard.
  - Found ticks in a broad range of habitats, including near car parks, with higher densities in wooded areas.
  - Maps used to identify potential high-contact zones to tailor risk communication.

## Risk Perception, Communication, and Behavioral Responses

- Study populations:
  - Lyme disease patients diagnosed during the study.
  - Countryside visitors and residents across case sites.
  - FC staff and forest managers involved in risk communication.
- Key insights:
  - Neither patients nor typical countryside users generally avoided the countryside; post-visit precautions were more acceptable than during-visit precautions.
  - Information sources varied widely; there was a push for more consistent messaging across organisations.
  - Post-visit precautions were preferred, aligning with delayed bacterial transfer from tick bite to humans.
  - Awareness and knowledge of Lyme disease were highest in Exmoor; attachment to countryside influenced risk interpretation.
  - Precautions linked to familiar insect-bite prevention were more acceptable; some precautions were perceived as intrusive and counter to the countryside experience.
- Organisational perspectives:
  - Managers distinguished between man-made and natural hazards; perceived responsibility for communicating natural hazards like Lyme was relatively low.
  - There was a desire for a more coordinated, authoritative knowledge base and clearer responsibility for risk communication across health authorities and land managers.
  - Variation existed in how information was provided to staff and the public; lack of consistent approach and coordination noted.

## Scenario Analysis and Integrated Frameworks

- Scenario development approach:
  - Inductive/deductive process conducted with land-managing organisations’ perspectives.
  - Four storylines organized around axes of land-use intensity and leisure patterns, projected over 20 years.
  - Stakeholders discussed potential actions to achieve more desirable futures; included considerations of a real outbreak vs. media-driven risk perception.
- Key outputs:
  - Identification of the need for audience segmentation and place-specific communication strategies.
  - Recognition of challenges in local control during disease outbreaks and potential conflicts between access/freedom and risk reduction.
- Integration outcomes:
  - Development of two conceptual frameworks to guide risk communication and disease management:
    1) An organizational response framework outlining five broad categories: targeted hazard control, medical intervention, influencing behavior, surveillance/research, and policy/action lobbying.
    2) A behavioral-influence framework focusing on how to tailor risk communication to specific times and places, grounded in biological understanding.
  - Frameworks intended to inform policy and practice; proposed for refinement and broader application to other zoonoses.

## Data-Driven Outputs, Knowledge Transfer, and Impacts

- Outputs and dissemination:
  - More than 40 outputs including journal articles, RELU policy/practice notes, conference papers, and a project website.
  - Two nominated outputs:

  - Data sets and metadata prepared for archiving; data management practices highlighted as exemplary for ESRC data policy.
- Knowledge transfer and engagement:
  - Active engagement with Project Advisory Board and Project Practitioner Panel (20+ land-based organisations).
  - Relationships with Defra health staff and RELU risk workshops; presentations to Westminster/Holyrood officials.
  - A project website maintained for ongoing access to resources and findings.
- Capacity-building:
  - Interdisciplinary days and joint workshops to foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.
  - Training in data management, interdisciplinarity, and mixed-methods approaches; success in publishing and presenting integrative research.
  - Mixed team composition (universities and public sector research institutes) facilitated knowledge exchange and applied impact.

## Data Availability, Challenges, and Learnings

- Major difficulties:
  - Data access constraints: reliance on HPA and GP networks for patient recruitment caused delays; permissions across many PCTs created bottlenecks.
  - Data availability gaps: lack of accessible human disease-incidence data limited scenario realism and geographic risk analysis.
  - Personnel changes: RA departures affected early integration and progression.
- Lessons for data support:
  - Demonstrated value of rigorous data management plans, open data archiving, and clear documentation for future policy/research use.
  - Need for integrated data-sharing agreements among health authorities, land managers, and researchers to support timely, robust risk assessments.

## Future Research Priorities and Next Steps

- Monitoring and data integration:
  - Develop coordinated monitoring of tick abundance, infection prevalence, and disease incidence across devolved regions.
- Tick modelling enhancements:
  - Refine pathogen transmission integration to better simulate disease risk under varying host densities and environmental conditions.
- Hotspots and public perception:
  - Systematic survey of infection prevalence in ticks nationwide; investigation of the hotspot concept versus human-use hotspots.
- Policy and practice evolution:
  - Develop decision-support tools and knowledge bases in partnership with health authorities and land managers.
  - Explore follow-on funding to translate frameworks into practical decision tools for stakeholders.
