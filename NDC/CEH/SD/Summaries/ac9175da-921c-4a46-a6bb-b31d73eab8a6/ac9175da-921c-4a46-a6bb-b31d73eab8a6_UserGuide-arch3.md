# Assessing and Communicating Animal Disease Risks for Countryside Users, 2007-2010

## Overview
- Aim: Investigate the potential impact of Lyme borreliosis (LB) on countryside use and develop appropriate responses; integrate risk assessment, risk perception, scenario analysis, and risk communication.
- Setting: United Kingdom forests and wild-lands; aims to inform policy and practice for land managers, health authorities, and recreation stakeholders.
- Approach: Interdisciplinary project combining biology, psychology, sociology, anthropology; engagement through Project Advisory Board (PAB) and Project Practitioner Panel (PrP).

## Monitoring Frameworks and Data Governance
- Core components:
  - Risk assessment (tick ecology, abundance, infection prevalence; case study sites).
  - Risk perception and communication (public, patients, forestry staff; interviews, questionnaires, focus groups).
  - Scenario analysis (future land use, visitor patterns, and risk communication).
  - Integration into two conceptual frameworks: organisational responses to disease incidence; risk communication tailored to time and place.
- Data and data governance:
  - Tick sampling produced high-resolution data across three sites; infection prevalence noted (2.8–5.9% in nymphs/adults at sites).
  - Field data (tick counts, life stage, habitat) used to build risk maps and inform communication.
  - Data management standards established; archiving of datasets; data sharing across organisations encouraged but constrained by governance and data availability.
  - Challenges: lack of disease incidence data; limited access to some health data from HPA; ethical and R&D approvals caused delays; data gaps affected scenario development.

## Stakeholder Engagement and Outputs
- Governance bodies:
  - Project Advisory Board (PAB): health protection, wildlife health, visitor management, land management perspectives.
  - Project Practitioner Panel (PrP): representation from land-based organisations (public, private, third sector).
- Outputs and dissemination:
  - Development of two integrated conceptual frameworks; publication in peer-reviewed outlets (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B) and RELU policy/practice notes.
  - Data sets archived; project website maintained; findings presented to Westminster/Holyrood; RELU risk workshop involvement.
  - Planned further dissemination: at RELU and academic venues; follow-on funding proposals with Health Protection Scotland and The Royal Parks.

## Findings by Theme
- Tick ecology and risk mapping:
  - Ticks found in a broader range of habitats than typical risk communications emphasize.
  - Tick abundance influenced by habitat, season, and host density (notably deer); higher densities in wooded areas.
  - Risk maps show seasonal variation; potential for targeted communication based on site- and habitat-specific risk.
- Disease incidence and transmission:
  - Limited information on infection prevalence in UK ticks; infection prevalence observed within UK ranges elsewhere.
  - Modeling indicates climate and host density shifts can alter questing tick abundance and thus exposure risk.
- Risk perception and communication:
  - Most LB patients and countryside users did not view countryside avoidance as appropriate; preference for post-visit precautions.
  - Information sources varied; demand for consistency across organisations; staff often felt uncertain communicating LB risks.
  - Visitors’ attachment to the countryside and restorative values influenced receptivity to precautionary measures.
- Scenarios and planning:
  - Four storylines developed to explore future land use and communication dynamics across sites.
  - Scenarios highlighted audience segmentation, place-specific messaging, and the possibility of local versus national control dynamics.
- Integration for risk communication and disease management:
  - Frameworks propose organisational responses (targeted control, medical intervention, influencing behaviour, surveillance, lobbying) and risk-communication strategies aligned with time/place.
  - Lack of credible disease incidence data challenges prioritisation and response planning; emphasizes need for authoritative knowledge bases and cross-sector collaboration.

## Capacity-Building and Training
- Built interdisciplinary capability through:
  - Interdisciplinary days and writing teams; joint workshops; cross-training between social and natural sciences.
  - Training through RELU resources; exposure to scenario analysis, communications, and methodological integration.
  - External conferences and collaborative outputs to promote interdisciplinary uptake.
- Engagement with decision-makers and practitioners:
  - Active participation of PrP and PAB; work shadowing to understand regional information flow and governance.

## Outputs and Data
- Outputs:
  - Two main conceptual frameworks for risk response and risk communication.
  - RELU policy and practice note; articles in preparation; dedicated project website.
  - Data management exemplar aligned with ESRC data policy.
- Nominated outputs:
  - Academic output: Frameworks for risk communication and disease management (in press).
  - Stakeholder output: Protecting countryside users against zoonotic diseases: the scope for influencing behaviour? (in press).
- Data and tools:
  - Tick sampling datasets, habitat/geospatial data, and risk maps generated; ArcView GIS resources and associated shapefiles provided.

## Data and Methods (Tick Sampling)
- Study sites: Wilverley Plain (New Forest), Richmond Park (Greater London), Webber’s Post (Exmoor).
- Sampling protocol: Tick dragging and leg sampling from vegetation; repeated transects; three-week intervals (Mar 2008–Dec 2009).
- Measurements: Vegetation height, soil moisture, relative humidity, ground-level and near-ground temperature; habitat mapping through ArcView.
- Outputs: Life-stage counts (larvae, nymphs, adults); habitat-based abundance data; infection prevalence estimates; risk-map generation.

## Challenges and Lessons
- Data availability and governance:
  - Difficulty obtaining early disease incidence data; ethical approvals and data-sharing barriers slowed progress.
  - Staff changes and project extension affected integration and timely dissemination.
- Benefits of interdisciplinarity:
  - Cross-disciplinary collaboration enriched understanding and policy relevance; challenges included funding alignment and follow-on support.

## Future Research Priorities
- Deeper exploration of the diagnosis-to-incidence pathway, including GP awareness and help-seeking behaviors.
- Integrated monitoring across devolved nations for tick abundance, infection prevalence, and disease incidence.
- Refinement of tick transmission modeling to couple host densities with pathogen dynamics.
- Systematic nationwide assessment of infection prevalence in ticks and broader risk landscapes.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks (Authors of Monitoring Frameworks Perspective)
- Emphasize proportionate, behavior-influencing risk management over solely information provision.
- Develop frameworks that integrate biology, risk communication, and audience segmentation to tailor time- and place-based messaging.
- Advocate for authoritative knowledge bases and cross-sector organizational links between health authorities and land managers.
- Highlight data governance, sharing, and quality standards; address metadata gaps and data accessibility barriers.
- Promote co-produced monitoring approaches with engaged stakeholders to inform policy and practice.

## Concluding Outlook
- The project demonstrates how integrated monitoring of vector-borne disease risks can inform policy by combining ecological risk assessment with perceptions, behaviors, and communication strategies.
- The proposed frameworks offer a basis for more responsive, evidence-based risk management and stakeholder engagement in zoonotic disease contexts.
