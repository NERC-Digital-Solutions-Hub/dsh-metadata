# Assessing and communicating animal disease risks for countryside

- Purpose: Investigate potential risk of Lyme borreliosis (LB) to countryside use and develop map-based risk communication and management strategies.
- Scope: Interdisciplinary study across three UK sites (Richmond Park, New Forest, Exmoor) to link tick ecology, human use of the countryside, risk perception, and information exchange.

## GIS Data and Methods

- Field sampling design:
  - Three sites with 6–7 plots per site; data collected March 2008–Dec 2009.
  - Tick collection via dragging a white wool blanket and sampling with leggings; life stages recorded (larvae, nymphs, adults).
  - Vegetation types converted to land-cover data for GIS use.
- GIS outputs and formats:
  - ArcView map documents and ArcView shapefiles representing habitat types and tick counts.
  - Detailed habitat-related GIS layers (e.g., deciduous/coniferous woods, bracken, grasses, roads, built-up areas) and image/backdrops.
  - Ground-truth attributes linked to plots and vegetation types; maps linked to tick abundance data.
- Spatial analysis focus:
  - Relationship between tick abundance, habitat type, and human activity.
  - Development of site-specific risk maps (seasonal tick hazards) and high-resolution risk quantification.
- Data management:
  - Large, multi-format datasets (DBF, SHP, SHX, etc.) organized per site and habitat class.
  - Metadata and structure prepared to support archiving and future reuse.

## Spatial Analysis and Outputs

- Tick distribution findings:
  - Ticks found across a wide range of habitats; highest densities typically in wooded plots.
  - Tick presence even in short grass near car parks; bracken-dominated habitats also notable.
- Risk mapping:
  - Production of high-resolution risk maps showing seasonal patterns of tick hazard (example figures referenced).
  - Maps used to identify zones of highest human-tick contact to inform targeted risk communication.
- Infection prevalence:
  - In UK ticks sampled, LB prevalence for nymphs ~2.8% (adult ticks higher); data indicate risk varies spatially and temporally.

## Modelling and Projections

- Tick population modelling (R):
  - Developed a stage-structured model (Leslie-matrix based) to simulate tick life stages (larva, nymph, adult) with temperature-dependent development.
  - Explored impacts of climate change, deer density, and acaricide-treated hosts on questing-tick abundance.
  - Model outputs used to project potential risk under different environmental and host scenarios.
- Relationships to risk communication:
  - Modelling informed understanding of where and when risk increases, guiding spatially explicit communication strategies.

## Risk Perception and Communication Frameworks

- Integrated approach across three work packages (risk assessment, risk perception, scenario analysis).
- Conceptual frameworks:
  - Framework for organisational responses to disease incidence (e.g., targeted control, medical intervention, influencing behaviour).
  - Framework for tailoring risk communication to time and place using biological knowledge.
- Stakeholder engagement:
  - Involvement of Project Advisory Board (policy/practice) and Project Practitioner Panel (land-based organisations) to test practicality and messaging.
- Messaging implications:
  - Preference for post-visit precautions among visitors and LB patients; in-visit precautions viewed as intrusive by some.
  - Demand for consistent information across organisations; lack of an authoritative, central information source.

## Data Availability and Limitations

- Data gaps:
  - Expectation of disease-incidence data (HPA) not provided; constrained scenario development.
  - R&D/ethics processes and multi-PCT approvals caused delays and extended data collection timelines.
- Data integration challenges:
  - Data held in multiple locations; heterogeneous formats complicated rapid integration.
  - Some changes in personnel affected continuity and integration efforts.

## Capacity Building and Outcomes

- Interdisciplinary capacity-building:
  - Regular interdisciplinary days; training in data management and methods; linked PhD integration.
  - Enhanced collaboration across universities, public research institutes, and policy/practice partners.
- Knowledge transfer and outputs:
  - Publication of two conceptual frameworks in a high-profile journal (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B).
  - RELU policy/practice note on influencing behaviour; project website and data archiving as exemplars.
  - Presentations to Westminster/Holyrood and RELU stakeholder events; practice notes for land managers and health authorities.
- Data and software assets:
  - Substantial GIS dataset with habitat layers, risk maps, and tick sampling results archived for reuse.

## Implications for GIS Practice

- Demonstrates value of integrating field ecology with GIS to create targeted, map-based risk products for diverse audiences (policy colleagues, land managers, public).
- Highlights importance of high-resolution habitat mapping, temporal risk mapping, and scenario-based spatial planning for risk communication.
- Emphasizes need for standardized, credible data sources and centralized information to support consistent mapping and messaging.

## Nominated Outputs and Dissemination
