# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

## Overview
- Aimed at guiding researchers to collect relevant, systematic, and clearly managed data from case study interviews.
- Produces one English transcript (RTF) per interviewee and one Flood Impact Matrix (CSV) per interviewee.
- Includes accompanying templates and instructions: Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, Harvest_matrix_tool.csv.

## Data Collection Components
- Translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews resulting in one English transcript per interviewee (RTF).
- Flood Impact Matrix completed by each interviewee (one CSV per interviewee).
- Templates provided to support completion: Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, Harvest_matrix_tool.csv.

## Field Preparation (Pre-field Day)
- Personal equipment: notebook, pens (5 spares), fully charged recording device with adequate storage.
- Documentation: hard copies of participant information sheets, interview questions (farmers and district officers), Flood Impact Matrix (with spares).
- Administrative tools: anon number spreadsheet for participant numbering, clipboards, a file to file all completed questionnaires.

## Health and Safety
- Adherence to ECOTRUST Covid-19 standard operating procedures.
- Prioritise safety; halt data collection if anyone feels unsafe. Seek guidance from designated contact (Jonah).

## Ethics, Introduction, and Consent
- Group introduction with clarity on project purpose, activities, expectations, confidentiality, withdrawal, access to information, and potential photographs.
- Obtain verbal consent for participation and data usage; provide information sheets for reference.

## Interview Conduct
- Sample: 16 community members total.
  - 8 farmers who participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline assessments (balanced gender: 4M/4F).
  - 8 farmers who did not participate in the above activities (balanced gender: 4M/4F).
- Individual interviews only; not group responses.
- Flood Impact Matrix completed during the interview; not audio-recorded.

## Practicalities
- Ensure privacy: interviewee alone, in a quiet, sheltered location to ensure free speech and clear audio.
- Time management: strive to adhere to allocated interview duration.
- Recording quality: regularly verify recording is ongoing; explain monitoring during sessions.
- At the start of every recording: document the interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number.

## Using the Tool Effectively
- Interviewer notes: capture notable statements, interruptions, disturbances, and observations with clear labeling (interviewee name and date).
- District officer interviews: must be audio recorded; hands-on recording checks and centralized labeling of audio files.
- Probing: use prompts to elicit detailed responses (e.g., “Could you tell me about X?”, “Please explain Y”, “Why do you think this?”).
- Flood Impact Matrix: completed with interviewee; ideally filled by the interviewee with interviewer support to ensure understanding.
- Additional questions: allowed when relevant, focusing on gender, difficulties, and adaptation strategies.

## File Management and Transcription
- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Transcriptions: each interview saved as a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
- Transcript header (at start): Date, Location, Interviewer, Interviewee name, Interviewee sex, Interviewee anon number, Interview length.

## Transcribing Guidelines (Quality and Consistency)
- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what is spoken; do not omit unclear phrases.
- Language: translate and transcribe into proper English; use standard capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
- Do Not Paraphrase: preserve original wording; do not restructure or edit for grammar.
- Do Not Add Information: refrain from including extra data (names, titles) in the transcript; add in separate fields if needed.
- Clean Up Non-Verbatim Speech: lightly edit fillers (um, er, etc.) and stutters unless they carry meaning.
- Indicate Interruptions: note any sound events that interrupt dialogue within the transcript.
- Trailing Off: use ellipses to indicate unfinished thoughts.
- Example formatting is provided to guide consistent transcription.
