# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose: Provide clear, systematic guidelines for collecting translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews, producing one English transcript per interviewee (RTF), and one complete Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee.
- Outputs and accompanying materials:
  - Transcripts: one per interviewee (RTF/Word, English translation)
  - Flood Impact Matrix: one completed CSV per interviewee
  - Supporting files: Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, Harvest_matrix_tool.csv

## 1. Pre field day kit checklist for each interviewee
- Notebook and pens (5 spare)
- Fully charged recording device with sufficient storage
- Hard copies of participant information sheets for planned interviewees
- Hard copies of interview questions for interviewers
- Hard copies of the Flood Impact Matrix (enough for all interviewees + 2 spares)
- Anonymous number spreadsheet to track interviewee numbers
- Clipboards and a file to store completed questionnaires

## 2. Covid-19 rules
- Follow ECOTRUST Covid-19 standard operating procedures
- Prioritize health and safety; stop data collection if at risk
- Contact Jonah if concerns arise

## 3. Group Introduction and Ethics Overview
- Introduce the project, purpose, expectations (input, duration, recording)
- Explain confidentiality, withdrawal options, and where to get more information
- Provide info sheets and obtain verbal consent for photographs

## 4. Conducting the interviews
- Sampling: 16 community members total
  - 8 farmers who participated in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female)
  - 8 farmers who did not participate in the above activities (4 male, 4 female)
- Interviews are individual, not group responses
- All interviewees complete the Flood Impact Matrix

### 4.1 Practicalities
- Ensure interviewee is alone and in a quiet, safe location
- Manage time to fit within allocated duration
- Regularly verify that recording is active
- Start recordings with interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number for filing

### 4.2 Using the tool effectively
- Interviewer notes: capture interesting points, interruptions, disturbances
- Farmer district officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure files are saved, labeled, and centralized
- Use open prompts to explore topics (e.g., gender, difficulties, adaptation strategies)
- Flood Impact Matrix is not audio recorded; interviewee completes the matrix with interviewer support

## 5.1 File management
- Audio file naming format: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118)
- Each interview transcript stored as a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork
- Transcripts must start with a header including:
  - Date of interview
  - Location
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

## 5.2 Transcribing guidelines
- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what was spoken; do not paraphrase
- Language: translate and transcribe into proper English; correct capitalization, punctuation, and spelling without altering meaning
- Do not add information (no extra page numbers, job numbers, titles, or comments)
- Clean up non-essential speech (remove fillers like um, er, stutters) while preserving meaning
- Indicate interruptions or sound events whenever they occur
- If a speaker trails off, use ellipses to show unfinished thoughts
- For completeness, ensure all questions are answered; use prompts to elicit richer responses
