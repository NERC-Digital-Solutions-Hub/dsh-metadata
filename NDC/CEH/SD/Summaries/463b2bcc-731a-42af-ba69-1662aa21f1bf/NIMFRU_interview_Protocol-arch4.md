- Results include one English transcript per interviewee (RTF) and one Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee.
- Accompanying materials include Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, and Harvest_matrix_tool.csv.

## Data collection instruments
- Flood Impact Matrix: completed per interviewee (CSV).
- Flood Matrix Instructions: guidance for completing the Flood Impact Matrix.
- Harvest Matrix Tool: additional data collection template (CSV).

## Fieldwork preparation
- Pre-field day kit includes: notebook, spare pens, fully charged recorder with space available, hard copies of participant information sheets, interview guides, Flood Impact Matrix copies, anon number spreadsheet, clipboards, and a file for completed questionnaires.

## Health, safety, and ethics
- Adherence to Ecotrust Covid-19 SOPs; safety prioritized; pause data collection if at risk; contact designated person (Jonah) with concerns.
- Group introductions cover project purpose, activities, expectations, confidentiality, withdrawal rights, and information resources; verbal consent for photos may be obtained.

## Interview design and sampling
- Farmer interviews conducted individually (not as group responses).
- Sample includes 16 community farmers: 8 with prior participation in listening groups/FAMVAC/IHM/HEA baseline (4 male, 4 female) and 8 without prior participation (4 male, 4 female).

## Practical interview conduct
- Ensure privacy and minimal noise/interruptions; conduct in a comfortable, safe setting.
- Time management; approximately one hour per interview; regular checks that recording is functioning.
- At the start of each recording, state the interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number for proper filing.

## Data collection process and quality
- Interviewers take notes on important points, interruptions, and observations; label notes with interviewee name and date.
- Audio recording for farmer district officer interviews; ensure files are saved centrally and labeled.
- Interviewers must ask all listed questions and also probe further on topics like gender, difficulties, and adaptation strategies to elicit detailed responses.

## Flood Impact Matrix administration
- Flood Impact Matrix is completed verbally with the interviewee; ideally by the interviewee, with active interviewer support to ensure comprehension.
- The Flood Impact Matrix completion is not audio recorded.

## File management and documentation
- Audio file naming convention: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Each interview is transcribed into a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
- Transcription header at start of each file should include: date, location, interviewer name, interviewee name, interviewee sex, interviewee anon number, and interview length.

## Transcribing guidelines
- Each speaker begins a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what is spoken; do not paraphrase or correct grammar.
- Language: transcripts must be translated and transcribed into English with proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
- Do Not Paraphrase; Do Not Add Information: do not insert page numbers, job numbers, titles, or comments.
- Clean up non-verbatim content: lightly edit fillers and stutters (e.g., um, er) but preserve meaning.
- Indicate interruptions or sound events as they occur.
- If a speaker trails off, use ellipses to indicate unfinished thoughts.
