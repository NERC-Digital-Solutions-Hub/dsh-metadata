# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

## Overview
- Aimed at ensuring data collected from case study interviews is relevant, systematic, and well-managed.
- Produces one English transcript (RTF) per interviewee and one complete Flood Impact Matrix (CSV) per interviewee.
- Accompanying templates and instructions are provided to standardize data collection and ensure traceability.

## Outputs and Templates
- Flood Impact Matrix: per interviewee (CSV).
- Templates and instructions:
  - Flood_matrix_instructions.csv
  - Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv
  - Harvest_matrix_tool.csv

## Pre-field day preparation
- Pack a field kit including:
  - Notebook, spare pens, fully charged recording device with space
  - Hard copies of participant information sheets
  - Hard copies of interview questions for farmers and district officers
  - Flood Impact Matrix copies (enough for all interviewees + 2 spare)
  - Anon number spreadsheet for participant numbering
  - Clipboards and a filing system for completed questionnaires

## Covid-19 safety
- ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs must be followed.
- Prioritize health and safety; if unsafe, discontinue; contact Jonah with concerns.

## Ethics, consent, and introductions
- Begin with group introductions and an ethics overview:
  - Project purpose, interview purpose, duration, recording, confidentiality, withdrawal, further information, and potential photographs.
  - Verbal consent for photography.

## Interview conduct and sampling
- Farmer interviews: 16 community members total.
  - 8 farmers from existing groups (list includes 4 males, 4 females)
  - 8 farmers not previously participating (4 males, 4 females)
- Each interviewee completes the Flood Impact Matrix.
- Tools are for individual interviews only (not group responses).

## Practicalities during interviews
- Location and privacy: interviewee alone and away from others; minimize wind/noise; ensure comfort and writing surfaces.
- Time management: aim to adhere to allocated time (e.g., one hour).
- Recording reliability: regularly check that recording is active; inform interviewees that checks will occur.
- Identification: state interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number at the start of every recording.

## Using the interview tools
- Interview notes: capture important points, interruptions, disturbances; label notes with interviewee name and date.
- Audio requirements: farmer district officer interviews must be audio recorded; check recordings regularly and label files centrally.
- Interview technique: ask all listed questions, but also probe for deeper information on topics like gender, difficulties, and adaptation strategies.
- Flood Impact Matrix: not audio recorded; interviewer guides the interviewee through the questions and records responses in the matrix with active support to ensure understanding.

## Data and file management
- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Transcripts: each interview transcribed into a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
- Transcript header information (at the start of each file):
  - Date of interview
  - Location of interview
  - Interviewer name
  - Interviewee name
  - Interviewee sex
  - Interviewee anon number
  - Interview length

## Transcribing guidelines
- Formatting: every speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what was spoken; do not paraphrase.
- Language: transcripts must be translated and transcribed into English with proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
- No additions: do not add job titles, numbers, or comments; additional information to be added in separate fields.
- Cleaning: lightly edit non-verbatim filler (e.g., um, er) but keep meaning intact.
- Sound events: note any interruptions or events that affect the dialogue.
- Interview structure: prompt for full responses (open-ended questions) rather than Yes/No answers.
- Ellipses: use to indicate trailing off when a speaker does not finish a thought.
- Do not omit or alter content based on assumed meaning.

## Additional notes
- Transcripts are to be translated and transcribed into English as part of standard procedure.
- Thorough documentation and metadata are required to enable later data analysis and cross-interview comparability.
