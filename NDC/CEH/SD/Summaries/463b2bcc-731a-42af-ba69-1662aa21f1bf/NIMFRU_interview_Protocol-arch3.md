# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides clear guidelines to ensure data collected from case study interviews is relevant, systematic, and methodically managed, resulting in one English transcript per interviewee and associated data outputs (e.g., Flood Impact Matrix per interviewee).

- Data collection tools and accompanying materials
  - Semi-structured translated interviews (English transcripts post-translation).
  - Flood Impact Matrix completed per interviewee (one CSV per interviewee).
  - Accompanying files:
    - Flood_matrix_instructions.csv (how-to)
    - Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv (matrix template)
    - Harvest_matrix_tool.csv (Harvest Matrix tool)

- Interview design and sampling
  - 16 farmer interviews:
    - 8 farmers with prior participation in listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline (balanced by gender: 4M/4F)
    - 8 farmers without prior participation (balanced by gender: 4M/4F)
  - Interviews are individual; not group responses.

- Field day logistics and safety
  - Pre-field day kit for each interviewee (recording device, spare pens, participant information sheets, Flood Impact Matrix sheets, anon number spreadsheet, clipboards, etc.).
  - Covid-19 protocols in place; health and safety prioritized; contact supervisor if concerns.

- Conduct, ethics, and consent
  - Group introduction detailing project purpose, expectations, confidentiality, withdrawal options, and information on where to obtain more information; verbal consent for potential photographs.
  - Emphasis on privacy: interviews conducted in private spaces to ensure candid responses.

- Interview practicalities and data quality
  - Ensure recording device is functioning; minimize background noise; document interviewee’s full name and anonymous number at the start of each recording.
  - Time management; maintain focus on questions; probe beyond yes/no answers; use prompts to elicit detailed responses (e.g., “could you tell me about X,” “please explain Y”).

- Tool usage and data capture
  - Flood Impact Matrix completed with the interviewee during the interview; interviewer assists as needed to ensure understanding.
  - Interview notes to capture interesting points, interruptions, and observations; audio recordings for district officer interviews.

- File management and metadata
  - Audio file naming convention: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
  - Each interview transcribed into a separate Word document; stored electronically and uploaded to teamwork.
  - Transcripts begin with metadata:
    - Date of interview
    - Location
    - Interviewer name
    - Interviewee name
    - Interviewee sex
    - Interviewee anon number
    - Interview length

- Transcribing guidelines
  - Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
  - Maintain verbatim accuracy; do not paraphrase or correct grammar.
  - Translate and transcribe into proper English; use standard capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
  - Do not add information; avoid including non-spoken content unless necessary for context.
  - Do not add page or job numbers; separate fields can be added elsewhere.
  - Lightly edit non-verbatim fillers (um, er) but preserve meaning.
  - Indicate interruptions and trailing thoughts (use ellipses for trailing off).
  - If noise interrupts dialogue, note the event in the transcript.

- Data governance, sharing, and ethics considerations
  - Ensure confidentiality and data protection; provide information sheets; obtain consent for data use and potential publication.
  - Anonymize data using anon numbers; manage and store data securely; consider data sharing in line with governance standards.

- Appendices and templates
  - Flood matrix instructions and templates (Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv).
  - Harvest matrix tool (Harvest_matrix_tool.csv).

- Alignment with monitoring framework objectives
  - Establishes standardized data collection and metadata practices to support transparent data governance, quality assurance, and accessibility.
  - Facilitates collecting baseline information and consistent indicators through structured tools, enabling clear dissemination and potential integration into monitoring frameworks.
