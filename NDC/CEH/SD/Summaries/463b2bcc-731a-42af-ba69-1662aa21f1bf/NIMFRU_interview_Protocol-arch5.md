# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

## Overview
- A guide to collect translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews in a systematic, clear, and methodical way.
- Aims to produce one English transcript (RTF) per interviewee and one completed Flood Impact Matrix (CSV) per interviewee.
- Accompanying materials include instructions and templates: Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, Harvest_matrix_tool.csv.

## Data collected and formats
- Interviews: translated and transcribed semi-structured interviews with individual community members (not group responses).
- Outputs per interviewee: one English transcript (RTF) and one completed Flood Impact Matrix (CSV).
- Tools are to be completed individually by interviewees with interviewer support.

## Pre-field day and materials
- Pre-field day kit includes: notebook, multiple pens, charged recording device with space, hard copies of participant information sheets, hard copies of interview questions, hard copies of Flood Impact Matrix, anon number spreadsheet, clipboards, and a file for completed questionnaires.

## Covid-19 safety
- ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs in place; follow precautions.
- Do not proceed if feeling unsafe; health and safety take priority. Contact Jonah with concerns.

## Group introduction and ethics
- Begin with project introduction, purpose of today’s work, expected input, duration, recording, confidentiality, withdrawal options, where to find more information, and note that photographs may be taken.

## Conducting the interviews
- Selection: 16 farmers total; 8 who participated in prior activities (4 male, 4 female) and 8 who did not (4 male, 4 female).
- Tools are for individuals; not group responses.
- Each interviewee completes both the Flood Impact Matrix and the interview.
  
## Practicalities
- Interview location should provide privacy (interviewee alone, away from others) and minimal noise (wind, rain).
- Manage time effectively (aim for the allocated interview duration).
- Regularly verify recording is active; document progress.
- Start each recording by stating the interviewee’s full name and allocated anonymous number.

## Using the tool effectively
- Interviewer should take notes on key points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations; label notes clearly with interviewee name and date.
- District officer interviews must be audio recorded; ensure all audio files are saved centrally and labeled.
- Use probing questions to elicit detailed responses (beyond yes/no).
- Flood Impact Matrix is not audio-recorded; interviewer assists the interviewee in completing the form.

## File management (5.1)
- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Each interview transcription saved as a separate Word document and uploaded to teamwork.
- Transcript header should include: Date, Location, Interviewer name, Interviewee name, Interviewee sex, Interviewee anon number, Interview length.

## Transcribing guidelines (5.2)
- Each speaker starts a new line with the speaker’s name.
- Accuracy: transcribe exactly what is spoken; do not paraphrase or alter grammar.
- Language: transcripts translated and transcribed into English with proper capitalization, punctuation, and spelling.
- Do not add information (no pages, job numbers, titles, or comments in transcripts).
- Clean up non-verbatim elements (remove fillers like ums/ers) but keep essential content.
- Indicate any interruptions or noises affecting speech.
- If a speaker trails off, use ellipses; differentiate from abrupt shifts.
- Do not include non-spoken information; keep transcript focused on spoken content.

## Data formats and supporting materials
- Transcripts: English RTf per interviewee.
- Flood Impact Matrix: completed CSV per interviewee.
- Supporting templates: Flood_matrix_instructions.csv, Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv, Harvest_matrix_tool.csv.

## Governance, quality control, and storage
- Ensure alignment between audio and transcript through standardized naming and headers.
- Transcripts uploaded to teamwork; audio files stored centrally and labeled.
- Maintain anonymization through the anon numbering system and proper labeling to enable discovery and reuse while protecting privacy.
