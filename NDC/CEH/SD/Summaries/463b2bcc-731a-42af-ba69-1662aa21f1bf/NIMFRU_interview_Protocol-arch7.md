# NIMFRU Case Study Interview Protocol - Uganda

- Summary for GIS Specialists:
  - This protocol governs the collection of qualitative interview data and structured Flood Impact Matrix data that can be integrated with geospatial analyses to map flood impacts and inform spatial decision-making.
  - Emphasizes careful data management (unique anonymized identifiers, consistent file naming, and separate transcripts) to support linking interview data with spatial datasets.

## Purpose and Outputs
- Purpose: Provide clear guidelines to collect relevant, systematic, and well-managed data across case study interviews.
- Outputs per interview:
  - One translated and transcribed English transcript (RTF).
  - One complete Flood Impact Matrix CSV per interviewee (structural data for spatial analysis).
- Supporting materials:
  - Flood_matrix_instructions.csv
  - Flood_impact_matrix_tool.csv
  - Harvest_matrix_tool.csv

## Pre-field Day Preparation
- Required items for interviewees:
  - Notebook, pens (5 spare), fully charged recorder with sufficient storage.
  - Hard copies of participant information sheets, interview questions, Flood Impact Matrix (plus 2 spares).
  - Anonymity tracking spreadsheet (Anon number) and clipboards.
  - A file to organize completed questionnaires.

## Covid-19 Rules
- ECOTRUST Covid-19 SOPs must be followed; prioritise health and safety.
- Do not proceed if you or participants feel unsafe; raise concerns to the designated contact.

## Group Introduction and Ethics Overview
- Team introductions and explanation of:
  - Project purpose and today’s activities.
  - Expected input, interview duration, recording, confidentiality, and withdrawal options.
  - Availability of information sheets and potential for photographs (verbal consent).

## Conducting the Interviews
- Selection criteria:
  - 16 farmers total: 8 with prior participation (listening groups, FAMVACs, or IHM/HEA baseline) and 8 without (4M/4F in each subgroup).
  - All interviews conducted individually; no group responses.
- Interview context and privacy:
  - Interviewees must be alone to ensure free speaking.
  - Prefer sheltered, quiet locations with minimal wind/noise.
- Time management:
  - Try to adhere to allocated interview length.
- Recording practices:
  - Regularly verify recording is active; document full name and anonymized number at the start of each recording.

## Using the Tool Effectively
- Field notes:
  - Interviewers should capture notable points, interruptions, disturbances, and observations with clear labeling (interviewee name and date).
- Probing and depth:
  - Farmer district officer interviews must be audio recorded; interviewers should probe beyond yes/no answers and encourage detailed responses.
- Flood Impact Matrix administration:
  - Conducted with interviewees verbally; interviewer guides and supports completion to ensure comprehension.
  - Ideally completed by interviewee with interviewer assistance.

## File Management
- Audio file naming: Anon number, interviewee name, location, date (e.g., 341 Fidele Nhamo, Jawani, 091118).
- Transcripts: One Word document per interview; upload to teamwork.
- Transcript header information must include:
  - Date, location, interviewer, interviewee name and sex, anon number, interview length.

## Transcription Guidelines
- Format: Each speaker starts a new line with their name.
- Accuracy: Only exact spoken words; do not paraphrase or insert missing content.
- Language: Transcripts translated to English with proper grammar; do not phonetic spellings or netspeak.
- No extra information: Do not add job numbers, titles, or comments in the transcript.
- Clean-up: Lightly edit non-verbatim speech (remove fillers) but retain meaning.
- Non-speech events: Indicate interruptions or environmental sounds explicitly.
- Trailing off: Use ellipses to denote incomplete thoughts.
