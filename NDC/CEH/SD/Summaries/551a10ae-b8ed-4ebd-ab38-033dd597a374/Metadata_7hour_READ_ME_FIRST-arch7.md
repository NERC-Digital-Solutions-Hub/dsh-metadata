# High-frequency precipitation and stream water quality time series from Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource spanning the periodic table

## Overview
- Publicly available data for education and research; copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Users should cite key publications when using the data in published work (see Citations and Attribution).

## Data and access
- Focus: high-frequency time series of water quality in precipitation and streamflow from Plynlimon, Wales; intended as an openly accessible data resource (spanning a broad range of constituents, i.e., the periodic table theme).
- Data are provided to support GIS-based visualization and analysis, offering raw measurements alongside processed data.
- Raw Data Archive (RDA) identifiers: end-of-variable suffix "RDA" denote unaltered laboratory-reported values, preserved for documentation and transparency.

## Data quality, editing and documentation
- Raw Data Archive contents: unaltered except for glitches traced to original lab files and analytical sheets; corrected on that basis.
- RDA is for completeness and transparency; not recommended for routine analyses due to known substantial errors in some values.
- Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded to the greatest extent possible.
- Differences between edited data and the raw archive are documented in detail in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf".
