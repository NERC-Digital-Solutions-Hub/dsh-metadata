# SAMPLING METHODS

- The document outlines sampling methods for rainfall and stream water data collected from 6-Mar-2007 to 27-Jan-2009 at two sites: Carreg Wen automatic weather station and CEH hydrological network.
- Sampling aims and context: Automated, time-staggered sampling to support rainfall and stream water datasets; emphasizes standardized sample collection for subsequent laboratory processing. 

## Data Characteristics

- Rainfall
  - Collection method: Bulk sample
  - Collection device: Continuously open, 57.5 cm diameter plastic collector with anti-bird protection
  - Bottles: 24 x 250 ml polypropylene bottles for automated sampling
  - Flow/volume measurement: Based on 12.5 cm diameter ground-level tipping bucket raingauge at Carreg Wen
  - Sampling interval: 7 hourly
  - Filtration: Lab
- Stream water
  - Collection method: Spot samples
  - Collection device: Xian automatic sampler with 24 bottles programmed to collect 500 ml samples
  - Bottles: High-density polypropylene (24 bottles)
  - Flow/volume measurement: CEH stream (flume) gauges used per hydrological network
  - Sampling interval: 7 hourly
  - Filtration: Lab

## Temporal Coverage

- Start: 6-Mar-2007 (both rainfall and stream water)
- Finish: 27-Jan-2009 (both rainfall and stream water)

## Data Management and Stewardship Considerations

- Data are collected via automated samplers and require proper handling, transfer, and timely access (chasing up may be needed to obtain data).
- Metadata to capture: collection method, collection device specs, bottle counts and volumes, sampling interval, start/finish dates, and laboratory filtration details.
- Potential challenges for data stewards include managing data across multiple systems/formats, handling large datasets, and maintaining data usability across updates and potential embargoes or access limitations.
