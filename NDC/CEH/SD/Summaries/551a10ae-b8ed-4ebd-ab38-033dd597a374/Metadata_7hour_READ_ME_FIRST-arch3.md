# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

## Overview
- Publicly available data intended for education and research; Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) retains copyright.
- Users should cite the primary publications:
  - Neal et al., High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge, Science of the Total Environment, 2012.
  - Neal et al., High-frequency precipitation and stream water quality time series from Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource spanning the periodic table, Hydrological Processes, 2013 (in press; updated information to be added when available).
- Users should also cite other relevant papers by the listed authors as appropriate to the study topic.

## Usage and citation
- Use of these data in published work requires proper citation of the two main papers listed above.
- The release encourages citing additional works by the authors as relevant to the study topic.

## Disclaimers
- Data are provided "as is" with no guarantee of absence of errors or omissions.
- Users are responsible for determining suitability for any purpose and assume all risk.
- Authors and employers provide no warranty (express or implied) and assume no liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of the data or processes described.

## Important information about data and formats
- Raw Data Archive (RDA): archive of raw laboratory-reported measurements, labeled with "RDA" at the end of variable names.
  - Raw data have not been altered except to correct glitches traceable to original laboratory files and analytical sheets.
  - Archival raw data are provided for completeness and transparency about data editing applied subsequently.
  - The raw archive allows revisiting original data if new information emerges suggesting that edited data may have omitted phenomena.
  - Recommendation: do not use the raw data for routine analyses; use the edited data where problematic values have been corrected or excluded.
- Differences between edited data and the raw archive are explained in detail in the accompanying file, "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf".
- The edited data are intended for routine analyses and to reflect cleaned, quality-controlled values.

## Data governance and quality considerations
- The data set supports transparency in data editing and governance by clearly separating raw and edited data.
- Metadata gaps and data quality issues are acknowledged as potential barriers in monitoring and data sharing in general.
- The documentation emphasizes the importance of data provenance and the availability of editing documentation to accompany data releases.
