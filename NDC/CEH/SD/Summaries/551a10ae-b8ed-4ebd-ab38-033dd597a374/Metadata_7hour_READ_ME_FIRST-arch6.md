# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

- Overview
  - The data are publicly available for education and research; copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
  - Openly accessible data resources supporting studies in high-frequency water quality and hydrology.
  - Primary citations provided for use in published work; additional related papers by the authors may be cited as appropriate.

- How to cite and attribution
  - Primary citations to use:
    - Neal, C. et al., High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge, Science of the Total Environment, 2012.
    - Neal, C. et al., High-frequency precipitation and stream water quality time series from Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource spanning the periodic table, Hydrological Processes, 2013 (in press; updated information forthcoming).
  - For specific topics, also cite other papers by the listed authors as appropriate.

- Data quality and purpose
  - Data are provided "as is" with no guarantees of errors or omissions.
  - Users assume all risk and are responsible for assessing suitability for their purposes.

- Raw vs edited data
  - The Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains unmodified raw laboratory measurements, with minor corrections for glitches traced to original lab files and analytical sheets.
  - The RDA supports documentation transparency and the possibility to re-examine potential phenomena that may have been edited out.
  - Routine analyses are not recommended on the raw data due to known substantial errors in some values.
  - Routine analyses should use the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded as far as possible.

- Documentation and how to interpret edits
  - Differences between edited data and the raw archive are explained in detail in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf."
  - The editing documentation provides context for when and why data values were altered and helps users understand data processing steps.

- Additional resources and updates
  - The Hydrological Processes 2013 article notes that updated information will be added when available, indicating ongoing maintenance of the data resource.
  - The data resource is described as spanning a broad range of elements (periodic table) in its openly accessible format.
