# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

## Overview
- Publicly available data for education and research, with copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
- Users should cite the primary sources when publishing: Neal et al., Science of the Total Environment, 2012; and Neal et al., Hydrological Processes, 2013 (in press; updated information forthcoming). Also cite other relevant papers by the listed authors as appropriate.

## Disclaimers
- Data are provided "as is" with no guarantee of completeness or error-free content.
- Users assume all risk and responsibility for determining suitability for any purpose.
- Authors and employers provide no warranties (including merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose) and assume no liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness; risk of infringement is not addressed by the authors.

## Important information about the data
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) comprises raw laboratory-reported measurements and ends each variable name with "RDA."
- Raw data have not been altered except for correcting glitches traceable to original lab files and analytical sheets; corrections are documented.
- Purpose of the RDA: to provide completeness and transparency about edits made to the data.
- The raw data allow reversion if new information suggests that edited data may have omitted important phenomena.

## Guidance on data use
- Routine analyses are best performed on the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded to the greatest extent possible.
- The differences between edited data and the raw archive are detailed in the accompanying file, "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf."
- For transparency and reproducibility, users may consult the raw data but should rely primarily on the edited dataset for standard analyses.
