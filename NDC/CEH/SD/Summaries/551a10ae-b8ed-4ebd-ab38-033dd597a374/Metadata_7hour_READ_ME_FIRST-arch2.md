# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

## Overview
- Data are publicly available for education and research; copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH).
- Users should cite specific foundational papers when publishing work that uses these data:
  - Neal et al., 2012, Science of the Total Environment
  - Neal et al., 2013, Hydrological Processes (in press; updated information when available)
- Authors and CEH encourage citing other papers by the listed authors as appropriate to the study topic.

## Data provenance and access
- The dataset comprises high-frequency time series of water quality related to precipitation and streamflow.
- The distribution package emphasizes transparency about data editing and the provenance of measurements.

## Usage and citation
- For published work, researchers must acknowledge the data source and cite the designated papers.
- Citations should reflect the authors, topic scope, and any additional relevant papers by the same authors.

## Data quality and structure
- The data are provided with formal disclaimers about potential errors and omissions.
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) contains the raw laboratory-reported measurements, denoted by “RDA” at the end of variable names.
- Raw data have not been altered except to correct glitches traceable to original laboratory files and analytical sheets.

## Data processing: raw vs edited
- The raw data archive is for documentation and transparency and to allow re-examination if new information emerges.
- Routine analyses are not recommended against using the edited data, where problematic values have been corrected or excluded to the greatest extent possible.
- Differences between edited data and the raw archive are explained in detail in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf".

## Documentation and transparency
- The data release provides documentation on data editing and the rationale for corrections, enabling users to understand how the final datasets were derived.
- The open data resource spans high-frequency measurements across topics relevant to precipitation and stream water quality.

## Disclaimers and limitations
- Data are provided "as is" with no guarantee of being free from errors or omissions; users assume all risk and responsibility for suitability.
- The authors and their employers disclaim warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and assume no legal liability for the data or resulting analyses.
- The raw data archive contains values believed to be substantially in error; use edited data for routine analyses.
