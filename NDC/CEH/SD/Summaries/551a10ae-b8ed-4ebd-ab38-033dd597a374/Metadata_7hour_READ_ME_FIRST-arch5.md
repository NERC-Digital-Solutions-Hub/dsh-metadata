# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

## Overview
- Data are publicly available for education and research; copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
- The data release cites primary publications describing the work and provides guidance on proper citation.

## Citations and Publication
- When used in published work, cite:
  - Neal, C., et al., High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge, Science of the Total Environment, 2012.
  - Neal, C., et al., High-frequency precipitation and stream water quality time series from Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource spanning the periodic table, Hydrological Processes, 2013 (in press; updated information to be added when available).
- Also cite other papers by the listed authors as appropriate to the study topics.

## Data contents and structure
- The Raw Data Archive (RDA) is the archive of raw laboratory-reported measurements. It has not been altered except for corrections of glitches traceable to original laboratory files and analytical sheets.
- The archive is provided for completeness and transparency about subsequent data editing. It also allows re-engagement with original data if new information suggests edits may have removed relevant phenomena.
- The edited dataset is provided for routine analyses; the raw data contain values believed to be substantially in error.
- Differences between edited data and the raw archive are detailed in the accompanying file, "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf".

## Quality, limitations, and disclaimers
- Data are provided "as is" with no guarantee of being free from errors or omissions.
- Users assume all risk and are responsible for determining suitability for any purpose.
- The authors and their employers provide no warranty, and assume no liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness.

## Data sharing, governance, and stewardship
- Data are intended to be openly accessible, but sharing limitations (disclosures, proprietary aspects, embargoes) may apply and must be respected.
- Data Stewards should:
  - Understand user needs to help ensure datasets meet those needs.
  - Work with data creators to ensure standards (accuracy, metadata, format) are met, providing guidance and tools.
  - Identify data availability and limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes) and manage them accordingly.
  - Oversee data intake (including chasing up data from creators when needed) and quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation before sharing.
  - Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalog data holdings; document work performed on datasets when appropriate.
  - Ensure that updating processes are in place and that users are aware of updated versions.

## Raw vs edited data guidance
- The Raw Data Archive is useful for transparency and potential re-edits but is not recommended for routine analyses due to the presence of substantial errors in some values.
- Routine analyses should rely on the edited dataset, with corrections or exclusions applied where possible.
- The editing differences and rationale are explained in the "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf" file.
