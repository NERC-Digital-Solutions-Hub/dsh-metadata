# High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge

## Overview
- Publicly available data for education and research, with copyright retained by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
- Primary publications for citation:
  - Neal et al., Science of the Total Environment, 2012: High-frequency water quality time series in precipitation and streamflow: from fragmentary signals to scientific challenge. DOI: 10.1016/j.scitotenv.2011.10.072
  - Neal et al., Hydrological Processes, 2013 (in press; updated information will be added): High-frequency precipitation and stream water quality time series from Plynlimon, Wales: an openly accessible data resource spanning the periodic table.
- Authors encourage citing additional papers by the listed authors as appropriate.

## Access, rights, and attribution
- Data are provided "as is" with no warranty; users assume all risk and responsibility for suitability.
- No liability for accuracy, completeness, or usefulness; does not guarantee non-infringement of third-party rights.
- Openly accessible resource intended to support education, research, and policy-oriented work; appropriate citation is required.

## Data content and scope
- Raw Data Archive (RDA): raw measurements as reported by analytical laboratories, with minimal corrections for glitches traceable to original lab files and sheets.
- Edited data: corrected or excluded problematic values; designed for routine analyses.
- Documentation of differences between raw and edited data is provided in the accompanying file: "Plynlimon 7hour data editing documentation.pdf."
- Focus area includes high-frequency time series for precipitation and streamwater quality data from Plynlimon, Wales; designed to enable exploration of detailed hydrological and water quality phenomena.

## Data structure, quality, and metadata
- RDA denotes a raw data archive with variable naming (ending in "RDA") and laboratories’ original reporting.
- Edited data version exists to improve reliability for analyses; the dataset notes where edits have occurred and why.
- Comprehensive documentation accompanies the data to support transparency about data editing and processing steps.

## Stewardship, governance, and usability for data leaders
- Clear provenance: listed authors and associated publications establish data origins and credibility.
- Metadata and documentation emphasize discoverability, data lineage, and versioning (raw vs edited) to support governance.
- Emphasis on transparency about data editing and the rationale for using edited data in routine analyses.
- Encourages proper data citation and recognition of data creators and contributors.

## Practical considerations for data strategy and implementation
- Distinguish between raw data and edited data to support both transparency and reliable analyses.
- Ensure access to and understanding of the editing documentation to assess data suitability for specific use cases.
- Plan for updates and version control, noting that updated information may be added to published records.
- When integrating into broader data systems, reference the primary publications for methodological context and maintain links to the data’s licensing and disclaimers.

## Key takeaways for Data Leaders
- The dataset demonstrates rigorous provenance, explicit rights and disclaimers, and a clear path from raw measurements to usable data products via documented editing.
- Important to maintain robust metadata, versioning, and documentation to enable transparent data governance and trustworthy analyses.
- Encourages responsible data use through proper citation and acknowledgment of contributors, while warning about limitations and potential data quality issues in raw records.
