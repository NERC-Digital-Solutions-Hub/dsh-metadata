# SAMPLING METHODS

- The document describes two parallel sampling streams for environmental data: rainfall and stream water, using automated, timer-based collection methods over a defined period (6-Mar-2007 to 27-Jan-2009) with 7-hourly intervals.
- Data are intended for lab filtration processing after collection, suitable for integration into GIS-based analyses of hydrological and climate-related spatial patterns.

## Rainfall

- COLLECTION METHOD: Bulk sample
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Continuously open, 57.5 cm diameter plastic collector with bird protection; 24 x 250 ml polypropylene bottles automate sample collection every 7 hours.
- FLOW/VOLUME: Rainfall amounts recorded by a 12.5 cm diameter ground-level tipping bucket raingauge at the Carreg Wen automatic weather station.
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: 7 hourly
- START/FINISH: 6-Mar-2007 to 27-Jan-2009
- FILTRATION: Lab

## Stream water

- COLLECTION METHOD: "Spot" samples
- COLLECTION DEVICE: Xian automatic sampler with 24 bottles programmed to collect 500 ml samples every 7 hours into high-density polypropylene bottles.
- FLOW/VOLUME: CEH stream (flume) gauges used according to the hydrological network
- SAMPLING INTERVAL: 7 hourly
- START/FINISH: 6-Mar-2007 to 27-Jan-2009
- FILTRATION: Lab

## GIS considerations

- Locations of rainfall collector and stream water samplers, along with associated gauges (Carreg Wen, CEH hydrological network), should be geolocated for map-based visualization.
- Data integration potential: reconcile rainfall and stream samples with gauge time stamps, ensure consistency across 7-hour intervals, and link to lab results.
- Metadata insights: clear start/finish dates and sampling cadence aid temporal GIS analyses and trend mapping for the 2007–2009 period.
