# Cumbrian Lakes plankton and fish data, used for turning points and early warnings analysis (1940 to 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Describes data used in Burthe et al. (2015) comprising phyto- and zooplankton counts, chlorophyll concentration, and fish catch data from the Cumbrian Lakes (Blelham Tarn, Esthwaite Water, Windermere NBAS and SBAS).
- Time series span 1940–2013 with varying lengths by species/site; fish data are available only for Windermere.
- Original data collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and subsequently by CEH and its predecessor IFE since 1989.

## Datasets included (files)
- Windermere_fish_annual_catches.csv
  - Columns: date, site (NBAS, SBAS), species (Arctic charr, perch, pike), variable (catch per unit effort), Catch values.
- Cumbrian_Lakes_phyto_allsites.csv
  - Columns: month, year, site, taxon, value (cells/ml), counter, chamber, form.
- Cumbrian_Lakes_zoo_allsites.csv
  - Columns: month, year, site, variable, value, confound.var.
- Cumbrian_Lakes_chl_allsites.csv
  - Columns: date, month, year, site, variable (TOCA for chlorophyll), value (mg/m3), confound.var.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Weekly to biweekly sampling at the deepest point of each lake.
- Phytoplankton: samples fixed with Lugol's iodine; counted in Lund chambers; dominant species summed to genus level for analysis.
- Chlorophyll: filtered water, methanol extraction, spectrophotometric measurement.
- Zooplankton: two sources—species-level Windermere data from vertical tows; aggregate zooplankton filter-paper counts for all lakes.
- Fish: Arctic charr (CPUE from anglers and gill nets), perch (standardised traps), and pike (gill nets) with long-term effort records.

## Analytical methods and time coverage
- Phytoplankton: genus-level aggregation to mitigate analyst inconsistencies; data used 1978–2003 (or 1978–2005 for some species).
- Chlorophyll: data used 1964–2009.
- Zooplankton: species-level Windermere data 1979–2010; crustacean filter counts 1964–2009.
- Fish: annual mean CPUE calculated by species, method, basin, and year; Windermere data span 1940–2013.

## Study sites and location
- Windermere North Basin (NBAS) and South Basin (SBAS); Esthwaite Water (ESTH); Blelham Tarn (BLEL).
- Approximate grid references provided for each site.
