# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Aim
- Identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and informing future decisions.

## Who they are
- Individuals in managerial roles within government departments or environmental quangos, responsible for deciding on and implementing monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims
- Speak with stakeholders and experts to understand which measures provide useful insight.
- Learn from others to avoid duplication.
- Find and verify available data; address metadata shortcomings by contacting dataset originators.
- Add metadata to datasets and often publicly share data used, recognizing this can be a barrier.
- Commission new data to fill gaps; ensure quality, openness, and data management standards are set at the source.
- Ensure data is quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and findings are presented clearly (through reports, charts, dashboards).
- Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, ensure underlying data is shared appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges
- Lack of data, or data that is not of sufficient standard.
- Lack of access to data, or access not timely.
- Silos within and between organisations hinder collaboration.
- Requirement to publicly share datasets can be a barrier to using existing data.
- Concerns about keeping data up to date deter data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hinders quick verification of suitability.
- Data formats require effortful transformation to be usable.
- Difficulty in communicating complex findings clearly.
- Establishing data governance to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and up-to-date maintenance.
