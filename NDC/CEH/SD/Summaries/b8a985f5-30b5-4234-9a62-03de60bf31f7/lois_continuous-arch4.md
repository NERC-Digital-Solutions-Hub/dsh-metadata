# LOIS Core Programme Hydrolab H20 (Hydrodata Systems, London, UK) water quality monitors were installed at 10 sites and used to log water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen between 1994 and 1997.

## Overview
- 10 Hydrolab DataSonde 3 units deployed for continuous water quality monitoring.
- Monitoring period: 1994–1997 with data collected at 30-minute intervals.

## Variables and Units
- pH (units: pH)
- Conductivity (25°C) (units: µS/cm)
- Dissolved oxygen (units: % saturation)
- Temperature (units: °C)
- Data collected as continuous measurements; “All variables” captured at each site.

## Spatial Coverage
- Sites and identifiers:
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1; NGR SE225994)
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7; NGR SE706364)
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8; NGR SE534255)
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9; NGR SE409258)
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11; NGR SK807612)
  - Ouse at Skelton (O16; NGR SE534255)
  - Aire above Thwaite Mills (A18; NGR SE327313)
  - Aire at Fleet Weir (A19; NGR SE417274)
  - Swale at Crakehill (S32; NGR SE426735)
  - Nidd at Hunsingore (N33; NGR SE427532)

## Temporal Coverage
- Data continuous from 1994 to 1997, with site-specific durations varying.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Equipment: Hydrolab DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units.
- Deployment: Some units in large steel pipes for protection; others suspended from trees.
- Fouling mitigation: Some probes fitted with stirrers due to high suspended solids during spates.

## Quality Assurance and Data Quality
- Calibration: Units calibrated for pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen in the laboratory prior to field deployment.
- Field maintenance: Field units exchanged fortnightly (Nov–Apr) and weekly (May–Oct).
- Fouling management: Regular cleaning and recalibration necessary due to algae/diatoms.
- Data validation: Cross-check with handheld Mettler CheckMate instruments; plotting parameters against time to identify spurious data; clearly, spurious data removed; otherwise data preserved as collected by DataSonde (raw data).

## Data Stewardship
- Data collection and deployment performed by the field sampling team at York University.
