# LOIS Core Programme Hydrolab H20 (Hydrodata Systems, London, UK) water quality monitors

- Overview
  - Ten Hydrolab DataSonde 3 monitoring units deployed across 10 sites (1994–1997) to log water temperature, pH, conductivity (25°C), and dissolved oxygen (% saturation).
  - Measurements were continuous at 30-minute intervals; variable site lengths (1994–1997).

- Variables and Units
  - pH (units: pH)
  - Conductivity (units: µS/cm at 25°C)
  - Dissolved oxygen (units: % saturation)
  - Temperature (units: °C)
  - Battery (units: volts) [listed as a variable, but primary focus is on water quality parameters]

- Measurement Locations (sites and identifiers)
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1), NGR SE225994, Variable = All
  - Derwent at Bubwith (D7), NGR SE706364, Variable = All
  - Aire at Beal Bridge (A8), NGR SE534255, Variable = All
  - Calder at Methley Bridge (C9), NGR SE409258, Variable = All
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11), NGR SK807612, Variable = All
  - Ouse at Skelton (O16), NGR SE534255, Variable = All
  - Aire above Thwaite Mills (A18), NGR SE327313, Variable = All
  - Aire at Fleet Weir (A19), NGR SE417274, Variable = All
  - Swale at Crakehill (S32), NGR SE426735, Variable = All
  - Nidd at Hunsingore (N33), NGR SE427532, Variable = All

- How it was measured
  - Hydrolab DataSonde 3 units deployed at each site.
  - Many units suspended from trees (River Nidd at Hunsingore and River Swale at Crakehill); others housed in large steel pipes to allow water flow and protect from vandalism/large debris.
  - Some probes (Trent and Ouse at Skelton) fitted with stirrers to reduce fouling from high suspended solids during spates.

- Temporal Coverage
  - Data collected continuously from 1994 to 1997; period length varied by site.

- Quality Control and Data Quality
  - Pre-deployment calibration of pH, conductivity, and DO in the laboratory.
  - Field unit exchange: every two weeks (Nov–Apr); weekly (May–Oct).
  - Fouling issues due to algae/diatoms; required more frequent cleaning and recalibration.
  - Data validation: after field unit changes, parameters were cross-checked against hand-held Mettler CheckMate measurements; data downloaded to spreadsheets and plotted over time to identify spurious readings.
  - Spurious or faulty/fouled probes were removed; remaining data were kept in the DataSonde's native format (raw).

- Data Handling and Access
  - Data were downloaded and plotted for quality review; otherwise, data were kept as recorded by the DataSonde.
  - No explicit statement about storage in portals or centralized databases.

- Field Team
  - Deployment and data collection conducted by the York University field sampling team.
