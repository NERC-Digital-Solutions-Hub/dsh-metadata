# HUMBER CATHCMENT

- The document centers on the Humber Catchment area.
- For GIS specialists, this implies creating map-based data products that depict catchment boundaries and related spatial features (e.g., hydrology, land use, water bodies).
- Likely activities include gathering and verifying relevant spatial datasets from multiple sources and producing clear map visualizations for stakeholders.
- Key considerations include data quality, consistency, and appropriate resolution for catchment-scale analysis, as well as addressing data gaps and standardization.
- Intended end users may include policy colleagues, clients, or the public.
