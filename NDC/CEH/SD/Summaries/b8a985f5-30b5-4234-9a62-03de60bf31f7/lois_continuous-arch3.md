# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- Hydrolab H20 water quality monitors were deployed at 10 sites (1994–1997) to log water temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen.
- Variables recorded continuously with 30-minute intervals.

## Variables and units
- pH (units: pH)
- Conductivity at 25C (units: µS/cm)
- Dissolved oxygen (units: % saturation)
- Temperature (units: Celsius)

## Measurement locations (sites)
- Swale at Catterick Bridge (S1, NGR SE225994)
- Derwent at Bubwith (D7, NGR SE706364)
- Aire at Beal Bridge (A8, NGR SE534255)
- Calder at Methley Bridge (C9, NGR SE409258)
- Trent at Cromwell Lock (T11, NGR SK807612)
- Ouse at Skelton (O16, NGR SE534255)
- Aire above Thwaite Mills (A18, NGR SE327313)
- Aire at Fleet Weir (A19, NGR SE417274)
- Swale at Crakehill (S32, NGR SE426735)
- Nidd at Hunsingore (N33, NGR SE427532)

## How measurements were made
- DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units (Hydrolab) deployed in pipes or suspended from trees.
- Some probes fitted with stirrers to reduce fouling in rivers with high suspended solids.

## Data collection and timing
- Data collected continuously between 1994 and 1997.
- Field deployment and data collection conducted by the York University field sampling team.

## Quality control and data quality
- Units calibrated in the laboratory prior to deployment.
- Field unit changes: fortnightly (Nov–Apr); weekly (May–Oct).
- Fouling from algae/diatoms prompted more frequent cleaning and recalibration.
- Cross-checks with handheld Mettler CheckMate instruments during data downloads.
- Spurious data identified via plotting parameters against time and removed; remaining data stored as raw from DataSonde.

## Data management and governance
- Data collected and managed by the LOIS project team at York University.
- Data quality checks and cleaning performed to ensure reliability for reporting and analysis.
