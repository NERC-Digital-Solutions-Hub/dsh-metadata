# LOIS Core Programme

## Overview
- Continuous water quality monitoring across 10 sites (1994–1997) using Hydrolab H20 systems.
- Variables tracked: pH (pH units); Conductivity at 25C (µS/cm); Dissolved oxygen (percent saturation); Temperature (C); Battery (volts).

## Spatial coverage
- Data collected at 10 river sites with specific site codes and National Grid References (NGRs) provided (full site list included in the document).

## Temporal coverage
- Data were logged continuously at 30-minute intervals, with recording periods varying by site from 1994 to 1997.

## Data and measurements
- Measurement platform: Hydrolab DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units.
- Installation details: Some units suspended from trees; others housed in large steel pipes to protect probes while allowing water flow; stirrers used at the Trent and Ouse (Skelton) sites to reduce fouling.
- Calibration and maintenance: Pre-deployment calibration in the laboratory; field units swapped fortnightly (Nov–Apr) and weekly (May–Oct).

## Instrumentation and deployment notes
- Probes subject to algae/diatom fouling; more frequent cleaning and recalibration required during higher light and temperature periods.
- Data collection performed by York University field sampling team.

## Quality control and data handling
- Calibration validation: Field checks using handheld Mettler CheckMate instruments during data downloads.
- Data cleaning: Plotting parameters against time to identify and remove spurious data from faulty or fouled probes; remaining data retained as raw outputs from the DataSonde.
