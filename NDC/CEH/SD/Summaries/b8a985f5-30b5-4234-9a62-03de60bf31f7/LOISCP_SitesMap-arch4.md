# HUMBER CATHCMENT

## Overview
- Data Leaders are managers focused on implementing an effective data strategy.
- They apply past data analysis knowledge to the organisation’s data function and consider data serving a wider community, potentially across partner networks.

## Who Data Leaders are
- Hold management roles dedicated to establishing an effective data strategy.
- Use previous data analysis experience to shape the organisation’s data function.
- Engage with a broader community, including networks of partners, to maximise data impact.

## How Data Leaders meet their aims
- Think about the entire data system and its interconnections.
- Understand user needs (e.g., policy colleagues) as an ongoing process and may foster co-ownership of data products.
- Identify what data exists, where gaps are, and assess data suitability to prioritise work.
- Source data through platforms, online searches, and outreach to others.
- Commission new data when needed and explore creative data-gathering approaches.
- Promote strong analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within their team.
- Ensure data assets are properly managed (format, quality, metadata, discoverability, updates).
- Validate that data products meet user needs through feedback and iterative improvement.
- Collaborate with the wider data community to support an effective data system.

## Key challenges
- Understanding diverse user needs, including varied public audiences.
- Gaining an overview of available data due to fragmentation and dispersion.
- Insufficient data, especially at the required level of granularity.
- Paywalls and data protection barriers limiting access.
- Difficulty verifying data content and format quickly.
- Lack of data standards, varying data quality, and unclear metadata.
- Limited sector coordination, leading to duplicated effort and a need for stronger communities of practice.
