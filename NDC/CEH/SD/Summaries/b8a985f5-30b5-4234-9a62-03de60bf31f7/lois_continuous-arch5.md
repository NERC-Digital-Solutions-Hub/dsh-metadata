LOIS Core Programme Hydrolab H20 (Hydrodata Systems, London, UK) water quality monitors were installed at 10 sites and used to log water temperature, pH, conductivity and dissolved oxygen between 1994 and 1997.

## Overview
- Ten Hydrolab H2O monitors deployed to log key water quality parameters continuously from 1994 to 1997.
- Variables recorded: pH (units: pH), conductivity at 25°C (units: µS/cm), dissolved oxygen (units: % saturated), water temperature (units: °C). Battery voltage also recorded (units: volts).
- Measurement cadence: data collected continuously at 30-minute intervals; duration varied by site.

## Measurement details (where and how)
- Sites and identifiers:
  - Swale at Catterick Bridge, S1, NGR SE225994
  - Derwent at Bubwith, D7, NGR SE706364
  - Aire at Beal Bridge, A8, NGR SE534255
  - Calder at Methley Bridge, C9, NGR SE409258
  - Trent at Cromwell Lock, T11, NGR SK807612
  - Ouse at Skelton, O16, NGR SE534255
  - Aire above Thwaite Mills, A18, NGR SE327313
  - Aire at Fleet Weir, A19, NGR SE417274
  - Swale at Crakehill, S32, NGR SE426735
  - Nidd at Hunsingore, N33, NGR SE427532
- Variable coverage: at each site, all recorded variables were monitored.

## Instrumentation and deployment
- Instrument: Hydrolab DataSonde 3 continuous monitoring units.
- Deployment configurations:
  - Some Hydrolabs suspended from trees.
  - Others housed in large steel pipes extending from the bank into rivers to protect probes.
  - Trent and Ouse at Skelton fitted with stirrers to reduce fouling from high suspended solids during spate conditions.

## Quality control and data quality
- Calibration:
  - Probes calibrated for pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen in the laboratory before field deployment.
- Maintenance cadence:
  - Units exchanged fortnightly (Nov–Apr); weekly (May–Oct).
- Fouling and cleaning:
  - Increased light and warmer temperatures in summer increased algae/diatom fouling, necessitating more regular cleaning and recalibration.
- Data verification:
  - During field changeovers, hand-held Mettler CheckMate units were used to record the same parameters measured by the Hydrolabs.
  - Data downloaded to spreadsheets; plots of parameter versus time reviewed to identify spurious data due to faulty or fouled probes; such data were deleted.
  - Otherwise, data were kept as collected by the DataSonde (i.e., raw).

## Data handling and documentation
- Data capture process:
  - Field sampling team at York University conducted deployment and data collection.
  - After collection, data were stored and quality-checked against field measurements.

## Relevance for data stewardship
- Provides a clear description of variables, units, locations, deployment methods, and measurement cadence, enabling proper data discovery and reuse.
- Documents calibration, maintenance schedules, and data cleaning procedures critical for assessing data quality and lineage.
- Indicates provenance through site identifiers, coordinates, and references, supporting data governance and reproducibility.
