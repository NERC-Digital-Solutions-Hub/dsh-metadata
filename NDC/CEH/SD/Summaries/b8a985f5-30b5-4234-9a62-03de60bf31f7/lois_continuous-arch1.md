# LOIS Core Programme

- Continuous water quality monitoring at 10 sites in the LOIS river programme (1994–1997) using Hydrolab H20 systems to log water temperature, pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen.
- Variables and units:
  - pH (pH units)
  - Conductivity at 25°C (µS/cm)
  - Dissolved oxygen (percent saturation)
  - Temperature (°C)
  - Battery (volts)

- Measurement locations (site code, location, and coordinates where provided):
  - S1: Swale at Catterick Bridge (NGR SE225994) – all variables
  - D7: Derwent at Bubwith (NGR SE706364) – all variables
  - A8: Aire at Beal Bridge (NGR SE534255) – all variables
  - C9: Calder at Methley Bridge (NGR SE409258) – all variables
  - T11: Trent at Cromwell Lock (NGR SK807612) – all variables
  - O16: Ouse at Skelton (NGR SE534255) – all variables
  - A18: Aire above Thwaite Mills (NGR SE327313) – all variables
  - A19: Aire at Fleet Weir (NGR SE417274) – all variables
  - S32: Swale at Crakehill (NGR SE426735) – all variables
  - N33: Nidd at Hunsingore (NGR SE427532) – all variables

- Data collection cadence and period:
  - Data collected continuously at 30-minute intervals from 1994 to 1997 (periods varied by site).

- How measurements were taken:
  - Hydrolab DataSonde 3 units deployed either suspended from trees or housed in large steel pipes enabling water flow over probes.
  - Some units at the Trent and Ouse sites included stirrers to reduce fouling from high suspended solids during spates.

- Quality control and data handling:
  - Pre-deployment calibration in the laboratory for pH, conductivity, and dissolved oxygen.
  - Unit exchanges: fortnightly (Nov–Apr) and weekly (May–Oct).
  - Fouling management due to algae/diatoms; regular cleaning and recalibration.
  - Data validation: during field changeovers, cross-checks with hand-held Mettler CheckMate; plots of parameters vs time used to identify spurious data; faulty data removed, otherwise raw data retained.

- Personnel:
  - Field data collection and deployment conducted by the York University field sampling team.
