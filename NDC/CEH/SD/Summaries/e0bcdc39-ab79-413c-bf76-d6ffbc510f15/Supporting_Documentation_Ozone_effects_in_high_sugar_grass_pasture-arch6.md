# Supporting documentation - Ozone effects in high sugar grass pasture

- Objective: Document and quantify the effects of ozone exposure on a high-sugar grass pasture mesocosm system, including biomass production, nitrogen fixation, injury, and canopy gas exchange, under environmentally monitored conditions.

- Experimental system and design:
  - Plants: Lolium perenne cv. AberMagic (grass) and Trifolium repens cv. Crusader (clover) grown in John Innes No. 2 compost.
  - Setup: Pots inoculated with a soil slurry to introduce a soil microbe population; grown in glasshouse conditions, then transferred to six solardomes (3 m diameter) for ozone exposure.
  - Treatments: Episodic ozone profiles across six solardomes (randomised). No explicit replication of ozone treatments within a dome; prior studies support the statistical validity of this design with multiple treatments.
  - Duration: 16 weeks of ozone exposure (June 11 to October 2013); weekly rotations and regular watering to maintain near-field capacity.
  - Environmental monitoring: Continuous recording of ambient temperature, soil moisture, PAR, and relative humidity in at least one dome.

- Measurements and assessments:
  - Biomass and productivity:
    - Above-ground biomass measured every 4 weeks; shoot biomass pooled per ozone treatment at each harvest.
    - Root biomass and, for Crusader, root nodules quantified at final harvest.
    - Injury assessment on clover leaves; shoot injury quantified as a percentage where applicable.
    - Canopy-level photosynthesis and respiration: whole-canopy hourly CO2 fluxes measured with a bell chamber and IR gas analyzer; NPP and canopy respiration (Rtot) calculated; GPP derived from NPP minus Rtot.
  - Nitrogen fixation and nodulation:
    - Acetylene reduction assays (ARA) conducted every 4 weeks to estimate nitrogenase activity.
    - Nodule biomass and counts recorded for Crusader; infection and nodule metrics analyzed.
  - Forage quality and nutritive value:
    - Near-infrared reflectance (NIR) to determine nutritive quality; relative feed value (RFV) and consumable food value (CFV) calculated from NIR and biomass data.
  - Ozone exposure characterization:
    - Flux and exposure quantified using the DO3SE model to estimate stomatal ozone flux (Fst) and cumulative exposure (POD values, POD6 for AberMagic and POD1 for Crusader).
    - Accumulated ozone flux values (g C m-2) used to relate to biomass, injury, and N-fixation endpoints.
  - Canopy and climate variables:
    - Leaf area index (LAI) derived from biomass; environmental variables including temperature, PAR, VPD, and PAR>200 μmol m-2 s-1 included in analyses.
  - Data analysis approach:
    - Regression analyses of biomass, injury, and N-fixation against accumulated POD values (4, 8, 12, 16 weeks) and/or seasonal metrics.
    - Canopy gas-exchange data analyzed by ANOVA across ozone treatments, with week as a random factor; post-hoc comparisons via Tukey HSD.
    - All analyses conducted in R (Version 3.1.1).

- Data availability and structure:

      - 12 columns including date, time, pot, size, dome, mean.ozone, gs, leaf.temp, soilm, PAR, air.temp, VPD.
    - AOT40 and climate data:
      - AOT40_and_climate_variables.csv
      - 32 columns including date, time, weekday, week, dome-specific >40ppb values, PAR, air temp, VPD, PAR>200, and dome identifiers.
  - Content scope:
    - Datasets cover ozone effects on high-sugar grass pasture mesocosms, including acetylene reduction, injury, biomass across time, root and nodule data, canopy gas exchange, forage quality, and environmental/climate context.

- Notable methodological notes:
  - Ozone treatments were not replicated within a single solardome; the facility’s prior use supports the statistical validity of this approach with multiple treatments across domes.
  - DO3SE-based ozone flux modeling was employed to estimate stomatal flux and accumulation thresholds (POD values) for each cultivar, with cultivar-specific parameterization where possible.
  - Data are designed for integration and re-use: multiple endpoints (biomass, N-fixation, injury, gas exchange, quality) and concurrent environmental data enable cross-endpoint analyses and meta-interpretation.

- Potential data use:
  - Data supports exploration of ozone-plant interactions in mixed grass-clover systems, including relationships between ozone flux/ exposure and plant productivity, nitrogen fixation, and forage quality.
  - Suitable for data cleaning, merging across weeks/timepoints, and comparative analyses with other ozone-perturbed pasture experiments.
  - Can inform modeling of ozone effects in managed pastures and contribute to meta-analyses of ozone impacts on perennial forage systems.
