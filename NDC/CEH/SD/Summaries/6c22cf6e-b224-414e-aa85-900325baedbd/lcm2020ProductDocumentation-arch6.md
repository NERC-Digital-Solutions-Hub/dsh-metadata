# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

## Overview and purpose
- UKCEH LCM2020 is the eighth UK land cover map, produced annually using automated methods.
- Product consists of six datasets: three for Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) each (10m Classified Pixels, Land Parcel dataset, and 25m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset).
- Aims to support informed decision-making with up-to-date land cover information across the UK.
- Provides 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats) aligned with, but not identical to, BAP Broad Habitats to preserve consistency with earlier products.
- Validated against multiple sources; overall thematic accuracy is just over 79% at full detail (Appendix 4 validation).

## Core data products
- 10m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Automatically classified Classification Scenes producing per-pixel land cover class IDs and associated confidence (probability) for each pixel.
  - No generalisation with the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine landscape detail (useful for specialist users understanding fine features; validation performed against Land Parcel data, not the 10m pixels).
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by intersecting 10m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to produce parcel-level attributes.
  - Includes per-parcel distributions of land cover classes and related metrics.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Rasterised version of parcels (25m pixels) carrying three attributes: dominant land cover (mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).

## Classification framework and inputs
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: 100x100 km tiles, 46-band scenes created by combining Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (winter, spring, summer, autumn) with 10 Context Rasters.
  - NI: Single 43-band Classification Scene per year, derived similarly but for a smaller area.
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Based on Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, four seasons, 10m to 60m resolution bands; some seasonal gaps may exist due to cloud, represented as nulls.
  - Classification tolerant of partial spectral information to enable full UK coverage.
- Context Rasters
  - GB: Height, Aspect, Slope, distances to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore and tidal masks, and a woodland mask (all 10m).
  - NI: Height, Aspect, Slope, urban mask (NISRA), distances to coast, freshwater, road (all context-derived).
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - 0.5 ha minimum mappable unit (MMU); original framework carried from LCM2007/2015 with minor changes for storage and indices.
  - Parcels represent discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.) to support change detection over time.

## Learning and classification methodology
- Bootstrap Training
  - Fully automatic training process using historic LCM data (2017–2019) to generate training observations for the current year.
  - Training sets filtered to high-purity parcels (>99% across three years) to create robust samples.
  - GB training set: ~941,027 objects; NI: ~214,833 objects.
- Random Forest Classification
  - Supervised learning using labelled parcels to sample pixels from Classification Scenes.
  - 10,000 samples per parcel class, drawn with replacement to balance class representation.
  - Output: 10m Classified Pixels with class ID and associated probability (confidence).
  - Software stack: bespoke UKCEH pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).

## Data quality, validation, and accuracy
- Validation approach
  - Compared LCM2020 outputs with countryside survey data (2019–2020), open-source National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (total 34,715 points).
  - Validation focuses on parcel-derived data; overall product accuracy reported as 79.2% (Appendix 4).
- Notes on accuracy and interpretation
  - Output includes a confusion/validation matrix detailing user’s and producer’s accuracies by class.
  - Some inter-class confusion is acknowledged (e.g., between acid vs. calcareous grassland, bog vs. heath, etc.) and is discussed in appendices with periodic improvement plans.
  - Saltwater vs. Freshwater distinctions rely on coastal and context rasters; some tidal confusion may occur.
- Validation data limitations
  - Validation points intersect with the Land Parcel datasets, not directly with 10m Pixel classification due to the lack of independent ground-truth at the pixel level.

## Classification detail and data schemas
- 10m Classified Pixels
  - Band 1: UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier.
  - Band 2: Class membership probability (confidence) for the most likely class.
- 25m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Band 1: Dominant land cover (mode) per parcel.
  - Band 2: Mean probability/confidence (_conf) across the parcel.
  - Band 3: Parcel purity (_purity) representing the share of the modal class within the parcel.
- Output and usage notes
  - 10m pixel data preserves fine landscape features (narrow patches, small habitats) but has not been generalised to the parcel framework for detailed analysis; suitable for specialists.
  - Parcel-based outputs provide a structured basis for change detection over time and easier comparison across years.

## The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework and notes
- Parcels are designed to represent discrete land units (fields, woods, urban areas) and are generally dominated by a single land cover type.
- The MMU and parcel geometry are preserved from earlier maps with minor storage and indexing updates; cross-year parcel identifiers (gid) may not align perfectly with LCM2015 if you attempt direct identifier matching.

## Appendices and guidance for users

- Appendix 2: Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (descriptions of broad habitat categories and how they relate to UKCEH classes).
- Appendix 3: Recommended colour recipes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (useful for cartography and visualization).
- Appendix 4: Detailed validation matrices (confusion matrices, class-by-class accuracies, and user/producer accuracies).
- Appendix 5: Full list of datasets for UKCEH LCM2020 (dataset names, extents, resolutions, and associated metadata).

## Practical implications for data use and support
- For broad monitoring and change detection, the annual LCM2020 maps provide a timely baseline with high-level accuracy (~79% at full detail).
- The 10m Classified Pixel product is best suited for specialist analyses and high-detail mapping; the 25m rasterised parcels support more scalable, parcel-based assessments.
- Context rasters and Seasonal Composite Images enhance classification accuracy by reducing spectral confusion, and Bootstrap Training leverages historical maps to minimize the need for costly field data collection.
- When comparing data across years or with historical datasets, be mindful of changes in parcel identifiers and the evolution of methods, especially the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework updates.
