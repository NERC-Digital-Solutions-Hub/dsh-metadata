# Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Overview and scope
- Datasets assessed: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands: Guernsey), (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Purpose: apply internal and external quality assessment to these land cover datasets to support consistent environmental monitoring and policy assessment.

## Internal quality control
- All work units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
- Finished units sent to independent photo-interpreter Geoff Smith; reviews used the InterCheck software with identical imagery/ancillary data.
- Feedback provided as exported shapefiles; interpreters revised accordingly.
- Each WU interpreted twice by two different interpreters to ensure consistency.

## External quality control
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014 to ensure UK output harmonises with European CLC2012 standards.
- Verification covered 7 WUs (about 19% of UK coverage); used a similar process to internal QC with InterCheck.
- External checks involved detailed visual review of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers, with errors recorded as points in shapefiles and accompanied by descriptive verification reports.

## External verification findings (typical errors)
- Omissions and misclassifications in CLC2006 layer, including:
  - Discontinuous built-up areas and infrastructure (e.g., industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Confusion between continuous urban fabric (111) and Industry (121).
  - Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132); green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
  - Arable (211) vs pasture (231) separation; pasture (231) vs natural grasslands (321).
  - Forest patches, forest boundaries, and mixed forest delineation; boundaries of moors/heathland (322) with natural grassland (321) and peatland (412).
  - Bare rocks (332) and sparse vegetation (333) classification issues.
  - Intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522) revisits.
- Mapping of changes generally correct but with occasional missed changes; some changes could not be mapped due to imagery limitations.
- Recommendations included: use the latest IMAGE2012 imagery for change mapping; ensure changes >5 ha are separated from complex change polygons.
- Full details referenced in Büttner (2013, 2014).

## Changes and mapping guidance
- Emphasis on using the latest available imagery to ensure change is captured accurately.
- Careful separation of large complex changes and small-scale changes (thresholds such as >5 ha).

## Outcomes and remediation
- All identified errors were addressed.
- Two WUs that were rejected were re-interpreted by a different interpreter after feedback and subsequent verification.
- Remarks and best practices from verifications were applied to all subsequent WUs to maintain high-quality outputs.
