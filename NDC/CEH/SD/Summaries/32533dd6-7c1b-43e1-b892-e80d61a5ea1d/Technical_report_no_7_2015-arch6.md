# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

- Overview
  - Metadata report for Copernicus CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012 and 2006-2012 changes across the UK, Guernsey, and Jersey.
  - Datasets describe land cover classes, area, and change information to support environmental monitoring and policy indicators.
  - Metadata adheres to INSPIRE/EEA guidelines; available in English; dataset-level metadata provided.

- Core content and technical details
  - Abstract and purpose
    - Provides Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2012 data and 2006-2012 change data; supports land cover monitoring, environmental indicators, and EU policy frameworks.
    - CLC uses 44 hierarchical classes; minimum mapping unit (MMU) for status layers is 25 ha; MMU for changes is 5 ha.
  - Update and methodology
    - Updated for reference year 2012; based on satellite imagery from 2011-2013; aerial imagery (e.g., Google Earth) used to support interpretation.
    - Unlike prior UK updates, no up-to-date national land cover map existed at update time; used InterChange with EEA guidelines to map changes.
  - Coverage and resolution
    - Geographic extent covers the UK (including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man) and Channel Islands.
    - Spatial resolution expressed with a denominator of 100,000 (coarser-scale thematic mapping suitable for regional/continental analyses).
  - Lineage and data quality
    - Data lineage describes the processing flow from satellite/aerial imagery to CLC2012 and change maps; supports tracking of changes from 2006 to 2012.
  - Access and use constraints
    - Data use governed by EU licensing; free, full, and open access with attribution and clear state of any modifications.
    - Users must acknowledge source and not imply Union endorsement; licensing framework references EU regulations (historical context provided).
  - Online resources and metadata
    - Metadata language: eng; dataset metadata aligned with INSPIRE/EEA guidelines.

- Relevance for data use and product development (Data Support perspective)
  - Provides standardized, cross-region land cover data and change information suitable for dashboards, reports, and self-serve analyses across UK and Channel Islands.
  - Clear datasets and layers enable integration with other spatial data (e.g., environmental indicators, policy monitoring).
  - Important considerations for use include licensing requirements, attribution, and recognition of the landscape-scale MMU differences when combining with higher-resolution datasets.
