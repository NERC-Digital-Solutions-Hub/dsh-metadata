Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Overview
- Datasets assessed: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands), (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Aim: document internal and external quality assessment measures applied to these datasets.

## Internal Quality Control
- Every Working Unit (WU) underwent internal quality control by two interpreters.
- An independent verifier (Geoff Smith) used InterCheck with the same imagery/ancillary data to re-check each WU; comments were returned as shapefiles and incorporated by interpreters.
- Process ensured that each WU was interpreted twice, improving consistency and accuracy.

## External Quality Control and Verification
- External verification conducted twice by the European Technical Team (CTT): July 2013 and September 2014.
- Purpose: verify UK production to ensure a harmonised European CLC2012 dataset.
- Method: similar visual checks to internal QC, using InterCheck; errors recorded as points with attributes and fed back with verification reports.

## External Verification Results
- Seven WUs were checked externally, representing 19% of UK coverage.
- Results categorized per WU as Accepted (A), Conditionally Accepted (CA), or Rejected (R); some WUs were clearly accepted with minor issues, others required revisions.
- Typical issues identified across the verification included the following, pointing to broader data and classification challenges:
  - Omissions of small built-up areas and infrastructure (e.g., industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Confusion between related classes (e.g., continuous urban fabric vs. Industry; arable vs. pasture; pasture vs. natural grasslands).
  - Inaccuracies in forest boundaries, patch delineation, and mixed forest classification.
  - Boundary issues for moors/heathland, peatland, and resource-related categories (mineral extraction, dumpsites).
  - Mapping of intertidal flats and estuaries requiring revisitation.
- Verification highlighted ongoing issues with the CLC2006 layer and recommended revisiting inherited problems.

## Change Mapping and Imagery Considerations
- Mapping changes was generally correct, but some changes were missed due to limited satellite imagery availability (IMAGE2012) at the time of interpretation.
- Important to correctly separate greater than 5-hectare changes from complex polygons.
- Guidance emphasized using the latest IMAGE2012 imagery for change mapping and ensuring up-to-date data to improve accuracy.

## Revisions and Outcomes
- All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
- Two WUs initially rejected were reinterpreted by a different interpreter using updated IMAGE2012 imagery.
- General advice and lessons were applied to subsequent WUs to maintain high data quality.

## Relevance for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Demonstrates a structured QA framework combining:
  - Internal quality control with independent double interpretation.
  - External, remote verification to ensure cross-border harmonisation.
  - Explicit error tagging, feedback loops, and documented verification criteria.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Using standardized tools (InterCheck) and consistent imagery (Image2012).
  - Addressing data gaps, metadata quality, and data governance.
  - Maintaining transparent reporting and revision history to support data sharing and governance.
- Provides concrete examples of typical data/classification issues to anticipate in environmental monitoring datasets and the need for ongoing revision and governance to maintain dataset quality over time.
