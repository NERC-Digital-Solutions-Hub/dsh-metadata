Centre for Landscape and Climate Research Department of Geography Technical Report No. 8

## Overview of datasets and purpose
- Datasets analyzed: 
  - CLC2012_UK.mdb (UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man)
  - CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands: Guernsey)
  - CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey)
- Objective: quality assessment to support harmonised European CLC2012 mapping and ensure data suitable for GIS-based map products.

## Internal quality control (QC)
- All work units (WUs) underwent internal QC.
- Finished units reviewed by independent photo-interpreter Geoff Smith using InterCheck.
- Each WU interpreted twice (two different interpreters) with feedback incorporated before finalisation.
- Process ensured consistent interpretation and error feedback loops prior to completion.

## External quality control (QC)
- Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) in July 2013 and September 2014.
- Purpose: verify UK production against European harmonisation standards.
- Verification covered a subset: 3 WUs in 2013 and 4 WUs in 2014 (total 7 WUs, about 19% of UK coverage).
- Method mirrored internal QC: detailed visual checks of CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012, with errors marked in shapefiles and accompanied by verification reports.
- Verification outcomes categorized per WU as Accepted (A), Conditioned Accepted (CA), or Rejected (R).

## Typical errors identified (CLC2006 layer and changes)
- Omissions in discontinuous built-up areas (including small urban areas) and infrastructure (industries, airports, wind turbines).
- Confusion between similar classes (e.g., continuous urban fabric 111 vs Industry 121).
- Inaccuracies in mineral extraction (131) and dumpsites (132); green urban areas (141) and sport/recreation (142).
- Problems distinguishing arable (211) and pasture (231); pasture (231) vs natural grasslands (321).
- Forest patches, boundaries, and mixed forest delineation issues; Moors/heathland (322) vs natural grassland (321); bare rocks (332) vs sparse vegetation (333).
- Inaccuracies in intertidal flats (423) and estuaries (522).
- Recommendations included re-assessing the CLC2006 layer and using IMAGE2012 imagery to improve change mapping.

## Change mapping and imagery considerations
- Changes were generally mapped correctly; some missed changes due to imagery limitations at the time.
- Guidelines emphasized: use the latest IMAGE2012 imagery; ensure changes greater than 5 hectares are separated out from complex change polygons.
- Full details available in Büttner (2013, 2014) verification reports.

## Outcomes and remediation
- All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
- Two WUs rejected and re-interpreted by a different interpreter using additional IMAGE2012 imagery.
- Feedback and verification remarks applied to all subsequent WUs to uphold high data quality.
