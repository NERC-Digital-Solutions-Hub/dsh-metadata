# Copernicus land CORINE metadata 2012

## Overview
- Metadata describing three CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012 datasets and changes (2006-2012) for the UK regions and Crown dependencies: (i) UK including Northern Ireland and Isle of Man, (ii) Guernsey, (iii) Jersey.
- Datasets comprise three layers each: CLC-Changes (2006-2012), CLC2006revised, and CLC2012.
- Context: produced within the Copernicus/GMES framework; reference year 2012; derived from satellite imagery (2011-2013) and supporting aerial imagery (Google Earth).
- Purpose: provide consistent land cover information and changes to support environmental monitoring, indicators, and policy reporting (EU Environmental Action Programs, Water Framework Directive, biodiversity, climate tracking, etc.).

## Lineage, purpose, and use

- Lineage
  - Based on satellite imagery from 2011-2013; supported by aerial imagery (Google Earth)
  - Followed EEA technical guidelines for producing CLC changes; no up-to-date national land cover map for the UK other than the 2007 LCM

- Purpose and applications
  - Produces consistent LCLU information for monitoring environmental change
  - Supports environmental indicators, policy development, and reporting for EU directives and environment programs

## Spatial extent and technical details

- Extent
  - Geographic bounding box: West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84
  - Spatial resolution: 1:100,000 denominator (approximate map scale)

- Technical notes
  - MMU (minimum mapping unit) for status layers: 25 hectares
  - MMU for land cover changes (LCC) layers: 5 hectares
  - National and regional projects compiled into a seamless Europe-wide map
