# Technical Report No. 8

## Executive Summary
- This report documents internal and external quality assessment measures applied to three datasets: (i) CLC2012_UK.mdb (covering the UK, including Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man), (ii) CLC2012_UK_GG.mdb (Channel Islands, Guernsey), and (iii) CLC2012_UK_JE (Jersey).
- Internal quality control: Working units (WUs) were reviewed by an independent photo-interpreter (Geoff Smith) using InterCheck software; each WU was interpreted twice by two different interpreters, with feedback returned as shapefiles and incorporated before completion.
- External quality control: Two remote verifications by the European Technical Team (CTT) occurred in 2013 and 2014 to ensure UK production met harmonised European CLC2012 standards. Seven WUs were checked externally, representing 19% of UK coverage.
- External verification process: Used InterCheck to perform detailed visual checks on CLC2006 revision and CLC-Changes2006-2012 layers; errors were recorded as points in shapefiles and accompanied by verification reports detailing error types.
- Findings: External verification highlighted several typical errors, especially in the CLC2006 layer, such as omissions of small built-up areas and infrastructure, misclassifications between urban fabric and industrial classes, issues with mineral extraction and dumpsites, and boundary inaccuracies among land cover types (e.g., arable vs. pasture, forest patches, moorland boundaries, intertidal zones).
- Change mapping: Emphasis on using the latest IMAGE2012 imagery and ensuring changes greater than 5 hectares are separated in complex polygons.
- Corrections: All identified errors were addressed. WUs initially rejected were reinterpreted by another interpreter using additional IMAGE2012 imagery; feedback was applied to subsequent units to maintain high-quality output.
- Implications: The verification reports underscore the need for thorough revision of the CLC2006 layer to achieve a harmonised European dataset. The process supports credible data products for end users and informs ongoing quality improvements.

## Internal quality control
- All WUs underwent internal quality control.
- An independent photo-interpreter re-evaluated each WU using identical imagery and ancillary data, with the InterCheck verification workflow.
- Feedback was provided as shapefiles and incorporated by interpreters; each WU was effectively double-interpreted.

## External quality control
- Two external verifications conducted by the European Technical Team (CTT) in 2013 and 2014.
- External checks covered seven WUs (19% of UK coverage) to assess harmonisation with European CLC2012 standards.
- Verification method mirrored internal process: detailed visual checks of layers, errors logged as points, and accompanied by verification reports describing error types.

## External verification results and typical errors
- Verification outcomes used a coding scheme: A (Accepted), CA (Conditionally Accepted), R (Rejected).
- Typical error categories identified across layers (notably CLC2006) included:
  - Omissions of small built-up areas and infrastructure (e.g., industries, airports, wind turbines).
  - Inaccurate separation between continuous urban fabric and industrial areas.
  - Misclassifications in mineral extraction, dumpsites, green urban areas, and sport/recreation.
  - Boundary ambiguities among land cover classes (e.g., arable vs. pasture; forest patches; moors/heathland vs. natural grassland; bare rocks vs. sparse vegetation).
  - Issues with intertidal flats and estuaries that required revisiting.
- These findings emphasized that earlier verifications had revealed ongoing inaccuracies in the CLC2006 layer, necessitating revision.

## Key issues identified and recommendations
- Revisions of the CLC2006 layer were crucial due to prior inaccuracies uncovered in earlier verifications.
- Recommendations included:
  - Use of the latest IMAGE2012 imagery to improve change detection accuracy.
  - Ensuring large-change polygons (>5 ha) are accurately separated in complex changes.
- Detailed error types and corrective actions were documented in the verification reports (Büttner, 2013; 2014).

## Actions and outcomes
- All identified errors were addressed and corrected.
- WUs initially rejected were re-interpreted by a different interpreter with access to additional IMAGE2012 imagery.
- Feedback and corrective remarks were incorporated into all subsequent WUs to ensure higher quality of the final database.
