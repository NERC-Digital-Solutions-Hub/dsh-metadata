# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

## Overview
- Context: The ESPA p4ges project in Madagascar aims to influence payment for global ecosystem services, focusing on carbon stock assessment within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
- Objective: Develop the first step of carbon quantification across four pools to support national and international ecosystem service initiatives.
- Pools covered in this manual: Aboveground biomass (AGB), litter, dead wood (DW), soil organic carbon (SOC), with belowground biomass (BGB) and other components considered in related work packages.
- Outputs: Sampling design, field methods, laboratory analyses, data handling, and data publication pathways; datasets archived for long-term valorization.

## Sampling Design and Zones of Interest
- Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) identified to capture CAZ representativeness:
  - ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, ZOI4 Didy
- Criteria for ZOI selection: biophysical factors (altitude, slope, bioclimate), deforestation history, and access.
- Zones chosen to reflect principal habitat conditions within CAZ.
- Land use types within sites (per WP2/WP5 inputs): closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty or degraded land, plus reforestation as identified through NGOs and community inputs.
- Site criteria for WP4: slope < 45 degrees; plots sized at least 120 m x 120 m; avoidance of edge effects, streams, and unusual disturbances; minimum 500 m between sites.
- Site sampling intensity: 16 plots per ZOI (4 land-use types × 4 replicates); extra plots added in each ZOI to capture C stock variability, yielding 28 sites in ZOI1, 48 in ZOI2, 28 in ZOI3, and 28 in ZOI4 (132 total sites).

## Sites Identification and Land Use Classification
- Field reconnaissance to verify remote-sensing site selections and assess land-use history, accessibility, and indicator species.
- Minimal area testing to determine representative sampling area: starting with 1 m x 1 m quadrats, expanding until species richness plateaued; determined that 16 m² is the minimal representative area for carbon stock quantification.
- Land use classification follows Styger et al. (2007) with additional reforestation category identified through stakeholder input.
- Each site corresponds to a land-use type; data and locations recorded and organized in site-specific datasets.

## Field Data Collection
- Administrative and preparatory steps: permits, mission orders, insurances; preparation of field forms and materials.
- Data collection forms (five types):
  - Site characteristics
  - Inventory (natural regeneration, standing and fallen dead wood, tree inventory)
  - Coverage percentage (Braun-Blanquet)
  - Sampling of saplings, litter, roots, understorey vegetation
  - Soil profile description
- Field tools and samples: forester compass, vertex, flags, quadrats, soil augers, cylinders, labeled sample bags.
- Plot design at plot level (general): single sampling method using circular plots with radii 2 m (saplings), 5 m (DBH 5–10 cm trees), 10 m (DBH 10–20 cm trees), and 20 m (DBH >20 cm trees) for biomass components; lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect.
- Aboveground biomass (AGB) by direct measurement in closed canopy:
  - Selection of 54 trees across four species based on relative contribution; trees felled, weighed by components (trunk, branches, leaves); fresh weights recorded; subsamples for moisture analysis.
  - Allometric or direct biomass estimates applied per tree to scale to plot-level biomass (Mg ha⁻¹) and carbon stock.
- Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat sampling:
  - Understorey: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; biomass weighed after oven-drying.
  - Litter and root mat: 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats; collected biomass weighed.
- Root sampling:
  - Center plot pit (1 m²) for root description and collection; roots categorized as medium (2–10 mm) and coarse (>10 mm); density and depth described.
- Percent cover:
  - Indicator species percent cover estimated within a 5 m radius circle using Braun-Blanquet scale.
- Soil sampling:
  - Soil carbon content via auger samples at 0–100 cm (10 cm intervals) and bulk density via cylinders (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm).
  - Soil profile description to 1.30 m depth at subplot 1; soil color (Munsell), texture, structure, roots, porosity recorded.
- Additional data gathered: GPS coordinates, slope, land-use history.

## Data Handling, Storage and Archiving
- Field data management:
  - Field forms scanned and stored in project archive.
  - Data entered into Excel; photos renamed and stored in project data center.
  - Data organized into data series and submitted to Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term storage and valorization.
- Samples management:
  - Field-collected samples sent to LRI laboratory; storage at room temperature and air-dried; samples tracked with field and lab numbers; worksheets prepared before analysis.

## Laboratory Analyses
- Biomass analysis:
  - Drying: samples air-dried, then oven-dried at 75°C until weight stabilization; moisture analysis via subsamples.
  - Wood specific gravity (WSG) determined (details in separate manual).
- Soil analyses:
  - Sample prep: air-dry, sieve to 2 mm, reweight coarse fraction; grind to 200 microns for conventional analyses.
  - Moisture content via drying at 105°C (48 hours).
  - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon (SOC) content; calibration with Mohr’s salt.
  - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for soil carbon content with reference to Walkley-Black results.
  - δ13C stable isotope analysis for selected samples (France’s LBMP) to study carbon dynamics across land uses; datasets archived at EIDC.

## Data Processing and Carbon Stock Calculations
- Aboveground biomass (AGB):
  - Use allometry or direct measurement to estimate biomass per tree (kg tree⁻¹); sum per plot and scale to Mg ha⁻¹.
  - Carbon stock per tree/plot derived from biomass via established conversion factors (e.g., Brown 2002).
  - Floristic analyses (richness, diversity) and spatial structure considered for biomass interpretation.
- Litter, understorey vegetation, and root mats:
  - Dry weights converted to plot-level densities and scaled to Mg ha⁻¹; carbon stock calculated using 0.5 conversion factor (Brown 2002).
- Dead wood:
  - Lying DW: volume computed from diameters intercepted on 100 m transect; biomass calculated as volume × density; summed per plot.
  - Standing DW: biomass computed from volume × density using standard allometric approaches.
- Soil organic carbon (SOC):
  - SOC stock per depth layer computed as SOC = Σ(BD_i × C_i × (1 − CF) × t_i × 0.1), where BD is bulk density (g cm⁻³), C_i is soil carbon content (g kg⁻¹), CF is coarse fraction percentage, t_i is layer thickness (cm).
  - SOC calculated for 0–30 cm (SOC30) and 0–100 cm (SOC100); equivalent mass method used to address density differences across land-use types.
- Scaling:
  - All pool measurements scaled from plot-level densities to per-hectare estimates.

## Data Publication and Access
- Data and findings published in scientific papers and disseminated through international and national events.
- Datasets and data products archived at EIDC for long-term storage and accessibility to stakeholders and researchers.
- Referenced publications include studies on soil organic carbon mapping, carbon stock changes due to land-use change, and related soil carbon dynamics in Madagascar.
