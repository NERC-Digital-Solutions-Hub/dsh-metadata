# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

## Context and Objectives
- Project aims to influence the development and implementation of payments for global ecosystem services at an international scale, focusing on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
- Targets five carbon pools (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter layer, dead wood, soil organic carbon) across multiple land uses.
- Data generated are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and are intended for long-term storage, valorisation, and publication.

## Sampling Design and Zones of Interest (ZOI)
- Four ZOIs identified to capture representative conditions of CAZ: Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy.
- ZOIs chosen based on biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, climate, soil), deforestation history, and access.
- Land use classifications: closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty/degraded land; reforestation included per NGO/local input.
- Site criteria beyond land use: slope < 45 degrees, plots near patch centers to avoid edge effects, each site >= 120m x 120m, avoid disturbances (e.g., mining), avoid watercourses, spacing between sites >= 500m.
- Sampling intensity: 16 plots per ZOI (4 land uses x 4 replicates); WP4 adds extra plots to capture C stock variability.
  - Total sites: ZOI1 Lakato 28; ZOI2 Andasibe 48; ZOI3 Anjahamana 28; ZOI4 Didy 28.
  - Site locations identified via remote sensing; each site corresponds to a single land use.

## Field Reconnaissance and Minimal Area
- Field reconnaissance to verify suitability, assess indicator species, collect land-use history, and confirm accessibility.
- Minimal area test conducted (July 2014) to determine representative sampling area; concluded 16 m² as the minimal area needed for carbon stock quantification.

## Administrative and Field Preparations
- Pre-field duties include permits, mission orders, and insurances.
- Field forms prepared: five types covering site characteristics, inventory (standing and dead wood, saplings, etc.), percent cover (Braun-Blanquet), and soil/roots.
- Equipment and sample bags prepared; labeling and precise weighing scales used for samples.

## Design Sampling at Plot Level
- General design: one plotting unit with a 5 m radius for all C pools; degraded land also uses this method.
- Closed canopy and land-use fallows:
  - Four subplots arranged as concentric circles for different measurements:
    - 2 m radius: saplings (DBH < 5 cm; height > 1.3 m) identified by species; 5 randomly selected saplings weighed and sampled.
    - 5 m radius: living trees and standing dead wood (DBH 5–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20+ cm) with heights recorded; local names recorded.
    - 10 m radius: DBH and height for larger trees; additional data for standing dead wood density class (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten).
    - 20 m radius: diameter, height, local names for trees >20 cm; lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect (intercept method) with density classification.
  - Direct aboveground biomass estimation: 54 trees sampled and felled for component weights (trunk, branches, leaves); humidity tests conducted in lab.
  - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: sampled within central subplots using 25 cm x 25 cm quadrats (litter/root mat) and 1 m x 1 m quadrats (understorey); samples sent to lab.
  - Root sampling: 1 m² soil pit at plot center; roots categorized as medium (<10 mm) and coarse (>10 mm); roots washed, weighed, and described; root depth distribution documented.
  - Percent cover: indicator species percent cover estimated within a 5 m radius plot using Braun-Blanquet scale.
- Degraded land (tany maty): no trees beyond 5 cm DBH; biomass, root mat, litter, understorey sampled as per same design; soil sampling conducted as in other land uses.
- Soil sampling: conducted in the same subplots; two methods for carbon and bulk density:
  - Auger sampling for soil carbon (0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments).
  - Cylinder sampling for bulk density (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm); moisture measurements also taken.
- Soil profile description: in subplot 1 pit (1.3 m depth) to document horizons, color (Munsell), texture, structure, root distribution, and porosity.

## Data Handling, Archiving, and Sample Management
- Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel; photos organized and stored in project data center.
- Data arranged in time-series and uploaded to EIDC for long-term storage.
- Samples transported to LRI laboratory; field-to-lab tracking ensured with lab numbers and provenance.
- Laboratory handling: samples stored at room temperature; correlation between field and lab records maintained.

## Laboratory Analyses
- Biomass: samples dried in oven at 75°C to stable weight; used to determine dry biomass; wood specific gravity (WSG) assessed in separate analyses (Manual n°4 reference).
- Soil analyses:
  - Drying and sieving to 2 mm; coarse fractions separated and weighed.
  - Moisture content determined by drying at 105°C.
  - Walkley-Black method for rapid soil organic carbon; calibration with MIRS for broader SOC estimates.
  - δ13C stable isotope analyses performed on select soil samples (France-based LBMP) to study carbon dynamics and land-use signals.
- All soil analyses detailed in Manual n°3.

## Data Handling and Carbon Stock Computation
- Data-driven carbon stock calculations across all pools:
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) derived via allometric equations (tree-level biomass from measurements; densities aggregated to plot and scaled to per hectare).
  - Conversion to carbon stock per tree, plot, and hectare using established coefficients (Brown 2002; multiple allometry sources).
  - Understorey, litter, and root biomass scaled to 1 hectare with similar allometric/logging approaches.
  - Dead wood (lying and standing) calculated using volume and density methods:
    - Lying dead wood: volume from intercepts along 100 m transect; biomass via piecewise density classes.
    - Standing dead wood: volume and density-based biomass estimation.
  - Soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks calculated per site and depth using bulk density, soil carbon content, coarse-fraction adjustment, and layer thickness; SOC30 and SOC100 considered for depth-specific stocks.
  - Equivalent mass method used to account for soil density differences across land uses.
- Data structure supports cross-site comparison and long-term monitoring of carbon stocks.
