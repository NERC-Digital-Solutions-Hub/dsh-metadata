# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Aims: Assess carbon stocks across Ankeniheny-Zahamena Corridor (CAZ) in Madagascar to inform pay-for-ecosystem-services strategies. Focuses on carbon stock quantification across five IPCC-defined pools (Aboveground biomass, Belowground biomass, Litter, Dead wood, Soil Organic Carbon) and the first step of carbon quantification design for the CAZ forest ecosystem, with datasets archived for long-term use.

## Study design and zones

- Project scope: Carbon survey conducted by WP4 as part of the p4ges project; results feed national-scale soil organic carbon mapping and poverty reduction analyses.
- Zones of Interest (ZOI): Four representative zones capturing CAZ diversity
  - ZOI1 Lakato
  - ZOI2 Andasibe
  - ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra
  - ZOI4 Didy
- Site identification and criteria
  - Land uses (LU) classified into four types plus reforestation: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty or degraded land; reforestation identified via NGO/local community input.
  - Additional requirements from WP2 (Hydrology) and WP5 (Biodiversity): slope < 45 degrees; patches centered to minimize edge effects; each site ≥ 120 m × 120 m; avoid disturbances (e.g., mining); transects away from streams; spacing ≥ 500 m between sites.
- Sampling intensity
  - Each ZOI targeted 16 plots (4 LU types × 4 replicates).
  - Extra plots were added within each ZOI to capture carbon stock variability, resulting in counts: ZOI1 has 28 sites, ZOI2 has 48 sites, ZOI3 has 28 sites, ZOI4 has 28 sites.

## Field sampling and plots

- Field reconnaissance and minimal area test
  - Field reconnaissance by biophysical WPs to verify suitability and land-use classification.
  - Minimal-area test established a representative sampling unit; a 16 m² area was determined as sufficient for carbon stock quantification.
- Plot design and measurements
  - General plot design: Plot with circular sampling areas encompassing multiple nested radii for different measurements.
  - For biomass and inventory in closed canopy and fallows:
    - Four concentric sampling zones within a circular plot to quantify different size classes and biomass components:
      - 2 m radius: saplings (DBH < 5 cm, height > 1.30 m) by species, five randomly selected saplings weighed.
      - 5 m radius: trees with DBH 5–10 cm and height measured; local names recorded.
      - 10 m radius: trees with DBH 10–20 cm.
      - 20 m radius: trees with DBH > 20 cm; measurements include DBH, height, local name; standing dead wood observed (wood density category S/I/R).
    - Lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect through plot center; record diameter where transect intersects and wood density category.
    - Direct aboveground biomass: in closed canopy, 54 trees across four species were felled and weighed by trunk, branches, and leaves; humidity samples collected for lab analysis.
    - Understorey vegetation (1 m × 1 m plots) and litter/ root mat (25 cm × 25 cm quadrats) within central subplots and adjacent sampling points; biomass weighed and samples sent to the lab.
    - Root description and sampling: 1 m² soil pit per plot center to classify roots by diameter (<2 mm MR vs >10 mm CR); roots washed, weighed, and described along soil profile.
    - Percent cover: estimated for indicator species within a 5 m radius (78.54 m²) using Braun-Blanquet scale.
  - For degraded land (tany maty): no tree inventory; biomass, root description, litter, and understorey sampling performed per the same plot design; soil sampling identical to other LUs.
- Soil sampling and profiling
  - Soil samples collected in the same subplots used for understorey sampling (Points 1–4).
  - Two methods per plot:
    - Soil carbon content by auger: 0–100 cm depth in 10 cm increments (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 30–40, 40–50, 50–60, 60–70, 70–80, 80–90, 90–100 cm).
    - Bulk density by cylinders (8.1 cm diameter, 10 cm height) at depths 0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm.
  - Soil profile description in a central soil pit (1.30 m deep) to document horizons, colors (Munsell), textures, structures, root depth, porosity.
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, and deforestation history from local interviews.

## Laboratory analyses and data handling

- Sample management
  - Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel; photos archived in project data center; datasets sent to Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term storage.
  - Lab numbering: samples assigned field and lab IDs; sample tracking lists prepared before analysis.
- Biomass analysis
  - Drying: air-dried then oven-dried at 75°C; weight stabilized (typically ~48 hours, longer for large samples).
  - Wood specific gravity (WSG) determined as part of biomass work (detailed in another manual).
  - Biomass per tree calculated via allometry; biomass per plot scaled to per-hectare (Mg/ha) to derive carbon stocks using species-specific allometric equations and general equations from Chave et al. and Brown (2002) for carbon conversion.
- Soil analysis
  - Sample preparation: air-dried, sieved to 2 mm, coarse fragments separated; soil ground to 200 µm for analysis.
  - Moisture: oven-dried at 105°C for 48 hours.
  - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon (SOC) content calibration.
  - Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for rapid SOC estimation, calibrated against Walkley-Black results.
  - Stable carbon isotopes: δ13C analyses at selected depths and land-use types (via LBMP Montpellier) to study carbon dynamics and land-use classification.
- Data handling and carbon stock calculations
  - Aboveground biomass: use allometry to estimate biomass per tree; sum per plot; convert to per-hectare density; carbon stock per pool via standard conversion.
  - Litter, understorey vegetation, and root biomass: dry weights scaled to 1 ha; carbon stock calculated using Brown (2002) conversion factor.
  - Dead wood:
    - Lying dead wood: volume estimated from a transect-based formula using diameters and transect length; biomass calculated with wood density categories.
    - Standing dead wood: biomass calculated from volume and density; summation across trees per plot.
  - Soil organic carbon stock (SOC):
    - SOC per depth layer calculated as SOC = Σ(BDi × Ci × (1 − CFi) × ti × 0.1), with BD: bulk density, Ci: carbon content, CFi: fraction of coarse material, ti: layer thickness; SOC stocks computed for 0–30 cm (SOC30) and 0–100 cm (SOC100).
    - Equivalent mass method used to account for density differences among land-use types.
- Data publication and outputs
  - Data and results prepared for publication; several peer-reviewed articles cited (e.g., Madagascar soil carbon mapping, land-use change impacts on carbon stocks).
  - Datasets archived at EIDC and related outputs published in scientific outlets; datasets intended to be discoverable and reusable.
