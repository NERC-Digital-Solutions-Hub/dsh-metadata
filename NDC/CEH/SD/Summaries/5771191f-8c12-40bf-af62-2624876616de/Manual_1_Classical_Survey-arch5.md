# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Context and aims
  - The p4ges project in Madagascar investigates paying for global ecosystem services to reduce poverty, focusing on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ).
  - This manual documents the carbon survey design and data generation for WP4, focusing on Aboveground Biomass (AGB), litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon (SOC).
  - Data produced are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) and other outputs (e.g., photos) are stored in institutional data centers for long-term storage and valorization.

- Data governance and stewardship orientation
  - Work conducted across multiple WPs (biophysical, hydrology, biodiversity) with data governance and standardization embedded in the design.
  - Documentation of datasets and workflows to support reproducibility, traceability, and future reuse.
  - Data lifecycle management includes data collection forms, field and lab records, sample tracking, and archiving in EIDC; data series are prepared for long-term storage and sharing.
  - Laboratory work and field data are linked via lab numbers and provenance records to ensure traceability.

- Design and scope of data collection
  - Zones of Interest (ZOI): four representative zones (Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana/Ambalarondra, Didy) selected using biophysical criteria, deforestation history, and access considerations.
  - Land uses (LU): closed canopy, tree fallow, shrub fallow, tany maty/degraded land; reforestation identified via NGO and community input.
  - Site identification criteria: slope < 45 degrees; plots ≥ 120 m × 120 m; avoid edge/disturbance areas; transects not crossing streams; at least 500 m between sites.
  - Sampling density: 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU × 4 replicates), with extra plots in CAZ to capture carbon stock variability; totals by ZOI: 28 (ZOI1), 48 (ZOI2), 28 (ZOI3), 28 (ZOI4).

- Field reconnaissance and minimal-area testing
  - Field reconnaissance to verify suitability of remotely identified sites, confirm land-use type, accessibility, and collect indicator species data.
  - Minimal-area test (July 2014) to determine the representative sampling area; concluded 16 m² as the minimum area for C stock quantification.

- Field administration and field documentation
  - Administrative groundwork: permits, mission orders, and insurance.
  - Field forms (five types): site characteristics; inventory (including regeneration, standing/downed dead wood, tree inventory); Braun-Blanquet cover; sampling of saplings, litter, roots, understory; soil profile description.
  - Equipment and sample handling materials defined (compasses, Vertex, flags, augers, quadrats, labeled bags, scales).

- Design of sampling at plot level
  - A common plot design with a 5 m radius for all C pools, plus nested subplots for biomass, saplings, trees (by DBH classes), and litter/understorey sampling.
  - Lying dead wood surveyed along a 100 m transect; diameter and wood density recorded for each piece.

- Aboveground biomass and other pools
  - Direct AGB assessment for a subset of trees in closed canopy plots: 54 trees measured, felled, and weighed by components (trunk, branches, leaves) with moisture analysis in lab.
  - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: sampled with 1 m × 1 m plots (understorey) and 25 cm × 25 cm quadrats (litter/root mats); biomass weighed and prepared for lab analysis.
  - Root sampling: soil pits (1 m²) at plot centers to categorize roots by diameter and describe distribution with depth.
  - Percent cover estimation using Braun-Blanquet scale for indicator species within a 5 m radius around each site.

- Soil sampling and soil analysis
  - Two parallel soil sampling strategies in each subplot: auger sampling for carbon content (0–100 cm, in 10 cm increments) and cylinder sampling for bulk density (0–10, 10–20, 20–30, 50–60, 80–90 cm).
  - Soil profile description in a central 1.3 m depth pit to document horizons, color (Munsell), texture, structure, rooting depth, and porosity.
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.
  - Soil analyses include Walkley-Black (for soil organic carbon), Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC estimation, and δ13C for carbon provenance and dynamics.

- Data handling and data lifecycle
  - Field forms scanned and stored; data entered into Excel; photos organized and stored in a project data center; datasets archived at EIDC as ESPA WP4 data for long-term storage.
  - Lab samples tracked with lab numbers; sample provenance linked to field data; methods standardized to ensure traceability across field and lab work.

- Biomass and carbon stock computation
  - Biomass and carbon stocks calculated using allometry (tree-level and plot-level scaling) and standard conversion factors (e.g., 0.5 biomass-to-carbon coefficient).
  - Litter, understory, and root stocks converted to plot-level and then to per-hectare (Mg ha−1) using established upscaling factors.
  - Dead wood calculations for lying and standing stock using geometry-based volume approaches and category densities (Sound, Intermediate, Rotten).
  - Soil organic carbon stocks computed per depth layer (SOC30 and SOC100) using bulk density, carbon content, and coarse fraction adjustments; equivalent mass method also considered to account for density differences across land uses.

- Data publication and references
  - Data published or in process of publication; multiple scholarly outputs cited to contextualize methods and results (soil carbon mapping, land-use change impacts, and soil carbon variability).

- Key challenges for data management
  - Aligning diverse user needs and priorities; obtaining timely data from field sources; ensuring data creators meet metadata and standardization requirements; interoperability across multiple systems and formats; handling large datasets and legacy databases.
