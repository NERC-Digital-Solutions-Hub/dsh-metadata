# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Site_description_Ankeniheny_Zahamena_forest_corridor_Madagascar.csv

## Overview
- Describes topographical characteristics for each sampling site within the Ankeniheny-Zahamena forest corridor, Madagascar.
- Associated with ESPA and the P4GES project; acknowledgement required for outputs derived from these data.
- Includes data provenance such as the DOI and involved institutions (e.g., Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo).

## Key variables and formats
- site_ID: Text string; P4GES site code. Unit: none. Purpose: unique site identifier.
- ZOI (Zone of Interest): Categorical; zones include Lakato, Andasibe, Anjahamana, Didy.
- Location: Text string; name of the sampling point location. Unit: none.
- LU (Land use type): Categorical; categories include Closed Canopy, Tree Savoka, Shrub Savoka, Degraded Land.
- Type: Categorical; indicates Transect or Plot. Note: Transect means exclusively WP4 site; Plot means common site with other work packages.
- X: Numeric; Longitude (east) in decimal degrees (WGS84). Source: GPS eTrex 30 Garmin.

- Precision: Numeric; GPS precision in meters.
- slope_up: Numeric; slope upward at the site in degrees.
- slope_down: Numeric; slope downward at the site in degrees.
- topographic_position: Text string; position on the slope (e.g., Mid side, High side, Low side).
- age_of_deforest: Numeric; estimated age of deforestation in years (from field interviews, average).
- age_of_fallow: Numeric; estimated age of fallows in years (from field interviews, average).
- Historic: Text string; historic information about the site based on local interviews.

## Data collection and provenance
- Data are collected as part of field surveys for topographical characteristics of sites.
- X, Y coordinates in decimal degrees using GPS (eTrex 30 Garmin).
- Slope measurements (slope_up, slope_down) with a sunnto MC-2 compass and mirror clinometer.
- Age_of_deforest and age_of_fallow derived from local field interviews.
- Historic information derived from local people interviews.
- Local resources noted for fieldwork include botanists and local guides.

## How to use
- Create dashboards or pivot tables to enable self-service exploration of site topography and land-use patterns.
- Combine with other datasets (e.g., environmental or policy data) for broader analyses.
- Maintain proper attribution to ESPA, P4GES, and the contributing institutions when using outputs.
