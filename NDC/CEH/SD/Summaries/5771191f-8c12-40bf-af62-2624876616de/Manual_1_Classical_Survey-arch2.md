# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°1)

- Purpose and context: The p4ges project in Madagascar aims to influence the development and international implementation of payments for ecosystem services to alleviate poverty. WP4 focuses on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena Corridor (CAZ) using IPCC-defined pools.

- Primary aim: Establish a standardized carbon quantification basis within CAZ by surveying key carbon pools across representative land uses and zones.

## Scope and key concepts

- Carbon pools (IPCC 2006): Aboveground biomass (AGB), Belowground biomass (BGB), Litter, Dead wood (DW), Soil organic carbon (SOC).
- Study area: CAZ in eastern Madagascar, with emphasis on capturing variability across land uses and biophysical conditions.
- Output format: Data and analyses designed to support consistent carbon stock estimates for monitoring and policy assessment.

## Zones of Interest and site selection

- Zone of Interest (ZOI): Four zones chosen to represent CAZ diversity:
  - ZOI1 Lakato
  - ZOI2 Andasibe
  - ZOI3 Anjahamana/Ambalarondra
  - ZOI4 Didy
- Biophysical criteria: altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soil type.
- Additional considerations: deforestation history and access.
- Land uses (LU): Four primary uses identified (based on Styger et al. 2007) plus reforestation:
  - Closed canopy
  - Tree fallow
  - Shrub fallow
  - Tany maty (degraded land)
  - Reforestation identified via NGO/ community inputs
- Site criteria (for WP4 and other WPs): slope < 45°, plots near patch center to avoid edge effects, minimum 120 m × 120 m, avoid disturbances (e.g., mining), avoid streams, distance between sites ≥ 500 m.
- Number and location of sites:
  - Biophysical planning targeted 16 plots per ZOI (4 LU × 4 replicates).
  - Extra plots to capture carbon stock variability: total sites per ZOI vary (e.g., ZOI1 Lakato 28 sites, ZOI2 Andasibe 48 sites, ZOI3 Anjahamana 28 sites, ZOI4 Didy 28 sites).

## Field reconnaissance and sampling design

- Field reconnaissance: Multi-WP team verifies suitability of remote-sensed sites, notes indicator species and land-use history, and assesses accessibility.
- Minimal area test: In July 2014, quadrat sampling (starting at 1 m², doubling area) to determine the minimal sampling area; results indicate 16 m² as the representative minimal area for carbon stock quantification.
- Administrative and field prep: permits, mission orders, insurances; standard forms, equipment, sample bags prepared for field work.

## Sampling design at plot level

- General plot design: A circular plot with a 5 m radius for carbon pools in all land uses (except a single method for degraded land).
- Subplot structure and sampling by LU:
  - Closed canopy and fallows:
    - Forest inventory with four concentric sub-areas (2 m, 5 m, 10 m, 20 m radii) to measure saplings, DBH/height of trees, standing dead wood, and lying dead wood across relevant diameter classes.
    - Aboveground biomass by direct measurement: selective felling of 54 trees (four species) to measure trunk/branch/leaves biomass; lab moisture analysis for dry weight.
    - Understorey vegetation, litter, and root mat: sampling with 25 cm × 25 cm quadrat for litter/root mat; 1 m × 1 m quadrats for understorey vegetation; samples sent to lab.
    - Root description and sampling: 1 m² pit at plot center; roots classified as Medium Root (MR, 2–10 mm) or Coarse Root (CR, >10 mm); depth and distribution recorded.
    - Percent cover: Braun-Blanquet scale (8-category) for indicator species within a 5 m radius.
  - Degraded land / tany maty:
    - No tree inventory due to lack of larger trees; biomass, litter, root mat, understorey sampling follow same general design; data include soil carbon stock and root descriptions.
- Soil sampling:
  - Conducted in the same subplots as understorey sampling.
  - Bulk density sampling: cylinders at depths down to 90–100 cm (various depths).
  - Carbon sampling: soil auger at 0–100 cm in 10 cm increments.
  - Soil profile description: description of horizons, color (Munsell), textures, root abundance, porosity to 1.3 m depth.
  - Additional site data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history.

## Laboratory analyses and data handling

- Sample handling: Field samples sent to LRI (Laboratoire des Radioisotopes) in Antananarivo; storage at room temperature and air-dried; lab numbers assigned to each sample.
- Biomass analysis:
  - Drying to constant weight (75°C) for biomass; moisture analysis on subsamples.
  - Wood Specific Gravity (WSG) determined (via separate manual).
- Soil analyses:
  - Preparation: air-drying, sieving to 2 mm, grinding to 200 μm for standard analyses.
  - Moisture determination by drying at 105°C.
  - Walkley-Black method for soil organic carbon as calibration reference.
  - Mid Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for soil carbon content prediction using reference Walkley-Black results.
  - Stable isotope analysis (δ13C) for selected samples at LBMP Montpellier for carbon dynamics across land uses.
- Data entry and archiving:
  - Field forms scanned and stored; field data entered into Excel; photos stored at Bangor University data center.
  - All data organized into series and archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Data storage and publication: Data and publications prepared for dissemination; multiple papers cited from 2016 onward addressing soil organic carbon mapping, carbon stock changes, and land-use impacts.

## Data analysis and carbon stock calculation

- Aboveground biomass (AGB) and carbon stock:
  - Use allometry to estimate tree biomass from dendrometric variables (DBH, height, wood density); biomass per plot scaled to Mg ha⁻¹.
  - Carbon stock derived by applying carbon content coefficients and standard conversions (e.g., Brown 2002).
  - Alternative allometry from literature (e.g., Chave et al., Vielledent et al.) used where appropriate.
  - Biomass by strata: tree-level and lower strata (understorey) analyzed with floristic structure and spatial distribution considerations.
- Litter, understorey vegetation, root mat, and dead wood:
  - Densities converted to plot- and hectare-level stocks; carbon stock estimates use the same 0.5 conversion factor as aboveground estimates.
  - Dead wood: volumes and densities used to compute biomass for lying and standing dead wood.
- Soil carbon stocks:
  - SOC stock calculated per depth layer using bulk density, soil carbon content, coarse fraction correction, and layer thickness.
  - SOC30 and SOC100 depth calculations included to account for depth-related carbon stocks.
  - Equivalent mass method used to normalize soil density differences across land uses.
- Overall: Total carbon stock per plot and per hectare across all pools aggregated to generate CAZ-wide estimates and support comparative analyses over time and land-use changes.
