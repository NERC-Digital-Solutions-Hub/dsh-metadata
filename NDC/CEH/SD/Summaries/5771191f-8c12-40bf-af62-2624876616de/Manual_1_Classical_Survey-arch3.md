# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Context and Aim
  - Aims to influence the development and implementation of payment for ecosystem services at international scale, focusing on carbon stocks in the Ankeniheny-Zahamena Forest Corridor (CAZ) in eastern Madagascar.
  - The manual supports carbon stock quantification across aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, dead wood, and soil organic carbon (SOC) and forms the basis for all carbon quantification within CAZ.

- Study design and Zones of Interest (ZOI)
  - Four Zones of Interest (ZOI) identified to capture Representativeness of CAZ: Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana/Ambalarondra (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - ZOI selection considered biophysical criteria (altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soils), deforestation history, and access.

- Site identification and land use
  - Land uses defined: Closed canopy, Tree fallow, Shrub fallow, Tany maty / Degraded land; reforestation identified via NGOs/local communities and included.
  - Site criteria (WP4 and WP2/WP5 needs): slope < 45 degrees; transects near habitat center to minimize edge effects; each site ≥ 120 m x 120 m; avoid unusual disturbances and streams; sites at least 500 m apart.
  - Sampling in each ZOI: 16 plots (4 land-use types x 4 replicates); additional plots within each ZOI to capture carbon stock variability.
  - Totals: ZOI1 had 28 sites, ZOI2 had 48, ZOI3 had 28, ZOI4 had 28.

- Field reconnaissance and minimal area
  - Field reconnaissance to verify remote-sensing site suitability, record land-use history, assess indicator species, and confirm accessibility.
  - Minimal area test established 16 m² as the representative area for carbon stock quantification; inventory extended to confirm sufficiency.

- Field procedures and data collection
  - Administrative and preparatory steps: permits, mission orders, insurances; forms and documents prepared for field use.
  - Field data collection sheets (five types) cover site characteristics, inventory (regeneration, standing deadwood, trees), percent cover (Braun-Blanquet), sampling of saplings, litter, roots, and soil profile descriptions.
  - Equipment and sample management: compasses, vertex, calipers, flags; sample bags; labeling and precise weighing equipment; data scanned and stored; photos archived; field data archived at EIDC.

- Design sampling and plot-level methods
  - Plot-level design: single 5 m radius circle for all C pools, with additional subplots:
    - 2 m radius: saplings (DBH<5 cm, H>1.30 m) by species; random 5 species weighed and sampled.
    - 5 m radius: measure DBH and height for living and standing dead wood 5–10 cm DBH.
    - 10 m radius: DBH and height for trees 10–20 cm DBH.
    - 20 m radius: DBH, height, and local name for trees >20 cm DBH; standing dead wood additionally measured at top and base; lying dead wood measured along a 100 m transect.
  - Degraded land (tany maty): no trees >5 cm; biomass, root mat, litter, and understory sampled with the same design.

- Biomass, soil, and other data collection
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB): direct measurement on a subset of 54 trees in closed canopy; trees felled, separated into trunk/branch/leaves, weighed in-field, humidity samples collected; allometric equations applied to scale to plot and hectare levels; C stock derived from biomass using standard conversion.
  - Understorey, litter, and root mat: collected from central subplots and peripheral points; 25 cm x 25 cm litter/root mats; 1 m x 1 m understory quadrats; samples sent to laboratory for analysis.
  - Root sampling: 1 m² soil pit at plot center; roots classified as medium (<10 mm) and coarse (>10 mm); density, depth distribution recorded.
  - Percent cover: indicator species assessed within 5 m radius using Braun-Blanquet scale.
  - Soil sampling: bulk density via cylinders; carbon via auger samples down to 100 cm (0–10 to 90–100 cm in 10 cm increments); soil profile description to 1.30 m depth (color, texture, structure, roots, porosity).
  - Additional data: GPS coordinates, slope, deforestation history gathered from local interviews.

- Laboratory analyses and data handling
  - Sample handling: field samples sent to LRI lab; drying and preparation conducted; lab numbering linked to field provenance; data entered into Excel; photos stored at Bangor University data center; data series archived at EIDC.
  - Biomass analysis: oven-drying at 75°C; moisture checks; wood specific gravity (WSG) determined; allometry applied to estimate biomass per tree and per plot; carbon stock derived (per Brown 2002).
  - Soil analysis: sample prep (air-dry, sieve to 2 mm, ground to 200 µm); moisture content determined by drying at 105°C; Walkley-Black method for initial SOC; Mid-Infrared Spectroscopy (MIRS) for SOC predictions; δ13C stable isotope analysis for selected samples (France) to study carbon dynamics and land-use signatures.
  - SOC stock calculations: SOC (Mg C ha⁻¹) computed by summing across soil layers (0–30 cm or 0–100 cm) using bulk density, carbon content, coarse fraction correction, and layer thickness; both SOC30 and SOC100 considered for land-use comparisons.

- Data processing and publication
  - Data processing focuses on carbon stock calculations for all pools across all sites; allometric approaches and species composition inform biomass and C stock estimates; rooftop of methods integrates forest inventory data with biomass and soil results.
  - Data publication: results and related papers listed (examples include soil organic carbon mapping in Madagascar, impact of land-use changes on carbon stocks, and soil carbon variability studies); data contributed to and archived in relevant repositories (EIDC) with reference to ongoing publications.

- Data governance, openness, and challenges (relevant to monitoring framework authors)
  - Emphasis on data archiving, data provenance, and shared data management through EIDC and associated centers; field forms, metadata, lab numbering, and data series are standardized for traceability.
  - Data sharing and openness balanced with governance requirements (labelling, archiving, and data center storage), documenting data lineage from field collection to published outputs.
  - Methodological consistency across zones and land uses helps reduce duplication and supports comparability; extensive attention to site representativeness, repeatability, and documented procedures.
