# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rainwater   (2004-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Overview
- Rainwater samples were collected and analyzed for anions and nutrients as part of the LOCAR programme.
- Study covered 7 sites across Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments between 2004 and 2006.

## Variables measured and units
- Alkalinity (as CaCO3) in mg/l
- Ammonia (as N) in mg/l
- Chloride-ion (Cl−) in mg/l
- Conductivity at 20 °C in uS/cm
- Nitrate (as N) in mg/l
- pH (pH units)
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) in mg/l P
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD) in mg/l SiO2
- Sulphate (SO4) in mg/l

## Where and when measurements occurred
- Sites (with codes): CEH Winfrith FP04; Higher Came Farm FP13; Lower Wraxall Farm FP35; Warren Farm PL06; Frilsham Meadow PL11; Helshaw Grange TE11; Oakley Folly TE17 (all RNWQ rainwater quality samples)
- Catchments: Frome/Piddle (FP), Pang/Lambourn (PL), Tern (TE)
- Sampling frequency: Fortnightly in Pang/Lambourn and Tern; roughly monthly in Frome/Piddle
- Measurement period: January 2004 – May 2006

## How measurements were conducted
- Rainwater collectors were collected and returned to the lab for analysis; samples for pH and alkalinity in glass bottles; SRP filtered; other determinands unfiltered.
- Analyses performed by Thames Water using Seal discrete analysers with specified calibration and reporting protocols.
- Nitrate values converted to mg/l N using the factor X*14/64.

## Who collected and processed data
- Field collection by Catchment Service Team; samples sent to Thames Water for laboratory analysis.
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water; a duplicate and a QC sample were sent weekly for cross-checks.

## Data quality, metadata, and processing notes
- Frome and Piddle data lack a timestamp (recorded as 00:00 when samples were returned).
- A variety of quality indicators accompany results (e.g., mean % of calibrations, uncertainty, and detection limits for each analyte).
- Data processing included generation of box-and-whisker plots to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Nitrate reported as mg/l NO3 and converted to mg/l N per the specified formula.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured QA approach with lab-based analyses and weekly QC checks.
- Highlights metadata gaps (missing time stamps) that can hinder temporal alignment and trend analysis.
- Shows the need for clear data provenance (site/catchment codes, measurement methods, and processing steps) to support data governance, openness, and reuse.
- Illustrates potential bottlenecks to data sharing (dataset format, metadata completeness) and the value of standardized reporting and metadata enrichment for policy evaluation and decision-making.
