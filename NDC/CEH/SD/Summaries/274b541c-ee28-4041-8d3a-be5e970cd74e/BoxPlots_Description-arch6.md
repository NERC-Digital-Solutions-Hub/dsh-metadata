# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Box and whisker plots are used to visually assess data quality and interpret the distribution of LOCAR data (range, median, and quartiles).

## Plot structure
- Y axis: number line corresponding to the units of the determinand.
- X axis: different sites; site IDs represent each site.

## Key elements
- Red line: median.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Calculations and outliers
- Lower whisker: Q1 − 1.5 × IQR.
- Upper whisker: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR: Q3 − Q1.
- Points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and use
- Helps determine if most data lie within the interquartile range and assesses distribution shape.
- Whisker length indicates data spread; outliers highlight potential data quality issues or anomalies.

## Purpose and context
- A visual quality check for LOCAR data, aiding interpretation of determinand distributions across sites.

## Diagram note

## Relevance to Data Support
- Illustrates how to create user-friendly visual data products for quality assurance.
- Supports self-serve data exploration by enabling comparison of distributions across sites and identification of outliers.
