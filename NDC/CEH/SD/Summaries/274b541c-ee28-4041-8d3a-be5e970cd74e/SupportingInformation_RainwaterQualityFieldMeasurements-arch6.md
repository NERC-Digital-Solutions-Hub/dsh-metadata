# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rainwater   (2004-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Overview
- Rainwater samples collected and analyzed for anions and nutrients as part of the Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) Programme.
- 7 sites across Frome and Piddle, Pang and Lambourn, and Tern catchments, with variable sampling durations per site (2004–2006).
- Variables measured include alkalinity (as CaCO3), ammonia, chloride, conductivity, nitrate (as N), pH, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), soluble reactive dissolved silicate (SRD), and sulphate.
- Samples processed and analyzed by Thames Water; data quality controlled and documented.

## Variables and units
- Alkalinity as CaCO3: mg/l CaCO3
- Ammonia as N: mg/l N
- Chloride-ion: mg/l Cl
- Conductivity (20°C): µS/cm
- Nitrate as N: mg/l N
- pH: pH units
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP): mg/l P
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD): mg/l SiO2
- Sulphate: mg/l SO4

## Measurement locations and catchments
- Sites (with codes and types):
  - CEH Winfrith, FP04
  - Higher Came Farm, FP13
  - Lower Wraxall Farm, FP35
  - Warren Farm, PL06
  - Frilsham Meadow, PL11
  - Helshaw Grange, TE11
  - Oakley Folly, TE17
- Site type: RNWQ (Rainwater collector for water quality samples)

## Temporal coverage
- Sampling cadence:
  - Fortnightly in Pang/Lambourn (PL) and Tern (TE) catchments
  - Roughly monthly in Frome (FP) and Piddle (FP) catchment
- Timeframe: January 2004 – May 2006

## Field collection and laboratory analysis
- Field method: Rainwater collectors returned to the lab; samples for pH and alkalinity poured into glass bottles; SRP filtered; other determinations on unfiltered samples.
- Analysis: Thames Water methods using Seal discrete analyzers for chloride, sulphate, nitrate, SRD, SRP, ammonia; pH and conductivity measured with appropriate meters.
- Nitrate conversion: Nitrate (NO3) measured and converted to mg/l N using X*14/64.

## Quality assurance and data quality
- Thames Water performed quality control; a duplicate and a QC sample sent weekly to compare laboratory results.
- Data notes:
  - Frome and Piddle catchments datasets lack time stamps (represented as 00:00 in the dataset).
- Data presentation: Box and whisker plots generated for all variables to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Key considerations for use
- Data are quality-controlled with explicit measurement uncertainties and detection limits provided for each analyte.
- Time stamping gaps need consideration when aligning time series across all catchments.
- Standardized units and laboratory methods facilitate cross-site comparisons and long-term trend analysis.
