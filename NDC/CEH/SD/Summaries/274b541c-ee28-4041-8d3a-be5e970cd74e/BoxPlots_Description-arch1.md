# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Introduction
- Box and whisker plots are used to display information about the range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
- Their purpose is to provide a visual check of data quality and to help interpret the distribution.
- They help determine if most data lie within the box (between the first and third quartiles), the length of the whiskers, and how many points are outliers.

## Description
- The LOCAR box and whisker plots display the number line on the y-axis, corresponding to the units of the determinand.
- The x-axis represents the different sites where the determinand was measured; site ID denotes the sites.
- The red line inside the box indicates the median; the box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
- Whiskers are calculated as:
  - Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
  - Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
  - IQR is the interquartile range = Q3 − Q1
- Values outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
- A diagram illustrating these concepts is provided.
