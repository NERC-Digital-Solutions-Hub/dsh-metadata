# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Introduction
- A box and whisker plot is used to display information about the range, the median, and the quartiles of a dataset.
- It provides a visual check of data quality and helps interpret the distribution.
- It aids understanding of whether most data lie within the box (between Q1 and Q3) and the presence of outliers beyond the whiskers.

## Description
- The y-axis represents the number line in units relevant to the determinand.
- The x-axis shows the different sites for which the determinand was measured; site IDs represent sites.
- The box's red line indicates the median; the box edges indicate Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
- Whiskers are calculated as:
  - Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
  - Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
  - IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1
- Values outside the whiskers are considered outliers.
- The description notes that a diagram illustrates these concepts.
