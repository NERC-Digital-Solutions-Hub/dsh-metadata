# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Box and whisker plots display range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
- Used alongside a number line (horizontal or vertical) to provide a visual check of data quality and to interpret data distribution.
- Helpful to see whether most data lie within the box (between Q1 and Q3), whisker lengths, and the presence of outliers.

## Plot Structure and Axes
- Y-axis: number line relevant to the units of the determinand being displayed.
- X-axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; site ID represents sites.
- Median is shown by a red line inside the box.
- Box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Calculations
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR; Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
- Points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and Use
- The plots enable quick assessment of data quality and distribution shape.
- They help identify outliers and understand data dispersion across sites.
- Useful for determining data suitability for further analysis and guiding data cleaning or validation steps.

## Notes
- A diagram illustrating the concept is referenced but not shown.
