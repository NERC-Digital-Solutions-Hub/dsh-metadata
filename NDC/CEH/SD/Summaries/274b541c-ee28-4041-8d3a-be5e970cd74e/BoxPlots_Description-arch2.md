# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Introduction to box and whisker plots
- Used to display range, median, and quartiles of a dataset.
- Provides a visual check of data quality and helps interpret distribution.
- Useful for assessing how concentrated data are within quartiles, whisker length, and presence of outliers.

## Plot axes and components
- Y axis: number line relevant to the units of the determinand being displayed.
- X axis: different sites; site ID represents each location.
- Median: red line inside the box.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## How whiskers are calculated
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR.
- Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.

## Outliers
- Values plotting outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and use
- The plots help verify data distribution across sites and identify potential anomalies.
- They accompany LOCAR data to support quality checks and interpretation of baseline datasets.
