# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose of the plots
- Box and whisker plots are used to provide a visual check of data quality and to aid interpretation of data distribution.

## Plot structure and axes
- Y axis: a number line, relevant to the units of the determinand being displayed.
- X axis: different sites for which the determinand was measured.
- Site ID: used to represent the sites.

## Key elements of the plot
- Median: indicated by a red line within the box.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Quartiles and data spread
- Q1 and Q3 define the interquartile range (IQR = Q3 − Q1).
- The box represents the middle 50% of the data.

## Whiskers and outliers
- Lower whisker: Q1 − 1.5 × IQR.
- Upper whisker: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- Values outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and use
- Helps assess whether most data fall within the central distribution and how long the whiskers are.
- Identifies outliers for potential review and investigation.

## Relevance for Data Stewards
- Supports visual data quality checks across sites and determinands.
- Emphasizes the importance of consistent units and clear site identifiers for meaningful cross-site comparisons.
- Highlights the need for metadata that describes determinands, units, and site IDs to facilitate discovery, reuse, and governance of LOCAR datasets.
