# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rainwater   (2004-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Overview
  - Rainwater samples collected and analysed for anions and nutrients as part of the Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) Programme.
  - Conducted at 7 sites across three catchments: Frome/Piddle (FP), Pang/Lambourn (PL), and Tern (TE) between 2004 and 2006.
  - Sampling frequency: fortnightly in Pang/Lambourn and Tern catchments; roughly monthly in Frome and Piddle catchments.
- Variables measured
  - Alkalinity (as CaCO3)
  - Ammonia (mg/l N)
  - Chloride (mg/l Cl)
  - Conductivity at 20 °C (µS/cm)
  - Nitrate (mg/l N)
  - pH
  - Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP, mg/l P)
  - Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD, mg/l SiO2)
  - Sulphate (mg/l SO4)
- Site locations and designations
  - FP04 – CEH Winfrith (Frome/Piddle catchment) – RNWQ (rainwater collector for water quality)
  - FP13 – Higher Came Farm – RNWQ
  - FP35 – Lower Wraxall Farm – RNWQ
  - PL06 – Warren Farm – RNWQ (Pang/Lambourn)
  - PL11 – Frilsham Meadow – RNWQ
  - TE11 – Helshaw Grange – RNWQ (Tern)
  - TE17 – Oakley Folly – RNWQ
- Temporal coverage
  - From January 2004 to May 2006
  - Sampling cadence: fortnightly (FP, PL, TE catchments with variable durations per site) and roughly monthly (Frome/Piddle catchment)
- Measurement and handling procedures
  - Rainwater collectors transported to the lab and aliquoted into bottles for analysis.
  - pH and alkalinity read from glass bottles; SRP filtered; other determinations unfiltered.
- Analysis and laboratories
  - Samples sent to Thames Water for analysis.
  - Methods (Thames Water): 
    - Chloride and Sulphate and Nitrate via Seal discrete analyser.
    - Ammonia via Seal discrete analyser.
    - Silicate (SRD) via Seal discrete analyser.
    - Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) via Seal discrete analyser.
    - pH via pH electrode.
    - Conductivity via conductivity electrode.
  - Quality control metrics (where reported): calibration standards, mean concentration accuracy, and detection limits provided; typical calibrations and accuracy indicators applied.
- Data quality and QA/QC
  - Thames Water performed quality control; weekly duplicates and QC samples used to compare laboratory results.
  - Frome and Piddle catchment data lack time stamps (time recorded as 00:00 when samples returned to lab).
  - Box-and-whisker plots generated for all variables to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Data management and outputs
  - Standardised dataset with clear unit definitions and site-catchment codes.
  - Outputs suitable for presentation as reports, charts, and maps; data intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Particular challenges noted
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data (beyond single-use applications).
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs for broader scrutiny and reuse.
