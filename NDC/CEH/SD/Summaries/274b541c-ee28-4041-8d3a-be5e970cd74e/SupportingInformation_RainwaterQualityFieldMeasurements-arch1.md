# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rainwater   (2004-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Scope and purpose
- Rainwater samples collected and analysed for anions and nutrients as part of the LOCAR program.
- Study sites cover seven locations across Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments (2004–2006).

## Variables and units
- Alkalinity as CaCO3: mg/l
- Ammonia (as N): mg/l N
- Chloride (Cl): mg/l
- Conductivity (20 °C): µS/cm
- Nitrate (as N): mg/l N
- pH: pH units
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP): mg/l P
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD): mg/l SiO2
- Sulphate (SO4): mg/l

## Sampling sites and catchments
- Frome/Piddle catchment: FP04 (CEH Winfrith), FP13 (Higher Came Farm), FP35 (Lower Wraxall Farm)
- Pang/Lambourn catchment: PL06 (Warren Farm), PL11 (Frilsham Meadow)
- Tern catchment: TE11 (Helshaw Grange), TE17 (Oakley Folly)
- Site type: RNWQ (rainwater collection for water quality samples)

## Temporal coverage and sampling frequency
- Fortnightly sampling in Pang/Lambourn and Tern catchments.
- Roughly monthly sampling in Frome and Piddle catchments.
- Period: January 2004 to May 2006.
- Note: Some Frome/Piddle data lack associated time (recorded as 00:00).

## Sampling and analysis methods
- Rainwater collectors returned to the lab; samples prepared in bottles (pH and alkalinity readings) or filtered for SRP; unfiltered used for other determinations.
- Analysis performed by Thames Water:
  - Chloride, Sulphate, Nitrate, Ammonia, SRP, SRD, Conductivity, Alkalinity: Seal discrete analyser (various calibration standards and detection limits provided).
  - Nitrate converted to mg/l N using a specified formula.
  - pH measured with pH electrode.
- Quality control: Thames Water conducted weekly duplicate and QC samples to validate results.

## Data quality, processing, and documentation
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water.
- Weekly duplicate and QC samples used to compare results.
- Time data missing for Frome and Piddle datasets; represented as 00:00 in the dataset.
- Box and whisker plots generated for all variables to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Data accessibility and usability
- Data are accompanied by method details, calibration and detection information, and QA notes.
- Datasets are described with metadata; intended to support discoverability and reuse (portal-based access implied).

## Potential analyses and considerations for analysts
- Explore correlations among alkalinity, pH, major ions (Cl, NO3, SO4, SRP, SRD), conductivity, and nutrients.
- Compare patterns across catchments and site types; assess temporal (fortnightly vs. monthly) differences.
- Investigate spatial variability among the seven sites and potential drivers (atmospheric deposition, local sources).
- Assess data quality concerns due to missing time stamps and measurement uncertainties; account for QC results in analyses.
- Leverage box plot summaries to identify outliers and distribution characteristics for each analyte.
