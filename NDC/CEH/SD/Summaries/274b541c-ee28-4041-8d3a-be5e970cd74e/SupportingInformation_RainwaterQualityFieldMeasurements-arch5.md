# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity, pH and nutrients in rainwater (2004-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Rainwater samples collected and analyzed for anions and nutrients as part of the Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) programme.
- Seven sites across Frome and Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
- Timeframe: January 2004 to May 2006, with site-specific sampling duration varying.

## Variables measured
- Alkalinity (as CaCO3) – mg/l
- Ammonia (as N) – mg/l
- Chloride (Cl) – mg/l
- Conductivity (20 °C) – μS/cm
- Nitrate (as N) – mg/l
- pH – pH units
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) – mg/l
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD) – mg/l
- Sulphate (SO4) – mg/l

## Location and site codes
- CEH Winfrith (FP04) – RNWQ
- Higher Came Farm (FP13) – RNWQ
- Lower Wraxall Farm (FP35) – RNWQ
- Warren Farm (PL06) – RNWQ
- Frilsham Meadow (PL11) – RNWQ
- Helshaw Grange (TE11) – RNWQ
- Oakley Folly (TE17) – RNWQ
- Catchments: FP = Frome/Piddle; PL = Pang/Lambourn; TE = Tern; RNWQ = Rainwater collector for water quality samples

## Sampling schedule
- Fortnightly sampling in Pang/Lambourn and Tern catchments.
- Roughly monthly sampling in Frome and Piddle catchments.
- Sampling window: Jan 2004 – May 2006.

## Sampling and laboratory procedures
- Rainwater collectors returned to lab; pH and alkalinity read in glass bottles; SRP filtered; other determinands unfiltered.
- Samples collected by Catchment Service Teams; analyzed by Thames Water.

## Measurements and quality assurance (QA)
- Analyte measurement methods (examples):
  - Chloride, sulfate, nitrate, SRD, SRP, ammonia: Seal discrete analyser
  - pH: pH electrode
  - Conductivity: Conductivity electrode
- Thames Water provided calibration constants, typical measured percentages, uncertainty, and limits of detection (LOD) for each analyte.
- Nitrate concentration converted from mg/l NO3 to mg/l N using a standard factor (14/64).
- Data quality control conducted by Thames Water:
  - Weekly duplicate and QC samples used to compare laboratory results.
- Time metadata issue:
  - Frome and Piddle catchments lack precise time stamps; recorded as 00:00 in the dataset.

## Data handling and presentation
- Box-and-whisker plots generated for all variables to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Documentation includes detailed notes on analytical accuracy, precision, and LODs.

## Data stewardship implications and considerations
- Metadata completeness: ensure site identifiers, catchment mappings, and time stamps are complete and standardized.
- Data provenance: clear records of sample collection, lab analysis, QA/QC procedures, and conversion steps (e.g., nitrate to N).
- Data formats and units: maintain consistent units and provide metadata to enable cross-site comparability.
- Temporal coverage and gaps: address missing timestamps and potential temporal alignment across catchments.
- Data updates: track any re-analyses or corrected values and maintain versioning.
- Accessibility: dataset appears within LOCAR baseline datasets; ensure discoverability via portals and proper documentation for reuse.
