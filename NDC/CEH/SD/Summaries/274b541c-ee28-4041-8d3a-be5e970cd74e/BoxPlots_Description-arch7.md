# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Purpose: Box and whisker plots provide a visual quality check of the LOCAR data and help interpret the distribution.
- Plot structure:
  - y-axis: number line, relevant to the units of the determinand.
  - x-axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; sites are represented by site IDs.
  - Median: red line inside the box.
  - Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
- Calculations:
  - IQR = Q3 - Q1.
  - Lower whisker = Q1 - 1.5 × IQR.
  - Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
  - Points outside the whiskers are outliers.
- Interpretation guidance:
  - Assess distribution by looking at how data are spread within the box, whiskers, and the number of outliers.
  - Use the plot to compare distributions across different sites for the determinand.
- Additional note: The diagram illustrating these concepts is referenced but not shown.
