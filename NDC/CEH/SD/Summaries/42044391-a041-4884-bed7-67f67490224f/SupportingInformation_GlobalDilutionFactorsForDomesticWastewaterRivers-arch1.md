# Global dilution factors estimates Supporting Information

- Purpose: Dilution factors (DFs) quantify how domestic wastewater-derived chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals, household cleaners) dilute in rivers, enabling estimation of likely environmental concentrations and identification of high-risk areas.
- Scope and resolution: Global dataset with 0.5-degree spatial resolution; includes long-term annual and monthly DF grids to capture temporal variability.
- Data derivation (methodology): 
  - Domestic wastewater effluents derived from national per-capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population.
  - Monthly and annual river flows estimated by accumulating runoff using topographically derived flow directions.
  - Method designed to be applicable worldwide even where river flow or wastewater data are scarce.
- Format and contents: Raster grids stored in ASCII format.
  - Annual file: df_annual.asc
  - Monthly files: df_monthly_xx.asc (xx = 01–12)
- Intended users and applications: Decision-makers and pharmaceutical companies can use the DF dataset to assess relative exposure to chemicals from human pollution in rivers and target high-risk areas for monitoring or mitigation.
