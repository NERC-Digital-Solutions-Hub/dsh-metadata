# Global dilution factors estimates Supporting Information

## Overview
- Dilution factors (DFs) quantify concentrations of down-the-drain chemicals entering freshwaters via domestic wastewater.
- Global dataset with 0.5-degree spatial resolution, including long-term annual and monthly DF grids.
- Developed for worldwide applicability, including countries with scarce river flow or wastewater data.
- Intended to support risk assessment of human pollution in rivers and help target high-risk areas.

## Data and methods
- Methodology enables global application even where data are limited.
- Domestic wastewater effluents derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population data.
- Monthly and annual river flows estimated by accumulating runoff using topographically derived flow directions.
- Open-access publication detailing data and methods: Keller et al. 2014, Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry; DOI: 10.1002/etc.2441. Access via http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/504561/

## Data format and contents
- Stored as raster grids in ASCII format, compatible with most GIS software.
- Annual file: df_annual.asc.
- Monthly files: df_monthly_xx.asc (xx = month, 01–12).

## Access and provenance
- Data aligned with an open-access publication, facilitating broad use and citation.
- The dataset supports international users (decision makers, pharmaceutical companies) for exposure assessment of down-the-drain chemicals.

## Governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure clear documentation of data generation methods, assumptions, and units used in deriving DFs.
- Maintain metadata quality, including spatial resolution (0.5-degree), file Naming conventions (df_annual.asc, df_monthly_xx.asc), and temporal coverage (monthly and annual).
- Track provenance and versioning, including the open-access source and publication DOI.
- Clarify licensing and usage rights consistent with open data practices; provide guidance for citation.
- Define update and maintenance plans if the dataset is extended or refreshed in the future; capture any data gaps or limitations related to scarce input data.
