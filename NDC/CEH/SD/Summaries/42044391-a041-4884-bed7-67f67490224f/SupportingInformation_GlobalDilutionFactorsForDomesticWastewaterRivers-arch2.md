# Global dilution factors estimates

## Overview
- Dilution factors (DFs) are key to estimating concentrations of “down-the-drain” chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals, household cleaners) entering freshwater via domestic wastewater.
- The dataset provides global, temporally and spatially variable DFs using 0.5-degree gridded data, including long-term annual and monthly DF grids.
- Designed to be applicable worldwide, including in countries with limited river flow or wastewater data.

## Data and methods
- Methodology enables global application even with scarce data on river flows or effluents.
- Domestic wastewater effluents derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population data.
- Monthly and annual river flows estimated by accumulating runoff using topographically derived flow directions.
- Aims to support decision makers and industry (e.g., pharmaceutical companies) in assessing relative exposure to chemicals from human pollution in rivers and identifying high-risk areas.

## Dataset format and contents
- Stored as raster grids in ASCII format compatible with most GIS software.
- Resolution: 0.5-degree gridded data.
- Files included:
  - df_annual.asc (annual dilution factors)
  - df_monthly_xx.asc for each month (xx = 01–12)

## Format details
- ASCII raster format suitable for GIS analysis and integration with other spatial datasets.

## Applications and intended users
- For a broad international community including decision makers and pharmaceutical companies.
- Enables assessment of relative exposure to sewage-derived chemicals in rivers and targeting of areas with potentially high risk.
- Supports standardised, comparable monitoring outputs across regions and time.
