# Global dilution factors estimates Supporting Information

## Purpose and scope
- Provides global dilution factors (DFs) to estimate concentrations of down-the-drain chemicals entering rivers from domestic wastewater (e.g., pharmaceuticals, cleaning products).
- Captures temporal and spatial variability; 0.5 degree resolution; includes long-term annual and monthly DF grids.
- Designed for global applicability even where river flow or wastewater data are scarce.
- DWFs derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population; monthly and annual river flows estimated from accumulated runoff using flow directions.

## Data and methods
- Full data and methodology described in Keller et al., 2014 (Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry).
- Open access publication; DOI: 10.1002/etc.2441.
- Method enables worldwide estimation of river concentrations for any chemical from sewage-treatment plants using dilution factors; suitable for decision makers and industry.

## Data format and content
- Data stored as raster grids in ASCII format (GIS-friendly).
- Files include:
  - df_annual.asc (annual dilution factor)
  - df_monthly_xx.asc (monthly dilution factors; xx = month)

## Applications and users
- Useful for assessing relative exposure to down-the-drain chemicals worldwide.
- Helps identify high-risk areas for monitoring and targeted mitigation; relevant for policymakers and pharmaceutical companies.

## Considerations and limitations (for monitoring frameworks)
- Based on estimations; dependent on input data quality (per capita water use, population data, runoff estimates).
- Global resolution of 0.5 degrees may limit local precision.
- Relies on assumptions about wastewater contributions and river flow; still valuable where empirical data are scarce.
- ASCII raster format requires GIS tools for processing and analysis.
