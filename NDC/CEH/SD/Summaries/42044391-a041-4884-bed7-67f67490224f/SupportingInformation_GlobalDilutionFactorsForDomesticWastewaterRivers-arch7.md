# Global dilution factors estimates

## Overview
- Dilution factors (DFs) are used to estimate concentrations of "down-the-drain" chemicals entering freshwater via domestic wastewater.
- Global DF dataset captures temporal and spatial variability at 0.5 degree resolution, including long-term annual and monthly grids.
- Methodology supports global application even where river flow data or wastewater effluent data are scarce.
- Domestic wastewater effluents are derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population.
- Monthly and annual river flows are estimated by accumulating runoff using topographically derived flow directions.
- Aims to enable international stakeholders (decision makers, pharmaceutical companies) to assess relative exposure to pollutants and identify high-risk river areas.

## Data and methods
- Detailed data and methods are provided in the open-access publication: Keller, V.D.J., Williams, R.J., Lofthouse, C., Johnson, A.C. 2014. Worldwide estimation of river concentrations of any chemical originating from sewage-treatment plants using dilution factors. Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, 33(2), 447-452. DOI: 10.1002/etc.2441.
- The approach is designed for broad international applicability, including areas with limited data.

## Format of the dataset and contents
- Data stored as raster grids in ASCII format, compatible with most GIS software.
- Files included:
  - df_annual.asc (one annual dilution factor file)
  - df_monthly_xx.asc (twelve monthly files, where xx is the month)

## Access and usage for GIS specialists
- Raster ASCII format facilitates integration into GIS workflows and overlays with other spatial datasets.
- Global, time-resolved layers enable comparative spatial analyses of dilution, exposure, and potential risk across regions.
