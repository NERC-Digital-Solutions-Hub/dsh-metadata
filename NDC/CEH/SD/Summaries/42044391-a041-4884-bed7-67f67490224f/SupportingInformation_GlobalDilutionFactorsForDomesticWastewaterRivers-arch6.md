# Global dilution factors estimates Supporting Information

- Purpose and scope
  - Dilution factors (DFs) are used to estimate concentrations of down-the-drain chemicals (e.g., pharmaceuticals, household cleaners) entering freshwater via domestic wastewater.
  - The dataset records temporal and spatial variability of DFs globally at 0.5 degree resolution, including long-term annual and monthly DF grids.

- Methodology
  - Designed for global applicability, even where river flow or wastewater data are scarce.
  - Domestic wastewater effluents are derived from national per capita domestic water use estimates and gridded population data.
  - Monthly and annual river flows are estimated by accumulating runoff using topographically derived flow directions.

- Data and methods reference
  - Detailed data and methods are described in the open-access publication: Keller et al. 2014, Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry, DOI: 10.1002/etc.2441.
  - Publication available at http://nora.nerc.ac.uk/504561/

- Data format and contents
  - Stored as raster grids in ASCII format, compatible with most GIS software.
  - Files include:
    - df_annual.asc (annual dilution factor)
    - df_monthly_xx.asc (monthly dilution factors; xx = month)

- Potential users and applications
  - International decision makers and pharmaceutical companies for assessing relative exposure to down-the-drain chemicals in rivers.
  - Useful for identifying high-risk areas to target management or further study.

- Practical notes
  - The dataset provides a globally applicable tool for evaluating dilution-related concentrations and can support global assessments and policy discussions.
