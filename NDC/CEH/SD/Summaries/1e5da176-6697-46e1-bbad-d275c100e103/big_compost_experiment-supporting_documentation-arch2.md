# Survey of opinions and behaviours regarding home composting, alongside experimental data for disintegration and degradation of compostable materials, UK, 2019-2023

## Overview
- The Big Compost Experiment was a voluntary UK citizen science study (2019–2023) exploring biodegradable/compostable packaging and home composting.
- Aims:
  - Assess the role and effectiveness of compostable packaging in the UK.
  - Engage the public and raise awareness about plastic waste.
  - Gather public opinions on compostable packaging and domestic compost habits/environments.
- Data components:
  - Qualitative and quantitative survey responses on opinions/behaviours toward compostable plastics and home composting.
  - Qualitative and quantitative results from home compost experiments on compostable plastics.
- Data collection method: online, voluntary survey and composting account; data stored in a database; personally identifiable information removed to meet GDPR/ethics.

## Dataset scope and structure
- Two CSV files comprise the dataset:
  - Big_Compost_Experiment-composter-items.csv
    - Describes individual compost experiments (participant/composter level).
    - Key variables include: product tested (compostableType and productName), quantity, dates (datePurchased, dateStarted, dateFinished, dateCreated, dateUpdated), composting method and duration, composter type, region, certification marks, degradation level, and related notes.
    - Additional fields cover packaging elements (certification marks), presence of non-biodegradable bags, and observations (comments).
  - Big_Compost_Experiment-surveys.csv
    - Captures participant survey responses.
    - Key areas include: attitudes toward compostable packaging (likelyToBuyCompostable Packaging and reasons), home composting/food waste separation (separatesFoodWaste, council waste usage, items placed in council waste), use of a composter, what is composted, other waste strategies, where composting occurs, types of composter used, end uses of compost, and observed life in the composter.
    - Additional fields cover demographic/collection details (dateCreated/dateUpdated) and open-text responses.

## Temporal coverage and collection
- Data collection period: 07/11/2019 – 30/08/2023.
- Submissions were made at variable intervals by volunteers over the study period.
- Data collected via an online website survey and home-composting account; stored in a database as raw CSV data.

## Data handling, quality, and access
- Anonymisation: Personally identifiable data (names, emails) removed to meet GDPR and ethics requirements.
- Processing: No further data processing beyond collection; data shared voluntarily by participants.
- Quality control: Data are self-reported by participants; no additional automated validation noted.
- Publication/next steps: Refer to 24 months’ analysis publication for further details (link provided in the dataset description).

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and use
- Provides standardized, exportable data on household composting behaviours and perceptions of compostable packaging, enabling monitoring over time.
- Data can be linked with other environmental datasets to evaluate packaging waste policies and household waste reduction efforts.
- Aligns with the “Analysts Monitoring the Environment” objective to verify data quality, transform data into usable outputs, and store datasets for accessible use; highlights opportunities to increase dataset value by combining with other data sources and by improving access to underlying data.
