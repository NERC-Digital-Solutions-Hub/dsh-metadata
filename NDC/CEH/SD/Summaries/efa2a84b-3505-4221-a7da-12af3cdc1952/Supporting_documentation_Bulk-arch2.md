# Bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content in soil profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Overview
- Study of soil cores collected in early summer 2013 and 2014 across multiple sites in subarctic Canada to compare peatland plateaus, thaw features, and burnt vs unburnt black spruce forests.
- Aimed at producing standardised environmental soil metrics (bulk density, carbon, nitrogen) to support environmental monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.
- Data collected include site codes, sampling depth, core replication, and notes on vegetation state and tephra layers; intended for integration with broader environmental datasets.

## Sampling design and sites
- Site codes and basic descriptions:
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - FFB - FireFox Burnt: burnt black spruce forest (burnt in 1998)
  - BLF - BlackFox: black spruce forest
  - WHF - WhiteFox: white spruce forest
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
  - TW - Teslin Wetland Mid: thawed peatland plateau
  - TWM - Teslin Wetland Margin: margin of thawed peatland plateau
  - MCU - Mosquito Creek Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
  - MCB - Mosquito Creek Burnt: burnt black spruce forest
  - WTP - White Truck Plateau: peatland plateau near Yellowknife
  - WTM - White Truck Moss: recently thawed peatland plateau (moss)
  - WTS - White Truck Sedge: recently thawed peatland plateau (sedge/moss)
  - WTW - White Truck Wetland: older potential thaw feature
  - BCB - Boundary Creek Birch: birch forest
  - BCS - Boundary Creek Spruce: black spruce forest
- In most sites, five soil cores (replicates) were collected; some sites had three or four cores.
- The TPP site cores are labeled TPP1–TPP5; coding across cores aligns with other data sets but cores come from different locations.

## Field sampling methods
- Target depth up to 1 meter; depth sometimes shallower due to rock or site conditions.
- Frozen-ground sites (e.g., FFU, FFB, BLF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS):
  - Upper core sampled by inserting a 40 cm long tin foil sleeve into the soil to thaw depth.
  - Deeper samples obtained with a powerhead corer, producing 10–15 cm sections.
  - Core material placed in sealed plastic, then in PVC tubes for transport.
- Non-frozen-ground sites:
  - Upper 40 cm sampled with tin foil method; deeper sampling with a Russian corer.
  - Samples placed in half-cut PVC tubes, wrapped, and shipped frozen to the UK.
- Transport: all samples were kept frozen in Canada and shipped to the UK for analysis.

## Laboratory analysis and data processing
- In the UK, cores were cut with volume recorded; the upper portion cut at 1 cm resolution for lead dating.
- Deeper sections: based on horizon uniformity, typically in 10 cm increments.
- Sample processing: all samples freeze-dried, weighed for bulk density calculation, and some ground for carbon and nitrogen analysis.
- Measurements:
  - Bulk density: expressed as grams of dry soil per cubic centimeter of wet soil.
  - Carbon and nitrogen: measured by combustion analysis; expressed as a percentage of dry mass.
  - Calibration: standards analyzed in each batch to calibrate carbon and nitrogen results.
- Data documentation:
  - Remarks column in the dataset notes potential bulk density overestimation/underestimation due to thick roots or sampling recovery, vegetation changes (Postthaw vs Pre-thaw peat), and presence of the White River Ash tephra layer in some cores.

## Data structure and metadata considerations
- The dataset notes that soil profile data (C, N, BD) and flux data (CO2, CH4) share coding but come from different spatial locations; GPS coordinates are provided in each file.
- Explicit example: soil profile information for TPP1 does not spatially match the flux data labeled TPP1.

## Notable considerations for interpretation
- Bulk density uncertainties may arise from root contamination or incomplete core recovery.
- Vegetation transitions associated with peat thaw (Postthaw vs Pre-thaw) are linked to soil profile changes.
- Tephra (White River Ash) layers are indicated in some cores and may affect stratigraphy and C/N measurements.
- While the dataset follows standardized sampling and analysis procedures, spatial alignment between soil profiles and flux measurements should be treated with caution during integration and analysis.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates a standardised approach to acquiring and processing soil carbon, nitrogen, and bulk density data across diverse subarctic environments.
- Supports cross-site comparability and time-series analyses essential for evaluating environmental health and policy performance.
- Emphasizes data quality assurance with field metadata, methodological notes, and explicit caveats to enable robust monitoring and stewardship of permafrost-influenced landscapes.
