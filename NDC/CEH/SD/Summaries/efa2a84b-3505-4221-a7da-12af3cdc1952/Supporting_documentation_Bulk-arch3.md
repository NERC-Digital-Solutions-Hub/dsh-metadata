# Bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content in soil profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Overview
  - A study of bulk density, carbon, and nitrogen content in soil profiles from permafrost areas in subarctic Canada.
  - Sampling conducted in 2013 and 2014; comparisons included peatland plateau versus thawing features, and unburnt versus burnt black spruce forest sites, with additional sites included.

- Study Design and Sites
  - Site codes and types:
    - FFU: FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
    - FFB: FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
    - BLF: BlackFox (black spruce forest)
    - WHF: WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
    - TPP: Teslin Peatland Plateau
    - TW: Teslin Wetland Mid (thawed peatland plateau)
    - TWM: Teslin Wetland Margin
    - MCU: Mosquito Creek Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
    - MCB: Mosquito Creek Burnt
    - WTP: White Truck Plateau (peatland plateau)
    - WTM: White Truck Moss (recently thawed peatland plateau, moss-dominated)
    - WTS: White Truck Sedge (recently thawed peatland plateau, sedge/moss)
    - WTW: White Truck Wetland (older thaw feature)
    - BCB: Boundary Creek Birch (birch forest)
    - BCS: Boundary Creek Spruce (black spruce forest)
  - Sampling: up to five soil cores per site (5 cores at most sites; some sites had 3–4 cores).
  - Example coding: TPP1–TPP5 used for five cores at Teslin Peatland Plateau; cores from the same site may have identical codes to flux datasets but originate from different locations.

- Sampling Methods
  - Target depth: up to 1 meter; actual depth varied due to rock presence.
  - Frozen-ground sites (e.g., FFU, FFB, BLF, TPP, MCU, MCB, WTP, BCB, BCS): upper core depth obtained with a tin foil sheet; deeper sampling with a powerhead corer to obtain 10–15 cm sections.
  - Non-frozen sites: tin foil used for upper 40 cm; deeper samples with a Russian corer.
  - Core handling: samples in core barrels wrapped, placed in PVC tubes, and kept frozen in Canada until shipment to the UK.
  - Documentation: core volumes recorded; five cores per site were intended for replication.

- Laboratory Analyses
  - In the UK: cores cut and volumes recorded; bulk density calculated from dry weight and core volume.
  - Lead dating: upper part of the core cut at 1 cm resolution for lead dating purposes; deeper parts divided into 10 cm sections based on horizon changes (organic/mineral).
  - Sample preparation: all samples freeze-dried, weighed to determine bulk density, and ground for carbon and nitrogen content.
  - Measurements: C and N contents measured with a C and N analyser after combustion; standards run with each batch and calibration applied.
  - Data expression: carbon and nitrogen contents expressed as percent of dry mass.

- Data and Metadata Considerations
  - Remarks column in datasets notes potential issues:
    - Bulk density may be over- or under-estimated due to thick roots or sampling losses.
    - Post-thaw versus pre-thaw peat vegetation changes observed in soil profiles.
    - Presence of Tephra (White River Ash) layers in some cores.
  - Lead dating and horizon demarcation depend on visible horizon stability and associated vegetation changes.

- Data Integration and Note on Coding
  - Codes for soil profiles and flux data (CO2 and CH4) share identifiers but originate from different locations; spatial coordinates may not match.
  - Example: soil profile TPP1 does not spatially coincide with flux data labeled TPP1; GPS coordinates differ between soil and flux datasets.

- Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Data quality and metadata gaps to watch for in monitoring workflows (e.g., descriptive remarks, potential measurement biases, and horizon demarcation consistency).
  - Cross-dataset integration requires careful validation of spatial alignment between soil profile data and gas flux measurements.
  - Data governance considerations include data sharing practices and documentation of sampling, processing, and calibration procedures to support transparency and reuse.
