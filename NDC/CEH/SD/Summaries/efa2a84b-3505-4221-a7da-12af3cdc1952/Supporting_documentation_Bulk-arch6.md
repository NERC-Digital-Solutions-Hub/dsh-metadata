# Bulk density, carbon and nitrogen content in soil profiles from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- The study collected soil cores in 2013 and 2014 to measure bulk density, carbon content, and nitrogen content across contrasting peatland and forest sites, including burnt vs unburnt conditions.
- Sites are labeled with codes (e.g., FFU, FFB, BLF, WHF, TPP, TW, TWM, MCU, MCB, WTP, WTM, WTS, WTW, BCB, BCS) representing combinations of forest type, burn status, and peatland features.
- Five cores per site were typical (some sites had three or four); one site (TPP) had cores coded TPP1–TPP5. Sampling aimed for 1 m depth, though rock or other constraints sometimes limited depth.

## Study design and sites

- Years: 2013 and 2014
- Comparisons:
  - Peatland plateau versus thawing features of peatland plateaus
  - Unburnt versus burnt black spruce forests
  - Additional miscellaneous sites included
- Core coding notes: Soil cores’ coding matches flux data coding in other datasets, but soil profiles and flux data originate from different spatial locations.

## Sampling methodology (field work)

- Frozen-ground sites required different instrumentation than unfrozen sites.
  - Frozen-ground sampling: upper core via tin foil insertion; deeper sections by powerhead corer (about 10–15 cm sections).
  - Unfrozen sites: tin foil for upper 40 cm and deeper sampling with a Russian corer.
- Handling and transport:
  - Cores wrapped in sealed plastic bags, placed in PVC tubes, and kept frozen in Canada until shipment to the UK.
  - Upon arrival in the UK, cores were cut and prepared for analysis.
- Depth strategy:
  - Upper part: sampled at 1 cm resolution for lead dating purposes.
  - Deeper parts: cut into sections typically 10 cm, chosen by horizon uniformity (organic vs. mineral or mixed).

## Laboratory analysis (UK)

- Processing:
  - All samples freeze-dried and weighed to determine bulk density.
  - Subsamples ground for carbon and nitrogen content analysis.
- Measurements and units:
  - Bulk density expressed as grams of dry soil per cubic centimeter of wet soil.
  - Carbon and nitrogen content expressed as a percentage of dry mass.
- Quality control:
  - Each batch included standards; calibrations applied to convert instrument readings to C and N values.

## Data variables and structure

- Primary outputs:
  - Bulk density (g dry soil per cm3 wet soil)
  - Carbon content (% dry mass)
  - Nitrogen content (% dry mass)
- Depth resolution:
  - 1 cm for upper sections (lead dating)
  - ~10 cm increments for deeper sections
- Metadata remarks:
  - Remarks column notes potential over- or underestimation of bulk density due to thick roots or incomplete soil recovery
  - Vegetation changes associated with thaw (Postthaw vs Pre-thaw peat)
  - Presence of Tephra (White River Ash) layers in some cores

## Data quality, limitations and caveats

- Depth limitations due to rock encountered during sampling
- Variable core counts per site (5 is typical; some sites had fewer)
- Potential biases from root intrusion or incomplete core recovery affecting volume and density estimates
- Lead dating resolution limited to upper 1 cm layers
- Vegetation and soil profile changes related to thaw events may influence interpretation

## Cross-dataset considerations

- While soil profile codes align with flux data (CO2 and CH4), the soil profile data and flux data are not spatially matched; refer to GPS coordinates in each file for linkage.
- Cores with the same code (e.g., TPP1) may correspond to different spatial locations in soil vs. flux datasets.

## Potential data products and applications

- Enables assessment of soil carbon and nitrogen pools across permafrost-affected landscapes and their response to thaw and fire.
- Supports analysis of how bulk density and elemental contents vary with horizon type and thaw status.
- Facilitates integration with vegetation change data (post-thaw vs pre-thaw peat) and tephra layer histories to interpret soil property changes.
- Data can inform models of carbon cycling in subarctic soils and help local land-management decisions related to permafrost thaw impacts.
