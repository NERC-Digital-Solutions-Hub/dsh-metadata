# What has been recorded and what form does the data take?

## Purpose and scope
- Study of the ability of sewage-associated plastic waste to act as reservoirs for faecal bacteria, potential human pathogens, and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes.
- Data collection supports UKRI-NERC grants related to microbial hitchhikers of marine plastics and related projects.

## Data files and contents
Ten CSV files, each covering different data aspects:
- Water_Background_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: bacterial concentrations in water (E. coli, Vibrio, Enterococcus) per 25 mL.
- Plastic_Waste_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: weight of plastic collected per site.
- Sand_Background_Bacterial_Concentrations_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: bacterial concentrations in sand per site.
- Wipes_Dry_Weight_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: dry weight of wet wipes collected.
- Sand_Dry_Weight_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: dry weight of sand collected.
- Seaweed_Dry_Weight_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: dry weight of seaweed collected.
- Enterococcus_Concentrations_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: Enterococcus on plastic at sites (per site).
- E_coli_Concentrations_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: E. coli on plastic at sites (per site).
- Vibrio_Concentrations_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: Vibrio on plastic at sites (per site).
- Minimum_Inhibitory_Concentrations_Sewage_Pathogens.csv: MIC data for isolates (E. coli, Enterococcus, Vibrio) against five antibiotics.

Notes:
- Data fields include site identifiers, replicate numbers, various CFU concentrations, weights (wet and dry), presence/absence indicators, and MIC values.
- ND denotes missing data.

## Study site and timing
- Data collected December 2021.
- Sampling locations indicated by black dots (mapping reference not included here).

## Data collection and laboratory methods
- Field sampling: transect 100 m x 10 m along the high-tide strandline; all sewage-associated plastic waste collected.
- Sample preparation: replicate composites of wipes (30 g in 100 mL), cotton buds (four sticks in 20 mL), and seaweed (3 g in 20 mL) pre-enriched in LB broth or Vibrio selective broth at 37°C for 18 h.
- Sub-sampling and culture: serial dilutions plated on selective media (MLGA for E. coli, TCBS for Vibrio, SB for Enterococci); incubation and CFU enumeration used to determine presence/absence and concentrations.
- MIC testing: isolates from seaweed, wipes, and cotton buds subjected to MIC analysis for amoxicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, cephalexin, and tetracycline across ten concentrations; standardized inoculum and incubation.

## Data quality and completeness
- Data checked for anomalies; missing data recorded as ND.
- Some samples had incomplete material weights or missing components (e.g., absence of certain sample types at some sites).

## Responsibility and governance
- The document notes a section on responsibility for collection and interpretation, but does not specify the individuals or organizations responsible.

## Data usage and context
- Data intended to illuminate whether sewage-associated plastics harbor bacteria, pathogens, and AMR, and to support related environmental microbiology and policy-relevant analyses.

## Metadata and discoverability
- Descriptions provide units and variable descriptions for each dataset (e.g., CFU counts per volume/weight, dry/wet weights, presence/absence, and MIC values).
- Data appear as ten CSV files with structured, site-centered measurements to enable cross-site comparisons.
