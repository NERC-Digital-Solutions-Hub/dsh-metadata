# Description of the dataset

- The dataset comprises water sampling data from Lake Akrotiri and its main inputs collected between July 2019 and November 2020.
- Eight monitoring sites were sampled, including marginal lake sites, input canals draining marshes, and a drainage pipe.
- The study forms part of the Darwin Initiative Plus project to monitor and understand drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.

## Sampling locations and lake context

- Sites labeled Cyp1 to Cyp8 with precise latitude and longitude coordinates and descriptive site notes:
  - Cyp1: Northern Polemidia retention pond overflow pipeline outlet west of a casino.
  - Cyp2–Cyp4: North east salt lake at Zakaki marsh outfall (Cyp2 furthest inland; Cyp3 furthest into salt lake; Cyp4 intermediate).
  - Cyp5: Zakaki freshwater marsh drainage channel; inflow from western Limassol stormwater.
  - Cyp6: Southern salt lake; distant from Zakaki/Fasouri inputs; runoff from citrus and eucalyptus areas.
  - Cyp7: Fasouri freshwater marsh drainage channel; connected to Akrotiri aquifer when water is high.
  - Cyp8: North west salt lake south of Fasouri outfall and near Akrotiri village stormwater drains.
- Lake Akrotiri is a culturally important wetland in the British Overseas Territory of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, with variable water levels and seasonal drying in summer; the site supports migratory birds.
- The data support understanding drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.

## Field measurements and sampling protocol

- July 2019 measurements by UKCEH using MYRON L Ultrameter II and a YSI DSS pro; later samples by Joint Services Health Unit (JSHU) with a YSI DSS pro.
- Samples were immediately filtered through a 0.45 μm Whatman WCN membrane filter.
- Field measurements included conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and related parameters.

## Monitoring and analytical information

- Laboratory analyses were conducted at UKCEH Wallingford for:
  - Phosphorus species: total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP)
  - Dissolved reactive silicon
  - Chlorophyll-a
  - Suspended solids
  - Fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate
  - Ammonium
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN)
- Primary instruments and methods:
  - pH measured with a Radiometer PHM210 meter; calibrated with buffers (pH 4, 7, 10) traceable to NIST.
  - Major dissolved cations/anions by ICP-OES and ion chromatography.
  - Conductivity, specific conductance (SPC), salinity, Eh, DO, and field temperature measured in the field or via YSI DSS pro.
  - Chlorophyll-a by extraction and spectrophotometric measurement following Marker et al. (1980).
- Analytical procedures:
  - TP and TDP: acidified potassium persulphate digestion; absorbance at 880 nm.
  - SRP: Murphy and Riley method (modified by Neal et al. 2000) with phosphomolybdenum blue detection.
  - SRP samples analyzed within 48 hours to minimize instability.
  - Dissolved silicon: molybdate reaction followed by reduction to form silicomolybdenum blues.
  - Ammonium: indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
  - DOC and TDN: thermal oxidation (Elementar Vario Cube).
- Major dissolved ions via ion chromatography; cations via ICP-OES.
- Field measurements included conductivity, Eh, temperature, DO, and pH; SPU and related metrics recorded.
