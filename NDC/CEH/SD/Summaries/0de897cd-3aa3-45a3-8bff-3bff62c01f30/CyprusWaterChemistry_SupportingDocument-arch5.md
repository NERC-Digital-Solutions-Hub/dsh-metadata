# Description of the dataset

## Overview
- Water samples collected from Lake Akrotiri and its main inputs between July 2019 and November 2020.
- Eight monitoring sites around the lake, including marginal areas and input canals; includes a drainage pipe.
- Part of the Darwin Initiative Plus project focused on monitoring drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.

## Study area and sampling locations
- Lake Akrotiri (Limassol salt lake) in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Cyprus.
- Lake is a key eastern Mediterranean wetland with migratory birds; water levels vary seasonally.
- Eight sites (Cyp1–Cyp8) with detailed latitude/longitude and site descriptions (e.g., outfalls, freshwater marsh channels, and salt lake locations).

## Field measurements
- July 2019: field measurements by UKCEH using MYRON L Ultrameter II and a YSI DSS pro.
- Subsequent samples collected by Joint Services Health Unit (JSHU) using a YSI DSS pro.

## Monitoring and analytical information
- Immediate filtration of field samples through 0.45 μm filters.
- Laboratory analyses at UKCEH Wallingford for: phosphorus species (TP, TDP, SRP), dissolved reactive silicon, suspended solids, chlorophyll, fluoride, chloride, and sulfate.
- In-field measurements: pH (calibrated against NIST-traceable buffers), conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO (% saturation), electrical resistance (Eh), and temperature.
- Analytical methods (selected): 
  - Suspended solids by filtration and gravimetric weighing.
  - Chlorophyll-a by filtration, acetone extraction, and spectrophotometry.
  - Total phosphorus (TP) and total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) via acidified persulfate digestion with spectrophotometric detection.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) via molybdenum blue colorimetry (Murphy and Riley method; modified by Neal et al.).
  - Dissolved reactive silicon with molybdate reduction to silicomolybdenum blue.
  - Ammonium by indophenol-blue colorimetry.
  - DOC and TDN by thermal oxidation (Elementar Vario Cube).
  - Major ions by ion chromatography (IC) and cations by ICP-OES.
- Instrumentation noted: Seal Auto Analyser 3; Beckman 750 DU; Radiometer PHM210 pH meter; Myron Ultrameter; YSI DSS pro; UV-Vis spectrophotometer; ICP-OES; IC system.

- Notes:
  - Total phosphorus is the sum of dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered samples.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus is also known as filterable reactive phosphorus or soluble molybdate-reactive phosphorus.
  - Concentrations are expressed as phosphorus for the phosphorus-related parameters.
- Missing values:
  - Some data missing due to equipment failure, different probes used, or access issues.
- Quality assurance:
  - Field samples collected by experienced surveyors; data checked for anomalies.
  - All analyses (except suspended solids) performed against Aquacheck QC standards (LGC Standards).

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- The dataset includes comprehensive methodology details, instrumentation, and QA procedures, enabling reproducibility and traceability.
- Clear definitions and units for each variable support interoperability and metadata consistency.
- Documentation of missing data and potential access-related issues aids in data quality assessment and governance.
- Reference methods are cited, facilitating future updates or comparisons with standardized approaches.
