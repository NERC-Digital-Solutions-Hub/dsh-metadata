# Description of the dataset

- Scope and purpose
  - Water samples from Lake Akrotiri and its main inputs collected July 2019 to November 2020.
  - Eight monitoring sites around the lake, including marginal samples, input canals draining surrounding marshes, and a drainage pipe.
  - Part of the Darwin Initiative Plus project to monitor and understand drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.

- Study area and sampling sites
  - Lake Akrotiri (Limassol salt lake) in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia; important wetland for migratory birds; water levels vary seasonally and can dry in summer.
  - Locations (Cyp1–Cyp8) with coordinates and site descriptions:
    - Cyp1: Northern Polemidia retention pond overflow outlet (west of the casino)
    - Cyp2–Cyp4: North east salt lake at Zakaki marsh outfall (Cyp2 furthest inland; Cyp3 furthest into lake; Cyp4 intermediate)
    - Cyp5: Zakaki freshwater marsh drainage channel (stormwater from western Limassol)
    - Cyp6: Southern salt lake (far from Zakaki/Fasouri inputs)
    - Cyp7: Fasouri freshwater marsh drainage channel (connected to Akrotiri aquifer when high)
    - Cyp8: North west salt lake near Fasouri outfall and village stormwater drains

- Field measurements
  - July 2019: field measurements by UKCEH using MYRON L Ultrameter II and YSI DSS pro.
  - Subsequent samples: collected by Joint Services Health Unit (JSHU) using YSI DSS pro.

- Monitoring and analytical methods
  - Sample processing: field filtration through 0.45 μm Whatman WCN membrane; analyses conducted at UKCEH Wallingford.
  - Analytes and methods:
    - Phosphorus: Total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) via acidified persulfate digestion; soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP) via phosphomolybdenum blue method.
    - Nutrients and carbon: Dissolved reactive phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN).
    - Silicon and chlorophyll: Dissolved reactive silicon; chlorophyll-a by filter-extract colorimetry after acetone extraction.
    - Major ions: Fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, sulfate (ion chromatography); major cations by ICP-OES.
    - Ammonium: Indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
  - General measurements: pH (calibrated with buffers to NIST), conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO and DO%), temperature, SPC, Eh.
  - Instruments: Radiometer pH meter (PHM210), Seal Auto Analyser 3, YSI DSS pro, ICP-OES, IC (Thermo Dionex).
  - Quality notes: Field pH calibration traceable to standard buffers; chlorophyll and nutrient analyses follow established reference methods.
