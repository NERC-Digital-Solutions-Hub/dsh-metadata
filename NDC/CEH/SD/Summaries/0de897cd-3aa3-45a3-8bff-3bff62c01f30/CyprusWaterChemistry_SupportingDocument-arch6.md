# Description of the dataset

- Scope and purpose
  - Water-quality dataset from Lake Akrotiri and its main inputs collected between July 2019 and November 2020.
  - Eight monitoring sites around the lake (Cyp1–Cyp8) including marginal samples, input canals, and a drainage pipe.
  - Part of the Darwin Initiative Plus project to monitor and understand drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.

- Sampling locations and site descriptions
  - Cyp1: Northern Polemidia retention pond overflow pipeline outlet west of the casino.
  - Cyp2–Cyp4: North east salt lake at Zakaki marsh outfall (furthest inland; with Cyp3 as the furthest into the salt lake; Cyp4 intermediate).
  - Cyp5: Zakaki freshwater marsh drainage channel; marsh drains western Limassol stormwater.
  - Cyp6: Southern salt lake; farthest from Zakaki/Fasouri inputs; edge runoff from plantations and forest.
  - Cyp7: Fasouri freshwater marsh drainage channel; connected to Akrotiri aquifer at high water.
  - Cyp8: North west salt lake near Fasouri outfall and village stormwater drains.

- Field measurements and analytical approach
  - Field measurements: July 2019 by UKCEH (MYRON L Ultrameter II, YSI DSS pro); subsequent samples by JSHU (YSI DSS pro).
  - Sample handling: filtration through 0.45 μm membrane immediately after collection.
  - Laboratory analyses (UKCEH Wallingford): phosphorus species (TP, TDP, SRP), dissolved reactive silicon, suspended solids, chlorophyll, fluoride, chloride, sulphate; major ions and nutrients (NH4, TDN, DOC).
  - pH measurement: calibrated Radiometer PHM210 (buffers 4, 7, 10; traceable to NIST).
  - Solutes and nutrients: colorimetric methods and spectrophotometry (e.g., molybdenum blue for TP/TDP/SRP; chlorophyll by standard pigment method); silicon by molybdomolybdate-reduction; ammonium by indophenol-blue; DOC/TDN by thermal oxidation.
  - Additional measurements: field conductivity (Myron Ultrameter); in-field DO, DO%, EC/Conductivity, Eh, temperature; SAL-PSU (salinity) and other field metrics.

- Quality assurance, data completeness, and limitations
  - Data verified by experienced field surveyors; anomalous values checked.
  - Most analyses aligned with reference Aquacheck QC standards (except suspended solids).
  - Some missing values due to equipment failure or restricted access to sampling sites.

- Metadata and references
  - Methods and analytical references include Eisenreich et al. (phosphorus), Leeks et al. (river monitoring), Marker et al. (chlorophyll pigments), Mullin & Riley (silicate), Murphy & Riley (phosphorus colorimetry), Neal et al. (phosphate measurement issues), and related standard protocols.
  - Field and laboratory methods are described to support reproducibility and potential data product development.

- How this data supports data use and product development
  - Provides a multi-parameter water-quality dataset suitable for dashboards, pivot-table style summaries, and self-serve exploration.
  - Enables cross-site comparison, trend analysis, and data integration with other sources while acknowledging missing data. 
  - Documentation supports data cleaning, transformation, and quality assurance for broader policy or environmental-management use.
