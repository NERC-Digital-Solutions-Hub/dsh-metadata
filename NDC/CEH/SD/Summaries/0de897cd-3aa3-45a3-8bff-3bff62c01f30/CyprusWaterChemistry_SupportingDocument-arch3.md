# Description of the dataset

- Overview: Water sampling dataset from Lake Akrotiri and its main inputs collected between July 2019 and November 2020. Includes eight monitoring sites around the lake and inputs from canals and a drainage pipe draining surrounding marshes.

- Study area and sampling design:
  - Lake Akrotiri (Limassol salt lake) located in the Sovereign Base Area of Akrotiri and Dhekelia, Cyprus; a key eastern Mediterranean wetland that attracts migratory birds and often dries in summer.
  - Eight sampling sites (Cyp1–Cyp8) with specific site descriptions, including northern retention pond outlet, Zakaki marsh outfalls, Zakaki freshwater marsh drainage channel, Fasouri marsh drainage channel, and surrounding salt/freshwater areas.
  - Geographic coordinates provided for each site.

- Field measurements:
  - July 2019 measurements conducted by UKCEH using a MYRON L Ultrameter II and a YSI DSS pro.
  - Subsequent samples collected by the Joint Services Health Unit (JSHU) using a YSI DSS pro.
  - Water samples filtered immediately (0.45 μm Whatman WCN membrane) prior to laboratory analyses.

- Monitoring and analytical information:
  - Analyses performed at UKCEH Wallingford for:
    - Phosphorus species: total phosphorus (TP), total dissolved phosphorus (TDP), soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP).
    - Nitrogen species: dissolved organic nitrogen (TDN) and total dissolved nitrogen (TDN as a measure alongside DOC).
    - Silicon: dissolved reactive silicon (DSi).
    - Chlorophyll a, suspended solids, fluoride, chloride, sulphate.
  - pH measured with a Radiometer PHM210 meter; calibration with pH 4, 7, and 10 buffers traceable to NIST.
  - Solids: suspended solids by filtration and reweighing of dried filters.
  - Chlorophyll: extraction in acetone/water and colorimetric determination.
  - Phosphorus: TP and TDP via digestion with acidified potassium persulphate; SRP via molybdenum blue method with Murphy and Riley modification.
  - SRP: filtered samples analyzed within 48 hours.
  - DSi: molybdate-based colorimetric method with reduction to form silicomolybdenum blues.
  - Ammonium: indophenol-blue colorimetric method.
  - DOC and TDN: thermal oxidation with an Elementar Vario Cube.
  - Major dissolved ions: fluoride, chloride, nitrite, nitrate, sulphate by ion chromatography; total and dissolved cations by ICP-OES after acidification.
  - Field conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), DO% saturation, temperature, Eh, and other related parameters recorded with field instruments.

- Dataset format and variables:
  - Variables include: Suspended_solids (mg/L), Soluble_reactive_phosphorus (μg/L), Total_dissolved_phosphorus (μg/L), Total_phosphorus (μg/L), Dissolved_ammonium (mg/L), Dissolved_silicon (mg/L), Chlorophyll-a (μg/L), Dissolved_fluoride (mg/L), Dissolved_chloride (mg/L), Dissolved_nitrite (mg/L), Dissolved_nitrate (mg/L), Dissolved_sulphate (mg/L), Total_dissolved_nitrogen (mg/L), Dissolved_organic_carbon (mg/L), Field_pH, Conductivity (µS), Eh (mV), Temp (°C), DO_percentage (%), DO (mg/L), SPC (µS/cm), C (ms/cm), SAL-PSU (PSU).
  - Each parameter includes definitions and units as specified in the dataset documentation; some values may be missing due to equipment failure, probe differences, or access limitations.

- Data quality, gaps and limitations:
  - Missing values occurred due to equipment failure, instrument variety, or access restrictions.
  - Data were checked for anomalous values; QA conducted against reference Aquacheck QC standards (except for suspended solids).

- Provenance, governance and usage notes:
  - Field measurements conducted by UKCEH and JSHU; laboratory analyses performed at UKCEH Wallingford.
  - Part of the Darwin Initiative Plus project monitoring drivers of change in the Akrotiri wetlands.
  - Data collection and processing adhere to documented analytical methods; the dataset includes methodological references for each analytical approach.
