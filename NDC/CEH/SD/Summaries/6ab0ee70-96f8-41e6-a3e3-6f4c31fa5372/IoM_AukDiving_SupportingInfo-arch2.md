# Dive times and depths of auk (Atlantic puffin, common guillemot and razorbill) from the Isle of May outside the seabird breeding season

- What the dataset contains
  - Dive times (start and end) and depths (maximum depth) for three auk species: Atlantic puffin, common guillemot, and razorbill.
  - Location: Isle of May National Nature Reserve, Scotland (56°11′N, 02°33′W).
  - Timeframe outside the seabird breeding season.
- Study site and temporal scope
  - Isle of May, Scotland.
  - Puffins: 19 July 2008 – 3 December 2008.
  - Guillemots: 20 July 2005 – 28 January 2006.
  - Razorbills: 1 July 2008 – 24 January 2009.
- Species and sample sizes
  - Atlantic puffins: 12 individuals.
  - Common guillemots: 13 individuals.
  - Razorbills: 13 individuals.
- Data collection methods
  - Birds captured as chick-rearing adults at the breeding site during the breeding season.
  - Time-depth recorders (TDRs) fitted to Darvic leg-rings.
  - Attachment time < 5 minutes.
  - Sexing of birds using CHD I genes from collected feathers (3–5 feathers per bird).
  - Recapture during the breeding season to remove TDRs.
- Equipment details
  - Puffins and razorbills: G5 TDRs (CEFAS, Lowestoft, UK), 31 × 8 mm.
  - Guillemots: LT2400 TDRs (Lotek Wireless, St John's, Newfoundland, Canada), 36 × 11 mm.
- Sampling design and data resolution
  - Aimed to record diving data over an extended nonbreeding period (July–April) but data gaps occurred as some TDRs failed.
  - Sampling rates used to balance data resolution and duration:
    - Guillemots: 16 s sampling every 30 d (n = 9 birds retrieved).
    - Guillemots: 32 s sampling every 15 d (n = 4 birds retrieved).
    - Razorbills: 3 s sampling every 10 d (n = 7 razorbills; n = 6 puffins for this schedule).
    - Puffins: 30 s sampling every day (n = 6 razorbills; n = 6 puffins for this schedule).
- Data structure
  - File: IoM_AukDiving.csv
  - Columns: 'Species', 'Sex', 'SamplingRate' (seconds), 'DepID' (deployment ID), 'StartTime' (start of dive, Y-M-D H:M:S), 'EndTime' (end of dive, Y-M-D H:M:S), 'DiveDepth' (maximum depth in meters).
- Data quality and limitations
  - Some TDRs failed partway through the study, reducing the number of individuals contributing data over time.
  - Original aim was to cover the entire nonbreeding period, but data coverage declined due to device failures.
- Provenance and data handling
  - Data collection led by Ruth Dunn (processing).
  - Fieldwork conducted with access granted by Scottish Natural Heritage.
  - Contributors: Sarah Wanless, Mike Harris, Francis Daunt (data collection); Ruth Dunn (data processing).
- Relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Provides standardized, verifiable dive behavior and depth data outside breeding season for three auk species.
  - Can support broader monitoring of marine foraging ecology and environmental health by enabling comparisons across time, seasons, and locations when integrated with other datasets and portals.
