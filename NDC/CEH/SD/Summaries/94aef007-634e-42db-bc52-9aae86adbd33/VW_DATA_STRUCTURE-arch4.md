# Explanatory Information: Species codes

- Purpose
  - Provides extensive cross-references for ECN (Environmental Change Network) species codes to enable consistent species identification across datasets and analyses.

- What the data contain
  - A large set of mappings in the form: "<ECN code>, <alternate code> = <mapped name or code>."
  - Examples show ECN numeric codes (e.g., 2254, 2947, 1121) mapped to various names or codes, including multiple synonyms and related taxa (e.g., Riccardia chamedryfolia mapped to Riccardia multifida; Rosa arvensis; Rosa canina; Rubus sp.; etc.).
  - Cross-references include alternative coding systems or aliases (e.g., Bry_902, Vas_902, etc.), reflecting integration with other taxon coding schemes.

- Structure and patterns
  - Each line ties an ECN code to one or more alternative identifiers or Latin names, often listing several possible mappings for broader compatibility.
  - The excerpt demonstrates numerous taxa across plants and bryophytes, algae, lichens, etc., indicating broad taxonomic coverage.

- Relationship to data quality and usage
  - The mapping supports interoperability and reuse by aligning ECN codes with other naming conventions used in partner datasets.
  - This section is part of broader explanatory information that helps users interpret species codes consistently.

- Quality and interpretation notes
  - The document includes a separate Quality Codes section (not fully shown here but referenced in the broader text) with codes such as 100–999, where 999 denotes an unusual event (see the quality text).

- Practical usage for Data Leaders
  - Use these mappings to translate ECN species codes into standardized names or cross-reference with external taxon databases during analysis, reporting, or data integration.
  - Leverage the cross-references to harmonize datasets from multiple sources and to improve discoverability and interoperability across networks.
