# Vegetation work

- Purpose: Standardised methods to assess vegetation structure, species composition, and biomass to monitor environmental health over time.
- Scope: Per-site measurements of vegetation cover, richness, and biomass, plus calculations for diversity (Shannon–Weaver).

## Vegetation assessment methods

- Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
- Biomass: clip at ground level from each quadrat, dry at 80 °C for 24 hours, weigh, and sum across the site to yield g biomass m⁻².
- Diversity: Shannon’s Diversity index calculated using the Shannon & Weaver (1963) formulation.

## Greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Net ecosystem CO₂ exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration assessed using four soil collars and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (EGM-4 IRGA).
- CO₂ influx measured over two minutes; a reflective cover is then placed to obtain CO₂ efflux in the dark.
- Concurrent measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
- Calculations convert raw CO₂ concentrations (ppm) to CO₂ flux (mg m⁻² h⁻¹) using chamber volume and area; a time-based change in CO₂ is used to derive flux.
- CH₄, CO₂, and N₂O quantified by placing reflective-chamber collars and collecting air samples (9 mL) at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes for gas-chromatography analysis.
- Final gas flux values derived using the same calculation framework as the IRGA-based CO₂ flux.

## Soil sampling and processing

- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm diameter auger to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Nitrogen and mineralisation analyses

- KCl extraction for N: 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL 1 M KCl, shaken for 1 hour, filtered; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻) using an autoanalyser.
- Moisture-adjustment: DIN mg kg⁻¹ = (raw value × (water content + extract volume) × dilution factor) ÷ dry soil weight.
- Mineralisation: 5 g soil incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above; mineralisation calculated as (NO₃⁻ + NH₄⁺) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹).

## Data management and outputs

- Outputs include: vegetation cover and composition, biomass (g m⁻²), species richness, Shannon diversity, CO₂/CH₄/N₂O fluxes (mg CO₂ m⁻² h⁻¹, etc.), DIN, and mineralisation rates.
- Protocols emphasize data quality assurance, standardised analysis methods, and documentation for reproducibility.
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to enable sharing and long-term monitoring.

## Considerations for data value and accessibility

- Aligns with aims to increase dataset value by enabling integration with other environmental data.
- Supports access to underlying data used to generate outputs, facilitating transparency and reuse.
