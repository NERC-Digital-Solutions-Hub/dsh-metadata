# Vegetation work and greenhouse gas flux measurements

## Vegetation assessment
- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover of each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass harvested by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, and weighed; summed across the site to yield g biomass per m².
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon, 1963).

## Greenhouse gas flux measurements
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration assessed using four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in soil with transparent chambers attached to an IRGA (EGM-4).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; a reflective cover placed to obtain dark efflux; soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and PAR measured in triplicate.
- CO2 flux converted from 27 measurements (ppm) over two minutes to mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹.
- Calculations involve time-based CO2 changes, chamber volume and area, and temperature corrections (formulas reference standard chamber/IRGA methods; t0 and t120 measurements used).

## Methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide
- Chambers covered with reflective material; 9 mL air sampled into syringe and injected into evacuated vials at 10, 20, and 30 minutes.
- Gases measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B); final values calculated using the same approach as IRGA data.

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to ~10 cm depth.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve, stored at 5°C until processing.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g fresh soil shaken with 25 mL of 1 M KCl for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analysed for DIN (NH4⁺ and NO3⁻) via autoanalyser.
- DIN calculations adjust for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × [water content + extract volume] × dilution factor) / dry soil weight.
- A separate 5 g subsample incubated at 25°C for 14 days; processed and analysed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as: (NO3⁺NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days = g m⁻² d⁻¹.
