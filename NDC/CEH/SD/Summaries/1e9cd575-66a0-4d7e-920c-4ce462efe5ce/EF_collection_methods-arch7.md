# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux

- Purpose and GIS relevance
  - Documents field and lab methods to quantify vegetation characteristics and greenhouse gas fluxes, enabling creation of map-based data products for spatial analysis and reporting.
  - Data can be integrated into GIS to visualize spatial patterns of vegetation, biomass, diversity, and gas flux across sites.

- Vegetation work
  - Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly at the site to sample vegetation.
  - Visual estimation of the percentage cover for each species within quadrats.
  - Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs are derived by summing the four quadrats.
  - Biomass sampling: biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per m2.
  - Diversity quantified using Shannon’s Diversity index (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).

- Greenhouse gas flux measurements
  - CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured using four collars (25 cm diameter) with transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
  - Measurements conducted over two minutes to capture CO2 influx; a reflective cover is used to obtain dark (respiration) conditions.
  - Concurrent measurements of soil moisture (WET sensor), soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
  - CO2 flux expressed as mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1, derived from the IRGA data.
  - Two timepoints (t0 and t120) used to compute CO2 changes over time, with explicit note of start time and interval calculations.
  - Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) sampled with reflective chambers; 9 ml air drawn at 10, 20, and 30 minutes and analyzed by Gas Chromatograph (GC). Final gas flux values calculated using the same approach as IRGA-derived CO2.

- Soil sampling and processing
  - Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
  - Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots; samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

- KCl extractable nitrogen and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g fresh soil extracted with 25 ml of 1 M KCl; shaken and filtered.
  - Filtrate diluted and analyzed for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NH4+ and NO3−) using an autoanalyser.
  - DIN normalized for soil moisture using a defined calculation to express mg/kg.
  - A second 5 g soil sample incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above to assess mineralisation.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3− + NH4+) × bulk density ÷ number of days, expressed as g m^-2 day^-1.

- Data and equations
  - CO2 flux and gas flux calculations rely on chamber volume, chamber area, and measured gas concentrations, with calculations adapted for time-based flux rates.
  - Specific equations shown for CO2 flux calculations (including time variables and unit conversions) and mineralisation computations.
