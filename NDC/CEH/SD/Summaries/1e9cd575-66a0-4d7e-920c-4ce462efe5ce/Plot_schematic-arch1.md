# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim: Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk, then test carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the plant groups. The study ran from March 2013 to September 2016, with data collected in 2014.

## Experimental design and concepts

- Plant groups (functional effects traits) were used to categorize species into three groups expected to have distinct effects on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
  - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves. Includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species. Predicted to store more carbon in soil (carbon deposited deeper, less accessible to microbes). Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots. Minimal impact on carbon and nitrogen; small physical presence. Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; long-lived. Very fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; may reduce long-term carbon storage due to rapid turnover. Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- A species grid was created to assign species to their respective functional group, with multiple species listed per group.

## Plot layout and replication

- Grid design: 7 plots across (horizontal) and 6 plots down (vertical), forming a 7x6 layout.
- Treatments: Across the 7 horizontal positions, every combination of the three functional groups was represented.
- Replication: The treatment combinations were repeated across each row, yielding six replicates of each combination.
- Plot size and spacing: Each plot measures 8 m x 8 m with a 2 m gap between plots.

## Drought treatment (rain shelters)

- From 2015 onwards, rain shelters were added to the plots to investigate drought effects.
- Shelter timing: Deployed from the beginning of June until mid-July, designed to mimic an extreme drought (approximately once in 100 years).

## Data collected and scope

- The dataset includes data collected in 2014.
- Measurements focus on:
  - Plant community composition by functional group (and species presence within plots).
  - Carbon storage dynamics in soil and plant material.
  - Nitrogen cycling and overall soil fertility.
  - Ecosystem health indicators and microbial activity related to different plant group compositions.
- Experimental framework supports analysis of how functional group composition and drought stress influence carbon and nutrient cycling.

## Analytical implications

- Potential analyses include comparing carbon storage and nutrient cycling across the three functional groups, evaluating interaction effects with drought treatment, and assessing how species composition within plots drives ecosystem processes.
- The replicated, fully crossed design (7 across x 6 down with six replicates) supports robust statistical comparisons of treatment combinations and drought impacts.
