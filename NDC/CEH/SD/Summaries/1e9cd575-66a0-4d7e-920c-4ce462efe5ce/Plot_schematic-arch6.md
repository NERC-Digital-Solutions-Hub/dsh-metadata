# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim and scope
  - Use seeds and plug plants to establish different plant communities on bare chalk at Winklebury Hill.
  - Test carbon and nutrient (nitrogen) cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the plant functional groups (FGs).
  - Dataset covered data collected in 2014; the full experiment ran from March 2013 to September 2016.

- Plant functional groups (FGs) and representative species
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and some long-lived species (examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata).
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon/nitrogen cycling activity.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; long-lived; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil; may reduce long-term soil carbon storage due to fast turnover (examples include Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides; additional listed species span multiple genera).

- Experimental design and plot layout
  - A grid of plots in the field: 7 plots across (horizontal) by 6 plots down (vertical).
  - Each plot is 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - All combinations of the three FG groups were included, with each combination replicated across six plots (six replicates per treatment).
  - From 2015, rain shelters were added to assess drought effects; shelters were deployed from June to mid-July to simulate an extreme drought (once in 100 years).

- Treatments and data collection
  - Plots created to test interactions among FG combinations and their impact on carbon and nutrient cycling.
  - Rain shelter treatment introduced to examine drought responses starting in 2015.
  - Data collected aimed to quantify differences in carbon storage in soil, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, and general ecosystem health across FG treatments and under drought conditions.

- Timeline and data scope
  - Experiment duration: March 2013 – September 2016.
  - Included data collection in 2014 (as part of ongoing measurements across treatments and drought manipulations).

- Key implications for data use
  - Provides a structured, replicated framework to analyze how plant functional traits influence carbon sequestration, soil fertility, and ecosystem dynamics under varying moisture conditions.
  - Data enable comparisons between FG-driven predictions (e.g., deeper carbon input vs. rapid turnover) and observed carbon/nutrient cycling outcomes across a controlled, multi-factor design.
