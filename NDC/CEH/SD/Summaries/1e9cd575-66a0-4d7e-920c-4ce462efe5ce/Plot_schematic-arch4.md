# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Overview
- Aim: Assess how different plant communities on bare chalk influence carbon storage, nutrient cycling, and ecosystem health.
- Timeframe: Field experiment conducted 2013–2016; dataset includes data collected in 2014.
- Approach: Plants grouped into functional effect trait (FG) groups to predict their environmental impacts; focus on comparing downstream carbon and soil processes across groups.

## Experimental design and data collected
- Plot layout: 7 across by 6 down grid of plots, each 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots; six replicates of every FG combination.
- Treatments: All combinations of the three FG groups were included in the grid.
- Drought manipulation: From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to simulate extreme drought (on from June to mid-July) to study drought effects on carbon and nutrient dynamics.
- Data focus: Measures related to carbon storage in soil, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, and overall ecosystem health.

## Plant functional groups (FG) and species
- FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - Predicted effects: substantial soil carbon storage due to deeper rooting.
  - Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited soil impact in carbon/nitrogen terms.
  - Predicted effects: smaller carbon/nitrogen footprint; limited physical presence.
  - Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- FG3: Big plants with shallow, extensive roots and fast-growing leaves; long-lived.
  - Predicted effects: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term carbon storage due to fast turnover.
  - Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
- The dataset includes a comprehensive mapping of species to FG groups (extensive lists provided).

## Data structure and management relevance
- Data organization: A structured grid with explicit FG group combinations and replicated plots supports robust comparison of functional group effects on carbon and nutrient processes.
- Temporal aspect: Drought treatment introduced in 2015 adds a temporal dimension for assessing resilience and treatment interactions over time.
- Documentation availability: The description includes detailed FG definitions, species lists by group, and plot layout, enabling clear metadata creation for data discoverability and reuse.

## Implications for data strategy and governance
- User needs and applicability: Data would support researchers and policy colleagues interested in how plant functional traits influence carbon cycling and soil health under drought stress.
- Data availability and granularity: Rich, trait-based grouping and plot-level treatments provide granular insights but require well-structured metadata (FG definitions, species lists, plot IDs, treatment timing).
- Data quality and standards: Clear labeling of FG groups, consistent species nomenclature, and precise recording of drought treatment periods are essential for cross-study comparability.
- Community and collaboration: The experimental design lends itself to integration with wider ecological data networks focused on functional traits and ecosystem services.
