# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux measurements methodology

- Overview
  - Describes field-based measurement protocols for vegetation metrics, greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2, CH4, N2O), and soil N dynamics at a site.
  - Includes sampling design, equipment, measurement timelines, and calculations to derive standardised metrics.

- Vegetation measurements
  - Quadrat sampling: Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
  - Visual estimates: Percent cover of each species within quadrats.
  - Aggregation: Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
  - Biomass: Biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, and weighed; total site biomass summed.
  - Diversity: Shannon’s Diversity (Shannon and Weaver, 1963) calculated.

- Greenhouse gas flux measurements
  - CO2 exchange system: Four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) embedded in the soil; transparent chambers attached to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA) to measure CO2 influx over two minutes; after a reflective cover is placed, the measurement is repeated to obtain CO2 efflux in the dark.
  - Ancillary measurements: Soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate.
  - Calculations: CO2 flux calculated from 27 measurements over two minutes, converted to mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1 using chamber volume, area, and gas constants (with explicit steps and units shown in the workflow).

- Methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide measurements
  - Gas sampling: Chambers with reflective material; 9 mL air samples collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes; exact timing recorded.
  - Analysis: Gas chromatography (Agilent 7890B) used to quantify CH4, CO2, and N2O.
  - Calculations: Final gas flux values derived using the same calculation framework as for CO2.

- Soil sampling and nutrient mineralisation
  - Soil collection: Six samples per site using a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm; samples sieved to 2 mm and stored at 5 °C.
  - KCl extractable N (DIN): 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL 1M KCl, shaken, filtered; DIN (NH4+ and NO3-) analysed after dilution; DIN mg/kg adjusted for soil moisture and dry weight.
  - Mineralisation: Another 5 g sample incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analysed as above.
  - Mineralisation rate: Calculated as (NO3- + NH4+) × bulk density ÷ number of days, expressed as g m^-2 day^-1.

- Data handling and standards
  - Measurements rely on standardised field protocols, replication, and careful documentation of times and volumes to enable comparability.
