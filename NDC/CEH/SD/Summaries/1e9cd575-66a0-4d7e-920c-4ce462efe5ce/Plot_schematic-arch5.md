# Winklebury Hill experiment

## Overview
- Study aimed to create different plant communities on bare chalk using seeds and plug plants.
- Measured carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compared them to the characteristics of plant groups.
- Conducted from March 2013 to September 2016; dataset includes data collected in 2014.

## Experimental design and data structure
- Plants were organized into three functional effect trait groups (FGs) to predict ecosystem impacts on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health.
- A grid of plots was established: 7 columns by 6 rows, with each plot measuring 8 m x 8 m and 2 m gaps between plots.
- All combinations of the three FG groups were included, replicated six times across the grid.
- From 2015 onwards, rain shelters were added to investigate drought effects; shelters were deployed from early June to mid-July to mimic an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

## Plant groups and species
- FG1: Deep, thick tap roots, simple root structure, thin large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species; predicted to enhance soil carbon storage via deep carbon inputs.
  - Example species include Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, among others.
- FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited contribution to carbon and nitrogen cycling due to small physical presence.
  - Example species include Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, among others.
- FG3: Large plants with shallow, thin roots and big fleshy leaves; high microbial activity and rapid carbon/nitrogen cycling, potentially reducing long-term carbon storage.
  - Example species include Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., among others.
- A detailed grid lists species assigned to each FG across plots (group membership shown per species).

## Plot layout and drought treatment
- Plots arranged in an 8 m x 8 m grid (7 across x 6 down) with 2 m gaps.
- Each plot contains a unique combination of the three FG groups.
- Rain shelters introduced in 2015 to simulate drought conditions; deployed from June to mid-July each year to reflect extreme but temporary drought stress.

## Data collected and timeframe
- Primary outcomes: carbon storage, soil fertility indicators, and ecosystem health metrics linked to the functional groups.
- Data collection occurred during the 2014 dataset included in the study; overarching experiment spanned March 2013 to September 2016.
- Treatments and plot configurations (FG combinations and drought manipulation) are explicitly documented for reproducibility.

## Data governance and sharing considerations for the dataset
- Key metadata to capture for data stewardship:
  - Study title and aims, time frame (2013–2016) and specific data year (2014 included).
  - Location: Winklebury Hill; plot design details (7x6 grid, plot size 8 m x 8 m, 2 m gaps).
  - Experimental design: definition of the three functional groups (FG1–FG3), species lists per group, grid of FG combinations, sixfold replication.
  - Treatments: drought manipulation with rain shelters (deployment window and duration).
  - Data types and variables: carbon cycling rates, nitrogen cycling rates, soil fertility indicators, ecosystem health metrics; units and measurement methods to be documented.
  - Temporal coverage: which measurements correspond to which year (notably 2014 data) and the drought treatment period (2015 onward).
  - Species-level data: full FG assignment grid and example species per group to support reproducibility and re-use.
- Considerations for discoverability and reuse:
  - Clear documentation of plot identifiers, FG configurations, and drought treatment timelines.
  - Standardized metadata to enable cross-study comparisons of functional-group-based ecosystem assessments.

## Key data management considerations and potential challenges
- Complex taxonomic data due to many species across three functional groups; ensure taxonomic authorities and naming conventions are consistent.
- Detailed plot-level design requires precise metadata for replication and secondary analyses.
- Data volumes may increase with repeated measurements across multiple plots and years; plan for scalable storage and versioning.
- Ensure alignment of data formats across years (2014 data included) and consistent units for carbon, nitrogen, and soil fertility measures.
