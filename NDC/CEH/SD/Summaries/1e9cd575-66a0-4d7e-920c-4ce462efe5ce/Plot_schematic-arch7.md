# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim: Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk, then test carbon and nutrient cycling rates and compare these to the characteristics of the three plant groups. The study ran 2013–2016, with data collection including 2014.

## Plant Functional Groups (FG)

- FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; long-lived and/or diverse lifespans.
  - Predicted effect: lots of carbon storage in soil; roots push carbon deeper, reducing accessibility to soil microbes.
  - Example species (selected): Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
  - Predicted effect: limited carbon and nitrogen cycling; small in physical presence.
  - Example species (selected): Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast turnover.
  - Predicted effect: very fast carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduced long-term carbon storage.
  - Example species (selected): Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Note: A broader list maps numerous species to these functional groups, illustrating the grouping by functional effects traits.

## Experimental Design

- Layout concept: 3-group factorial arrangement to compare functional traits’ effects on carbon, nitrogen, and ecosystem health.
- Plot replication: Each combination of the three FG groups is replicated across the grid six times.

## Plot Layout and Geography

- Grid: 7 plots across (columns) by 6 plots down (rows).
- Plot size: Each plot 8 m x 8 m.
- Spacing: 2 m gaps between plots.
- Treatment combinations: Every possible combination of the three FG groups included within the across-row arrangements.
- Rain-drought treatment: From 2015, rain shelters added to plots to simulate drought conditions.
  - Shelter timing: Shelters deployed from early June to mid-July, mimicking an extreme drought event (once in 100 years).

## Data Collected

- Primary metrics: Carbon storage, soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health, in relation to plant functional groups.
- Temporal scope: Data collection includes 2014 data; drought/shelter effects observed from 2015 onward.

## Spatial and GIS Considerations

- The study’s explicit plot grid and replicate structure support spatial analysis of treatment effects.
- Potential GIS uses:
  - Mapping plot locations, treatments, and FG compositions.
  - Analyzing spatial patterns in carbon cycling and soil properties across the 7x6 plot grid.
  - Integrating multi-year data (2014–2016) to assess temporal changes and drought responses.
- Data integration needs: migration of species-level groupings to functional groups, alignment of soil/carbon measurements with plot coordinates, and handling large or complex datasets across multiple years.

## Timeline and Data Availability

- Timeline: March 2013 – September 2016 (focus on data from 2014 included in dataset).
- Data availability: Includes a dataset with 2014 measurements; drought treatments implemented from 2015.

## Notable Features

- Emphasis on functional traits to predict ecosystem outcomes (carbon storage and soil processes).
- Comprehensive factorial plot design with full combination coverage and replication.
- Incorporation of a drought treatment to evaluate resilience and carbon/nitrogen dynamics under stress.
