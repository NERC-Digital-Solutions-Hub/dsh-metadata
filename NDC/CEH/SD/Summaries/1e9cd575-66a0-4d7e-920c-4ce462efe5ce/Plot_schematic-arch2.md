# Winklebury Hill experiment

- Purpose: Use seeds and plug plants to create different plant communities on bare chalk and test carbon and nutrient cycling rates, comparing outcomes to the characteristics of the three plant groups defined by functional effects traits.

- Timeframe: Conducted from March 2013 to September 2016; the dataset includes data collected in 2014.

- Plant functional groups (FG) and rationale:
  - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots with a simple root structure and large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and some long-lived species.
    - Predicted effects: substantial soil carbon storage; roots move carbon deeper into the soil, reducing accessibility to microbes.
    - Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; limited carbon and nitrogen dynamics; overall small physical presence.
    - Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - FG3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large fleshy leaves; rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential for lower long-term carbon storage due to fast turnover.
    - Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Experimental design and layout:
  - Plots arranged in a grid of 7 across by 6 down, with six replicates of each treatment combination.
  - Each plot measures 8 m x 8 m with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Every combination of the three functional groups was included across the grid (FG1 x FG2 x FG3 combinations).

- Drought treatment:
  - From 2015 onward, rain shelters were added to the plots to examine the effect of drought.
  - Shelters were deployed from the beginning of June to mid-July, simulating an extreme (once in 100 years) drought event.

- Data and outputs:
  - Collected data focused on carbon storage and nutrient cycling within different plant groupings.
  - Aimed to relate plant functional group traits to ecosystem outcomes such as soil carbon storage, nitrogen dynamics, and overall ecosystem health.
  - The dataset includes observations from 2014, with the experimental design enabling analysis of treatment effects and drought responses.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring:
  - Demonstrates a standardized, trait-based experimental approach to assess environmental health indicators (carbon storage, soil fertility, ecosystem function).
  - Provides replicated, transparent plots and data collection that can be integrated with broader datasets for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
