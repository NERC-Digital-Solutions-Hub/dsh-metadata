# Vegetation work and Greenhouse gas flux; Soil sampling and mineralisation

- Vegetation work
  - Four random 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed on the site.
  - Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
  - Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs computed by summing the four quadrats.
  - Biomass: clip at ground level from each quadrat, dry at 80°C for 24 hours, weigh, and sum across the site to obtain g biomass per m².
  - Shannon’s Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).

- Greenhouse gas flux
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured with four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA).
  - CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes; a reflective cover placed over the chamber and a repeat measurement obtained to determine CO2 efflux in the dark.
  - At the same time, soil moisture (WET sensor), soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate.
  - Calculations convert 27 CO2 measurements (ppm) over 2 minutes into CO2 flux (mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹); time-based predictions used (t0 and t120 seconds) to compute changes in CO2 over an hour.
  - Final CO2 flux expressed as mg CO2 m⁻² h⁻¹ using chamber volume and area with established unit conversions (involving atomic masses and gas constant).
  - Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O)
    - Chambers covered with reflective material placed in collars; 9 mL air sampled into a syringe and injected into evacuated gas vials.
    - Sampling at 0, 10, 20, and 30 minutes with exact timing recorded.
    - Gas concentrations measured with a Gas-Chromatograph (GC).
    - Final gas flux values calculated using the same approach as for CO2 with the IRGA.
  
- Soil sampling
  - Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm as far as possible.
  - Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots; samples stored at 5°C until processing.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g fresh soil mixed with 25 mL of 1 M KCl, shaken at 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtered through Whatman No. 1.
  - Filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN: NH4⁺ and NO3⁻) using an autoanalyser.
  - DIN concentration adjusted for soil moisture using: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume) × 100) / dry weight.
  - A second 5 g soil sample incubated with 25 mL KCl at 25°C for 14 days; processed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3⁺NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹).
