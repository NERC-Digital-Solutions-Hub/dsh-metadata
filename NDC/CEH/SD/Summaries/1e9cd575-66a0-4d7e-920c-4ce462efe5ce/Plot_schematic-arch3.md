Winklebury Hill experiment

- Aim
  - Use seeds and plug plants to establish different plant communities on bare chalk and test how they influence carbon and nutrient cycling.
  - Compare observed ecosystem responses to the functional traits of the plant groups.
  - Conduct the study from March 2013 to September 2016, with dataset data collected in 2014.

- Experimental design and plant groups (functional effects traits)
  - Three plant functional groups (FGs) defined by root structure and growth form, expected to have different effects on carbon storage, soil fertility, and ecosystem health:
    - FG1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
      - Predictions: higher soil carbon storage due to carbon being deposited deeper in the soil.
      - Example species include Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
    - FG2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
      - Predictions: relatively little carbon and nitrogen processing; smaller physical presence.
      - Example species include Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
    - FG3: Large plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; long-lived.
      - Predictions: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with high microbial activity; potential reduced long-term carbon storage.
      - Example species include Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
  - A comprehensive species list was organized into a grid of plots representing all combinations of the three groups.

- Plot layout and treatments
  - Layout: 7 plots across by 6 plots down, making a total of 42 plots with every possible combination of FG1, FG2, and FG3.
  - Each plot size: 8 m x 8 m, with 2 m gaps between plots.
  - Replication: the design was repeated in each row to provide six replicates of each treatment combination.
  - Drought treatment: from 2015 onwards, rain shelters were added to assess drought effects.
    - Shelters were deployed from the beginning of June until mid-July, simulating an extreme drought (once in 100 years).

- Data and outcomes
  - Measurements focused on carbon storage (primarily in soils), soil fertility, and overall ecosystem health, via monitoring of carbon and nitrogen cycling rates across the different FG combinations and under drought conditions.
  - Data collected during the study period include 2014 within the broader 2013–2016 experiment window.
  - The design enables evaluation of how plant functional traits influence ecosystem processes and responses to drought, informing monitoring and restoration strategies.
