# Spatial and temporal variations in aquatic organic matter composition in UK surface waters

- Objective and scope
  - Investigates spatial and temporal variations in aquatic organic matter (AOM) composition in UK surface waters.
  - Fieldwork conducted 2018–2021 across four sites in England and Scotland, including peat- and organic-soil influenced waters.
  - Sampling encompassed multiple water body types (pools, headwaters, streams, reservoirs, lakes) and multiple locations within each catchment.

- Study design and sampling locations
  - Sites selected to capture diversity in water body type, catchment characteristics, and peatland influence.
  - Within-site sampling included several sub-locations (e.g., pools, headwaters, streams, inlets, reservoirs, lakes).
  - Site metadata captured to characterize sampling context (location group, peat area, elevation, land use, vegetation, catchment area, distance to sea).

- Field measurements and sample collection
  - In situ measurements at each site: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature; additional air temperature, pressure, and humidity recorded.
  - Grab water samples collected (50 mL) and filtered on site through 0.45 µm filters; samples kept cold (cool bag in field, fridge at 4 °C in lab) for subsequent chemistry analyses.
  - Water chemistry analyses included dissolved and inorganic carbon, absorbance at eight wavelengths, and a suite of nutrients, cations, metals, and anions.

- Organic matter collection and processing
  - Large-volume sampling to extract particulate organic matter (POM); subsequent filtration to isolate DOM contributions.
  - Concentration of filtered water to ~100 mL, then drying to remove water and isolate DOM/colloidal matter.
  - DOM fraction analyzed primarily by elemental composition (C, H, N, O) using a Vario MICRO cube; subset analyzed by negative-mode FT-ICR MS for detailed molecular characterization.

- Analytical methods and QA/QC
  - DOM elemental analysis after acidification to remove inorganic carbonates.
  - Replicate analysis: 10% of samples reanalyzed; instrument calibration and checks performed at run start and during runs.
  - Data QA: replicate comparisons; if replicates concur within 95%, averaged values used; otherwise samples reanalyzed.
  - Derived metrics restricted by physical properties (e.g., bonding) to maintain data validity.

- Data governance, metadata, and sharing
  - Datasets compiled with structured metadata; key datasets include UK_Sites, UK_DOM, and UK_Water.
  - Location data for certain sites (e.g., reservoir locations) withheld to maintain access-agreement confidentiality with water companies.
  - Metadata fields cover sampling visits, calendar months, years, site grouping, peat area, elevation type, catchment area, land use, vegetation cover, sampling position, and proximity to the sea.
  - Emphasizes data quality, openness, and data management standards, while balancing confidentiality and governance considerations.

- Datasets and key variables
  - UK_Sites: site-level metadata, including visits (1–24), sampling month/year, location group, peat area, elevation, water body type, land use, vegetation, catchment area, and distance to sea.
  - UK_DOM: DOM composition metrics derived from elemental data and FT-ICR MS outputs (e.g., C/N ratios, oxidation state, aromaticity, diversity indices, lipid/carbohydrate/amino/peptide fractions, assigned formulae, mean and dispersion in m/z, etc.).
  - UK_Water: environmental variables and water chemistry for each sample, including pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water and air temperatures, humidity, pressure, and a broad suite of chemical species (DOC, chloride, sulfate, DON, DIN, DOP, DIP, major ions, trace metals, and related proxies).
  - Data structure supports linking site metadata, DOM composition metrics, and water chemistry across visits and samples.

- Reference and methodological context
  - Builds on Moody et al. (2020) methodology for DOM extraction from freshwaters, including extraction, analysis, and QA procedures.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates an end-to-end approach for environmental health monitoring: robust field sampling design, standardized in-field measurements, detailed laboratory analyses of DOM, comprehensive QA/QC, and structured datasets with clear metadata.
  - Highlights practical governance considerations for monitoring programs, such as data sharing barriers, anonymization of sensitive locations, and the need for consistent data management and provenance.
  - Provides a blueprint for integrating high-resolution organic matter characterization (including FT-ICR MS) into monitoring frameworks to inform policy decisions and future decisions regarding water quality and ecosystem health.
