# Experimental Design

- Objective: A qualitative study in Bangladesh to complement quantitative data on antibiotic-resistant bacteria among poultry, humans, and the environment; explores poultry keeping, hygiene, waste disposal, biosecurity, and antibiotic use.

- Settings and participants:
  - Rural households with domestic poultry (n=3)
  - Small-scale commercial poultry farm workers in a rural area (n=10)
  - Urban live poultry market stall holders in Dhaka (n=5)
  - Location: Mirzapur sub-district, Tangail District (rural) and Dhaka city (urban)
  - Total interviews: 18

- Interview focus areas (themes):
  - Poultry rearing practices (care, feed, business decisions, disease prevention)
  - Waste-disposal practices (faeces/litter, carcasses, offal, processing water)
  - Biosecurity, hygiene, and personal protection for humans
  - Sources of advice and decision-making influences
  - Perceptions of antibiotics and reasons for their use

- Methodology:
  - In-depth interviews using tailored guides for each setting
  - No formal sample size calculation; continued until thematic saturation
  - Written informed consent with right to withdraw
  - Ethical clearances: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037)

- Data collection and structure:
  - Data collected through interviews conducted and transcribed by an experienced researcher
  - Transcripts anonymised, conducted and transcribed in Bangla
  - Transcripts checked against audio recordings to ensure accuracy

- Quality control:
  - Transcripts validated by cross-checking with original audio

- Data governance and stewardship considerations (for Data Stewards perspective):
  - Anonymisation of interview data (Bangla transcripts) to protect participant identity
  - Documentation of data provenance, settings, participant groups, and language
  - Ethical compliance and consent documentation; potential implications for data sharing and embargo
  - Metadata to capture study location, respondent category, and themes for discoverability
  - Clear data handling practices to support future reuse while respecting participant rights and study restrictions
  - Assessment of data sharing feasibility given consent and sensitive health/animal welfare content
