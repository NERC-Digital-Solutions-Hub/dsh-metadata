# Experimental Design

## Objective and context
- Qualitative study conducted in Bangladesh to complement quantitative assessment of antibiotic resistant bacteria among poultry, humans, and the environment.
- Explores antibiotic use, poultry keeping practices, poultry hygiene, and waste disposal practices.

## Settings and participants
- Rural households with domestic poultry; small-scale commercial poultry farmers in a rural area; market sellers of live poultry in urban Dhaka.
- Study locations: Mirzapur sub-district, Tangail District (rural) and Dhaka city (urban).
- Total of 18 interviews: rural poultry owners (n=3), small-scale commercial farm workers (n=10), urban live poultry market stall holders (n=5).

## Data collection methods
- In-depth interviews guided by setting-specific interview guides to explore themes.
- Core themes: poultry rearing practices; waste-disposal practices; biosecurity measures and human hygiene; sources of advice and decision-making influences; perceptions and reasons for antibiotic use.
- Sampling pursued until thematic saturation; written informed consent obtained; right to withdraw preserved.
- Ethical clearance: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data collection specifics
- Interviews conducted and transcribed by an experienced researcher from icddr,b.
- Transcripts checked against original audio recordings.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Anonymised interview transcripts presented.
- Interviews conducted and transcribed in Bangla.

## Considerations for GIS data products
- Potential for geospatial representation of qualitative data:
  - Map interview sites by setting (rural vs urban) and location.
  - Link themes to locations (e.g., practices, waste disposal, biosecurity, antibiotic perceptions).
  - Integrate with related spatial data (e.g., environmental samples, antibiotic resistance datasets) for broader analyses.
- Possible GIS layers to inform map-based visuals:
  - Poultry production type/scale (household vs small-scale farm vs market stall)
  - Waste/disposal practices at locations
  - Biosecurity and hygiene practices by site
  - Perceived antibiotic usage and sources of advice by site

## Ethical and quality assurances
- Informed consent obtained; participants could withdraw.
- Ethical clearances documented (PR16071; R17-P037).
- Transcripts quality-checked against audio recordings.

## Limitations and notes
- Sample size determined by saturation rather than formal calculation; qualitative and not intended for generalization.
- Data are qualitative and collected in Bangla; no quantitative geospatial coordinates are provided in the document.
