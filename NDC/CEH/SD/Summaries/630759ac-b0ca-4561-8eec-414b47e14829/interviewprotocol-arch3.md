# Experimental Design

- This is a qualitative study designed to complement quantitative assessments of antibiotic-resistant bacteria among poultry, humans, and the environment in Bangladesh.
- Aimed to explore real-world practices that influence antibiotic use, poultry management, hygiene, and waste disposal to inform environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Settings and participants

- Study locations: Mirzapur sub-district, Tangail District (rural households and small-scale commercial farms) and Dhaka city (urban live poultry market stalls).
- Participant groups:
  - Rural poultry owners (n=3)
  - Small-scale commercial farm workers (n=10)
  - Urban market live poultry stall holders (n=5)
- Purposeful sampling guided by relevance to themes; no formal sample size calculation, interviews conducted until thematic saturation.

## Interview content and themes

- Poultry rearing practices: care routines, feed choices, business decision-making, disease prevention.
- Waste-disposal practices: solid/liquid waste, carcasses, offal, processing water, and market-related waste.
- Biosecurity and hygiene: practices before/after working with poultry; personal protection.
- Influences and sources of advice on poultry keeping and business decisions.
- Perceptions and rationales for antibiotic use.

## Ethical considerations and consent

- Written informed consent obtained from all participants; participants could withdraw at any stage.
- Ethical approvals: International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Data collection and quality control

- Methods: in-depth, semi-structured interviews; interview guides tailored for each setting.
- Data collection locations and recruitment: rural Mirzapur households and farm workers; urban Dhaka live poultry market stall holders.
- Quality control: interviews conducted and transcribed by an experienced researcher; transcripts checked against original audio recordings.

## Data processing and structure

- Data handling: anonymised interview transcripts.
- Language: interviews conducted and transcribed in Bangla.
- Verification: transcripts cross-checked with audio to ensure accuracy.

## Implications for monitoring and policy

- Provides formative, context-rich insights that can inform environmental health monitoring indicators (e.g., antibiotic use patterns, waste management, and biosecurity practices).
- Highlights data needs for monitoring frameworks, including reliable data collection on waste disposal, hygiene behavior, and influences on antibiotic use to support evidence-based policy decisions.
