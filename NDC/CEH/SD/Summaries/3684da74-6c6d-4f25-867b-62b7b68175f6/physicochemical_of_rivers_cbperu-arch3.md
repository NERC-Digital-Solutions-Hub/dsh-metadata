- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset to analyze physicochemical changes in river waters under glacial retreat, along a gradient of glacier coverage.
  - Aims to relate water chemistry to the biodiversity of aquatic macroinvertebrates in the Cordillera Blanca, Peru.

- Study area and timeline
  - Ten rivers in the glacial valleys of Parón, Huaytapallana, and Llanganuco, Cordillera Blanca, Ancash, Peru.
  - Sampling conducted in two periods: October 2019 and October 2020.

- Data collection and methods
  - In-field measurements with a Multi 3630 IDS multiparameter instrument (every 5 seconds, averaged over 5 minutes) for core physicochemical parameters.
  - Turbidity measured in the laboratory; other parameters (nutrients, carbon species, metal ions, anions) determined from water samples analyzed in the University of Leeds laboratory.
  - Topographic and glaciological context derived from remote sensing: slope from a 12.5 m DEM (ALOS PALSAR) and distance to glacier from Sentinel-2 imagery.
  - Pfankuch Index used to characterize channel stability (six components of the channel bed).

- Parameters and measurements
  - Physical/in-situ: water temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, Pfankuch Index.
  - Nutrients and carbon: total nitrogen, total phosphorus, dissolved organic carbon, dissolved inorganic carbon.
  - Metals and metalloids: Al, B, Be, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Si, Zn, Sr, Pb, Ni, Se, Te, Ti, etc.
  - Anions: fluoride, chloride, sulfate, nitrate.
  - Units provided for all parameters (e.g., NTU, °C, µS/cm, mg/L).

- Site information and geography
  - Site codes P01–P10 corresponding to 10 glacial rivers.
  - For each site: geographic coordinates (UTM 18S), basin area, glacier area, glacier coverage (GCC %) in Table 2, distance to glacier, slope, altitude.
  - Examples of site variation include GCC ranging from as low as ~0% to as high as ~66%, different distances from glacier, and diverse altitudes and slopes.

- Data structure and documentation
  - Data presented in a single Excel sheet.
  - Sites listed in the first column; environmental variables in the first row.
  - Season indicated by a code: w = wet season, d = dry season.
  - Nature and units of all 37 environmental variables documented in Table 3 (Site, Parameter, Units, Season).

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Instrument calibration prior to field work.
  - Use of certified standards and interlaboratory references (e.g., ERM-CA022a) to ensure accuracy and precision of measurements.
