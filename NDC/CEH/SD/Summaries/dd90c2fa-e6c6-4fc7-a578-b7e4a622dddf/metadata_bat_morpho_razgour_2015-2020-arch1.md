# Metadata for 'bat_morpho_razgour_2015-2020.csv'

## Aim
- Support studying adaptive responses to climate change in three bat species (Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, Myotis escalerai) across England, Spain, and Portugal from 2015–2020, as part of a NERC IRF project.

## Data scope and contents
- Morphological and life-history data collected from three bat species.
- Location: England, Spain, Portugal; time span: 2015–2020.
- Data stored in a single CSV; empty cells denote missing values.
- Coordinate data provided as latitude/longitude in WGS84 decimal degrees with a 10 km resolution.
- Species included: Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, Myotis escalerai.
- Variables include sex, age, reproductive condition, forearm measurements, and body mass.

## Collection and processing methods
- Bats captured in roosts, caves, foraging sites, and over small water bodies using mist nets and harp traps.
- Tissue samples (wing biopsies), blood, or faecal samples collected for study; non-target species released immediately; target species released after processing.
- Age determined by ossification of finger bones.
- Female reproductive condition classified as Nulliparous, Pregnant, Lactating, Post-lactating, or Nonreproductive.
- Male reproductive status inferred from position/size of testicles.
- Forearm measured with calipers; body mass measured with Pesola spring scales.
- All measurements taken by the same experienced person.
- Data checked for outliers and anomalies.

## Variables and units
- Latitude/Longitude: decimal degrees (WGS84), 10 km resolution.
- Sex: F or M.
- Age: Adults, Sub-adults, Juveniles.
- Female reproductive condition: Nulliparous, Pregnant, Lactating, Post-lactating, Nonreproductive.
- Male reproductive assessment: based on testicular position/size.
- Forearm: millimetres.
- BodyMass: grams.

## Data structure and accessibility
- Single CSV file containing data for all three species.
- Empty cells represent missing values.

## Quality control
- Measurements conducted by a single, experienced observer to ensure consistency.
- Data screened for outliers and anomalies.

## Potential uses for analysts
- Analyze morphological variation in relation to environmental/climatic factors.
- Compare species and life-history traits across regions and time.
- Develop predictive models of adaptive responses to climate change.
- Integrate with external environmental data to explore correlations and potential drivers.
