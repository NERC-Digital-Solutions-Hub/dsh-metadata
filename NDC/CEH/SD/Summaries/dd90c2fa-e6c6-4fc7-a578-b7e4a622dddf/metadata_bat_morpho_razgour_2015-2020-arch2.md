# Metadata for 'bat_morpho_razgour_2015-2020.csv'

## Purpose and scope
- Dataset contains morphological and life history data collected from 2015 to 2020.
- Species: Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, Myotis escalerai.
- Regions: England, Spain, and Portugal.
- Objective: study adaptive responses to climate change as part of a NERC IRF project.

## Study species and locations
- Three bat species included.
- Sampling across England, Spain, and Portugal to capture a broad geographic picture for climate-related adaptive studies.

## Collection and processing methods
- Bats captured to collect tissue (wing biopsies), blood, or faecal samples.
- Capture settings: roosts, caves, foraging sites, and over small water bodies.
- Capture tools: mist nets and harp traps.
- Handling: bats placed in individual cotton bags until processing.
- Post-processing: non-target species released immediately; target species released at the capture site after processing.

## Data collected and variable structure
- Location: Latitude and Longitude in WGS84 decimal degrees, with a resolution of 10 km.
- Sex: F (female) or M (male).
- Age: Adults, Sub-adults, or Juveniles.
- Reproductive condition:
  - Females: Nulliparous, Pregnant, Lactating, Post-lactating, Nonreproductive.
  - Males: assessed by position/size of the testicles.
- Forearm: measurement in millimetres (caliper).
- BodyMass: measurement in grams (Pesola spring scales).
- Data completeness: empty cells denote missing values.

## Quality control and data integrity
- All measurements taken by the same experienced person.
- Data checked for outliers and anomalies to ensure consistency.

## Data structure and accessibility
- File format: a single CSV file containing all three species.
- Missing values are represented by empty cells.

## Practical considerations for environmental monitoring analysts
- Standardized data collection and measurement protocols support cross-study comparability.
- Coordinated metadata enables integration with climate and ecological analyses of bat responses.
- Spatial data are provided at a coarse resolution (10 km), which may influence fine-scale analyses.
