# Metadata for 'bat_morpho_razgour_2015-2020.csv'

## Overview
- Morphological and life-history data for three bat species: Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, Myotis escalerai.
- Timeframe: 2015–2020.
- Geographic scope: England, Spain, and Portugal.
- Purpose: study adaptive responses to climate change; part of a NERC IRF project.

## Data collection methods
- Bats captured to collect tissue samples (wing biopsies), blood, or fecal samples.
- Capture sites included roosts, caves, foraging sites, and areas over small water bodies.
- Capture methods: mist nets and harp traps.
- Procedures: bats kept in individual cotton bags during processing; non-target species released immediately; target species released after processing.

## Variables and units
- Location: Latitude and Longitude in WGS84 decimal degrees, presented at a 10 km resolution.
- Sex: F (female) or M (male).
- Age: Adults, Sub-adults, or Juveniles.
- Reproductive condition:
  - Females: Nulliparous, Pregnant, Lactating, Post-lactating, Nonreproductive.
  - Males: determined by position/size of the testicles.
- Forearm: measurements in millimetres (mm).
- Body Mass: measurements in grams (g).

## Data quality and structure
- All measurements taken by the same experienced person.
- Data checked for outliers and anomalies.
- Structure: a single CSV file containing data for all three species.
- Missing values indicated by empty cells.

## Scope and context
- Dataset supports monitoring of environmental health indicators related to bat morphology and life history.
- Data governance aspects implied through quality control and standardized metadata, though explicit public-sharing requirements are not stated.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides standardized, location-linked biological indicators (sex, age, reproductive status, body condition) useful for environmental health monitoring.
- Enables assessment of climate-change-driven adaptive responses across multiple species and regions.
- Suitable for cross-species comparisons and temporal trend analyses to inform policy and management decisions.
