# Metadata for 'bat_morpho_razgour_2015-2020.csv'

## Overview
- Morphological and life history data collected 2015–2020 from three bat species: Barbastella barbastellus, Plecotus auritus, and Myotis escalerai.
- Location: England, Spain, and Portugal.
- Study aim: investigate adaptive responses to climate change as part of a NERC IRF project.

## Collection and Generation Methods
- Bats captured to collect tissue (wing biopsies), blood, or fecal samples.
- Capture settings: roosts, caves, foraging sites, and over small water bodies.
- Methods: mist nets and harp traps.
- Handling: individual bats placed in cotton bags during processing; non-target species released immediately; target species released back at capture site after processing.

## Data Details and Units
- Coordinates: Latitude/Longitude in WGS84 decimal degrees, reported at a resolution of 10 km.
- Sex: F (female) or M (male).
- Age: Adults, Sub-adults, or Juveniles (based on ossification of finger bones).
- Reproductive condition (females): Nulliparous, Pregnant, Lactating, Post-lactating, Nonreproductive.
- Reproductive condition (males): assessed from position/size of testes.
- Forearm: measurements in millimeters (mm).
- BodyMass: measurements in grams (g).
- Data are presented in a single CSV file including all three species; empty cells indicate missing values.

## Quality Control
- All measurements taken by the same experienced person to ensure consistency.
- Data checked for outliers and anomalies.

## Data Structure and Availability
- Structure: single CSV file containing data for all three bat species.
- Missing values: represented by empty cells.
- Dataset scope: 2015–2020 collection period.
- Availability: intended to be uploaded to relevant data portals and catalogues as part of standard data sharing practices.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Considerations
- Alignment with good data management practices: clear data items, units, and collection context to facilitate reuse.
- Metadata should document provenance, collection methods, and processing steps for reproducibility.
- Plan for updates and versioning to reflect any corrections or additions.
- Ensure appropriate data sharing terms and repository placement (portals/catalogues) consistent with the NERC IRF project and institutional policies.

## Limitations and Cautions
- Location precision limited to 10 km resolution due to reporting format.
- Missing values present in the dataset; users should account for gaps in analyses.
- Data captured under specific field conditions; applicability may vary for other contexts or species.

## Provenance and Notes
- Part of a climate-change adaptation study under a NERC IRF project.
- Data reflect processed measurements taken during handling and release procedures outlined above.
