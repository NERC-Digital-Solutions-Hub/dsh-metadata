## Overview
- Compilation of post-Chernobyl radiocaesium survey data for Great Britain.
- Datasets cover radiocaesium (Cs-134, Cs-137) in soil, vegetation, wildlife, and fungi from 1986–1997.
- Aimed at monitoring environmental contamination, uptake by biota, and spatial-temporal trends.

## Sampling and Study Design
- Vegetation: grassy/graminaceous plants sampled to reflect grazing animal diet; site selection avoids splash from roads and throughfall from trees.
- Wildlife: samples from rabbit, hare, fox, red deer, woodcock, grouse; ingestion data obtained from stomach/rumen contents; tissue and organ samples collected (flesh, gut contents, etc.).
- Soil: 20 x 20 x 15 cm samples within vegetation plots; litter separated; horizons identified; samples kept cold until processing.
- Habitat and location data collected (latitude/longitude, location description) with records of sampling date.

## Analytical Methods
- Gamma spectrometry using high-purity Ge detectors; calibration with British Calibration Service standards; decay corrections to sampling date.
- Radioisotopes measured include Cs-134, Cs-137; additional radionuclides (e.g., K-40, Ru-103/106) appear in the metadata.
- Results reported as activity concentrations (Bq/kg dry weight for biota and soil; Bq/m2 for deposits) and decay-corrected to sampling date.
- Soil and vegetation processing details (drying, grinding, sieving) and measurement efficiencies noted.

## Data Content and Variables
- Detailed sample metadata: sample ID codes, CEH/ITE project codes, sampling dates, location (latitude/longitude), habitat, sample type (soil, vegetation, tissue, fungi).
- Environmental and soil properties: pH, texture, organic matter, loss on ignition (LOI), bulk density (soil and mineral/organic layers), depth, organic layer data.
- Biological samples: species, age, sex, tissue type (flesh, gut contents, vegetation in various matrices), fresh/dry weights, biomass (kg DM for vegetation).
- Radiocaesium measurements: Cs-134 and Cs-137 concentrations in soil (top and below 4 cm, whole soil, mineral/organic layers), vegetation, and deposits; activity per unit mass and per unit area; sample depth and core metadata.
- Data structure notes: extensive column headers with units, methods, and descriptive notes; multiple cross-referenced CEH/ITE identifiers.

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Format
- QA includes calibration against international standards and cross-checks with standard references.
- Decay corrections applied to dates of sampling; clear reporting of units (Bq/kg DM, Bq/m2, etc.) and data qualifiers (e.g., MDA notations).
- Documentation links sampling methods, soil classifications, and site-level metadata to facilitate reproducibility and data reuse.

## Relevance for Environment Monitoring and Policy
- Establishes spatial and temporal patterns of radiocaesium transfer through soil-plant-animal pathways after a nuclear release.
- Supports assessments of environmental health, grazing safety, and ecological dose estimation.
- Provides standardized, reusable datasets that can be combined with other environmental data for monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Access, Use, and Reuse
- Data sets are hosted in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre under Chaplow et al. (2015).
- Rich metadata and standardized formats enable integration with other monitoring datasets and long-term environmental assessments.
