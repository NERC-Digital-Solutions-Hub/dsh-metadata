# Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - CBED (Concentration Based Estimated Deposition) produces 5x5 km gridded data of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations.
  - Based on measured concentrations of gases/PM in air and ions in precipitation from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
  - Data are intended to support critical load exceedance assessments and environmental monitoring at a national scale.

- How deposition is estimated
  - Wet deposition
    - Derived by combining precipitation ion concentrations with annual precipitation maps (UK Met Office).
    - Includes direct cloud deposition to vegetation (occult deposition) and an orographic enhancement factor for upland regions.
  - Dry deposition
    - Based on gas/PM concentration maps and habitat-specific deposition velocities.
    - Calculated for five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
    - Deposition to each grid square is weighted by the relative proportions of land cover within the 5x5 km cell.
  - Critical loads context
    - Moorland deposition applied to all non-woodland habitats; forest deposition applied to all woodland habitats.

- Data sources and modelling components
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 concentrations from the PCM model (interpolated measurements plus point/line source modelling).
  - Ammonia concentrations from a combination of the FRAME model and UKEAP measurements; FRAME provides local-scale variability.
  - FRAME emissions used for the year 2017.
  - Wet deposition includes sulphate, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and acidity (hydrogen ion).

- Temporal and spatial characteristics
  - Inter-annual variability influenced by weather and atmospheric dynamics.
  - Deposition values are averaged over a three-year period to smooth variability.
  - Data are calculated annually but provided as rolling 3-year means.
  - Ecosystem-specific outputs: moorland, forest/woodland, and grid average.

- Output data and structure
  - Three ecosystem-specific deposition datasets for 2017–2019:
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
  - Each dataset includes:
    - Easting and northing (centre of 5x5 km grid square, in metres).
    - Deposition components in keq ha^-1 year^-1:
      - Moorland: nox_m (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_m (reduced nitrogen), nms_m (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations).
      - Forest: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f.
      - Grid average: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
  - Datasets are described as 3-year means (rolling) and assume one of three ecosystem contexts per grid square (moorland, forest/woodland, or grid average).

- Units and data interpretation
  - All deposition values are expressed as keq ha^-1 year^-1.
  - Conversion to other units:
    - To kg S ha^-1 year^-1: multiply sulphur-related values by 16 (keq to kg S).
    - To kg N ha^-1 year^-1: multiply nitrogen-related values by 14.
    - To kg Ca ha^-1 year^-1: multiply non-marine Ca+Mg values by 20.

- Quality control and governance
  - Methods align with government QA practices for analytical models.
  - CBED data and calculations have undergone extensive peer review and were part of the Defra model inter-comparison (Carslaw 2011).
  - Version control, central storage of code, and documented method developments guided by senior responsible officers.
  - Mass balance checks confirm numerical consistency and consistency with previous years.
  - Results are published in peer-reviewed literature and supported by the Defra information framework.

- Data accessibility and metadata
  - Supporting information and model descriptions referenced through specific URLs.
  - Data structure details specify column naming conventions, units, and descriptions to support reproducibility and reuse.
