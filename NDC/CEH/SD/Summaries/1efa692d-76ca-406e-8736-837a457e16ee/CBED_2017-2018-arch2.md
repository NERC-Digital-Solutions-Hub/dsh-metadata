# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose: Generate 5x5 km resolution gridded data of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations, based on measured air concentrations and precipitation ion concentrations to support environmental health monitoring and policy assessment in the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants network (UKEAP).

## What CBED measures and how it works

- Data sources: Site measurements from the UKEAP network interpolated to UK maps; gas and PM concentration maps combined with habitat-specific deposition velocities.
- Wet deposition: Derived from precipitation concentrations combined with UK Met Office annual precipitation maps; includes direct cloud droplet (occult) deposition and an orographic enhancement factor for upland regions.
- Dry deposition: Calculated from gas/PM concentrations and deposition velocities across five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban); deposition to 5 land cover types is weighted by their proportions within each 5x5 km grid square.
- Deposition components: Dry deposition covers sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitric acid (HNO3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ammonia (NH3), and particulate matter (sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, calcium, magnesium) to vegetation.
- Critical loads: For calculations, Moorland deposition applies to all non-woodland habitats; Forest deposition applies to all woodland habitats.

## Temporal and ecosystem representations

- Timeframe: Annual deposition values, provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability.
- Ecosystem-specific outputs: Two sets per grid square (and grid-average): moorland everywhere; forest everywhere; plus grid-average values.

## Data inputs and sources

- Nitrogen and sulfur species: 
  - Nitric acid concentrations interpolated from ~30 sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 from the PCM model (interpolated rural measurements plus point/line sources).
  - Ammonia from FRAME atmospheric transport model plus annual UKEAP measurements; FRAME used for local variability; 2017 FRAME emissions.
- Wet deposition: includes occult deposition and upscaling for orography.

## Data structure and files (2017–2019)

- Output files:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
- Common columns in each file:
  - easting (metres) and northing (metres): centre coordinates of each 5x5 km grid square (OS Great Britain grid).
  - deposition values for each category and species:
    - Moorland file: nox_m (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_m (reduced nitrogen), nms_m (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations).
    - Forest file: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f.
    - Grid-average file: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
- Units: keq ha-1 year-1 (three-year means).

## Units and conversions

- All deposition values are in keq ha-1 year-1.
- Conversions to tangible mass units:
  - To kg S ha-1 year-1: multiply sulphur-related values by 16.
  - To kg N ha-1 year-1: multiply nitrogen-related values by 14.
  - To kg Ca ha-1 year-1: multiply non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) values by 20.

## Quality control and governance

- Methods and CBED data follow QA procedures aligned with Government analytical model QA (mass balance checks, numerical consistency with previous years).
- Extensive peer review and involvement in Defra model inter-comparison exercises; documented with version control and central storage of code.
- CBED results and method developments are published in peer-reviewed literature and supported by formal documentation.

## Data provenance and references

- Data inputs and methodological references include PCM model (NO2, SO2), FRAME model (NH3), and observational studies (e.g., Holme Moss, Great Dun Fell) to account for vertical variation and orographic effects.
- Supporting information and model descriptions are available via project and Defra sources (URLs provided in the resource section).
