# Methods The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- The CBED method generates 5x5 km resolution gridded data of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations.
- Data are derived from measured concentrations of gases and particulate matter in air, and measured ion concentrations in precipitation, collected at UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) sites.
- Outputs are used to assess deposition to ecosystem types and support critical load exceedance calculations.

## How CBED data are generated

- Site measurements are interpolated to create UK-wide concentration maps.
- Ion concentrations in precipitation are combined with an annual UK precipitation map to produce wet deposition values.
- Gas and particulate concentration maps are paired with habitat-specific deposition velocities to estimate dry deposition for five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
- Deposition to grid squares is computed by weighting the 5 land-cover category deposits by their proportional area within each 5x5 km grid.
- Critical loads: deposition for moorland is applied to non-woodland habitats, while forest deposition is applied to woodland habitats.
- Nitric acid concentrations are interpolated from ~30 sites; NO2 and SO2 concentrations come from the PCM model; ammonia comes from FRAME plus UKEAP data (2017 emissions used in FRAME).
- Wet deposition includes direct deposition of cloud droplets (occult deposition) and an orographic enhancement factor for upland precipitation.
- Inter-annual variability is acknowledged; deposition values used for critical loads are averaged over a three-year period.

## Temporal aspects and ecosystem-specific results

- Deposition data are calculated annually but presented as rolling 3-year means to smooth natural weather-related variability.
- Ecosystem-specific outputs provided in two sets:
  - Moorland/short vegetation everywhere
  - Forest everywhere
- Grid-average deposition is also provided as a 3-year rolling mean.

## Units, conversions, and interpretation

- All deposition values are expressed as keq ha-1 year-1.
- Conversion to common mass units:
  - Sulphur deposition: multiply by 16 to get kg S ha-1 year-1
  - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: multiply by 14 to get kg N ha-1 year-1
  - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) deposition: multiply by 20 to get kg Ca ha-1 year-1
- Values are suitable for comparing across ecosystems and for use in critical load exceedance assessments.

## Quality control and provenance

- CBED methods have undergone extensive peer review and were part of the Defra model inter-comparison exercise.
- Documentation practices include version control and central storage of code; results widely published in peer-reviewed literature.
- Method developments are overseen by senior responsible officers.
- Mass balance checks are routinely performed to ensure numerical consistency and comparability with previous years.

## Data structure and file formats

- Three 3-year mean datasets (2017–2019) with ecosystem-specific depictions:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
- Common schema elements:
  - easting and northing: centre coordinates of each 5x5 km grid square (metres)
  - deposition columns per dataset (e.g., nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m for moorland; nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f for forest; nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga for grid average)
- Units for all deposition columns: keq ha-1 year-1
