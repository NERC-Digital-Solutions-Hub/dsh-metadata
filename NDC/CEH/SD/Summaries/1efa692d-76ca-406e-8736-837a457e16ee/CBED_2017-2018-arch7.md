# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose: Generates 5x5 km resolution gridded data of wet and dry deposition for sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations from air concentrations and precipitation measurements in the UK, enabling map-based analysis of deposition and its ecological impacts.
- Output scope: 
  - Wet deposition for sulphate, ammonium, nitrate, calcium, magnesium, and acidity.
  - Dry deposition to vegetation for five land cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
  - Grid-square averaged deposition values, calculated by weighting land-cover-specific depositions by the proportions of land cover within each 5x5 km grid cell.
- Time handling: Values are calculated annually but provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability; ecosystem-specific (moorland or forest) and grid-average datasets are generated, along with grid-average means.
- Data sources and inputs:
  - Site measurements from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
  - Gas and PM concentration maps:
    - NOx/NO2 and NO3: interpolated from measurements and PCM model (NO2/NO3).
    - NH3: FRAME atmospheric chemical transport model plus UKEAP measurements.
  - Wet deposition: derived from precipitation maps and ion concentrations, including occult deposition (direct deposition from cloud droplets) and an orographic enhancement factor for upland precipitation.
- Deposition calculation process:
  - Interpolate site measurements to create UK concentration maps.
  - Wet deposition: combine ion concentrations with annual precipitation.
  - Dry deposition: combine gas/PM concentration maps with habitat-specific deposition velocities for five land cover types to produce deposition per category.
  - Apply habitat-specific deposition to grid cells by weighting with land-cover proportions to obtain grid-square deposition values.
  - Critical load exceedance calculations use moorland deposition for non-woodland habitats and forest deposition for woodland habitats.
- Temporal context and references:
  - Emissions year 2017 used in FRAME model.
  - Inter-annual variability acknowledged; three-year means used for stability.
  - Supporting information and methodological background drawn from a range of peer-reviewed sources (citations included in the dataset).
- Data structure and formats:
  - Three CSV files for 2017–2019 (3-year means):
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
  - Common fields:
    - easting, northing: centre coordinates of the 5x5 km grid square (metres).
    - Deposition fields for each category (keq ha-1 year-1):
      - Moorland: nox_m (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_m (reduced nitrogen), nms_m (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations).
      - Forest: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f.
      - Grid average: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga.
- Units and conversions:
  - All deposition values are in keq ha-1 year-1.
  - Conversions to kg per ha per year:
    - Sulphur: keq × 16 = kg S ha-1 year-1
    - Nitrogen (oxidised/reduced): keq × 14 = kg N ha-1 year-1
    - Base cations (Ca+Mg): keq × 20 = kg Ca ha-1 year-1
- Quality control and governance:
  - CBED methods subjected to extensive peer review and model inter-comparison (e.g., Defra projects).
  - Version control, centralized code storage, and documentation procedures.
  - Mass balance checks and comparison to previous years ensure numerical consistency.

- GIS considerations for map-based use:
  - Data are tailored for GIS workflows as 5x5 km gridded surfaces with ecosystem-specific and grid-average layers.
  - Useful for overlay with habitat and land-use maps; accounts for land-cover weighting within grid cells.
  - Users should consider the rolling 3-year means for temporal analyses and the habitat-assignment rules (moorland vs forest) when interpreting results.
