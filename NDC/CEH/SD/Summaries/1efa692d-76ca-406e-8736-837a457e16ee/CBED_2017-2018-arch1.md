# Methods

- Purpose
  - Describes the Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology to generate 5x5 km gridded deposition data for sulphur, oxidised nitrogen, reduced nitrogen, and base cations (wet and dry deposition) from air concentrations and precipitation ion measurements.
  - Supports assessment of critical loads and ecosystem impacts.

- Data sources and inputs
  - Site measurements come from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network and are interpolated to UK-wide concentration maps.
  - Gas and particulate matter concentrations are combined with habitat-specific deposition velocities to produce dry-deposition maps for five land-cover categories: forest, moorland, grassland, arable, and urban.
  - Wet deposition is derived from precipitation concentrations plus direct cloud (occult) deposition to vegetation, using an annual precipitation map from the UK Met Office and an orographic enhancement factor (upland regions) based on observations at Great Dun Fell and Holme Moss.
  - Nitric acid (NOx) concentrations are interpolated from ~30 measurement sites.
  - NO2 and SO2 concentrations come from the Pollution Concentration Mapping (PCM) model.
  - Ammonia concentrations combine FRAME model output (for local variability) with annual UKEAP measurements; FRAME emissions for 2017 are used.

- Deposition components and land cover
  - Dry deposition includes gases (SO2, HNO3, NO2, NH3) and particulate matter (sulphate, nitrate, ammonium, Ca, Mg) onto vegetation.
  - For critical loads, moorland deposition is applied to all non-woodland habitats, forest deposition to woodland habitats.

- Temporal and spatial resolution
  - Outputs are produced on an annual basis but provided as rolling 3-year means to smooth inter-annual variability.
  - Data are ecosystem-specific (moorland vs forest/woodland) plus a grid-average result for each 5x5 km square.

- Units and conversions
  - All deposition values are expressed as keq ha^-1 year^-1.
  - Conversion to kilograms per hectare per year:
    - Sulphur deposition: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 16 = kg S ha^-1 yr^-1
    - Oxidised/reduced nitrogen deposition: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 14 = kg N ha^-1 yr^-1
    - Non-marine base cations (Ca+Mg) deposition: keq ha^-1 yr^-1 × 20 = kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1

- Data structure and outputs
  - Three 3-year mean datasets (2017-2019) with ecosystem-specific and grid-average deposition:
    - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv (nox_m, nhx_m, nms_m, nm_ca_mg_m; easting, northing in metres)
    - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv (nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f)
    - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv (nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga)
  - Each file includes easting and northing (centre of 5x5 km grid square) and deposition values in keq ha^-1 year^-1 for the relevant category.

- Quality control and validation
  - CBED data and methods align with government QA standards and have undergone extensive peer review, including participation in Defra model inter-comparison (Carslaw, 2011).
  - Documentation, version control, and central storage of code; mass-balance checks against previous years; method developments approved by senior officers.
  - Results have been widely published in peer-reviewed literature.

- Supporting information and references
  - Supporting information and data sources are provided via:

  - Includes methodological references and related datasets (e.g., PCM model, FRAME model, Holme Moss and Great Dun Fell studies).

- Practical implications for analysis
  - Enables spatially explicit estimation of pollutant deposition at 5x5 km resolution across the UK, with distinctions for moorland vs forest and a grid-average baseline.
  - Facilitates assessment of critical load exceedances using rolling 3-year means and ecosystem-specific deposition inputs.
  - Data are provided in standardized units with clear conversion factors, supporting integration with other environmental datasets and transparent reproducibility.
