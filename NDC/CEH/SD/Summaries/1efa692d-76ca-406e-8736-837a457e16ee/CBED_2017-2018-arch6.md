# Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

- Purpose and scope
  - Generates 5x5 km resolution gridded data for wet and dry deposition of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations.
  - Based on measured concentrations of gases, PM in air, and ions in precipitation from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
  - Outputs used to assess critical loads and enable policy and scientific analyses.

- Data sources and inputs
  - Gas and PM concentration maps derived from measurements (NO2, NO3, SO2) and models (PCM, FRAME).
  - Ammonia concentrations from FRAME model and UKEAP measurements; FRAME uses 2017 emissions.
  - Wet deposition incorporates precipitation data and occult (cloud droplet) deposition.
  - Orographic enhancement applied for upland precipitation (seeder-feeder effect).

- Deposition calculation approach
  - Wet deposition: combine precipitation map with measured/interpolated precipitation data to yield wet deposition values.
  - Dry deposition: combine gas/PM concentration maps with habitat-specific deposition velocities across five land cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban); depositions are weighted by the grid cell’s land cover proportions.
  - For critical loads, apply moorland deposition values to non-woodland habitats and forest deposition values to woodland habitats.
  - Inter-annual variability due to weather and emissions is acknowledged; deposition values for assessment are averaged over a 3-year period.

- Temporal framing and data products
  - Calculated annually but provided as rolling 3-year means.
  - Ecosystem-specific outputs (two scenarios: moorland everywhere or forest everywhere) and grid-average values are provided.

- Output data structure and file formats
  - Three 3-year mean datasets:
    - Moorland: CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
    - Forest: CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
    - Grid average: CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
  - Each file structure (examples):
    - Columns include easting and northing (centre of 5x5 km grid, OS GB grid) and deposition values for:
      - Moorland: nox_m (oxidised nitrogen), nhx_m (reduced nitrogen), nms_m (non-marine sulphur), nm_ca_mg_m (non-marine base cations)
      - Forest: nox_f, nhx_f, nms_f, nm_ca_mg_f
      - Grid average: nox_ga, nhx_ga, nms_ga, nm_ca_mg_ga
  - Units: keq ha-1 year-1 for all deposition values; conversion to kg ha-1 year-1 provided:
    - Sulphur (S) multiply by 16
    - Nitrogen (N) multiply by 14
    - Base cations (Ca+Mg) multiply by 20

- Quality control and governance
  - CBED methods peer-reviewed and included in Defra model inter-comparison exercises.
  - Documented method developments, version control, and central storage of code.
  - Mass balance checks and comparisons with previous years; outputs published in peer-reviewed literature.
  - Management by senior responsible officers.

- Data structure details and metadata
  - Data are 3-year means at 5x5 km grid cells, with ecosystem-specific (moorland or forest) and grid-average alternatives.
  - Each dataset includes coordinate fields (easting, northing in metres) and deposition fields as described above.
  - References and supporting materials documented (e.g., Beswick et al., Dore et al., Stedman et al., etc.).

- Practical considerations for data users (Data Support perspective)
  - Aligns with data integration goals by providing standardized, gridded deposition products usable in dashboards, reports, and policy analyses.
  - Facilitates self-serve exploration of deposition patterns by land cover type and grid cell.
  - Clear unit conventions and conversion factors support cross-dataset comparability and downstream modeling (e.g., critical load assessments).
