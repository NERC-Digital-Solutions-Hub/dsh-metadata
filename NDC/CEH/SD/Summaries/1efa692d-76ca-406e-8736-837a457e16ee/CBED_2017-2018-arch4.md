# The Concentration Based Estimated Deposition (CBED) methodology

## Overview
- Produces 5x5 km resolution gridded data for wet and dry deposition of sulphur, oxidised and reduced nitrogen, and base cations.
- Data are derived from measured gas/particulate concentrations and precipitation ion concentrations from the UK Eutrophying and Acidifying Pollutants (UKEAP) network.
- Wet deposition is calculated by combining precipitation maps with ion concentrations, including direct deposition of cloud droplets (occult deposition) and an orographic enhancement factor.
- Dry deposition is estimated by combining gas/PM concentration maps with habitat-specific deposition velocities across five land-cover categories (forest, moorland, grassland, arable, urban).
- For critical loads, deposition to moorland is applied to non-woodland habitats and deposition to forest is applied to woodland habitats.

## Data generation and processes
- Site-based measurements are interpolated to generate UK concentration maps.
- Gas and PM concentration maps are linked to deposition velocities to yield deposition for each land-cover category.
- Nitric acid concentrations are interpolated from ~30 sites; NO2 and SO2 concentrations come from the PCM model; ammonia from FRAME model plus network measurements.
- Wet deposition includes occult deposition and an orographic enhancement factor from altitude-related precipitation studies.
- Inter-annual variation is smoothed by averaging over a three-year period; deposition data are calculated annually but provided as rolling 3-year means.
- Ecosystem-specific outputs include two sets of values (moorland/short vegetation everywhere; forest woodland everywhere) plus grid-average values.

## Output data structure and files
- Data provided as 3-year mean, ecosystem-specific deposition data for each 5x5 km grid square:
  - CBED-deposition-moorland-2017-2019.csv
    - Columns include easting, northing, and deposition values for oxidised nitrogen (nox_m), reduced nitrogen (nhx_m), non-marine sulphur (nms_m), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_m) to moorland.
  - CBED-deposition-forest-2017-2019.csv
    - Columns include easting, northing, and deposition values for oxidised nitrogen (nox_f), reduced nitrogen (nhx_f), non-marine sulphur (nms_f), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_f) to forest.
  - CBED-deposition-gridaverage-2017-2019.csv
    - Columns include easting, northing, and grid-average deposition values for oxidised nitrogen (nox_ga), reduced nitrogen (nhx_ga), non-marine sulphur (nms_ga), non-marine base cations (nm_ca_mg_ga) to grid average.
- Units and conversions:
  - All deposition values are in keq ha-1 year-1.
  - Conversions provided to kg ha-1 year-1 (e.g., 1 keq ha-1 year-1 equals 16 kg S ha-1 year-1 for sulphur; 14 for nitrogen; 20 for calcium equivalents).

## Data quality and provenance
- Methods align with quality assurance practices for government analytical models; extensive peer review and participation in Defra model inter-comparison.
- Version control, documentation, central storage of code, and mass-balance checks ensure numerical consistency.
- Data and method developments are reviewed and approved by senior responsible officers; results have been published in peer-reviewed literature.

## Data sources and modeling components
- Measurements and data sources:
  - NO2/NO3 concentrations from interpolation of rural measurements and model inputs.
  - SO2 concentrations from the PCM model (rural measurements plus point/line sources).
  - NH3 concentrations from FRAME model and network measurements (emissions year 2017 used in FRAME).
  - Wet deposition includes occult deposition and an altitude-dependent enhancement factor validated by field observations.
- Supporting references and prior work are cited to underpin methods and trends (e.g., Holme Moss, Great Dun Fell observations; various atmospheric transport/modeling studies).

## Access and metadata
- Resource locators:
  - http://www.pollutantdeposition.ceh.ac.uk/ukeap
  - https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/networks/network-info?view=ukeap
- Data are provided with clear unit definitions, ecosystem-specific vs grid-average options, and instructions for converting keq to kg per hectare.

## Implications for data strategy and use
- Provides a comprehensive, system-wide deposition dataset suitable for policy analysis, environmental assessment, and cross-domain collaboration.
- Supports flexible usage across different ecosystems (moorland vs forest) and across networked data communities.
- Rolling 3-year means help mitigate inter-annual variability, improving stability for trend analysis and critical-load exceedance assessments.
- Clear provenance, quality controls, and documentation facilitate reproducibility, governance, and integration with other data products.
