# WP1 - Physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash derived from UK bioenergy production (anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation)

## Aim
- Provide physico-chemical characterization data of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash to support formulation of waste blends (WP1) and environmental monitoring over time.
- Support environmental health and policy performance assessment through standardized data outputs.

## Context andScope
- AVAnD project started January 2015 with a planned duration of 3 years.
- Materials studied: anaerobic digestates from UK industrial-scale plants and biomass ashes from thermal transformation of biomass (Spain and UK sources).
- WP1 data focus: characterization and formulation of waste blends; data from all batches included to reflect overall waste streams, though WP1 analyses pertain to batch 1–2.

## Digestate samples (anaerobic digestate)
- Batches and timing:
  - 1st batch: January 2015
  - 2nd batch: April 2015
  - 3rd batch: October 2015
  - 4th batch: March 2016
  - 5th batch: June 2016
  - 6th batch: September 2016
  - 7th batch: November 2017
  - 8th batch: January 2018
- Source details (Table 1 codes):
  - DB1: Source-segregated food waste (household)
  - DB2: Source-segregated food waste
  - DB3: Source-segregated food waste + pig
  - DB4/D1: Slurry, food waste (≈25%) from various sources
  - Dba/D2: Maize silage, vegetables waste, sweet-corn waste, aerobically treated food waste, other biodegradable sludge
  - DTa: Slurry (≈25%) of food waste from kerbside collections, retailers, manufacturers
- Batch 1–2: all digestate sources sampled; from Batch 3 onward, only selected digestates (codes 4 & 5) used beyond WP1.
- Sample size and handling:
  - 5–10 kg per digestate sample
  - Collected at process end, cooled, transported in ice
  - Upon receipt: stored in cold room <4°C; subsamples may be sent to external labs for complementary analyses (mainly nitrogen forms)
  - Processing: no pre-processing for fresh samples; dried samples milled to pass 1 mm, stored in zip bags at room temperature

## Biomass ashes
- Sources: one location in Spain and three in the UK; two UK sources produced both fly (light) and bottom (heavy) ashes; six ash types in total.
- Ash types and codes (Table 2):
  - Fly: Code 7 (ABaF / A1) – Virgin wood bark and chipped timber (85%)
  - Bottom: Code 7 (ABaB / A2) – Sitka spruce and 15% Larch
  - Bulk: Code 8 (ASe) – 70% virgin wood, 30% recycled wood
  - Fly: Code 9 (ALuF) – Variable feedstock
  - Bulk: Code 9 (ALuB)
  - Bulk: Code 10 (Aspa) – Pine residues
- Sample sizes and handling:
  - 10–20 kg per ash sample, received from producer
  - Composite subsample taken, air-dried, milled to pass 1 mm, stored at room temperature
  - For fully dried analyses: drying at 105°C until constant weight

## Processing, storage, and labelling
- Digestate: fresh samples analyzed with minimal preprocessing; dried sub-samples prepared by drying at 60/105°C, milled to pass 1 mm, stored dry
- Ashes: dried processing applied when needed; standard preparation to uniform particle size
- External laboratory analyses common for nitrogen and phosphorus-related forms; in-house analyses use standardized equipment and methods

## Analytical methods and equipment
- Standard methods (TABLE 3) with described modifications; external laboratories used for specific analyses
- External laboratory methods:
  - Nitrogen species (NO3-, NH4+, NO2-) – JAS082; JAS300
  - Total Carbon & Total Nitrogen (TC & TN) – JAS373; JAS475
  - Aqua Regia soluble elements – JAS510; JAS300; JAS379
- In-house measurements and equipment:
  - pH: pH-meter, Mettler Toledo Seven Compact with Inlab Versatile Pro electrode
  - EC (electrical conductivity): conductivity meter, Jenway 4510
  - Nitrate, ammonium, and phosphate: flow analyzer, AA3AutoAnalyser
  - Water soluble (WS) and Aqua Regia soluble (AR) elemental composition: ICP-OES, iCAP 6300
  - Dry matter (DM), loss on ignition (LOI): BS EN 14346; BS EN 15169
  - TC and TN: Elemental analyser (Elementar Vario EL III)
- Unit conventions and data coding:
  - Dry basis unless stated otherwise
  - BDL indicates reading below detection
  - Replicates are analytical (from bulk composite samples)
  - Blank cells indicate non-measured replicates or differing replicate counts

## Data structure and key variables
- Variables include: pH, EC, NO3-, NH4+, NO3-N, NH4-N, WSCa, WSMg, WSK, WSNa, WSCu, WSFe, WSMn, WSNi, WSPb, WSZn
- Aqua Regia extractable elements: Ca, Mg, K, Na, P, S, Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn
- Analytical methods typically aligned with BS EN and ISO standards (as listed in references)

## Data use and scope
- WP1 dataset aims to include data from all digestate and ash batches to reflect the full range of waste streams
- However, WP1-specific analyses primarily used batch 1–2 data; data from later batches fed into other work packages
- Digestate batch 2 data for Available N & P were obtained from external laboratories and left blank in the main dataset file

## Quality, notes, and references
- Data quality notes:
  - In-house analyses are distinguished from external laboratory results
  - Results reported on a dry basis; WS and AR extraction methods follow established standards
  - Some data (e.g., Available N & P for batch 2) come from external labs
- References and standards used:
  - ISO/DIS 14820-2; BS EN 15002:2006; BS EN 16168:2012; BS EN 13137:2001; BS EN 13038:2011; BS EN 13037:2011; BS EN 14346:2006
  - BS EN 15169:2007; ISO/DIS 13395; BS ISO 15958; DIN EN ISO 15681-2; BS EN 13652:2001; BS EN 13657:2002

## Notable implications for environmental monitoring
- Enables tracking of physico-chemical properties of bioenergy waste streams over time
- Supports standardised data formatting for cross-project scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance
- Highlights the value of integrating multiple batches and sources to avoid single-use data limitations and to improve data accessibility for stakeholders
