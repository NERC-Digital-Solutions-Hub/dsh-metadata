# WP1 - Physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash derived from UK bioenergy production (anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation)

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset supports WP1: physico-chemical characterization and formulation of waste blends from anaerobic digestate and biomass ash.
  - Includes data from multiple batches and sources, with WP1 data focusing on early batches but dataset encompassing all batches for completeness.

- Project context and timeline
  - AVAnD project started January 2015; duration ~3 years.
  - Digestates and ashes collected across UK/Spain; samples processed for research across batches.

- Digestates: sampling and batch timeline
  - Batches and dates: 1 (Jan 2015), 2 (Apr 2015), 3 (Oct 2015), 4 (Mar 2016), 5 (Jun 2016), 6 (Sep 2016), 7 (Nov 2017), 8 (Jan 2018).
  - Batch-specific sourcing:
    - Batches 1–2: all sources included.
    - Batches 3–8: primarily selected digestates (codes 4 & 5) used for WP1 and beyond.
  - Source codes and feedstock descriptions (e.g., DB1–DB4, Dba, DTa) indicate mixtures such as source-segregated food waste, maize silage, vegetables, kerbside food waste, etc.
  - Sample size and handling: 5–10 kg per digestate; stored cold, transported in ice; received by Lancaster University, stored <4°C until analysis; subsamples sometimes sent to external labs for complementary analyses.

- Biomass ashes: sampling and batch timeline
  - Ash types: six total (fly and bottom fractions, bulk types) from Spain and the UK (two UK sites with fly and bottom ashes).
  - Batches: 1 (Jan 2015), 2 (Jun 2016) for selected ash sources for WP1 and beyond.
  - Sample handling: 10–20 kg per ash sample; composite subsample air-dried, ground to pass 1 mm, stored at room temperature; dried analyses at 105°C as needed.

- Analytical methods and data sources
  - In-house analyses and external accredited laboratories (NRM) used for complementary analyses (primarily N and P forms).
  - Parameters and measurement approach (examples):
    - pH (BS EN 13037), EC (BS EN 13038), NO3-, NH4+, NO3-N, NH4-N (flow analysis/ISO methods), TC & TN (BS EN 13137; elemental analysis), C/N (TC/TN).
    - Water soluble and aqua regia soluble elemental compositions (WS and AR fractions) via ICP-OES and related digestion.
    - Additional indicators: Dry matter (BS EN 14346), Loss on Ignition (BS EN 15169), etc.
  - Equipment linked to parameters (illustrative): pH meter (Mettler Toledo Seven Compact), Conductivity meter (Jenway 4510), Automated flow analyser (NO3-/NH4+/PO4), ICP-OES (iCAP 6300), Microwave digestion (MARSXpress), Elemental analyser (Vario EL III).
  - Documentation and standards references:
    - Core process and sampling: ISO/DIS 14820-2, BS EN 15002:2006.
    - Waste/sludge characterization and nutrient determinations: BS EN 16168, BS EN 13137, BS EN 13038, BS EN 13037, BS EN 14346, BS EN 15169, ISO/DIS 13395, BS ISO 15958, DIN EN ISO 15681-2, BS EN 13652, BS EN 13657.
  - Data specificity and labeling:
    - Subsamples and replicates: all replicates are analytical; results typically on a dry basis; data mostly in-house measurements, not including externally sourced data unless noted.
    - BDL indicates readings below detection; blank cells indicate missing measurements or varying replicate counts.
    - Digestate batch 2 data for Available N & P are external-lab results and left blank in the main dataset.

- Data provenance, metadata, and documentation
  - Data originate from multiple sources (in-house analyses and external laboratories) with detailed batch-level context, sample handling, and feedstock information.
  - The dataset documents:
    - Batch descriptions, sampling dates, and source feedstocks (Tables 1–2 references in metadata).
    - Analytical methods and instruments used (Table 3 references for each parameter).
    - Data interpretation notes (e.g., dry basis, analytical replicates, and data availability for batch 2external results).
  - For data management, processing steps include minimal pre-processing for fresh samples and drying/ grinding for dried samples; external analyses handled separately.

- Data availability, sharing, and governance considerations
  - WP1 data explicitly covers batches 1 and 2; data from later batches are included to support WP1’s broader characterization of waste streams, and are used in other WPs.
  - Documentation provides clear methodological provenance, enabling reuse by researchers, data stewards, and other stakeholders.
  - Standards-based metadata supports potential interoperability, while noting that some data (e.g., external batch 2 Available N & P) reside in separate external-lab results.

- Key considerations for Data Stewards
  - Ensure harmonization of units and basis (dry basis) across in-house and external data sources.
  - Maintain linkage between batch metadata, feedstock codes, sampling dates, and analytical methods for traceability.
  - Manage versioning and updates as additional batches or re-analyses become available; ensure metadata remains aligned with Table 3 parameter definitions and standard methods.
  - Address potential interoperability challenges arising from multiple laboratories, formats, and legacy data.
  - Preserve documentation of limitations (e.g., incomplete WP1 coverage for some batches, external data gaps) to inform users of data scope and reliability.
