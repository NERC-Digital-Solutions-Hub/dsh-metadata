# WP1 - Physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash derived from UK bioenergy production (anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation)

- Purpose and scope
  - Dataset documenting physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate (digestate) and biomass ash from UK bioenergy production.
  - Part of the AVAnD project (Jan 2015–2018+) focusing on waste streams from anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation, to support formulation of waste blends and monitoring decisions.

- Sampling and sample processing
  - Sampling followed ISO/DIS 14820-2 and BS EN 15002:2006 guidance.
  - Minimum subsample: ≥0.5 kg per sample type.
  - Digestates: collected from multiple industrial-scale AD plants across the UK at various project times; eight batches (Jan 2015, Apr 2015, Oct 2015, Mar 2016, Jun 2016, Sep 2016, Nov 2017, Jan 2018).
  - Biomass ashes: sourced from Spain and three UK locations; two UK sites produced split fly/bottom ash; six ash types in total.
  - Sample handling: 5–10 kg per digestate sample; cooled and stored in cold room; subsamples sent to accredited external labs for complementary analyses when applicable; for fresh samples, no pre-processing beyond basic handling; dried samples milled and sieved to pass 1 mm.

- Digestates: sources and batches
  - Early batches (1–2): all digestate sources sampled.
  - Later batches (3–8): selected digestates (codes 4–5; and others) used for experiments beyond WP1.
  - Feedstock compositions included source-segregated food waste and mixtures with slurry, maize silage, vegetables waste, and other biodegradable materials (as detailed in TABLE 1).

- Biomass ashes: sources and batches
  - Fly and bottom ashes with varying feedstock compositions (e.g., virgin wood, sitka spruce, recycled wood, pine residues).
  - Batch 1 (Jan 2015) and Batch 2 (June 2016, limited to selected ash source codes for WP beyond WP1).

- Analytical methods and data variables
  - Analyses conducted using standard methods; modifications and external lab procedures noted (NRM laboratories for N forms, TC/TN, and phosphorus forms).
  - In-house measurements (with specified equipment):
    - pH (pH meter), EC (conductivity meter), nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+), nitrite (NO2−), total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C/N ratio, dry matter (DM), loss on ignition (LOI).
    - Elemental composition: water-soluble (WS) and aqua regia soluble (AR) determinations for a wide suite of elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, etc.), with specific unit notes (e.g., mg/kg, µg/kg).
  - Data presentation and units:
    - Results generally on a dry basis (unless otherwise specified).
    - Tables describe origins, units, analytical methods, and batch/subtype information (e.g., biomass ash subtype: fly or bottom).
  - External laboratory contributions:
    - Some analyses (notably N forms, total C/N forms, and certain P/N related analyses) performed by accredited external labs (NRM labs) using specified methods (e.g., JAS082, JAS300; ISO/DIS 13395; BS EN 15958).
  - Data structure notes:
    - Data in the dataset reflect in-house measurements; external data (Batch 2 available N & P) are noted as separate and left blank in the main dataset.
    - Replicates are analytical (from bulk composites), with blanks indicating missing measurements or differing replicate counts across variables.
    - All results expressed on a dry basis unless stated otherwise.

- Data provenance, governance, and limitations
  - Dataset aims to include all WP1-related characterization data for waste streams, with full traceability to batches, sources, and analytical methods (as per TABLE 3 and TABLES 1–2 references).
  - Metadata includes processing steps, batch descriptions, and connections to standard references (ISO/BS standards).
  - Data accessibility considerations acknowledged: some data derived from external labs; batch-2 available-N and available-P results provided by external labs and not fully integrated into the in-house dataset.
  - Quality assurance: analyses linked to standard and accredited methods; materials handled and stored appropriately; explicit notes on the use of external laboratories for complementary analyses.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a comprehensive set of physico-chemical indicators to monitor bioenergy waste streams, including nutrient forms (N, P), carbon/nitrogen balance (TC/TN, C/N), inorganic constituents (NO3−, NH4+, NO3−N, NH4−N), physical properties (pH, EC, DM, LOI), and a wide suite of elemental constituents (both water-soluble and aqua regia soluble).
  - Supports evaluation of waste blend formulations, data quality assurance, and governance by documenting sampling regimes, batch variability, and methodological transparency.
  - Highlights data gaps and practical challenges common in monitoring frameworks, such as batch heterogeneity, data completeness across batches, reliance on external labs for specific analyses, and metadata sufficiency for cross-study comparability.
