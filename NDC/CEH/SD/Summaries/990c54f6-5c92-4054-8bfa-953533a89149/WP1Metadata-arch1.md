# WP1 - Physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash derived from UK bioenergy production (anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation)

- Overview
  - AVAnD project ran from January 2015 for 3 years to study bioenergy waste streams through physico-chemical characterization.
  - Focus on collecting and analyzing anaerobic digestates and biomass ashes from UK sources to inform waste-to-energy processes.

- Sampling and samples
  - Digestates: collected from multiple industrial-scale UK plants across eight batches (1: Jan 2015; 2: Apr 2015; 3: Oct 2015; 4: Mar 2016; 5: Jun 2016; 6: Sep 2016; 7: Nov 2017; 8: Jan 2018).
    - From batches 3–8, only selected digestates (codes 4 & 5) were used for experiments beyond WP1.
  - Digestate sources (Table 1): coded sources include source-segregated food waste (various compositions), maize silage, vegetables waste, aerobically treated food waste, and other biodegradable sludges; batch 1 & 2 used as broader sources, later batches limited for specific purposes.
  - Sample size and handling: each digestate sample comprised 5–10 kg, collected at the end of the digestion process, shipped on ice, stored at <4°C; a subsample was sometimes sent to external labs for additional analyses.
  - Processing: for fresh digestates, no preprocessing; for dried samples, drying at 60/105°C to constant weight, then milling to pass 1 mm and storage.

- Biomass ashes
  - Source: waste from thermal transformation of biomass; two fractions possible (fly ash and bottom ash); six ash types across Spain and the UK.
  - Batch timing: January 2015 and June 2016 (batch 2) for selected sources intended for WP beyond WP1.
  - Sample size and handling: each ash sample typically 10–20 kg, composite sub-sample taken, air-dried, milled, sieved to pass 1 mm, stored at room temperature; fresh vs dried methodology followed (105°C for drying when required).

- Data scope and usage
  - WP1 data focus: characterization and formulation of waste blends; data from batches 1 and 2 specifically used for WP1; subsequent batches used for other work packages but included in the WP1 dataset to ensure comprehensiveness.
  - External analyses: a portion of samples (especially for nitrogen and phosphorus forms) analyzed by accredited external laboratories; some data labeled as available N & P from external labs (noted for batch 2).

- Methods and instrumentation
  - Standard methods (described in TABLE 3) with modifications as needed; external laboratories used for certain analyses (nitrogen forms, total carbon and nitrogen, aqua regia soluble elemental forms).
  - Key instruments and methods:
    - pH: pH meter (Mettler Toledo Inlab Versatile Pro)
    - Electrical Conductivity (EC): conductivity meter (Jenway 4510)
    - N forms: automated flow analyser (NO3–, NO2–, NH4+; references JAS082; JAS300)
    - TC & TN: elemental/carbons analyzers (e.g., Elementar Vario EL III)
    - WS and AR elemental compositions: ICP-OES (iCAP 6300) and related digestions
    - AR digestion: Microwave digestion (MARSXpress)
  - Datasets include both in-house analyses and results from external accredited laboratories; notes indicate which measurements are in-house vs external.

- Data content and reporting
  - Analytes included: pH, EC, dry matter (DM), LOI, total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), carbon/nitrogen ratio (C/N); inorganic and nutrient species (NO3–, NH4+, NO3-N, NH4-N); water-soluble and aqua regia soluble extractables for Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, P, S, Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Zn, etc.; and various other elements as per aqua regia extractables (ARCa, ARMg, ARK, ARNa, ARP, ARS, ARAl, ARCd, ARCo, ARCr, ARCu, ARFe, ARMn, ARNi, ARPb, ARZn).
  - Data conventions: results mostly on a dry basis; BDl denotes readings below detection; replicates are analytical; blank cells indicate measurements not performed or differing replicate counts.
  - Data provenance: dataset includes analyses performed in-house; external lab results exist for some parameters (not all external data are included in the WP1 dataset).

- Additional notes
  - Digestate batch 2 data for Available N & P were obtained from external laboratory results (left blank in the internal dataset).
  - The dataset aggregates data across batches to provide a comprehensive view of waste streams for WP1 characterization, with later batches exclusively supporting other WP analyses but still included for completeness.

- Practical relevance for data-driven analysis
  - Enables correlation analysis between feedstock composition, digestate/ash physico-chemical properties, and potential performance of bioenergy processes.
  - Provides standardized measurement context, enabling cross-batch comparison and integration with external datasets.
  - Highlights data gaps and access considerations typical of public health and environmental data, such as reliance on external labs for certain measurements and the use of multiple standards.
