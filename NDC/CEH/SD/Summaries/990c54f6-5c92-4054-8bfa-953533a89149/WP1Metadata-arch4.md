WP1 - Physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash derived from UK bioenergy production (anaerobic digestion and thermal transformation)

## Overview
- Describes dataset and methods for physico-chemical characterization of anaerobic digestate and biomass ash from UK bioenergy production.
- AVAnD project ran from January 2015 for 3 years; multiple waste streams were collected and analyzed.
- WP1 data focus on initial batches (batch 1–2) for waste stream characterization and formulation, with data from all batches included in the dataset for completeness.

## Dataset scope and batches
- Digestates: samples collected from several industrial plants across the UK at multiple time points; 8 batches documented (Jan 2015 to Jan 2018).
- Biomass ashes: six ash types from Spain and the UK (fly and bottom ashes, bulk fractions) collected at different times; data cover multiple batches.
- WP1 dataset includes data from all batches for comprehensive characterization; subsequent batches used in other work packages (WPs).

## Sampling and sample handling
- Subsampling: minimum 0.5 kg per subsample; samples processed per ISO/DIS 14820-2 and BS EN 15002:2006.
- Digestates: 5–10 kg per sample; stored cold (<4°C); analyzed as soon as possible; some subsamples sent to external labs for complementary analyses.
- Fresh vs dried: fresh analyses with minimal preprocessing; dried samples dried at 60/105°C, milled to pass 1 mm, stored in zip bags.
- Storage and transport: samples cooled and transported in appropriate containers; various batches sourced from end-of-line in AD plants.

## Materials and sampling sources
- Digestate sources (batch-specific context provided in the dataset): various feedstocks including source-separated food waste, maize silage, vegetables, and kerbside food waste.
- Ash sources: multiple UK and Spanish sources; six biomass ash types with fly/bottom and bulk fractions described.

## Analytical methods and laboratories
- In-house analyses described; external accredited labs performed complementary analyses (nitrogen forms, TC/TN, aqua regia soluble elements).
- Analytical methods referenced by tabled standards and equipment mapping (pH, EC, nitrate, ammonium, nitrite, total C/N, water- and aqua-regia soluble elements, etc.).
- Key external methods: N-NO3, N-NH4, N-NO2; TC & TN; aqua regia extractions; several ISO/BS standards listed (e.g., EN 16168, EN 13137, EN 13657, ISO 15958, ISO 13395, etc.).
- Equipment examples: pH meters, conductivity meters, automated flow analyzers, ICP-OES (water- and aqua-regia soluble analyses), ICP digestion, elemental analyzers.
- Batch 2: available N & P data derived from external lab results and left blank in the dataset file.

## Data structure and key variables
- Parameters include: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), nitrate (NO3−), ammonium (NH4+), total nitrogen (TN), total carbon (TC), carbon to nitrogen ratio (C/N), dry matter (DM), loss on ignition (LOI); water-soluble (WS) and aqua regia soluble (AR) fractions for various elements (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn, etc.); and specific metals in AR extracts.
- Data expressed on a dry basis unless stated otherwise.
- Dataset notes include qualifiers like BDL (below detection), analytical replicates, and blank/missing values.
- Table 3 outlines origins, units, methods, and batch/subtype details for interpretation of results.

## Data quality, metadata, and standards
- Data are primarily in-house measurements; external data exist only for specific parameters (notably batch 2 Available N & P).
- Metadata references a comprehensive set of sampling, preparation, and analysis standards to ensure quality and comparability.
- Subsamples are composites from bulk samples; replicates are analytical rather than multiple physical replicates.

## Governance, access, and intended use
- WP1 dataset supports physico-chemical characterization and formulation of waste blends within the AVAnD project.
- Data are intended to enable understanding of waste streams, inform data-driven decisions on blending/formulation, and support broader data-sharing within the project ecosystem.
- All batches’ data are included to provide a complete characterization, with later batches contributing to broader WP context.

## Limitations and notes
- Batch 2 external results for Available N & P were used and left blank in the in-dataset file.
- Some data are limited to in-house measurements; external data are not fully incorporated across all parameters.
- The dataset emphasizes analytical results from composites and may not include all raw inputs from external labs.
