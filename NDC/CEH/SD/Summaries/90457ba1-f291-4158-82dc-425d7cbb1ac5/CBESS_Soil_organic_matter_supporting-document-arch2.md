# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil organic matter content from three soil depths on saltmarsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring soil organic matter (OM) content (%), assessed by loss-on-ignition (LOI) from bulk density samples.
- Three soil depths: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm.
- Locations: saltmarsh sites in Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain).
- Campaign timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013 as an additional sampling window.
- Lead staff: Hilary Ford.

## Methods and sampling design
- Sampling context: adjacent to flume core; bulk density rings used for density estimates (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter).
- OM measurement: bulk density samples dried at 105°C for 72 hours; sub-sample dried at 375°C for 16 hours to determine OM percentage in dry soil.
- Data format: stored in an Excel workbook; some cells marked NA indicate missing data.
- Procedures listed include field and lab steps; calibration procedures are not specified.

## Site context and environmental variability
- Site selection represents contrasting soil types:
  - Essex: clay soils (three sites) with hare grazing; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by overwintering Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils (three sites) with intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 ha−1) and winter grazing by pink-footed geese.
  - West Plain (Essex context) described separately as lightly grazed.
- Vegetation, inundation frequency, creek structure, and grazing regimes differ between Essex and Morecambe Bay, providing a range of conditions for OM assessment.

## Dataset contents and structure
- Primary variable: Soil organic matter (%) at each depth.
- Site and location details:
  - Morecambe: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Habitat options include Mudflat (MF) and Saltmarsh (SM).
- Quadrat-level data: 1–22 per site.
- Spatial scale categories: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m and above).
- Data fields include: Row Number, Season (Winter W or Summer S), Location (Morecambe M or Essex E), Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, and OM measurements for the 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm depths (represented as OM_10-20 and OM_20-30 in the dataset).

## Temporal coverage
- Winter and Summer 2013 field campaign.
- Additional March 2–6, 2013 sampling window for Essex winter data.

## Data quality and formats
- Primary format: Excel workbook.
- QA/QC details are not specified; calibration procedures are listed as None.
- NA cells indicate missing data.

## Context for environmental monitoring
- Provides a standardised metric (OM %) across two ecologically distinct saltmarsh regions and three depths, enabling temporal and cross-site comparisons.
- Rich metadata (soil type, inundation, grazing regime, vegetation) supports integrated analyses with other environmental datasets.
- Supports monitoring of soil health and ecosystem service implications within CBESS frameworks.

## Potential for integration and use
- Data can be combined with other CBESS datasets or hydrological/vegetation data to assess coastal carbon dynamics, soil health trends, and ecosystem service provisioning over time.
- Depth-specific OM data enables depth-profile analyses of soil carbon and related processes across contrasting marsh environments.

## Limitations and considerations
- Data limited to 2013 field campaign (with some Essex winter sampling in March 2013).
- Details on data quality control procedures are not provided; calibration specifics are not described.
- Some dataset fields (e.g., exact QA metrics and data portal access) are not specified.
