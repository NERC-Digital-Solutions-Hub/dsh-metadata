# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil organic matter content from three soil depths on saltmarsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose and scope
  - Tracks soil organic matter content (%) at three depths (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm) using LOI on bulk density samples.
  - Sites: six saltmarsh locations split between Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain).
  - Aims to compare across contrasting soil types (clay in Essex; sandy in Morecambe Bay) and differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
  - Sampling period: general field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013, with Essex winter samples collected March 2–6, 2013.
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.

- Methods and procedures
  - Field sampling: bulk density rings (3.1 cm height, 7.5 cm diameter) deployed in quadrats to obtain depth-specific samples (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm).
  - Laboratory analysis: Loss-on-Ignition (LOI) to determine soil organic matter after drying subsamples; drying steps include 105°C for 72 hours and 375°C for 16 hours to determine OM on dry soil.
  - Metadata included: site coordinates and descriptive habitat context (saltmarsh vs mudflat).
  - Calibration and quality control: no calibration procedures reported; data quality control procedures not specified.

- Sites, habitats, and grazing context
  - Essex sites (E): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM) – hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay sites (M): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS) – intensively sheep-grazed (~4–5 ha⁻¹) with pink-footed geese grazing in winter; West Plain (WP) – lightly grazed (<2 sheep ha⁻¹).
  - Habitats: saltmarsh (SM) and mudflat (MF) across sites.

- Data structure and variables
  - Variables observed: Soil organic matter (%) across three depths, measured via LOI.
  - Dataset fields (examples): Row Number; Season (Winter W, Summer S); Location (Morecambe M, Essex E); Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex); Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM); Quadrat Number (1–22); Scale categories (A=1 m, B=1–10 m, C=10–100 m, D=100 m and up); OM_10-20 and OM_20-30 as columns representing OM percentages for the depth ranges described in the dataset (the exact depth pairing within each OM field is described in the metadata but not fully unambiguous in the text).
  - Data formats: Excel workbook.
  - Notes: NA cells indicate missing data.

- Data governance and accessibility
  - Data ownership and responsible contact: Hilary Ford.
  - Data provenance: detailed field and lab procedures included to support reproducibility.
  - Metadata depth and clarity: dataset provides site coordinates, habitat context, and a structured variable schema; some depth-field mappings are not fully explicit in the provided description.
  - Data sharing and openness: dataset provided as an Excel workbook with descriptive metadata; formal data sharing policy not explicitly stated.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a structured, depth-resolved measure of soil organic matter across contrasting coastal marsh systems, useful for monitoring carbon pools and soil health in policy and management contexts.
  - Enables assessment of management and environmental drivers (grazing intensity, habitat type, inundation regime) on OM content.
  - The dataset supports cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses across seasons (Winter vs Summer) and could inform decisions on data collection cadence, metadata requirements, and governance in monitoring programs.
