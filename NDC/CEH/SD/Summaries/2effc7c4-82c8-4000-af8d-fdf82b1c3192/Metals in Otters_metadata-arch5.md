# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales.

## Overview
- Study of metal and metalloid concentrations in otter livers collected from England and Wales during 2007–2009.
- Otters mainly died from road traffic accidents; samples were part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP).

## Sample collection and storage
- Carcasses stored frozen at -18°C prior to examination.
- Post-mortem data collected: age class (adult, sub-adult, juvenile), sex, body length, weight, and body condition coefficient (K) per Kruuk and Conroy (1991).
- A liver sub-sample was taken and stored at -18°C before analysis.
- Most elements measured in 157 liver samples; Pb measured in 107 samples (2007–2008); Ag measured in 17 livers (2009).

## Analytical methods
- Sample preparation: 1 g wet weight liver digested in 10 mL of 70% nitric acid using a microwave digestion system (200°C, 15 min).
- Post-digestion: digests brought to 25 mL with deionized water, then diluted ten-fold prior to ICP-MS analysis.
- ICP-MS: instrument preconditioned with 10% nitric acid; Ag concentration corrected for interference from zirconium oxide.
- Moisture content: determined by drying 0.5 g sub-sample at 70°C for 48 h; dry-weight concentrations calculated from wet weight and moisture content.

## Quality control and detection limits
- Detection limits (LoD): instrumental LoD defined as 4.03 × SD of six blank replicates; method LoD accounts for dilution, digest volume, and minimum sample weight; LoD range across elements: 0.003–2.0 µg/g dry weight.
- Certified reference material (Tort2) analyzed alongside samples; recoveries ranged 88–108% for most elements; Se had an average recovery of 149%.
- Reported concentrations are not adjusted for recovery corrections.

## Data handling and statistics
- Data distributions for most elements were left-skewed; medians used for reporting and non-parametric tests used for analysis.
- Age/sex comparisons: Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc tests.
- Relationships: Spearman rank correlations between body condition (K) and analyte concentrations, and between pairs of analytes.
- Spatial analysis: otters assigned to four regions (north England, east England, south-west England, mid-west England and Wales); regional differences assessed with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post hoc tests.

## Dataset scope and limitations
- Sample counts by element and year:
  - Most elements: 157 samples (2007–2009).
  - Lead (Pb): 107 samples (2007–2008).
  - Silver (Ag): 17 livers (2009).
- Data limitations include incomplete data for some elements in certain years, non-recovery-corrected results (noted especially for Se), and potential interferences or biases from analytical methods.

## Metadata and provenance
- Data originate from the Cardiff University Otter Project; associated biological metadata include age, sex, body length, weight, and body condition.
- Geographic regional classification enabled spatial analysis of metal concentrations.
