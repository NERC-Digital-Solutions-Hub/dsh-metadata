# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales.

## Overview
- Study period: 2007–2009, using otters found dead in England and Wales (primarily road traffic accidents >90%).
- Samples: livers collected from otters; a sub-sample used for detailed analysis.
- Objective: determine concentrations of selected metals/metalloids in otter livers and assess factors such as age, sex, body condition, and geography.
- Key measurements: age class (adult, sub-adult, juvenile), sex, body condition coefficient (K) per Kruuk & Conroy (1991), moisture content, and liver metal/metalloid concentrations.

## Materials and Methods (analytical workflow)
- Sample handling: carcasses stored at -18°C before examination; post-mortem data collected; a 1 g wet weight liver sample digested.
- Digestion and analysis: microwave digestion with 10 ml of 70% nitric acid at 200°C for 15 minutes; digested samples diluted to 25 ml, then diluted ten-fold prior to ICP-MS analysis.
- Instrumental considerations: ICP-MS with background correction for Ag due to zirconium oxide interferences.
- Moisture and weight: moisture content determined by drying a 0.5 g sub-sample at 70°C for 48 hours; dry weight concentrations calculated from wet weight and moisture data.
- Quality control:
  - Instrumental limits of detection (LoD) calculated as 4.03 × SD of six replicate blanks.
  - Method LoD derived from instrumental LoD, factoring dilution, digest volume, and minimum sample weight; LoD range: 0.003–2.0 µg/g dry weight across elements.
  - Tort2 certified reference material run with otter samples; recoveries 88–108% for all elements except Se (149%); reported residues are not recovery-corrected.
- Data characteristics: distributions largely left-skewed; medians used; non-parametric methods employed.

## Data and Statistical Analyses
- Population structure: otters assigned to four broad regions for spatial assessment (north England, east England, south-west England, and mid-west England and Wales).
- Analyses:
  - Age/sex differences: Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc for multiple comparisons.
  - Inter-analyte and K correlations: Spearman rank correlation.
  - Spatial variation: Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc tests to compare regional concentrations.

## Sample Size and Scope
- Most elements: 157 liver samples (2007–2009).
- Lead (Pb): 107 samples (assessed in 2007–2008).
- Silver (Ag): 17 livers (assessed in 2009).

## Notes
- Reported concentrations are not corrected for recoveries.
