# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales.

## Overview
- Study period: 2007–2009; otters found dead in England and Wales collected via Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP).
- Most deaths: road traffic accidents (>90%).
- Objective: determine liver concentrations of metals/metalloids; relate to sample metadata and spatial distribution.

## Data and sample collection
- Specimen handling: carcasses stored at -18°C; post-mortem determined age class (adult, sub-adult, juvenile) and sex; biometric measurements recorded (body length, weight) to compute body condition coefficient (K).
- Tissue samples: sub-sample of liver collected and stored at -18°C before analysis.
- Sample sizes by element:
  - Most elements: 157 liver samples (2007–2009).
  - Lead (Pb): 107 samples (2007–2008).
  - Silver (Ag): 17 livers (2009 subset).
- Data linked to metadata: year of collection, age class, sex, biometric measures, and four broad geographic regions.

## Analytical methods (data processing)
- Digestion: 1 g wet weight liver digested in 10 ml of 70% nitric acid via microwave (200°C, 15 min).
- Dilution: digest brought to 25 ml, then ten-fold dilution prior to ICP-MS analysis.
- Instrumental corrections: Ag concentration corrected for interferences from zirconium oxide.
- Moisture and weight basis: moisture content determined by drying 0.5 g at 70°C for 48 h; dry weight concentrations derived from wet weight and moisture data.
- Quality assurance and control:
  - Instrumental LoD defined as 4.03×SD of six blank replicates.
  - Method LoD calculated using dilution and digest volumes.
  - Tort2 CRM included with recoveries 88–108% for all elements except Se (149%); results not recovery-corrected.

## Data quality and limitations
- Data distribution: most elements show left-skew (more low concentrations).
- Handling of results: report as medians; non-parametric statistics used due to distribution.
- Comparisons and correlations:
  - Age and sex differences: Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc.
  - Associations: Spearman rank correlations between body condition (K) and analyte concentrations; correlations among analytes.
- Regional analysis: four regions (north England, east England, south-west England, mid-west England and Wales) tested for regional differences using Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc.
- Limitations:
  - Uneven sample sizes across years and elements (e.g., Ag only in 2009; Pb limited to 2007–2008).
  - Not all recoveries corrected; Se shows notably high CRM recovery (149%), indicating potential matrix effects.
  - Some elements measured in smaller sub-samples, reducing power for comparisons.

## Data products and reuse
- Potential data products:
  - Summary tables of median liver concentrations by element, year, age/sex class, and region.
  - Visual dashboards showing regional and temporal trends with non-parametric summaries.
  - Dataset combining metal concentrations with metadata (age, sex, body condition, region, year) for cross-study comparisons.
- Data interpretation guidance:
  - Interpret dry-weight concentrations with the caveat of CRM recoveries and method LoDs.
  - Use medians for skewed distributions; apply non-parametric tests for group comparisons.
- Data integration considerations:
  - Align element lists with Table 1 and ensure consistent units (dry weight) and detection limits across years.
  - Document sample size per element when evaluating statistical power.
