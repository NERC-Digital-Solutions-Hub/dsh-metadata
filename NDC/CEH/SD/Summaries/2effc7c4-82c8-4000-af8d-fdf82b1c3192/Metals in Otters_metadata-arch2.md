# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales

## Overview
- Objective: document liver concentrations of metals/metalloids in Eurasian otters to support environmental health monitoring and policy assessment over time.
- Population and period: otters found dead in England and Wales during 2007–2009, predominantly from road traffic accidents.
- Project and data flow: samples collected by the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP); post-mortem data collected (age, sex, body length, weight, body condition K); liver sub-samples stored for analysis.
- Data intent: generate standardized measurements to enable comparisons across age/sex groups and geographic regions, with clear QA/QA, and to support monitoring datasets.

## Materials and Methods (Data Collection and Laboratory Analysis)
- Sample handling: liver sub-samples stored at -18°C prior to analysis; moisture content determined by drying sub-samples; dry-weight concentrations computed from wet-weight analyses.
- Analytical procedure:
  - 1 g wet weight liver digested with 10 ml of 70% nitric acid using microwave digestion (200°C, 15 min).
  - Digests brought to 25 ml, then diluted tenfold for ICP-MS analysis.
  - Instrument validated with 10% nitric acid; Ag corrected for zirconium oxide interferences.
- Quality assurance:
  - Use of Tort2 certified reference material (CRM) alongside otter samples; recoveries 88–108% for all elements except Se (149%).
  - Detection limits (LoD) calculated as 4.03 × SD of six blank replicates; method LoD adjusted for dilution, digest volume, and minimum sample weight (range 0.003–2.0 µg/g dry weight, depending on element).
- Sample characteristics:
  - Elements measured (Table 1 in the study) across most elements in 157 otter livers (2007–2009).
  - Pb measured in 107 livers (2007–2008); Ag analyzed in 17 livers (2009).
- Data normalization and reporting:
  - Moisture correction to dry weight; most data reported as medians due to left-skewed distributions.
  - Age classification: adult, sub-adult, juvenile.
  - Body condition coefficient K calculated per Kruuk and Conroy (1991).

## Statistical Analysis and Data Handling
- Distribution characteristics: most element concentrations are left-skewed; medians and non-parametric tests used.
- Group comparisons:
  - Age and sex: Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn’s post hoc comparisons.
  - Geographic variation: otters assigned to four regions (north England, east England, south-west England, mid-west England and Wales); regional differences tested with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn’s post hoc tests.
- Associations:
  - Spearman rank correlations to assess relationships between body condition (K) and analyte concentrations, and between pairs of analytes.
- Software: GraphPad Prism 5.03 and Minitab 15.1 used for analyses.

## Geographic and Temporal Scope
- Regions analyzed: four broad geographic regions within England and Wales.
- Temporal resolution: data spanning 2007–2009.

## Data Coverage and Limits
- Elemental coverage: multiple metals/metalloids (specific elements listed in Table 1; not all elements uniformly available across all years).
- Sample size variation by element and year (e.g., Pb limited to 2007–2008; Ag restricted to 2009 for a small subset).
- Data handling caveats:
  - Recoveries not corrected for all elements.
  - Samples represent otters found dead (predominantly road traffic incidents), which may influence exposure profiles.

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring and Data Reuse
- Standardized methodology: microwave digestion, ICP-MS analysis, QA with CRM, and explicit LODs support reproducibility and cross-study comparability.
- Analytical transparency: explicit reporting of detection limits, recovery ranges, and non-correction for some recoveries facilitates appropriate interpretation and integration with other datasets.
- Data integration potential: dataset designed to enable comparisons across age, sex, and geography; framework suitable for combining with other biomonitoring datasets to enhance environmental health surveillance and policy evaluation.
- Accessibility considerations: underlying data and full dataset accessibility would enhance reuse and broader monitoring applications.
