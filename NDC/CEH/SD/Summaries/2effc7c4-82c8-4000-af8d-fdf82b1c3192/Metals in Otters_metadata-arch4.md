# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales.

## Overview
- Study of metal and metalloid residues in otter livers collected from England and Wales during 2007–2009.
- Most otters died from road traffic accidents; remains were stored at -18°C prior to examination.
- Aimed to determine concentrations and assess factors such as age, sex, body condition, geography, and data quality.

## Sample collection and handling
- Otters found dead between 2007–2009 were collected via the Cardiff University Otter Project.
- Age categories recorded: adult, sub-adult, juvenile; sex recorded.
- Biometric measurements taken to derive body condition coefficient (K) per Kruuk and Conroy (1991).
- Liver tissue sub-samples collected (1 g wet weight) and stored at -18°C for analysis.
- Most elements measured in 157 liver samples; lead (Pb) measured in 107 samples (2007–2008); silver (Ag) analysed in a small subset (17 livers, 2009).

## Analytical methods
- Microwave digestion: 1 g liver in 10 ml of 70% nitric acid; digestion at 200°C for 15 minutes.
- post-digestion: diluted to 25 ml, then ten-fold dilution prior to analysis.
- Instrumental analysis: Inductively Coupled Plasma–Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) with background correction for Ag interference from zirconium oxide.
- Moisture content: determined by drying 0.5 g sub-sample at 70°C for 48 hours; results expressed as dry weight concentrations.
- Limits of detection (LoDs): calculated as 4.03 × SD of six blank replicates; method LoD incorporates dilution, digest volume, and minimum sample weight; LoDs varied by element (0.003–2.0 µg/g dry weight for cadmium to zinc).

## Quality control and data integrity
- Use of Tort2 certified reference material (CRM) alongside otter samples; recoveries ranged 88–108% for most elements; Se recovery higher at 149%.
- Reported residues are not recovery-corrected.
- Data distributions: majority of elements showed left-skewness (lower concentrations common); results reported as medians.

## Data handling and analysis
- Statistical approach:
  - Age/sex comparisons: Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc tests.
  - Associations: Spearman rank correlations (between body condition K and analyte concentrations; between analyte pairs).
  - Spatial variation: otters assigned to four broad regions (north England, east England, south-west England, mid-west England and Wales); Kruskal-Wallis with Dunn’s post hoc tests to assess regional differences.
- Data processing and statistics performed with GraphPad Prism and Minitab.

## Data availability and limitations
- Sample sizes varied by element (157 for most elements; Pb in 107; Ag in 17).
- Se showed notably higher CRM recovery, indicating potential measurement bias for that element.
- Left-skewed data informed non-parametric reporting (medians).
- No recovery correction applied to reported concentrations.
- Spatial analysis limited to broad regional groupings; may mask finer-scale geographic variation.
