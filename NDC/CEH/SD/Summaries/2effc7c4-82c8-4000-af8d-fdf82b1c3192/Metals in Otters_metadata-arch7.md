# Metal and metalloid concentrations in the livers of Eurasian otter ( Lutra lutra ) from England and Wales.

- Overview
  - Study period: otters found dead in England and Wales collected during 2007–2009 as part of the Cardiff University Otter Project.
  - Majority cause of death: road traffic accidents.
  - Objective: determine concentrations of multiple metals/metalloids in otter livers; relate findings to age, sex, body condition, and geography using four broad regions.

- Data collection and samples
  - Biological data: age class (adult, sub-adult, juvenile), sex, body length, weight to compute body condition coefficient (K).
  - Tissue sampling: sub-sample of liver taken, stored at -18°C; moisture content measured to enable dry-weight calculations.
  - Sample counts: most elements measured in 157 livers (2007–2009); lead (Pb) measured in 107 livers (2007–2008); silver (Ag) analysed in a small subset (17 livers) in 2009.
  - Geographic grouping: otters assigned to four regions for spatial analysis (north England, east England, south-west England, and mid-west England and Wales).

- Laboratory analysis
  - Sample preparation: 1 g wet-weight liver digested with 10 ml of 70% nitric acid using microwave digestion (200°C, 15 min); digests brought to 25 ml, then ten-fold diluted prior to ICP-MS analysis.
  - Instrumental approach: inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS); Ag concentration corrected for interference from zirconium oxide.
  - Quality control: moisture content determined; dry-weight concentrations calculated; use of Tort2 certified reference material (CRM) alongside samples.
  - Recovery and detection: average CRM recoveries 88–108% for most elements; Se recovery 149%; data are not recovery-corrected.
  - Detection limits: elemental limits of detection (LoDs) calculated as 4.03 × SD of six blank replicates; method LoD derived from instrument LoD, dilution factor, digest volume, and minimum sample weight; LoD range 0.003–2.0 µg g−1 dry weight across elements.

- Data handling and statistics
  - Data distribution: most elements show left-skewed distributions; results reported as medians.
  - Comparative analyses: age/sex differences assessed with Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post hoc tests.
  - Relationships: Spearman rank correlations between body condition (K) and analyte concentrations, and among analytes.
  - Spatial analysis: regional differences tested via Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s post hoc comparisons across the four geographic regions.

- Key data characteristics and limitations
  - Element coverage: table of elements (Table 1) details which were measured; broader analysis restricted by sample sizes for some elements (e.g., Ag in a small subset).
  - Data constraints: regional analysis limited to four broad zones; not a high-resolution spatial mapping due to sample distribution and data structure.
  - Data quality notes: Se recovery higher than typical (149%); Pb measurements limited to 2007–2008; Ag data limited to a small subset in 2009.
  - Data handling: results based on wet weight with subsequent dry-weight normalization using measured moisture.

- Implications for GIS and map-based data products
  - Suitable for region-based visualization of metal/metalloid concentrations in otter livers, with medians by region and potentially by year if data are aggregated accordingly.
  - Caution on interpretation given small sample sizes for some elements, skewed distributions, and non-representative sampling (road traffic fatalities, museum/roadkill context).
  - Metadata considerations: year range, regional classification, age/sex categories, and data treatment (dry-weight normalization, non-parametric statistics) should accompany any GIS display or analysis. 
  - Potential analyses: spatial comparison of regional medians, overlay with environmental exposure indicators, and exploration of associations with body condition, while acknowledging QA/QC limitations.
