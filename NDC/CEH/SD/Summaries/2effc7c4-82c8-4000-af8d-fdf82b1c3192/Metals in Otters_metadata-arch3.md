## Summary
- Objective and context
  - Assess concentrations of metals and metalloids in otter livers from England and Wales; samples collected 2007–2009 as part of the Cardiff University Otter Project (CUOP).
  - Most otters died from road traffic accidents, introducing potential sampling bias.

- Sampling and biological data
  - Otters found dead were stored at -18°C; age category (adult, sub-adult, juvenile) and sex recorded; body length and weight measured to derive body condition coefficient K (Kruuk & Conroy 1991).
  - A sub-sample of liver tissue was used for analysis; moisture content determined for dry-weight calculations.

- Analytes and sample sizing
  - Metals/metalloids listed in Table 1; most elements measured in 157 livers (2007–2009).
  - Lead (Pb) measured in 107 livers (2007–2008); a small subset (17 livers) analyzed for silver (Ag) in 2009.

- Analytical methods and QA/QC
  - Digestion: 1 g wet-weight liver digested in 10 ml of 70% nitric acid using microwave digestion (200°C, 15 min).
  - Analysis: Inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) with corrections for interferences; Ag corrected for zirconium oxide interference.
  - Quality control: Instrumental limits of detection (LoD) calculated as 4.03 × SD of blanks; method LoD adjusted for dilution, digest volume, and minimum sample weight.
  - Certified reference material (Tort2 CRM) analyzed concurrently; recoveries ranged 88–108% for all elements except Se (149%); reported concentrations are not recovery-corrected.
  - Dry-weight concentrations calculated from wet weight and moisture content.

- Data characteristics and statistics
  - Distributions for most elements were left-skewed; results presented as medians.
  - Age/sex comparisons: Kruskal–Wallis tests with Dunn’s post hoc for multiple comparisons.
  - Relationships: Spearman rank correlations between body condition (K) and analyte concentrations, and between pairs of analytes.
  - Spatial analysis: Each otter assigned to four regions (north England, east England, south-west England, and mid-west England and Wales); regional differences tested with Kruskal–Wallis and Dunn’s post hoc.
