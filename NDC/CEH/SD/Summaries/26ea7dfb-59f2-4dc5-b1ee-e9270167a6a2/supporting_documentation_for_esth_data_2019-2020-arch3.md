## Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from Esthwaite Water, UK, 2019  2020.

- Overview
  - Part of a long-term monitoring dataset from Esthwaite Tarn, Cumbria, England.
  - Fortnightly sampling from January 2019 to end of 2020.
  - Measurements include surface temperature, surface oxygen saturation, water clarity, water chemistry, and phytoplankton chlorophyll a.

- Measured variables and units
  - Surface temperature (TEMP): degrees Celsius
  - Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG): % air-saturation
  - Secchi depth (SECC): metres
  - Alkalinity (ALKA): µg CaCO3 per litre
  - pH: unitless
  - Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per litre
  - Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per litre
  - Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per litre
  - Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per litre
  - Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg Si per litre
  - Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre
  - Note: Values below detection limit shown with a < sign.

- Sampling regime and location
  - Water samples collected from 0 to 5 m integrated depth.
  - Boat-based sampling at a buoy location (Latitude 54.364, Longitude -2.988) deepest part of the lake; when inaccessible, shore samples were taken.
  - Sampling frequency: fortnightly; dataset includes all samples from January 2019 through December 2020.

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Data delivered as a comma-separated values (CSV) file.
  - Columns include Date, variables (TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA), Value, Sign (for below-detection-limit values), and Flag.
  - Flag meanings: 1 = sample taken on the lake at the buoy; 2 = sample from the shore due to buoy access issues.
  - Each variable has an associated unit description and data field labeling as described in the dataset documentation.

- Quality control and data limitations
  - The dataset provided is raw and has not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Data have undergone double-entry and visual checks.
  - Missing data arise from weather conditions, lake access restrictions, COVID-19 restrictions, or staff shortages.

- Data governance and sharing considerations
  - Raw data are available for download, with accompanying metadata detailing structure and variable definitions.
  - Public sharing of underlying data may be constrained by dataset status and quality control stage; awareness of data provenance and transformation needs is important for interpretation.

- Funding and support
  - Data collection supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) under the UK-SCAPE programme.
  - Data validation supported by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/Y006208/1) under the ACCESS-UK programme.
