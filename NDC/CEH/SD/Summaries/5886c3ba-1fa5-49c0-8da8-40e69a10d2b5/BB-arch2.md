# BB Protocol

## Aim
- The Breeding Bird Survey (BBS) is a key component of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Objective: record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds across varied UK habitats to reveal year-to-year and long-term population changes.
- Methodological improvements over CBC/WBS: random sample sites, more sites, counts instead of mapping territories, reduced per-site effort, and improved representativeness.
- Outputs feed environmental health and policy monitoring through standardized data collection and longitudinal trends.

## Location and site selection
- Random selection of at least one 1 km square within target areas; preferably more in rooms with mixed habitats.
- If overlap with CBC or BM protocols, use the same squares; moorland sites reuse previously used squares.
- If neither CBC nor BM has been used, select at least one 1 km square at random from all available squares.

## Transect establishment
- Within each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects, each 1 km long (north/south or east/west).
- Transects 500 m apart and at least 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect divided into ten 200 m sections; routes are marked and the exact route is recorded.
- If routes deviate due to barriers, ensure transects remain at least 200 m apart; minor intrusions into adjacent squares allowed.
- The same transect route is followed every year.

## Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, including habitats within 25 m of each transect side.
- Use habitat codes for the predominant habitat (first habitat) and a secondary habitat if present (second habitat).
- Choose habitat codes from Levels 1–4; for each BB Protocol habitat, select codes from Levels 1–4 (and up to two from Levels 3–4 as needed).
- If transect route differs from the ideal, record the average distance to the ideal transect and provide an additional habitat code list for the ideal route.

## Frequency and timing
- Main breeding season in southern Britain: roughly 1 April to 30 June.
- Two counting periods: early (early April to mid-May) and late (mid-May to late June); one visit per period, at least four weeks apart.
- Timing typically in the morning: start between 06:00 and 07:00 BST, no later than 09:00; maintain consistency across years.
- Conduct counts only in suitable weather; weather conditions recorded on forms.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds encountered along the two transects.
- Start with transect 1 (sections 1–5), then transect 2 (sections 6–10); total visit ~90 minutes.
- Observe for birds seen/heard, scanning for overhead birds; categorize by distance from transect:
  - 1: within 25 m
  - 2: 25–100 m
  - 3: more than 100 m (including birds outside square)
  - F: birds in flight
- Distances estimated as right-angled to the line; avoid double counting; juveniles distinguished where possible.
- Use standard BTO species codes; nest counts for dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls) counted separately outside transects.
- After field work, produce summaries of adult birds by species and distance band for each transect section.

## Recording conventions and data handling
- Recording forms: standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field forms; moorland forms available from CCU.
- Summary and code references: BTO species codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, habitat codes, weather codes, distance categories (see references in the protocol).
- Data specification: each sampling location must capture core identifiers (Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit date, Visit code, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, Units, Grid reference; BTO codes; etc.).
- Data submission and formats: data to ECNCCU with accompanying Data Transfer documentation; datasets formatted for ECN conventions; access via restricted ECN Site Managers' extranet.

## Outputs and forms
- Data collected to be used within the ECN/National monitoring framework; enables longitudinal analysis of population trends and habitat associations.
- Forms and recording sheets are provided by BTO/Census Unit; BBS maps and CBC outlines typically generated by the BTO from recorder submissions.

## Availability and references
- Specific BTO codes and data conventions referenced (pages p177–p181 for codes, weather, distance categories, etc.).
- Forms and moorland recording forms available from designated BTO/Census Unit contacts.
