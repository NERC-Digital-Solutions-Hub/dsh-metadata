# BB Protocol

## Aim
- To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).
- Aims to show year-to-year and long-term population changes across habitats; improvements over CBC and WBS include random site selection, more sample sites, counts instead of territory mapping, reduced per-site effort, and improved representativeness.

## Location
- In overlap with sites previously using CBC or BM: select at least one 1 km square at random from those containing part of the former survey area.
- If moorland sites: use the same squares as previously used.
- If neither method was used previously: select at least one 1 km square at random from all available squares.

## Transect establishment
- Birds are counted along transects within each 1 km square.
- Ideally two parallel transects per square, each 1 km long; transects are 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect is divided into ten 200 m sections; the route is specified and marked, and the same route is used each year.
- If necessary, routes may deviate to avoid barriers, provided the two lines remain at least 200 m apart. Minor intrusions into adjacent squares are permissible.
- The exact route is recorded on a map.

## Habitat recording
- Habitat features are recorded at the start of each recording year for every 200 m section (within 25 m on either side of the line).
- Use codes to describe the predominant first habitat and a second habitat if present, with levels 1–4 for specifics.
- If the transect route differs from the ideal two parallel lines, record the average distance from the ideal line and also record an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain lowlands: two visits to transects per year (early: April–mid May; late: mid May–late June).
- Visits should be at least four weeks apart; timing adjusted for latitude/altitude.
- Counts occur in the morning (ideally 06:00–07:00 BST, no later than 09:00).
- Weather conditions (rain, visibility, wind) should be recorded; weather timing is consistent within a season and year.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds seen or heard along both transects.
- Birds categorized by distance from the transect line: within 25 m (1), 25–100 m (2), >100 m (3), or F for birds in flight.
- Distances are estimated perpendicularly to the line; same individual should not be counted twice.
- Use standard BTO species codes; distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
- For colonies nesting densely within the square (rook, sand martin, gulls), counts or nest estimates should be made for the whole 1 km square and recorded separately from transect data.
- Typical field session lasts about 90 minutes; starting and finishing times are recorded.

## Colony counts
- Dense colonies not adequately censused by the transect method (rook, sand martin, gulls) require separate colony counts or nest estimates for the entire 1 km square.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data are collected for each BB sampling location with a standard set of key identifying variables (e.g., Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time).
- BB data include two yearly visits, detailed habitat and bird-count fields, weather, start/finish times, species counts by distance category, bird activity, and BTO codes.
- Records are submitted in a defined ECN dataset format; details are provided in the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted extranet).

## Recording forms
- Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms are available from the Census Unit (BTO).
- A moorland bird field recording form is available from the CCU.
- Documentation and coding references relate to BTO codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories.

## Notes
- BTO codes and related mapping/symbol references are documented in specified pages (p177–p181).
- Data transfer documentation and access are restricted to authorized personnel (ECN Site Managers’ extranet); contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
