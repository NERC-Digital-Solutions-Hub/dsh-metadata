# BB Protocol

- Aim
  - Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
  - Enable monitoring of year-to-year and long-term population changes across the UK.
  - Improve representativeness through random site selection, increased sample size, and counts (not territory mapping) to reduce per-site effort.

- Location and Sampling Design
  - Overlap with previous CBC/BM protocols: select at least one randomly chosen 1 km square (preferably more) containing part of the former survey area; moorland sites keep previously used squares.
  - If no prior protocol used, sample at random from all available squares.

- Transect Establishment
  - Within each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transect lines, each 1 km long, oriented N–S or E–W.
  - Transects 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge; each line divided into five 200 m sections (ten sections total).
  - Start points marked for consistent yearly replication; routes may deviate to avoid barriers but lines must remain ≥200 m apart.

- Habitat Recording
  - Record habitat features for each 200 m section (within 25 m of each side of the line) using a habitat coding system.
  - Capture first and second habitats; levels 1–4 codes used for each habitat.
  - If the recorded route differs from the ideal, estimate average distance from ideal and record an additional “ideal transect” habitat list.

- Frequency and Timing
  - Two visits per year (early: April–mid-May; late: mid-May–late June) in southern Britain lowlands; at least four weeks apart.
  - Timing adjusted for latitude/altitude; trips for early and late periods are weather-conditioned and should avoid poor conditions.

- Bird Recording (Field Procedure)
  - Record all birds seen or heard along both transects.
  - Categories by distance from transect line:
    - 1: within 25 m
    - 2: 25–100 m
    - 3: more than 100 m (including beyond square boundary)
    - F: birds in flight
  - Distances estimated as right-angle measurements; same individual should not be counted twice.
  - Use standard BTO species codes; distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
  - Dense colony nesting species (rook, sand martin, gulls) counted separately as nests within the 1 km square.
  - Each field visit yields a summary of adult birds per species per distance band; average visit ≈ 90 minutes.

- Recording, Codes, and Forms
  - Standard BTO recording forms for CBC summaries and BBS field data; moorland birds have a dedicated CCU form.
  - BTO codes and symbols linked to habitat, weather, distance, and activity codes (referenced in accompanying pages).
  - For data entry, record:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code
    - Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats
    - Visit date/code, Weather, Start/Finish times
    - Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity
    - Grid references and BTO codes (habitat, weather, distance)
  - Units and precision: time to the minute; distance categories use BTO coding.

- Data Specification and Access
  - Data submission for BB includes two annual visits per ECN site; data entered as BBS field forms with standard notations.
  - ECN data format and transfer are defined in accompanying Data Transfer documentation; access via restricted ECN Site Manager extranet.
  - Key parameters to identify a recording occasion:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time
  - Data example fields: Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit code, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, Standard BTO codes.

- Supporting Documentation and Codes
  - BTO resources and coding references needed for consistent data capture:
    - BTO species codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, habitat codes, weather codes, distance categories.
  - Forms and field recording tools: CBC summary sheets, BBS field forms, moorland field form (from BTO CCU).

- Data Governance and Practical Considerations for Data Leaders
  - Emphasis on standardized, repeatable protocols to ensure cross-site comparability and long-term trend analysis.
  - Metadata-rich data collection (habitat context, weather, timing) supports robust habitat–population analyses.
  - Clear data ownership, transfer procedures, and access via restricted extranet; biennial data integrity checks via fixed transect routes and time windows.
  - Supports integration with broader ecosystem monitoring efforts and potential cross-site data coordination within ECN networks.
