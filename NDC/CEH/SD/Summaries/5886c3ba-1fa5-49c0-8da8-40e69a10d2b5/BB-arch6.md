# BB Protocol

- Aim
  - To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme (BTO).
  - Designed to show year-to-year and long-term changes across a range of habitats in the UK.
  - Improves representativeness and efficiency by random site selection, increasing sample size, and using counts over territory mapping.
  - Procedures are drawn from BBS observer instructions and published for broader use.

- Location
  - For sites where CBC or BM protocols were used, select at least one random 1 km square (preferably more) from squares containing part of the former survey area; overlap considerations apply.
  - Moorland sites use the same squares as previously used during the overlap period.
  - If neither CBC nor BM has been used, select at least one random 1 km square from all available squares.

- Transect establishment
  - In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects (1 km long) oriented NS or EW.
  - Transects are 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge.
  - Each transect is divided into ten 200 m sections with marked starts.
  - The route is ideally fixed and followed each year; deviations to avoid barriers are allowed if lines remain sufficiently apart.
  - The exact route is mapped; the same route is used annually.

- Habitat recording
  - Habitats are recorded at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, covering habitats within 25 m of either side of the transect.
  - Use codes to denote the predominant first habitat and a possible second habitat; up to two from levels 3 and 4.
  - If the transect route differs from the ideal, an average distance from the ideal is recorded and an additional list for the ideal transect is captured.

- Frequency and timing
  - Two visits per square per year: early (April to mid-May) and late (mid-May to late June).
  - Visits at least four weeks apart; timing adjusted for latitude (further north or higher altitude later).
  - Counts conducted in the morning, preferably 0600–0700 BST, not later than 0900; starting times must be consistent within and between years.
  - Avoid counts in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather recorded.

- Bird recording
  - Record all birds seen or heard along both transects, noting time and location by transect section.
  - Birds categorized by distance from the line: within 25 m (1), 25–100 m (2), over 100 m (3), and birds in flight (F).
  - Distances estimated perpendicularly to the line; same individual not counted twice.
  - Use standard BTO species codes; juvenile vs. adult distinguished where possible.
  - For dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls), nest counts are recorded separately for the entire 1 km square rather than by transect; colony counts are separate from transect data.
  - Each field visit includes a summary of adult birds by species and distance band.

- Colony counts
  - Nest counts or estimates required for birds nesting in dense colonies within the square (rook, sand martin, gulls), counted separately from transect data.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Data submission requires core identifying variables for each sampling occasion:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
  - Breeding birds (BB) dataset includes: Year, County, 1 km square code, Transect section, Habitats, Visit, Weather, Start/Finish times, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity, and BTO codes (with both 4- and 6-character coding schemes for different fields).
  - Additional fields include grid references, early/late visit codes, and time precision.

- Recording forms
  - Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit (BTO), with CBC outline maps typically prepared by BTO.
  - A field recording form for moorland birds is available from the CCU.

- Data access and documentation
  - Measurement variables and dataset formats align with ECN Site/ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; access is via restricted Site Managers' extranet.
  - Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access to documentation or data transfer specifications.
  - For the BB dataset, specific required fields include Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Year, and transect-related fields, along with weather, time, species, and habitat data coded per BTO standards.

- Notes
  - BTO codes, habitat codes, weather codes, activity mapping symbols, county codes, and distance categories are referenced in accompanying pages (e.g., p177–p181 in the BTO manual).
  - Observers must be familiar with the most common species codes and recording conventions to ensure consistency across years and sites.
