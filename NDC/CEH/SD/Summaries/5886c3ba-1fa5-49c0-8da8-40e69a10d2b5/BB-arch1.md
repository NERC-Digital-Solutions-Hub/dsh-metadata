# BB Protocol

## Aim
- To record the annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites.
- Part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).
- Designed to address limitations of earlier approaches by randomising sites, increasing sample size, using counts instead of territory mapping, reducing per-site effort, and improving representativeness.

## Method overview

### Location
- Select at least one 1 km square at random within the overlap area of the CBC method or, for moorland, the BM method; prefer more squares when possible.
- If neither prior method has been used, select at least one 1 km square at random from all available squares.

### Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transects (1 km long) oriented north/south or east/west.
- Transects 500 m apart and at least 250 m from the square edge.
- Each transect divided into ten 200 m sections; section starts marked.
- The actual route may deviate to avoid barriers, as long as transects remain ≥200 m apart; routes are recorded and repeated annually.

### Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, within 25 m of either side of the transect.
- Use a habitat coding system with a “first” and optional “second” habitat (levels 1–4; use up to two codes from levels 3–4 for each habitat).
- If the actual transect differs from the ideal two-parallel-transects route, also record an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

### Frequency and timing
- Breeding season in southern Britain: roughly 1 April to 30 June.
- Two counting periods: early (early April–mid May) and late (mid May–late June); one visit per period, at least four weeks apart.
- Morning counts (preferably 06:00–07:00 BST, no later than 09:00); keep start times consistent across season and years.
- Weather: avoid counts in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather conditions recorded.

### Bird recording
- Record all birds seen or heard along both transects.
- Distinguish distance bands per section: within 25 m (Category 1), 25–100 m (Category 2), more than 100 m or outside square (Category 3), or F for birds in flight.
- Estimate distances perpendicularly to the line; avoid double-counting the same individual.
- Distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
- For dense colony-nesting species (rook, sand martin, gulls), count nests in the whole 1 km square separately from transects.
- After each visit, produce summaries of adult birds by species within each distance band for each transect section.

### Coding and references
- Use standard BTO species codes and associated activity mapping symbols, weather codes, habitat codes, and distance categories.

## Data recording and formats

### Core parameters and data transfer
- The first four key parameters uniquely identifying each sample/recording occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g. T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g. PC)
  - Location Code (e.g. 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time
- For Breeding Birds (BB), two transect visits per year are recorded (early and late) with habitat and bird counts by species along the transects on field forms using standard notations.

### Variables recorded (examples)
- Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Year, County, 1 km square code
- Transect section, Habitats, Visit date/time, Weather
- Start time, Finish time, Species seen, Distance category, Bird activity
- Habitat codes (first and second habitat; levels 1–4)
- Biological details: juvenile/adult status where possible
- Notes on nest counts for colonies (rook, sand Martin, gulls)

### Data formats and access
- Data are recorded on CBC and BBS field recording forms; CBC maps are prepared by BTO.
- A moorland-specific field recording form is available from the CCU.
- ECN data submission uses specific dataset formats described in Data Transfer documentation (restricted access ECN Site Managers’ extranet).
- For access to documentation, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Practical notes for analysts
- Ensure alignment of field-reported data with unique site and measurement identifiers for temporal analyses.
- When merging habitat and bird counts, maintain the distinction between actual transect routes and ideal transect paths.
- Apply standard BTO coding to support cross-study comparability and long-term trend analyses.
- Be mindful of data availability constraints and potential need for nest counts to supplement transect surveys in dense colonies.
