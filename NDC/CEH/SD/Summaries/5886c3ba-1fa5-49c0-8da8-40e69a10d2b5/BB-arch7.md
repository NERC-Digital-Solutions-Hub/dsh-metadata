# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme by BTO.
- Track year-to-year and long-term population changes across a range of habitats in the UK.
- Improve sampling efficiency and representativeness compared with earlier CBC/WBS methods by random site selection, increased sample size, counts rather than territory mapping, and standardized procedures.

## Location and sampling design
- For overlap areas with CBC or BM protocols, select at least one 1 km square at random from squares containing part of the former survey area; prefer more than one square when possible.
- Moorland sites should reuse the same squares as previously used during overlap periods.
- If neither CBC nor BM has been used, sample at least one randomly selected 1 km square from all available squares.

## Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, establish two parallel transects (north-south or east-west), each 1 km long.
- Transects should be 500 m apart and 250 m from the square edge; each transect divided into five 200 m sections (ten sections total).
- Start of each section marked with permanent or visible markers; route to avoid barriers if needed, provided the two lines remain at least 200 m apart.
- Exact transect route is recorded; the same route is followed every year.
- Minor deviations into adjacent squares are acceptable if necessary.

## Habitat recording
- Record habitat features at the start of each recording year for every 200 m section, considering habitats within 25 m of either side of the transect.
- Use a habitat coding scheme to describe the predominant habitat (first habitat) and a second habitat if present; assign codes from hierarchical levels (1–4) across levels 1–4.
- If the actual transect deviates from the ideal two parallel lines, estimate the average distance from the ideal and also record an additional list of habitat codes for the ideal transect.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain’s lowlands, conduct two visits during the main breeding season (roughly 1 April to 30 June): early (early April to mid-May) and late (mid-May to late June).
- Visits should be at least four weeks apart; times should align with resident breeding bird activity and be later for northern/high-altitude sites.
- Field counts are best conducted in the morning (ideally 0600–0700 BST, no later than 0900) with a consistent start time within and across years.
- Avoid counting in heavy rain, poor visibility, or strong wind; weather is recorded on the forms.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds seen or heard along the two transects.
- First transect (sections 1–5) is walked, start time recorded; after completion, note time, then proceed to second transect (sections 6–10) and record time and birds.
- An average visit takes about 90 minutes.
- Observe while walking: listen for songs and scan for flying birds.
- Record birds into four distance categories relative to the transect line:
  - 1: within 25 m of the line
  - 2: 25–100 m from the line
  - 3: more than 100 m from the line (including birds outside the square)
  - F: birds in flight (any distance)
- Distances are estimated perpendicularly to the line; estimate 25 m and 100 m distances accurately.
- Do not double-count the same individual; use standard BTO species codes and distinguish juveniles where possible.
- For dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls), transect counts may be inadequate; count or estimate nests for the whole 1 km square separately and outside transects for these species.
- After each field visit, prepare summaries of adult birds by species within each distance band and transect section.

## Colony counts
- Conduct separate colony counts for species with dense nesting (rooks, sand martins, gulls) rather than relying solely on transect data.

## Recording forms and data transfer
- Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field forms are available from the Census Unit of BTO; CBC outlines maps are typically prepared by the BTO.
- A field recording form for moorland birds is available from the ECN Census and Coordination Unit (CCU).
- Data are recorded on field forms and later transferred to ECN dataset formats via ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation (restricted access on the Site Managers’ extranet). Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Key identifying and timing variables must be included for each sampling location:
  - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code
  - Sampling Date/time (with time element where sampling is more frequent than daily)
- For Breeding Birds (BB):
  - Year, County, 1 km square code
  - Transect section, Habitats (codes)
  - Visit (Sampling) date, Visit code
  - Weather, Start time, Finish time
  - Species seen, Distance category (from transect)
  - Bird activity, Units (BTO codes)
  - National Grid reference (numeric), BTO codes for species, activity, habitat, weather, and distance (as specified in BTO p.177–181)
  - Early vs late season designation (E/L)
- The data specification emphasizes consistent coding (BTO codes) and standardized distance and habitat classifications to ensure compatibility with ECN dataset formats.

## Notes and references
- BTO species codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories are described in the BTO documentation (pages referenced in the protocol).
- Field recording forms and location-specific data handling guidelines are specified by BTO and ECNCCU for data transfer and formatting.
