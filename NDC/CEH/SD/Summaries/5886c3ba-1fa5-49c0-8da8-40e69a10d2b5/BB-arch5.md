# BB Protocol

## Aim
- Record annual distribution and abundance of breeding birds within selected ECN sites as part of the Integrated Population Monitoring Programme.
- Provide information on year-to-year and longer-term population changes across habitats in the UK.
- Improve sampling representativeness by random site selection, increasing site numbers, using counts instead of territory mapping, and reducing per-site effort.

## Location
- For sites previously surveyed with CBC, use at least one 1 km square (preferably more) selected at random from squares containing part of the former area; for moorland sites, use the same squares as previously used; if neither BC nor BM used before, sample at least one 1 km square at random from all available squares.
- The exact route and transect placement are documented; same squares and routes are used across years where possible.

## Transect establishment
- In each 1 km square, ideally two parallel transect lines (1 km long) oriented north/south or east/west.
- Transects are 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge; each transect divided into five 200 m sections (total of ten sections).
- Start of each section marked with permanent landmarks or visible markers; routes may deviate to avoid barriers but must keep transects at least 200 m apart.
- The recorded route is mapped, and the same route is followed every year.

## Habitat recording
- Habitat features recorded at the start of each recording year for each 200 m section, considering habitats within 25 m of each transect side.
- Use codes to describe predominant habitats (first habitat) and, if present, a second habitat; select habitat codes from levels 1–4.
- If the transect route differs from the ideal two parallel lines, estimate the average distance deviation and record an additional list for the ideal transect.

## Frequency and timing
- In southern Britain, two visits per year during the main breeding season: early (April to mid-May) and late (mid-May to late June), with visits at least four weeks apart.
- Visits timed to coincide with resident and migrant breeding activity; adjust timing for northern or higher altitude sites.
- Countings conducted in mornings (preferably 06:00–07:00 BST, no later than 09:00) with consistent start times within a season and between years.
- Weather conditions (rain, visibility, wind) noted; sampling not conducted in adverse conditions.

## Bird recording
- Record all birds seen or heard while walking the two transects, categorising by distance from the transect line: within 25 m (1), 25–100 m (2), more than 100 m or beyond square (3), or birds in flight (F).
- Distance estimates are made perpendicular to the line; avoid double counting of individuals.
- Use standard BTO species codes; distinguish juveniles from adults where possible.
- For birds nesting in dense colonies (rook, sand martin, gulls), count nests in the whole 1 km square separately from transect counts.
- After each field visit, prepare summaries of the number of adult birds by species in each distance band for each transect section.

## Recording forms
- Standard CBC summary sheets and BBS field recording forms available from the Census Unit of the BTO; CBC maps are normally prepared from observer maps by the BTO.
- Moorland bird field recording form available from the ECN CCU.

## Notes
- BTO codes, bird activity mappings, county codes, habitat codes, weather codes, and distance categories are documented in related reference pages (p177–p181).

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Core data variables required for each sampling occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (unique ECN Site code)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time element when sampling is more frequent than daily)
- For Breeding Birds (BB):
  - Two annual visits to transects within 1 km squares (early and late)
  - Data captured on transect by species, distance category, activity, weather, times, and site codes
  - Use of 4-character National Grid reference codes and BTO-specific codes for activities, distances, and weather
  - Records include start/finish times, visit codes, and habitat data per section

## Author Reference
- BB Protocol
- Breeding birds (BB) data collection and recording conventions are defined by J.M. Sykes (BTO, 1995)
- Data transfer and ECN dataset formats are referenced to ECNCCU documentation (restricted access via extranet)

## Data governance and stewardship perspective (Data Stewards)
- Emphasizes standardized data structures with unique identifiers (Site ID, Core Measurement Code, Location Code) and precise temporal markers (sampling date/time) to enable reliable discovery and reuse.
- Uses formal coding schemes (BTO codes for species, habitats, weather, distance categories) to ensure consistency across observers and years.
- Requires explicit metadata and data transfer documentation to ECNCCU, including dataset formats and field definitions, enabling interoperability and long-term accessibility.
- Supports data quality through:
  - documented transect routes and fixed yearly protocols to enable comparability
  - standardized habitat recording with levels and codes
  - clear rules for counting (e.g., distances, timing, weather constraints, colony counts)
- Highlights governance considerations such as embargo or restricted access for restricted ECNCCU data, and the need for updated forms and mapping materials (CBC/BBS forms, habitat codes, weather codes) to maintain data integrity.
- Identifies potential operational risks for data stewards:
  - deviations from ideal transect routes and incomplete habitat coding
  - reliance on observer judgment for distance estimation and species identification
  - ensuring timeliness of data submission and consistency across years and sites
- Recommends robust data management practices:
  - maintainable data transfer processes, with clear documentation and access controls
  - ongoing alignment with ECNCCU data specifications and extranet access for site managers
  - proactive data quality checks and metadata enrichment to support discovery and future reuse
