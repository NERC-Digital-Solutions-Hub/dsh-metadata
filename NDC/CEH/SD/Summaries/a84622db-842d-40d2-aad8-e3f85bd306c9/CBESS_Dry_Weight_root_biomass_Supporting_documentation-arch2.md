# Dry weight root biomass from three soil depths on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Aim and scope
- Quantifies root biomass (kg dry weight per m^2) for three soil depth intervals: 0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, and 20–30 cm.
- Covers six saltmarsh sites across Essex and Morecambe Bay; Winter and Summer 2013, with an additional Essex winter sampling in March 2013.
- Part of the CBESS field campaign; provides standardized data for environmental monitoring and policy performance assessment.

## Location and sampling design
- Sites:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP)
- Coordinates are provided for each site.
- Habitat and soil context: saltmarsh with contrasting soil types (Essex clay vs. Morecambe Bay sandy soils); broad differences in inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Site area: rectangular saltmarsh regions between 400 x 500 m and 1000 x 1000 m, spanning low, mid, and high marsh zones.
- Quadrat design: 22 x 1 x 1 m quadrats per site; quadrats randomly allocated within site rectangles.
- Spatial scales: A = 1 quadrat, B = 3 quadrats (1–10 m apart), C = 6 quadrats (10–100 m apart) (plus references to additional scale metadata).
- Sampling periods: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter sampling conducted 2–6 March 2013.

## Methods and data handling
- Core sampling: one large sediment core (16 cm diameter, 30 cm depth) per quadrat, including soil, roots, and vegetation.
- Processing: roots eroded in a recirculating flume, dried at 60°C for 72 hours, weighed to determine dry weight.
- Data calculation: convert to kg DW per m^2; total root biomass for 0–30 cm is the sum across the three depth intervals.
- Data storage and access: stored as comma-separated values (CSV) and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Variables and data structure
- Primary variables: RB_0-10 (0–10 cm), RB_10-20 (10–20 cm), RB_0-30 (total 0–30 cm) root biomass, all in kg DW m^-2.
- Metadata fields: Season (Winter/Summer), Location (M = Morecambe, E = Essex), Site (AH, FW, TM, CS, WS, WP), Habitat (Saltmarsh; Mudflat listed as a potential category), Quadrat Number (1–22), Scale (A/B/C; definitions provided).
- Data records: include Row Number for sorting; some fields indicate possible missing data (blank cells).
- Quality control: readings entered into spreadsheets with outlier checks; no statistical treatments applied to the data.

## Calibration, statistics, and formats
- Calibration: scales calibrated according to laboratory protocols where applicable.
- Statistics: no statistical treatment applied to the raw observations.
- File formats: CSV; includes headers and field descriptions for data interpretation.

## Supplementary notes
- Site grazing context: Essex sites heavily grazed by geese; Morecambe Bay sites heavily grazed by sheep with geese presence; West Plain lightly grazed—useful for interpreting biomass variation.
