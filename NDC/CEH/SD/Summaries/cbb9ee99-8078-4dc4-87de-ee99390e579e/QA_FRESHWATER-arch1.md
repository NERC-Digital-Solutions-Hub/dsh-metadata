# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- This report documents the freshwater QA component of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) and assesses the uncertainty in field data for streams and ponds, to establish a baseline for future surveys and inform training and protocols.

## Aim and scope
- Ensure high-quality, repeatable freshwater data across Great Britain.
- Quantify uncertainty and inter-surveyor variability in field observations and derived measures.
- Provide baseline against which future CS freshwater data can be judged.
- Highlight data quality issues and guide improvements in training, protocols, and data handling.

## Field survey methods (QA sampling design)
- Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares; re-sampling by an experienced CEH biologist.
- Stream re-survey: 8% of CS2007 stream sites; pond re-survey: 7% of CS2007 pond sites (18 of 31 squares contained ponds).
- Aquatic plants (streams): 30 of 31 sites re-surveyed at the same 100 m reach; relocation aided by photographs, grid refs, maps; data recorded with IRIS on Tablet PC.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS): 31 sites re-surveyed at the same 500 m reach; relocation using photographs, grid refs, maps; data captured with RAPID on Tablet PC; features recorded across 10 transects plus overall reach assessment.
- Aquatic macroinvertebrates: 30 of 31 stream sites re-surveyed; sampling and processing per standard CEH protocols; results pending (to be reported with main Freshwaters Report late 2009).
- Hydrochemistry: 30 of 31 streams sampled for phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity; on-site pH and conductivity measured.
- Ponds (plants and hydrochemistry): 18 ponds re-surveyed for aquatic plants; 15 ponds sampled for hydrochemistry.

## Aquatic plants (streams) – QA findings
- Data validation showed taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial species.
- Bias detected: main CS2007 survey tended to record fewer taxa than QA (significant bias, P < 0.001).
- Mean taxon list agreement between CS2007 and QA: 31% across 29 sites; 100% agreement only when few taxa were found.
- Main reasons for discrepancies: misidentifications, inadequate searching, slight differences in 100 m reach location, seasonal changes, vegetation cutting, and defining survey boundaries.
- Most missed taxa were rare (<1% cover); over 60% of errors due to taxa overlooked by the main surveyor; 15% due to misidentification.
- Commonly missed taxa: liverworts (Pelia sp.), moss (Rhynchostegium riparioides), marginal grass (Agrostis stolonifera), and certain algae (Cladophora, Vaucheria).
- MTR (multiplicative tolerance/score) difference: QA surveys tended to score 5.6 points higher on average (not statistically significant, wide CI).
- Conclusion: plant surveys are inherently difficult to repeat; the QA provides a baseline for improving field protocols and targeted training; assume CS2000 bias similar to CS2007, so no adjustment to CS2007 results is applied.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS) – QA findings
- Concordance for counts of bridges and culverts: 70% of sites showed no difference; small discrepancies at some sites likely due to slight stretch relocation.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) scores: QA survey consistently produced lower HQA scores; QA vs CS differences ranged, with overall classic bias where CS tended to score higher by about 6.9 units on average (P < 0.001).
- Discrepancies largely driven by subjective judgments of bank-face and bank-top vegetation, particularly in upland moorland where classification differed (Simple vs Uniform).
- No QA data for CS2000; thus both CS2000 and CS2007 are treated as equally biased for change-detection purposes; CS2007 RHS data can be used with caution and without formal correction.
- Conclusion: RHS results show substantial interpretation variability; highlights the need for clearer vegetation classification guidance and alignment of survey stretch relocation.

## Hydrochemistry – QA findings
- Parameters show substantial natural temporal variability; nonetheless, rank correlations indicate repeatability between main and QA data:
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.89)
  - Total oxidised nitrogen (TON) (r = 0.79)
  - Alkalinity (r = 0.97)
  - pH (r = 0.74)
  - Conductivity (r = 0.97)
- TON showed some disagreement between main and QA for two ponds with a two-month gap between visits, underscoring the importance of keeping QA and main surveys close in time.

## Wetland plants (ponds) – QA findings
- 16 ponds surveyed by both main and QA; 59% mean taxon agreement; no significant overall bias (main surveys found 0.6 more taxa on average, P > 0.214).
- 36 taxa missed in total, with 29 missed only once; misses spread across many plant groups, though grasses/sedges/rushes dominated misses.
- Most frequently missed taxa: grasses/rushes (e.g., Juncus effusus, Agrostis stolonifera) and small-leaved submerged aquatics.
- Implication: training should emphasize identification of bryophytes and inconspicuous grass-like species; boundary definition and seasonal timing also affect results.

## Discussion: uncertainty and implications for practice
- Environmental measurements carry inherent uncertainty: temporal, spatial, and inter-surveyor variability all contribute.
- CS2007 QA provides an initial estimate of freshwater data variability to inform training, protocol refinement, and capability to detect change.
- Temporal mismatch between main and QA surveys complicates isolation of inter-surveyor error from temporal changes.
- Subjective elements (e.g., RHS vegetation classification) contribute to variability; objective counts (bridges/culverts) are more repeatable but still show discrepancies.
- The QA results guide targeted improvements:
  - Improved identification skills for bryophytes and algae; better recognition of inconspicuous grasses
  - Emphasis on returning to exactly the same survey stretch
  - Strengthened RHS training for subjective components
  - Conduct QA within two weeks of the main survey in the same site when possible

## Limitations and caveats
- Macroinvertebrate QA results are not yet reported; CODA pending (CS Freshwaters Report late 2009).
- No QA data for CS2000; assumption of similar bias used for change interpretation.
- Temporal gaps between main and QA surveys reduce the ability to fully attribute differences to inter-surveyor effects.

## Conclusions and recommendations for future surveys
- CS2007 freshwater QA establishes a baseline understanding of data uncertainty and survey repeatability across plant, RHS, hydrochemistry, and pond components.
- Overall data quality is generally suitable for analysis, but notable biases and higher variability in plant and RHS data indicate areas for improvement.
- Key recommendations:
  - Enhance training focusing on bryophytes, algae, and difficult grasses/rushes; improve plant search thoroughness and boundary definition.
  - Improve guidance and consistency for classifying bank vegetation in RHS to reduce subjective variability, especially in upland/moorland areas.
  - Maintain close temporal proximity between main and QA surveys, ideally within two weeks, to minimize temporal effects.
  - Continue QA across all components (including macroinvertebrates) and document QA findings to refine protocols for future CS cycles.
  - Use QA findings to build more robust change-detection capabilities and to target protocol adjustments and field staff training for subsequent surveys.
