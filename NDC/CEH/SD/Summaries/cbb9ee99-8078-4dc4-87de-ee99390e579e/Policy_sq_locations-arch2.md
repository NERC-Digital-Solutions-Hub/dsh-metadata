# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public-interest environmental monitoring.
- Minimise risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Preserve scientific integrity of sampling and future surveying permissions.
- Confidentiality supports continued environmental monitoring and policy relevance.

## When locations may be released and precision levels
- Four-digit (10x10 km grid) references may be released under licence to indicate general location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Precise six-digit grid references are only allowed in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality considerations and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or outputs should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan or conduct visits to CS squares or to assess individual landowners’ compliance.
- For potential licensees, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
- Four-digit releases have similar licence terms but do not require the same IP confidentiality standard as six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempting to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) makes decisions on exceptional releases according to policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences signed by authorized representatives.
- If release is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing data-access applications, decisions, and rationales.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; requests from non-partner organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific guidance or collaborative support as appropriate (negotiated per case).
