# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Scope and purpose
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.
- Aim: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity; protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released
- Approximate location (which predetermined areas squares fall into) can be shared; four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid.
- Very exceptional circumstances may allow six-digit grid references under licence, only if the requester proves legally that their data/models require equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are treated with the same exceptional access criteria as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licensing)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project purpose.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- End-of-period: licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; user must not use data to locate CS squares or to verify landowner locations.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have license terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; both forms prohibit attempts to derive exact square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- CEH reports annually to CS partners on licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH provides pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes to CS partners; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to define requirements and ensure appropriate use; collaboration or payment may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data governance
- Emphasises data minimisation, controlled access, and project-specific licensing to balance data utility with confidentiality.
- Requires clear documentation of licence terms, secure handling, and promised destruction or return of data after project completion.
- Aligns with broader data stewardship goals: transparent governance, responsible sharing, and safeguarding sensitive location information while enabling legitimate research and policy use.
