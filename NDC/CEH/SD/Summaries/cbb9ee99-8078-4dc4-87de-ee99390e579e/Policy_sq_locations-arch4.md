# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Current CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
  - Defra
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - NIEA
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
  - Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permissions.
  - Public-interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Release conditions and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to show approximate location within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references (precise) require pre-processing by CEH if possible; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may exact locations be released under licence, with stringent IP/confidentiality parity considerations.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) can also reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.

- Specific licence conditions
  - Confidentiality must be preserved; data stored securely; access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
  - End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; if in doubt, consult CEH.
  - Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares or to check compliance by landowners.
  - Licence applicants may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; a clause prohibits attempts to derive precise locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences must be signed by an authorized senior official.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report summarising applications, decisions, and grounds for decisions.
  - CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be direct or advisory, with potential negotiation depending on effort and arrangements.
