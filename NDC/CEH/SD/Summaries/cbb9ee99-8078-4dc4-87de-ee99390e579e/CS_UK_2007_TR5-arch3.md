# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and context
  - Part of Countryside Survey 2007 aiming to monitor environmental health to scrutinise and inform policy decisions.
  - Focuses on headwater streams across GB, integrating macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, hydromorphology, and water chemistry into a coherent survey framework.
  - Builds on CS1990/CS2000 experiences, with standardized methods to enable cross-square comparability and long-term trends.

- Key surveying elements and scope
  - Headwater sampling covers 425 CS2000 squares; a 500 m watercourse length is the focus for RHS and macroinvertebrate sampling.
  - In 425 squares, macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, hydromorphological status (RHS), and water chemistry are collected.
  - In 629 squares containing ponds, a randomly selected pond per square is surveyed for aquatic plants, physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
  - Pond condition surveying is integrated into CS2007 as a national freshwater component, with pond mapping and baseline physical attributes.

- Study design and methodology
  - 2-person survey teams with defined roles A and B; clear sequence of tasks to maximise efficiency and data quality.
  - Field protocols emphasize representative sampling across habitats, proportional sampling effort, and avoidance of spates or unsafe conditions.
  - Nested sampling approach ensures consistency with historic CS datasets while enabling RHS/RIVPACS compatibility.

- Data collection and digital data capture
  - On-site data entry to reduce transcription errors and improve data governance:
    - RIVPACS: macroinvertebrate sampling data captured on RIVPACS Sample Area Form (paper forms and on-site entry).
    - RHS: River Habitat Survey data entered with the RAPID field digital data-entry system (Tablet PC); built-in validation and data checks.
    - Macrophyte survey: aquatic plant data captured with IRIS (field data entry system) linked to species lists and abundance categories; supports specimen handling and lab confirmation workflow.
  - All data undergo on-site validation before leaving the site (RAPID and IRIS check data features).

- Macroinvertebrate sampling details
  - Primary objective: maximize taxa collected within a continuous 5–15 m sampling area, using a standard pond-net (900 µm) with three-minute kick sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
  - Sampling extended to reflect habitat proportionality; kill/fixation uses 40% formalin to achieve approximately 4% solution in samples.
  - Manual search components included to capture surface dwellers and organisms in habitats not easily sampled by netting.
  - Sample handling and labeling protocols emphasize avoiding cross-contamination and maintaining chain-of-custody (multiple bags/pots; formalin volumes; labeling).
  - Environmental data collected in tandem (width, depth, velocity, substrate, vegetation, and habitat types) using standardized RIVPACS forms.
  - Guidance on non-sampling conditions (e.g., unsafe sites, very deep channels) with documented alternatives.

- Water chemistry and field measurements
  - Indicative chemical sample collected at downstream end of the macroinvertebrate area; parameters include pH and conductivity (field meters) and SRP, TON, and alkalinity via filtered samples (50 ml bottles) with on-site filtration.
  - Detailed on-site filtration protocol using disposable syringe filters; sample labeling and submission to CEH for lab analysis.
  - Use of Hanna Combi meter for pH and conductivity with calibration guidance; strict calibration and rinsing procedures.

- Habitat, substrate, and hydromorphology data
  - RHS-based hydromorphology assessment conducted over a 500 m reach; data captured via RAPID with site relocation features and on-site validation.
  - Substrate content categorized into four size classes with percentage cover estimates across the full sampling length; bedrock and other habitats (filamentous algae, moss, higher plants) recorded.
  - Documentation of channel types (Pool, Run, Riffle, Slack) and channel shading, water clarity, and habitat features (trees, banks, artificial features) to support hydromorphology interpretation.
  - Sketch maps prepared for site relocation and future re-surveys; photographs required for macroinvertebrate sampling area, RHS reach, and aquatic plant surveys.

- Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR IRIS workflow)
  - Macrophyte/macroalgae survey uses the Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) framework; 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site is walked/waded to record presence and cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants.
  - Abundance estimates on a 9-point scale, with careful emphasis on small patches and rare taxa; careful lab identification for challenging taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Potamogeton, Callitriche) including field samples or lab confirmation.
  - Plant specimens may be sent for confirmation; detailed guidance provided on sampling, labeling, pressing, preserving (pickle), and returning to Pond Conservation.
  - IRIS data entry supports plant species lists, abundance, and physical site data; specimen management and “no plants” cases documented.

- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Ponds mapped per square; “survey pond” identified for macrophyte, environmental characteristics, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Comprehensive field protocol for pond boundary identification, area estimation, drawdown height, sediment/water depths, pond base composition, pollution assessment, inflows/outflows, and surrounding land use.
  - Documentation of pond management, grazing, waterbird use, fish/amphibian presence, and surrounding land-use categories in two distance zones (0-5 m and 0-100 m).
  - Photographic records and detailed field sheets accompany samples; robust transport and storage procedures for macroinvertebrate and plant specimens, including TREM transport cards and monthly courier schedules to CEH Dorset.

- Data governance, quality control, and training
  - All field personnel must hold recognized accreditation (Environment Agency RHS and RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling); routine team rotations to prevent drift.
  - Sample AUDITS: approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; on-site validation and mentorship during fieldwork.
  - Field survey checklists and data validation steps integrated across macroinvertebrate, RHS, and macrophyte surveys; on-site data validation to minimize omissions.

- Safety, logistics, and logistics documentation
  - Emphasis on safety in field conditions, especially for pond and headwater sampling; explicit health and safety checks for high-risk sites.
  - Transport and storage procedures for fixative and samples, including TREM cards and standardized packaging for courier to CEH Dorset.
  - Documentation and forms are designed to ensure traceability (CS square, pond code, GPS coordinates, dates, surveyors, and site notes).

- References and training materials
  - Field manuals and guidance on RHS (Environment Agency 2003), RIVPACS (Murray-Bligh; Raven et al. 1998), MTR (Holmes et al. 1999), and documented sampling protocols; lab confirmation guidance for challenging taxa.
  - Emphasis on standardized identification keys and specimen handling for rare or difficult taxa, with formal processes for expert confirmation.

- Overall objective for monitoring framework
  - The CS2007 Headwaters framework demonstrates a integrated, standardized monitoring approach that aligns biological (macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) and physical (hydromorphology) data with water quality measurements.
  - It emphasizes on-site data capture, rigorous QA, cross-system data compatibility (RIVPACS, RHS, MTR/IRIS), and robust pond surveying to build a coherent national environmental health picture to inform policy and future decisions.
