# Countryside Survey in 2007

- A national field survey program (CS2007) to systematically collect and integrate freshwater data across Great Britain, focusing on headwaters, ponds, macrophytes, and associated water quality and habitat data.
- Two main sampling components:
  - Headwaters: 425 squares re-surveyed; macronvertebrate (RIVPACS) sampling, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey), aquatic plant surveys, and water chemistry in 500 m headwater stretches plus a 100 m aquatic plant reach; RHS indices updated to the 2003 protocol.
  - Ponds: mapping of ponds within squares, selection of a survey pond per square, macrophyte surveys within pond boundaries, environmental data, and water chemistry; extensive field measurements of pond structure and surrounding land use.

- Primary data streams and associated data products:
  - Macroinvertebrates: RIVPACS-based sampling data and environment variables captured on site using RIVPACS Sample Area Forms.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): field data captured in RAPID (tablet-based MS Access database) for 500 m RHS reach; includes spot-checks, physical attributes, bank/top features, channel shape, shading, and water clarity.
  - Aquatic plants: macrophyte surveys recorded via IRIS (field data entry system) with species lists, abundance, and physical site data; plant specimens managed for lab confirmation.
  - Pond condition: separate CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets for water quality, environmental survey, and pond macrophyte surveys; includes turbidity estimates, drawdown height, sediment and pond base, inflows/outflows, pollution, and surrounding land use.

- Data collection scope and logistics:
  - Headwaters: 425 squares re-surveyed; 500 m RHS sampling length per site with a 100 m aquatic plant survey; 25 new headwater sites within a 425-square subset.
  - Ponds: survey pond selection in squares containing ponds; boundary and area mapping; 25 m2 to 2 ha pond size definition; comprehensive pond environmental and macrophyte data collected.

- Data collection methods and protocols:
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling:
    - A single continuous sampling area (5–15 m typical) sampled with a 25 cm2 pond-net (900 µm mesh) for three minutes plus a mandatory one-minute manual search.
    - Sampling proportional to habitat cover; avoid mixing distinct sampling points; manage net contents to avoid clogging; retain all specimens for lab identification (except large or easily identified species; some must be returned live).
    - Sample fixation and storage in 4% formaldehyde equivalent; thorough labelling with square number, site, date.
  - Water chemistry:
    - On-site field conductivity and pH with Hanna Combi meter; SRP, TON, and alkalinity via filtered on-site samples (0.45 µm filters) in 50 ml bottles; strict on-site filtration protocol.
    - Lab analyses coordinated with CEH (Lancaster) for downstream processing.
  - Habitat and environmental data:
    - RIVPACS sample area forms capture width, depth, velocity category, substrate, and habitat structure; environmental data collected to represent modal site conditions.
  - RHS (Hydromorphology):
    - 500 m RHS survey centered on macroinvertebrate site; data recorded via RAPID with 17 sections across 4 pages; data validation performed on-site before leaving.
    - 10 spot-checks plus a 500 m sweep-up with defined bank/top and channel attributes; includes artificial features, vegetation, bank profiles, and channel shading.
  - Macrophyte survey (MTR approach):
    - 100 m stretch (centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point) walked/waded; macrophyte species recorded with abundance categories; percentage cover estimates across submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent groups.
    - Specimens collected for lab confirmation where needed; heavy emphasis on accurate species identification, including rare/black-listed taxa; volunteer and expert guidance for difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Potamogeton, Callitriche).
  - IRIS data capture:
    - Aquatic plant data recorded in IRIS with species lists and cover categories; lab samples for difficult identifications; on-site validation and data checks.
  - Pond condition survey:
    - Pond boundary and mapping; drawdown height, water depth, sediment depth, and pond base composition; turbidity estimation; water chemistry sampling; inflows/outflows; pollution indicators; surrounding land use; amenity values.

- Data quality, validation, and governance:
  - On-site data validation with RAPID and IRIS to ensure completeness and internal consistency; error-by-error validation prompts to correct issues before leaving.
  - Field survey teams include trained RHS macroinvertebrate technicians; regular data audits (approx. 7% of headwater sites) by CEH staff.
  - Data management and transfer:
    - Macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens couriered to CEH Dorset as boxes fill; monthly dispatch cycles; use of Transport Emergency Card (TREM) for formaldehyde-containing samples.
    - Pond and plant specimens returned to Pond Conservation; strict labeling and sample tracking.
  - Data capture systems and workflow:
    - RAPID for RHS data (MS Access; Tablet PC); IRIS for aquatic plant data; RP forms designed to minimize data entry errors and enable real-time validation.
    - The RHS protocol adopts the Environment Agency 2003 version; data compatibility maintained with CS2000/1990 legacy data.

- Outputs and usage implications for data support:
  - Rich multi-layer datasets enabling hydromorphology, water chemistry, macroinvertebrate indicators, and macrophyte communities across headwaters and ponds.
  - Standardized field sheets and digital tools streamline data capture, validation, and relocation of survey sites for future monitoring.
  - Data products support ecological status assessments, pond and stream habitat characterization, and policy-relevant analyses for freshwater ecosystems in GB.

- Helpful notes for data management and reuse:
  - Ensure proper mapping identifiers: CS square, pond IDs, and exact GPS/NGR data for site relocation.
  - Maintain rigorous sample labeling conventions and chain-of-custody for lab analyses and specimen handling.
  Use of standardized taxonomic keys and identification protocols to minimize misidentification, with clear lab submission guidelines for uncertain taxa.
- Reference framework:
  - Foundations drawn from RIVPACS (macroinvertebrates), MTR (macrophytes), and RHS methodologies; data integration aligned with Environment Agency guidance and CEH practices.
