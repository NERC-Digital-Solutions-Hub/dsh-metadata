Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Overview
- Purpose: Assess QA aspects of the Countryside Survey 2007 freshwater module to provide high-quality information on small streams and ponds and their biological diversity across Great Britain.
- Commitment to data quality: Emphasizes trained field surveyors, accredited methods (River Habitat Survey), ISO 17025 for chemistry labs, taxonomic accreditation for macroinvertebrates, and repeated measurements to quantify uncertainty.
- Baseline function: Establishes a baseline QA framework for future CS freshwater surveys and informs improvements in field protocols and training.

## Methods and Data Collection
- Sampling design: Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares re-surveyed by an experienced CEH biologist to assess repeatability.
- Sites and effort: 31 squares re-surveyed for streams; 18 contained ponds re-surveyed; re-survey effort ~8% for streams and 7% for ponds.
- Aquatic plants (streams):
  - Re-location: 100 m survey stretch re-located using photographs, grid refs, and maps; data recorded with IRIS on Tablet PC.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS):
  - Re-location: 500 m stretch re-located using photographs, grid refs, maps; data captured with RAPID on Tablet PC; features recorded across 10 transects.
- Aquatic macroinvertebrates:
  - Standard sampling protocols followed at the same locations; samples processed by CEH River Communities Group.
- Hydrochemistry:
  - On-site: pH and conductivity; laboratory analysis (phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity) at CEH.
- Ponds (wetland plants and chemistry):
  - 18 ponds re-surveyed with standard pond protocols; on-site water chemistry measured; laboratory analyses as for streams.
- Data processing and validation:
  - Aquatic plant data: taxonomic standardisation; removal of terrestrial species; taxa lists compared between CS2007 and QA surveys.
  - QA data used to assess agreement and biases relative to main CS2007 survey.

## Key Findings

### Aquatic Plants (streams and ponds)
- Streams (aquatic plants):
  - 30/31 sites re-surveyed; 1 site dry during QA.
  - Major issue: significant bias where main survey recorded fewer taxa than QA (main tended to miss taxa compared to QA).
  - Mean agreement across 29 sites: 31% (taxa recorded by both surveys); 100% agreement only when only one species present in both surveys.
  - Commonly missed taxa included bryophytes, certain mosses, marginal grasses/sedges, and some algae.
  - Result: QA tended to yield higher taxa counts and MTR scores, reflecting difficulty in repeatability and identification rather than data being uniformly biased.
  - Implication: Plant surveys are highly sensitive to exact stretch location, search thoroughness, and seasonal/temporal changes.
- Ponds (wetland plants):
  - 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA; mean agreement 59%; no significant bias (main found ~0.6 more taxa on average).
  - 36 taxa missed across surveys (mostly rare or hard-to-detect groups like grasses/sedges/rushes and submerged plants); seven taxa missed at more than one site, notably certain grasses and rushes.
  - Implication: First CS pond plant dataset; QA provides baseline for future pond surveys and highlights training needs for challenging plant groups.

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges or culverts between CS and QA.
- Some discrepancies: ±1 for bridges or culverts at a subset of sites, likely due to slight relocation differences.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA):
  - QA survey generally produced slightly lower HQA scores than main CS surveys; average difference around -6.9 units (main higher).
  - Variability largely due to subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation, especially in upland moorland areas where vegetation types were variably interpreted.
  - No single feature dominated HQA; discrepancies linked to interpretation rather than measurement of discrete features.
- Implication: RHS measurements show subjective elements; training can reduce variability in HQA scoring, particularly vegetation classification.

### Hydrochemistry
- Rankings (across 31 sites) were highly correlated between QA and main surveys for all measured parameters:
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus: r = 0.89
  - Total oxidised nitrogen: r = 0.79
  - Alkalinity: r = 0.97
  - pH: r = 0.74
  - Conductivity: r = 0.97
- Wetland ponds: Similar correlations for most parameters, though TON showed weaker correlation (r = 0.47) and variability between two ponds with a two-month gap between surveys.
- Implication: Field and lab procedures for hydrochemistry are consistently applied; strong repeatability supports reliability of chemical measurements.

## Data Quality and Uncertainty
- Overall uncertainty: Inherent in environmental measurements; QA provides a baseline to quantify inter-surveyor variability and inform training and protocol refinement.
- Sources of error:
  - Spatial: precise location of survey stretch and survey boundaries.
  - Temporal: natural changes and disturbances between main and QA surveys; timing differences reduce comparability, especially for plants.
  - Inter-surveyor competence: thoroughness of search, taxonomic identification, and subjective judgments (notably RHS vegetation classification).
- Timing considerations: Many QA surveys occurred weeks after the main survey, limiting ability to attribute differences solely to surveyor performance.
- Key takeaway: Difficult to partition total variation into components, but QA highlights areas most prone to misinterpretation and variability (notably aquatic plants and RHS vegetation assessments).

## Implications for Data Stewardship
- Data provenance and standards:
  - Documentation of training, accreditation, and QA procedures to support data credibility and reproducibility.
  - Clear metadata about surveyors, dates, and exact stretches/location for re-survey events.
- Data quality controls:
  - Taxonomic validation and explicit handling of uncertain identifications, especially for bryophytes, algae, and grass-like taxa.
  - Standardized protocols for locating survey stretches and defining lateral boundaries.
  - Timeliness requirements to minimize temporal error (target QA within two weeks of main survey).
- Data interoperability and sharing:
  - Use of consistent digital data entry systems (IRIS, RAPID) and tablets to standardize data capture.
  - QA data serve as a baseline for future comparisons and change detection.
  - Documentation of limitations and biases to accompany datasets when shared.
- Training and protocol refinement:
  - Enhanced emphasis on difficult taxa (bryophytes, algae, rare grasses) and exact relocation of survey stretches.
  - Increased awareness of subjective elements in RHS scoring and how to minimize variability.
- Governance outcomes:
  - CS2007 QA establishes a defensible baseline for subsequent CS freshwater surveys.
  - Highlights need for streamlined QA timing and targeted training to improve data quality and comparability.

## Recommendations and Next Steps
- Training enhancements:
  - Focus on aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
  - Improve relocation accuracy and adherence to exact survey stretches.
  - Strengthen RHS training for consistent bank vegetation classification, especially in upland/moorland areas.
- Timing and workflow improvements:
  - Conduct QA at the site within two weeks of the main survey to minimize temporal differences.
  - Where possible, align QA and main surveys temporally to improve comparability.
- Data handling and documentation:
  - Maintain thorough metadata on survey method changes and boundary definitions.
  - Continue validation and standardisation of plant data, clearly documenting taxa lists and any taxonomic ambiguities.
- Future QA focus:
  - Macroinvertebrate QA results to be reported in the Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) to complete the QA picture.
  - Use QA findings to refine field protocols and targeted training for the next CS freshwater survey cycle.
