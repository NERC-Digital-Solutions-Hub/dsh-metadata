# HEADWATERS

- Objective: use data-driven analysis to identify patterns across headwater streams and ponds, integrate macroinvertebrate, plant, hydromorphological, and chemical data, and support longitudinal comparisons and predictions.
- Context: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) headwaters component builds on CS2000 baselines; aims to survey headwater streams across GB and integrate pond condition assessments within CS squares.

## Scope and design

- CS2007 headwaters: re-survey all 425 CS2000 freshwater squares; include macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, physical characteristics, and indicative water chemistry.
- Pond component: in CS2007, survey a randomly selected pond in each CS2007 square that contains ponds (approximately 629 squares); conduct aquatic plant and physical/chemical assessments within the pond.
- Sectioned layout: sampling areas centered on the macroinvertebrate sites, with standardized reach lengths (500 m for headwaters RHS; 100 m aquatic plant survey around macroinvertebrate point).

## Data collection and sources

- Macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS)
  - Objective: maximize taxa variety in a single continuous sampling area (typically 5–15 m wide, 3 minutes of active sampling plus 1 minute manual search).
  - Method: standard pond-net (900 μm mesh), proportional habitat sampling, thorough net clearing, avoid deep or unsafe sites, no transfer of fish; curation of large or rare taxa in situ.
  - Data captured: macroinvertebrate taxa, RIVPACS environmental variables (width, depth, velocity category, substrate, altitude, distance from source, slope), site environmental data, and photography for relocation.
  - Documentation: RIVPACS Sample Area Form with fields for square, river, site, date, NGR, samplers, sample method, sampling time, substrate, and vegetation cover.
- Water chemistry (headwaters)
  - On-site measurements: conductivity and pH (via Hanna Combi meter), field-calibrated before each square.
  - Chemical analysis (samples): SRP, TON, and alkalinity using on-site filtered water (0.45 μm filters) and 50 mL bottles; lab guidance sheets accompany samples.
  - Procedures: water sampling from downstream end of macroinvertebrate area; strict labeling and on-site filtration protocol; avoidance of near inflows.
- Hydromorphology (RHS)
  - Protocol: 2003 RHS field method; field data captured digitally via RAPID (tablet-based).
  - 500 m RHS reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site; includes spot-checks, vegetation, substrates, and cross-sections; data validated on-site with RAPID.
  - Data capture: 17 sections across 4 pages in RAPID; spot-checks with tabbed interfaces; validation checks ensure completeness before leaving site.
- Aquatic macrophytes (MTR/IRIS)
  - Survey: 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate site; record presence and percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes.
  - Techniques: wading where safe; grapnel use for submerged plants; systematic, repeatable percent-cover estimates with species lists; specimen collection for laboratory confirmation when needed.
  - Data entry: IRIS field data entry system (two-page form) with drop-down fields and on-site validation; specimens may be sent for lab confirmation; include sampling notes and photographic evidence.
- Pond condition survey (CS2007)
  - Mapping: mappers identify all ponds in the square and designate a survey pond; pond is defined as 25 m2 to 2 ha, usually water-filled for at least 4 months.
  - Survey steps: photograph pond with square number, map outer boundary, sketch outline, estimate area, measure drawdown height, estimate water present, assess sediment and pond base, pollution, inflows/outflows, and pond management.
  - Additional data: surrounding land use, amenity value, wildlife use (waterbirds, fish, amphibians), and pond morphology.
  - Macrophyte survey: perform within pond boundary; record all species to as high taxonomic resolution as feasible; categorize abundance (dominant, abundant, frequent, occasional, rare); record submerged, floating-leaved, emergent covers; note overhanging trees.
  - Lab and specimen handling: preservation and labeling guidelines; rare species confirmation procedures; forwarding of specimens to Pond Conservation; reporting procedures for damaged or uncertain identifications.
- Data handling and quality control
  - On-site validation: RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant survey) include built-in validation; data are checked and corrected before leaving the site.
  - Training and auditing: CEH staff training, periodic audits of a subset of headwater sites, and routine field team rotations to maintain consistency.
  - Transport and storage: formaldehyde-based fixatives for macroinvertebrates; transport with TREM cards; secure packaging; monthly dispatch to CEH Dorset; organized cataloguing and storage at CEH bases.

## Equipment and logistics

- Headwaters field gear: safety items, field maps, GPS, A4 lab notebooks, clipboards, protective clothing, wading/ safety gear, pond nets (25 cm) with 900 μm mesh, sampling bottles (1 L and 50 mL), filters, formalin fixative, labeled sample pots, and transport materials.
- Data systems
  - RAPID: RHS data capture (MS Access, Tablet PC) for on-site RHS survey data; includes data validation, square selection, and manual notes.
  - IRIS: aquatic plant data capture (MS Access); supports species lists, percent cover, specimen labeling, and lab specimen tracking.
  - RIVPACS Sample Area Form: macroinvertebrate sampling and environmental data, including site coordinates, sample time, substrate, and habitat data.
  - Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets: structured paper forms for water quality, environmental survey, pond macrophytes, and pond details; later digitized and summarized.
- Lab and transport
  - Macroinvertebrate samples fixed in 4% formaldehyde; transported in labeled pots; TREM card with hazard details; specimens couriered to CEH Dorset in batches (6–8 pots per box).
  - Plant specimens to be identified by experts or laboratory-confirmed; press and preserve in accordance with labelling and packaging guidelines.

## Practical workflow and interpretation

- Timing and sequencing
  - Headwaters: 500 m RHS reach; sampling sequence designed to optimize data capture for macroinvertebrates, plants, and water chemistry in the same field window.
  - Plant surveys: 100 m MTR reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; wading or grappling as conditions permit; careful documentation of patches and microhabitats.
- Relocation and relocation aids
  - Photographs, marker boards, and detailed sketch maps are used to relocate sites in future CS cycles.
- Data integrity and discoverability
  - Data are uploaded with metadata to accessible portals; datasets are traced back to square numbers, pond IDs, and sampling dates; on-site validation reduces transfer errors.

## Challenges and considerations

- Data gaps and scale: local-level data or missing data can affect cross-square analyses; field-level uncertainties addressed through standardized procedures and cross-checks.
- Standardization across datasets: harmonizing RIVPACS, RHS, MTR, and pond data requires consistent taxonomic references, measurement protocols, and data schemas.
- Safety and accessibility: sampling in headwater streams may involve safety risks; sampling protocols include risk assessment and conservative management in high-risk circumstances.
