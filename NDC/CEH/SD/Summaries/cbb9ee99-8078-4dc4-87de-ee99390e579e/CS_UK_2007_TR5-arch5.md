# Countryside Survey in 2007

## Overview and Aims
- National freshwater survey integrating headwater streams and pond condition assessments (CS2007).
- Coverage: re-survey of 425 CS2000 headwater squares; pond surveys in 629 squares containing ponds; headwater elements include macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey), physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
- Pond assessments include macrophyte surveys, environmental characteristics, water chemistry, and pond condition documentation.
- Purpose for data stewards: ensure standardized data collection, governance, metadata, storage, sharing, and up-to-date datasets for discovery and reuse.

## Data Collection Framework and Systems
- Headwaters components and methods
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS): standardized three-minute pond-net kick sampling plus a one-minute manual search; subsequent environmental data collection (RIVPACS Site Environmental Data) and sample area forms (RIVPACS Sample Area Form).
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m headwater reach surveyed; hydromorphological and habitat data collected; data entered in the field via RAPID, a tablet-based MS Access system.
  - Aquatic plant survey (MTR method): 100 m reach around macroinvertebrate site; record macrophyte and bryophyte species presence and cover; sample collection and lab confirmation for difficult taxa; data integrated via IRIS (plant data entry).
  - Water chemistry: on-site measurement of pH and conductivity; filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; detailed sample labeling and submission (CS2007 Water Sample Information Sheet).
- Ponds
  - Pond condition survey follows mapping (CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet) to identify survey pond and boundary; macroinvertebrate, hydromorphology, macrophyte, and water chemistry data collected for the survey pond.
  - Documentation includes pond boundary sketch, area estimation, drawdown, sediment/pond base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, management, grazing, waterbird/fish/amphibian evidence, surrounding land use, amenity value, and pond condition narratives.
  - Photographing ponds with square numbers for relocation and identification.
- Data capture tools and forms
  - RIVPACS: RIVPACS Sample Area Form (field data for macroinvertebrate sampling).
  - RHS: RAPID field data entry for 2003 RHS protocol; 17 sections across 4 pages; validation checks built-in; GPS/NGR and site details required.
  - MTR/Aquatic Plants: IRIS data entry system; two-page form; plant species lists with abundance coding; specimen handling and lab confirmation workflow.
  - Pond mapping and pond condition sheets: paper-based forms for pond boundary, area, drawdown, turbidity, water chemistry, and environmental attributes; specimen handling and transport via TREM cards.
  - Data validation: built-in validation routines in RAPID and IRIS to flag missing data and inconsistencies; final “survey appears to be complete” message upon validation.
- Data management and relocation
  - RAPID and IRIS designed to minimize data transfer errors and enable on-site validation.
  - Photographs accompanied by site boards and location references to facilitate relocation.
  - Data and specimens to be dispatched to CEH Dorset; standard packaging, labeling, and monthly dispatch cycles; TREM transport cards used for formaldehyde-containing samples.

## Data Standards, Metadata, and Entry Quality
- Core metadata fields across components
  - CS square number, GPS/NGR coordinates, survey date, surveyor initials, sampling method, sample time, and site name.
  - For macroinvertebrates: sampling area width, depth, substrate, velocity, and habitat types; environmental data associated with the sampling area; photographs of sampling area with identifiable markers.
  - For RHS: spot-check data, 500 m sweep-up boundaries, bank/shade/vegetation characteristics, substrate composition, and channel features; multi-tab data entry in RAPID to improve usability and data integrity.
  - For macrophytes: species lists (submerged, floating-leaved, emergent, trees/overhangs) with abundance categories; percentage cover estimates; specimen handling guidance and rare species confirmation.
  - For ponds: outer boundary delineation, pond area, drawdown height, water depth, sediment composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, and land-use/amenity data.
- Taxonomic standards and specimen handling
  - Plant identifications targeted to species level where possible; guidance for particularly difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton, Charophytes) including when to send samples to the lab for confirmation.
  - Use of field guides and approved taxonomic lists; provision for specimen preservation (pressed, pickled) and later laboratory confirmation when needed.
- Data quality and governance
  - Training and accreditation: all field surveyors hold Environment Agency RHS macroinvertebrate sampling certification; RHS accreditation, MTR plant surveying, and chemical sampling training.
  - Regular data audits: approx. 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; field teams rotated to maintain consistency.
  - On-site validation: RAPID and IRIS include validation steps; field survey checklists ensure completion of all tasks.

## Data Access, Storage, and Sharing
- Sample handling and transport
  - Macroinvertebrate samples stored in labeled pots and transport boxes with TREM cards; reported to CEH Dorset for processing; monthly courier of 6-8 pots per box.
  - Plant specimens sent to Pond Conservation; pressed or preserved as appropriate; specimens labeled with CS square and pond codes.
- Data storage and workflows
  - Field data captured in RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant survey); macroinvertebrate and pond environmental data linked to CS square and site identifiers.
  - Shared datasets and outputs planned with Pond Conservation; project coordination and reporting through CEH and partner organizations.
- Documentation and relocation
  - Photographs and field sketches included in datasets to aid relocation and future re-sampling; site boards mark macroinvertebrate and RHS/MTR locations.
- Publication and licensing
  - CS2007 materials reference permission to reproduce and SAFETY disclaimers; data and findings intended for public dissemination through Countryside Survey channels and partner organizations.

## Practical Challenges and Data Stewardship Considerations
- Common data stewardship challenges
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and dataset priorities across different survey components.
  - Timely receipt of data and specimens from field teams; coordinating across multiple systems and formats (RAPID, IRIS, paper forms).
  - Interoperability across datasets (macroinvertebrate, RHS, macrophyte) and taxonomic alignment for integrated analyses.
  - Large and complex datasets requiring rigorous validation, curation, and robust metadata for discoverability.
  - Handling rare species; licensing and ethical considerations for specimen collection.
- Data governance implications for data stewards
  - Ensure consistent metadata schemas and field definitions across components to support data integration and reuse.
  - Maintain a clear data lifecycle: field collection, on-site validation, shipment to CEH, laboratory processing, and eventual data release.
  - Enforce standardized labeling, units, and date formats; ensure traceability from field to dataset.
  - Establish and monitor data quality controls, including periodic audits and cross-team standardization activities.
  - Facilitate clear documentation of methodologies, specimen handling protocols, and decision rules (e.g., sampling in non-standard watercourses, site relocation rules).

## Key Takeaways for Data Stewards
- The CS2007 framework provides highly structured, multi-component ecological data with standardized metadata, enabling robust cross-dataset analyses and national-scale monitoring.
- Centralized, tablet-based data entry (RAPID, IRIS) paired with paper backups ensures data quality, traceability, and timely validation in the field.
- Clear data governance practices—training, accreditation, auditing, and validation workflows—support dataset reliability and long-term stewardship.
- Comprehensive documentation (sampling methods, site relocation, specimen handling, and field checklists) is essential for future data discoverability and reproducibility.
- Data sharing arrangements with CEH and Pond Conservation illustrate a defined data flow and governance path from field collection to national reporting and public dissemination.
