# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence to identify if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly reveal square locations; released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period; no retention for other purposes.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; no use to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- License terms for spatial data and four-digit references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners summarising applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes; case-by-case for external organisations.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before committing to work with CS location data; CEH involvement may be direct or via collaborative/support arrangements.

## Practical guidance for GIS work
- Access to precise location data is tightly controlled; consider using pre-processed or masked data when possible.
- For policy or public-facing map products, rely on licensed four-digit references or aggregated area identifiers.
- Engage CEH early to determine permissible data usage and licensing requirements for specific GIS analyses.
