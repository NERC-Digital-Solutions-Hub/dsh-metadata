# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters

## Aim and scope
- National freshwater survey across GB; re-survey CS2000 headwaters framework.
- Collect and integrate multiple data streams: macroinvertebrate communities, hydromorphology (RHS), physical characteristics, water chemistry, aquatic macrophytes (MTR), and environmental context.
- Use field digital data capture (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants) and standardized lab/field protocols.
- Include a pond component (CS2007 Pond Condition Survey) to map and assess ponds within survey squares.

## Data assets and datasets
- Macroinvertebrate data and RIVPACS-based environmental data forms (sampling area, site data, water chemistry).
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) data captured via RAPID, aligned to the 2003 RHS protocol; 500 m survey length with integrated spot-checks and a standard RHS workflow.
- Aquatic plant data (MTR/Macrophyte survey) recorded via IRIS; 100 m plant survey length, centered on the macroinvertebrate site (50 m upstream and 50 m downstream).
- Water chemistry data: field pH and conductivity; filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity with on-site filtration and standardized labeling.
- Environmental and site data: width, depth, substratum, channel shading, water clarity, habitats (pool/run/riffle/slack), land use, and surrounding landscape context.
- Pond data: CS2007 Pond Mapping Recording Sheet and CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets for boundary, area, drawdown, turbidity, pollution, inflows/outflows, macrophyte survey, and environmental characteristics.

## Survey design and methodology
- Headwaters scope: re-survey all 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams; 500 m sampling reach with 100 m aquatic plant survey stretch centered on invert sampling point.
- Sampling targets per square: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), RHS hydromorphology, physical characteristics, water chemistry; 25 squares include a new headwater site on a smaller watercourse to improve headwater focus.
- Macroinvertebrate sampling: three-minute kick-sample with a 25 cm2 pond-net (900 μm mesh) plus one-minute manual search; proportional sampling across habitats; retain all specimens in the sample for lab identification, excluding fish/amphibians/very rare taxa which are returned or recorded; avoid sampling during spates.
- Water chemistry: indicative chemical sample downstream of the macroinvertebrate area; on-site pH and conductivity; SRP, TON, alkalinity measured from a filtered sample; detailed on-site filtration procedure and labeling.
- RHS (River Habitat Survey): 500 m reach, RHS site data captured in RAPID; field forms include 17 sections across 4 pages; on-site validation with “Check Data” to ensure completeness before leaving site.
- Aquatic plant survey (MTR): 100 m reach, 50 m upstream and 50 m downstream of invert site; wading or grapnel as needed; record presence and percent cover of macrophyte species; specimen collection for lab confirmation when needed; data entered in IRIS with plant species lists and cover categories; rare species confirmation procedures outlined.
- Data capture integration: RAPID for RHS/RHS spot-checks; IRIS for aquatic plant data; field checklists to ensure data completeness; photographs required for relocation and site characterization.

## Data quality, validation, and governance
- Training and certification: all field staff hold appropriate Environment Agency RHS macroinvertebrate sampling and plant surveying credentials; CEH training on RIVPACS, MTR, and chemical sampling.
- Quality assurance: regular team rotations to maintain consistency; approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; on-site validation and data checks via RAPID and IRIS before export.
- Field survey check-list used to ensure all tasks are completed at each site.
- Data integrity and standardization: use of drop-down fields in RAPID/IRIS to minimize free-text errors; standardized fields for GPS (NGR to 8 digits), dates, and surveyor IDs; photographs and relocation markers included for future site re-location.

## Data capture, storage, and workflow
- On-site data entry with tablet-based systems (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants) to reduce transcription errors and enable immediate validation.
- Sample handling and transport: macroinvertebrate samples fixed in 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde; samples stored in labeled pots in transport-friendly boxes with Transport Emergency (TREM) cards; plant specimens post-collection for lab confirmation.
- Centralized processing: samples couriered monthly to CEH Dorset; specimens and vouchered plants returned or shipped as required; field teams coordinate dispatch with Pond Conservation for non-macroinvertebrate data.
- Documented data products: field data forms (RIVPACS sample area forms, RHS data forms, MTR/IRIS plant data), Pond Condition Survey sheets, and field checklists; digital data entry feeds into centralized databases at CEH.

## Safety, equipment, and logistics
- Detailed field equipment lists and safety considerations (health and safety risk factors, use of GPS, ranges of instruments, and sampling protocols).
- Safety checks for sampling sites (water flow, bank stability, access, livestock presence); high-risk sites may be deferred.
- Transport and storage: formaldehyde and other fixatives transported with appropriate labeling; TREM cards used; chain-of-custody and chain-of-proper-storage for samples.

## Pond condition survey component (CS2007)
- Overview: identify all ponds in the square, select a survey pond, and conduct macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry surveys.
- Mapping and boundary: map pond boundary, sketch outline, estimate pond area, drawdown height, and proportion of water present.
- Measurements: turbidity estimates, water depth at transects, sediment and pond base composition, inflows/outflows, and pond management history.
- Surrounding context: two-distance land-use assessment (0-5 m and 0-100 m) and amenity/value assessments (view, public access, evidence of use).
- Macrophyte survey: comprehensive species list within pond boundary; abundance estimates by species; guidelines for specimen collection and lab confirmation; rare species handling and identification keys; documentation of plant samples sent for identification.
- Data integration: macrophyte data linked to pond boundary and survey metadata; photographic records and relocation notes essential for future re-surveys.

## Key references and standards
- Environment Agency RHS field guidance (2003 version); RIVPACS methodology; Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) macrophyte approach; lab/field protocols for chemical sampling and plant identification.
- Species identification and specimen handling guidance, with emphasis on careful confirmation for rare species and difficult taxa (e.g., Ranunculus, Callitriche, Potamogeton, Charophytes).
