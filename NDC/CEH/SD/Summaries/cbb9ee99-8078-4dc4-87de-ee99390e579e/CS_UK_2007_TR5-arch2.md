# Countryside Survey 2007: Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- Purpose: Use standardized environmental data to monitor condition and policy performance over time, enabling scrutiny of freshwater health across GB with comparable outputs.

## Scope and Overview

- National freshwater monitoring program covering headwaters and ponds as part of Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007).
- Headwaters: re-survey of 425 squares from CS2000; elements include macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, physical characteristics, and a 500 m watercourse length per site.
- Ponds: survey of ponds within CS2007 squares containing ponds; randomly selected pond per square (629 CS2007 squares with ponds) across elements of aquatic plants, pond physical characteristics, and water chemistry.
- CS2007 aims to link various water body types across GB within a single national framework and to integrate data into standardised outputs for progress assessment.

## Data Collection and Monitoring Framework

- Data sources: established field survey protocols (RIVPACS for macroinvertebrates; MTR for macrophytes; RHS for hydromorphology; on-site chemistry sampling) with standardized data capture and QA.
- Field data flow: data collected in the field and entered via computer systems (RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plant surveys). On-site validation reduces data transfer errors.
- Documentation: extensive field sheets and forms (RIVPACS Sample Area Form, RHS data entry in RAPID, MTR/IRIS plant data, pond condition recording sheets) to ensure traceability and relocation capability.

## Headwaters Survey Design and Operations

- Sampling framework: 425 headwater squares; each square surveys a 500 m headwater stretch for macroinvertebrates and RHS data; aquatic plant and water chemistry sampled within this framework.
- Site selection: within each square, sampling centers on RHS point locations; in 25 squares, a new site is sampled on smaller watercourses to focus on headwaters.
- Study layout: nested sampling arrangement to optimise relocation and comparability across surveys (illustrated in figures in the guide).
- Safety and procedures: risk assessment at each site; sampling halted if high-risk conditions are present; explicit sequencing of duties between two surveyors (A and B) to optimise fieldwork efficiency and data capture.

## Data Capture and Quality Assurance

- On-site validation: data validated during field entry using RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (macrophytes); check data routines ensure completeness before leaving the site.
- Training and governance: all field teams hold Environment Agency RHS macroinvertebrate sampling certification; regular team swaps and audits (approx. 7% of headwater sites) to maintain consistency.
- Field checklist: comprehensive field survey check-list ensures completion of all tasks before departure.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS) Component

- Reach length: RHS 500 m section centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; survey conducted irrespective of water flow where possible.
- Data capture: 17-section RHS data captured via RAPID; Page 2 includes 10 spot-checks; Page 3–4 cover 500 m sweep-up and dimensions; Page 2 includes an “Overall” tab for substrates and vegetation across the full 500 m site.
- RHS methodology: based on the 2003 RHS protocol; aim to maintain comparability with earlier versions while enabling modern data entry and validation.
- Data types: spot-checks (habitat features, substrate, vegetation, bank top land-use, etc.), physical attributes (width, depth, bank stability, substratum), channel shading, water clarity, and broader habitat categorisations (POOL, RUN, RIFFLE, SLACK).
- Tools: RAPID data entry system for RHS, with in-field validation and a “Check Data” feature to identify missing data or inconsistencies.

## Macroinvertebrate Sampling (RIVPACS) Protocol

- Objective: maximize taxa recovery from a single, continuous sampling area (5–15 m) with proportional sampling across habitats; aim to capture about 60% of families present per 3-minute kick sample.
- Sampling method: standard pond-net (25 cm2, 900 μm mesh) with three-minute kick sampling plus one minute of manual searching; site-specific habitat sampling proportional to cover; net integrity and cleanliness emphasized to avoid cross-contamination.
- Sample handling: specimens retained for lab identification; large fauna (fish, amphibians, rare species) may be returned to site; samples fixed with 40% formaldehyde to achieve approximately 4% formaldehyde solution; detailed labeling and storage in pots/bags for transport.
- Data capture: macroinvertebrate environmental data (RIVPACS Sample Area Form) including sample area width, depth, substrate, velocity, and habitat composition; precise GPS-based NGR capture for sites.
- Site environmental data: measurement of water width, depth, velocity, substrate composition, bank features, and vegetation within the sampling area to characterise habitat conditions.

## Macrophyte Survey and Aquatic Plant Data (MTR and IRIS)

- Macrophyte survey length: 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate sampling centre; wading or grapnel-based sampling to capture submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plants.
- Data capture: MTR protocol used to record presence and abundance (cover) of macrophyte species along the 100 m reach; 9-point cover scale; species identified to the level practical in field, with laboratory confirmation for difficult taxa.
- Cover estimation: species cover and total cover estimates computed using systematic approaches; instructions include examples and conversion tables to relate cover to survey length and channel width.
- Specimen handling: routine collection of plants for lab confirmation, particularly for groups difficult to identify in field (e.g., Callitriche, Potamogeton, Ranunculus); provision for pressed specimens, pickling for Charophytes, and careful labeling for traceability.
- Data capture tools: IRIS system for aquatic plant survey data with a two-page form; validation via a “Check Data” function; field staff select CS square, date, and surveyor details; specimen identification metadata linked to CS square and pond sampling.
- Taxonomic scope: a curated list of 351 taxa representing typical GB freshwater macrophytes; emphasis on species-level identification where possible; rare species flagged for special handling.

## Pond Condition Survey

- Overview: identify ponds within CS2007 squares, map outer boundary, estimate pond area, and assess turbidity and basic water chemistry before introducing disturbance; then perform pond environmental survey, macrophyte survey, and water chemistry sampling.
- Survey pond identification: mapping sheets identify all ponds in a square; one pond per square designated as the “survey pond” for condition assessment.
- Data collection sequence: photograph pond with square number; sketch boundary; estimate drawdown height and pond area; assess sediment, pond base, inflows/outflows; record pollution indicators and surrounding land use; document pond management and livestock/waterbird presence; record amenity values (view and access).
- Water quality: turbidity estimate prior to disturbance; measure conductivity and pH on-site; collect filtered SRP, TON and alkalinity samples (50 ml filtered) using on-site syringe filtration; careful labeling and post to CEH for analysis.
- Macrophyte survey in ponds: assess all wetland macrophytes within the outer boundary (100% coverage basis); record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent plant abundances; specimens collected for lab confirmation when necessary; identify to species where possible; rare species flagged for special handling and potential lab confirmation.
- Data handling: pond condition data recorded on CS2007 Pond Condition Survey Recording Sheets; field data pasted into multiple sheets (mapping, environmental, macrophyte, water quality) and stapled; samples dispatched monthly to CEH Dorset; Pond Conservation receives plant specimens and final data; TREM cards used for transport safety.
- Quality and reporting: robust guidelines for labeling, sketching outlines, calculating pond area, drawdown, sediment composition, pollution extent, inflows/outflows, and land-use surrounding the pond; ensure complete herd of fieldsheets before dispatch.

## Data Flow, Storage and Accessibility

- Data entry and validation: on-site data entry in RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (macrophyte/plant data); immediate validation to ensure data quality prior to site departure.
- Data storage and transfer: samples and fieldsheets stored and dispatched to CEH Dorset and Pond Conservation; monthly shipment cadence; formal transport documentation (TREM) accompanies macroinvertebrate and plant samples.
- Data integration: RIVPACS (macroinvertebrates), RHS (hydromorphology), MTR/IRIS (macrophytes), and headwater water chemistry data integrated within CS2007 framework to enable cross-waterbody type comparisons and policy-relevant metrics.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges

- Data utility and reuse: explicit aim to maximise dataset value by enabling broader data access and by combining with other relevant environmental datasets.
- Access and sharing: structured data collection and metadata standards intended to facilitate broader sharing and longitudinal analyses.
- Safety and logistics: explicit health and safety protocols, risk management for field conditions, and robust transport procedures for hazardous fixatives (formaldehyde) and biological samples.
