# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data for public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Stakeholders
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Confidential locations preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release possibilities and precision levels
- Location data can be released at the following levels:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km). Released under licence to show whether squares fall within predetermined areas.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations): pre-processing analysis by CEH required to avoid release; exceptional external release possible only if IP/confidentiality criteria are met (externally under licence).
  - Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, etc.): release mirrors six-digit policy and follows same exceptional circumstances.
- In very exceptional cases, precise location data may be released externally under licence if confidentiality/IP protections are equivalent to or higher than CS data.

## Licence conditions and usage restrictions
- Licensees must:
  - Preserve confidentiality; store securely; restrict access to authorised individuals.
  - Use licences for finite periods and for specified projects; destroy data at project end and confirm destruction in writing.
  - Not release data to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; not use data to plan visits or assess landowner compliance.
  - Potential licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements.
  - Prohibition on attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Governance, responsibilities, and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; signatories must be authorised representatives.
- If access is denied, CEH will follow Act/Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partner use; case-by-case consideration for other organisations.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH before using CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may apply.

## Practical implications for authors of monitoring frameworks
- Data governance: balance openness with protection of sensitive location data; implement tiered access and licensing.
- Data minimisation: prefer pre-processing to derive usable insights without exposing precise locations.
- Transparency and accountability: maintain logs and annual reporting of access requests and decisions.
- Collaboration considerations: establish clear processes for internal and external requests, including potential JCOP-aligned management standards.
