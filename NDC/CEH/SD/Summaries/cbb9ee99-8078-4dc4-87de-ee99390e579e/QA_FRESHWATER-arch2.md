# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Aim
- Provide high-quality information on changes in the physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain.
- Establish a baseline QA framework to enable reliability assessment, training improvements, and future change detection in freshwater monitoring.

## Methods

- Random-stratified QA: 31 squares re-surveyed by an experienced CEH freshwater biologist, targeting all environmental zones and CS teams.
- Sampling scope:
  - Streams: re-sampled in all 31 squares (8% re-survey rate).
  - Ponds: 18 of 31 squares re-surveyed (7% re-survey rate); 18 ponds re-surveyed for hydrochemistry in streams; 16 ponds surveyed for wetland plants.
- Data collection and relocation:
  - Aquatic plants (streams): 100 m stretch re-surveyed; relocation aided by photographs, grid refs, maps; data captured with IRIS on Tablet PC.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 500 m reach re-surveyed; relocation aided by photographs, grid refs, maps; data captured with RAPID on Tablet PC.
  - Macroinvertebrates: standard protocols used; samples processed by CEH River Communities Group (results pending in late 2009 Freshwaters Report).
  - Hydrochemistry: on-site pH and conductivity; laboratory analyses for phosphate, nitrogen, and alkalinity (CEH lab, ISO 17025).
- Validation: taxonomic standardisation and removal of terrestrial taxa; comparison of main CS2007 surveys with QA surveys to assess concordance and error sources.

## Key Findings

### Aquatic Plants (Streams)
- 30 of 31 QA stream sites re-surveyed; one stream dry.
- Agreement and taxon detection:
  - Main CS2007 survey generally found fewer taxa than QA survey (main tended to undercount taxa by ~1.9 taxa on average).
  - Mean agreement in species lists across 29 sites only 31%; 100% agreement only where a single species was found in both surveys.
- Error patterns:
  - >80% of errors involved rare taxa (<1% cover).
  - Over 60% of errors were taxa overlooked by the main surveyor; 15% due to misidentification.
  - Commonly missed: liverworts, certain mosses, marginal grasses, and some algae.
- Implications:
  - Repeats of aquatic plant surveys are challenging; significant site-to-site variability due to location, search thoroughness, seasonality, and boundary definitions.
  - QA results used to inform improvements in field protocols and training focus, particularly for bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grasses.

### River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges/culverts; small discrepancies typically ±1.
- Hydromorphological Quality Assessment (HQA):
  - QA surveys tended to yield lower HQA scores by about 6.9 units on average (significant difference, P < 0.001).
  - Discrepancies largely due to subjective judgments about bank-face and bank-top vegetation (e.g., upland moorland classifications).
- Temporal and spatial factors:
  - Differences partly attributed to slight shifts in the 500 m reach or vegetation classification ambiguities.
- Implication:
  - No corrective adjustments to main CS2007 RHS data; treat as biased in a consistent manner and use as baseline for future improvements.

### Hydrochemistry
- Rank correlations between main CS2007 and QA data:
  - Streams: soluble reactive phosphorus (r = 0.89), total oxidised nitrogen (r = 0.79), alkalinity (r = 0.97), pH (r = 0.74), conductivity (r = 0.97) — all significant.
  - Ponds: phosphorus (r = 0.60), alkalinity (r = 0.95), pH (r = 0.84), conductivity (r = 0.98); TON correlation weaker (r = 0.47, not significant).
- Timing: two ponds showed notable TON differences between main and QA surveys due to about two months between visits.
- Implication:
  - Field and lab procedures are consistently applied; results are reliable, but timing between main and QA surveys should be kept close.

### Wetland Plants (Ponds)
- 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA; no significant bias (main found ~0.6 more taxa on average; P > 0.214).
- Mean agreement: 59% (100% agreement at five ponds).
- Common misses:
  - Grass/sedge/rush taxa and small-leaved submerged aquatic plants; seven taxa missed at more than one site, mostly grasses/rushes.
- Implication:
  - First pond plant data collection; QA baseline will guide future pond surveys and training emphasis on grass-like taxa and boundary delineation.

## Uncertainty and Limitations

- Inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements due to spatial, temporal, and inter-surveyor variability.
- Difficulty isolating inter-surveyor competence from spatial/temporal error; many QA surveys occurred weeks after main surveys, limiting interpretation of temporal effects.
- Subjectivity in RHS vegetation classifications contributes to variability, especially in moorland and complex bank habitats.
- No QA data for CS2000; assumption that CS2000 and CS2007 biases are comparable for deriving change estimates.

## Implications for Monitoring and Recommendations

- QA provides a baseline for assessing freshwater data reliability and guides targeted training and protocol refinement.
- Recommendations to improve future CS freshwater QA:
  - Enhance identification skills for aquatic bryophytes and algae.
  - Increase awareness of bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species during plant surveys.
  - Emphasize returning exactly to the previous survey stretch to reduce spatial error.
  - Reinforce RHS training focused on subjective vegetation classifications and bank vegetation structure.
  - Strive to conduct QA within two weeks of the main survey at the same site to minimize temporal discrepancies.
- Future updates:
  - Freshwater macroinvertebrate QA analysis and results to be reported in late 2009 Freshwaters Report.

## Conclusion

- The CS2007 freshwater QA survey establishes a critical baseline for understanding measurement variability across streams and ponds.
- It highlights the main sources of error (especially rare taxa detection, boundary accuracy, and subjective habitat classification) and demonstrates the overall reliability of hydrochemical data while identifying areas for targeted training and protocol improvements.
- The findings will inform improvements in field protocols, training, and data interpretation for subsequent Countryside Survey cycles and enhance the ability to detect genuine environmental change over time.
