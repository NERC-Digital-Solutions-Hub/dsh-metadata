# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Purpose and scope
- CS2007 freshwater QA assesses the uncertainty in field-collected data and derived condition measures.
- Establishes a baseline for evaluating future Countryside Survey freshwater data and informing protocol improvements and training.

## QA design and sampling plan
- Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares; re-surveyed by an experienced CEH freshwater biologist.
- Scope: streams re-sampled at all 31 squares; ponds re-surveyed at 18 of the 31 squares (8% stream re-survey, 7% pond re-survey).
- Data types targeted: aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), aquatic macroinvertebrates, and hydrochemistry (streams); aquatic plants and hydrochemistry (ponds).

## Field and laboratory standards
- Field staff: trained in aquatic plant taxonomy; RHS accredited; field biologist supported teams to ensure methodological adherence.
- Laboratory work: CEH water chemistry analysis ISO 17025 accredited; macroinvertebrate samples processed under CEH River Communities Group protocols with taxonomic accreditation.
- Temporal sequencing: QA tasks conducted as close as possible to main survey to minimize temporal error.

## Methods for locating and recording data
- Re-locating 100 m stream stretches and 500 m RHS reaches using photos, grid references, and map annotations; IRIS/RAPID tablet data entry for plant, RHS, and macroinvertebrate data.

## Aquatic plants (streams)
- 30 of 31 streams re-surveyed (one site dry).
- Findings: main CS2007 surveys tended to record about 1.9 fewer taxa than QA survey (significant bias).
- Mean agreement: 31% of taxa recorded by both surveys; 100% agreement only when a site had a single species.
- Key sources of discrepancy: misidentifications, differing survey stretch location, seasonal differences, vegetation management, and lateral boundary definition.
- Most missed taxa were rare (<1% cover); main survey often missed taxa (about 60%), with 15% misidentifications influencing apparent matches.
- QA surveys typically scored higher on the MTR index by ~5.6 points (not statistically significant); substantial variability between surveys.
- Conclusion: aquatic plant surveys are difficult to repeat; supports using QA data as a baseline for improving field protocols and identifying plant groups needing expert identification.

## River Habitat Survey (RHS)
- 31 stream sites; 70% showed no difference in bridges/culverts counts; small discrepancies mostly due to slight differences in 500 m reach relocation.
- Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values calculated; QA vs main survey showed a significant bias, with main survey generally scoring higher by ~6.9 points.
- Greater disparity in upland moorland/bank vegetation classifications (e.g., simple vs uniform) affecting HQA scoring.
- No QA data for CS2000; assume similar bias for CS2000 and CS2007; main CS2007 RHS data can be analyzed with awareness of biases.

## Hydrochemistry (streams)
- Rankings across 31 sites show strong repeatability:
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus: r = 0.89
  - Total oxidised nitrogen: r = 0.79
  - Alkalinity: r = 0.97
  - pH: r = 0.74
  - Conductivity: r = 0.97
- Confidence in field and laboratory procedures supported; close timing between QA and main surveys is important.

## Wetland plants (ponds)
- 16 ponds surveyed in both main and QA; no significant bias detected.
- Main survey found 0.6 more taxa on average; mean agreement 59% (100% agreement at five ponds).
- Discrepancies due to misidentifications, boundaries of pond delineation, and seasonal changes.
- Commonly missed taxa included grasses, sedges, rushes, and certain small submerged aquatic plants.

## Hydrochemistry (ponds)
- Significant correlations for four of five parameters:
  - SRP: r = 0.60
  - Alkalinity: r = 0.95
  - pH: r = 0.84
  - Conductivity: r = 0.98
- TON values varied more; two ponds showed substantial differences due to a two-month gap between visits.
- Overall indicates field and lab procedures are reliable, reinforcing need to keep QA and main surveys temporally close.

## Discussion and interpretation
- Environmental measurements carry inherent uncertainty; QA provides a first quantitative look at variability in freshwater data.
- Variation arises from spatial, temporal, and inter-surveyor differences; temporal alignment between QA and main surveys is crucial but not always achievable.
- Subjective elements (e.g., RHS classifications) contribute to variability, especially in vegetation assessments.
- Where feasible, retain QA within two weeks of the main survey to minimize temporal error.
- The QA exercise highlights where training should be enhanced (e.g., bryophytes, algae, inconspicuous grasses) and where strict replication of survey stretches is important.

## Implications for data use and future work
- CS2007 freshwater data can be used for change detection with awareness of identified data quality issues.
- QA results inform targeted training, refinements to field protocols, and prioritization of elements prone to misinterpretation or repeatability problems.
- The Freshwater Technical Report (late 2009) will include macroinvertebrate QA results and further methodological details.

## Recommendations for future surveys
- Improve identification skills for bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grass-like species.
- Increase emphasis on precise re-location and exact return to prior survey stretches.
- Enhance RHS training to reduce subjective interpretation variability, especially in upland moorland zones.
- Schedule QA work within two weeks of the main survey to minimize temporal bias.
- Use QA findings to guide protocol refinements and training priorities for subsequent CS freshwater surveys.
