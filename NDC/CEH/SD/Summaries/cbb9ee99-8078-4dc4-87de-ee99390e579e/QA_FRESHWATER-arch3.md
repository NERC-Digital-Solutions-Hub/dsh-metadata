# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

## Aim and context
- Countryside Survey 2007 freshwater module aimed to provide high-quality information on changes in physical and biological condition of small streams and ponds across Great Britain, including distribution of biodiversity components.
- QA emphasized: rigorous training for field surveyors, ISO 17025-accredited laboratories, and quantification of uncertainty.
- The QA report serves as a baseline for future surveys and highlights data quality, training needs, and protocol improvements.

## QA design and methods
- Fieldwork: random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares surveyed; 31 streams re-sampled, 18 included ponds (8% stream re-survey effort; 7% pond re-survey effort).
- Relocation and data capture: re-locations aided by photographs, grid references, and map annotations; data recorded with Tablet PC systems (IRIS for plants; RAPID for RHS).
- Components surveyed:
  - Aquatic plants (streams): re-survey at 30 of 31 streams; 100 m reach; taxonomic standardisation; comparison of plant taxa between main and QA surveys.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS): 31 streams; 500 m reach; assessment of banks/vegetation and overall habitat features; calculation of Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA).
  - Aquatic macroinvertebrates: 30 streams; still being processed; relocation consistency assessed.
  - Hydrochemistry: phosphate, nitrogen, alkalinity in water; on-site pH and conductivity.
  - Wetland plants (ponds): 18 ponds; 29 QA sites with plants; measurement of plant taxa richness.
- Quality checks: independent CEH biologists repeated tasks to quantify error/variation; taxonomy validation and data cleaning performed.

## Key findings by component
- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - Significant bias: main CS2007 surveys tended to record fewer taxa than QA; mean difference in taxa richness substantial; mean agreement across taxa only 31%.
  - Most discrepancies due to rare taxa, search effort, misidentifications, and timing differences; over 80% of errors involved taxa with <1% cover.
  - Among commonly missed taxa: bryophytes, certain algae, and grasses/rushes; the QA generally found more taxa.
  - Derived MTR scores tended to be higher in QA, though not statistically conclusive; substantial variability even on the same day.
  - Conclusion: high repeatability challenges for aquatic plant surveys; QA provides a baseline to improve training and protocols.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - 70% of sites showed no difference in counts of bridges/culverts; some sites differed by ±1 or ±2 due to slight relocation differences.
  - HQA scores varied with inter-surveyor decisions on bank complexity and vegetation classification; upland moorland landscapes were especially prone to disparity (classification of bank-face and top vegetation).
  - No CS2000 QA data; assumption that CS2000 and CS2007 share similar bias; main CS2007 RHS data treated as precautionary with awareness of quality issues.
- Hydrochemistry
  - Ranking consistency between main and QA surveys high for most parameters: soluble reactive phosphorus, alkalinity, pH, conductivity; TON showed less agreement in two ponds with a two-month gap between visits.
  - Overall, field and lab procedures appear consistently applied; timing proximity between QA and main surveys is important.
- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - 16 ponds with both main and QA data showed no significant bias in taxa richness; mean difference +0.6 taxa; mean agreement 59%.
  - Discrepancies due to misidentifications, boundary definitions, and seasonal changes; grasses and rushes among most commonly missed groups.
  - TON and related hydrochemistry in ponds generally aligned, with some exceptions tied to timing.

## Overall interpretation and implications for monitoring frameworks
- QA provides a crucial baseline for understanding uncertainty and inter-surveyor variability across freshwater components.
- Data quality issues identified inform targeted improvements in training, especially for:
  - Bryophyte and algae identification.
  - Conspicuous yet easy-to-miss grass-like taxa.
  - Precise relocalisation to previous survey stretches.
  - Timely replication to minimize temporal variability.
- Protocol refinements suggested:
  - Emphasize consistent return to exact 100 m (streams) or 500 m (RHS) survey reaches.
  - Shorten gap between main and QA surveys to within two weeks where feasible.
  - Improve standardisation of habitat classification (e.g., bank vegetation structure) to reduce subjectivity.
  - Maintain strict data governance and metadata practices; ensure data sharing while respecting data quality standards.
- Limitations acknowledged:
  - No QA data for CS2000; biases assumed equal between CS2000 and CS2007 RHS and plant data.
  - Temporal differences between main and QA surveys complicate attribution of variation to inter-surveyor competence vs. natural change.
- Practice-oriented outcomes:
  - Training focus areas identified to enhance repeatability and reliability of plant and habitat assessments.
  - QA demonstrated where protocol guidance is ambiguous, prompting revisions in the freshwater QA protocols.

## Conclusions and recommendations
- The CS2007 freshwater QA study establishes a baseline for data quality and repeatability, guiding improvements in field protocols and surveyor training.
- Key recommendations:
  - Strengthen identification training for aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous grasses/rushes.
  - Improve strategies for returning exactly to the same survey reach and for minimizing temporal differences by scheduling QA and main surveys in close succession (ideally within two weeks).
  - Recognize and address inter-surveyor variability in subjective classifications (e.g., bank vegetation and habitat structure) to reduce bias in RHS/HQA scores.
  - Use QA findings to refine monitoring protocols and target future QA efforts where greatest variation is observed.
- The forthcoming Freshwater Technical Report will provide macroinvertebrate QA results to complement these findings.
