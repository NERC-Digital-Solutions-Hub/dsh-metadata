# Quality Assurance Report: surveying condition of headwater streams and ponds

- Purpose: Establish a high-quality baseline for CS2007 freshwater data by evaluating field and laboratory procedures, data collection methods, and measurement uncertainty.
- Scope: QA re-survey of 31 random-stratified squares (streams and ponds) to assess repeatability and identify sources of error in aquatic plants, River Habitat Survey (RHS), hydrochemistry, and pond plant data; field data entry used IRIS and RAPID on Tablet PCs.

## Data governance and QA approach

- Personnel and training
  - Freshwater field surveyors required to have strong aquatic plant taxonomy knowledge and RHS accreditation.
  - Field quality checks by an experienced CEH freshwater biologist.
- Laboratories and protocols
  - Water chemistry analyzed by ISO 17025-accredited CEH lab.
  - Macroinvertebrate samples processed under CEH River Communities Group protocols.
  - Taxonomic standardisation and terrestrial species removal during data validation.
- Sampling design and replication
  - Random-stratified sub-sample of 31 squares; re-survey included streams (100%) and ponds (approx. 60% of squares had ponds).
  - Re-survey conducted within two weeks where possible; some temporal gaps occurred.
- Data capture and navigation
  - Use of IRIS (plant data) and RAPID (RHS data) on Tablet PCs to ensure consistent data recording and relocation back to original survey locations.
- Uncertainty quantification
  - Re-survey assesses error/variation in field tasks and derived condition measures to establish data reliability baselines for future CS efforts.

## Findings by data domain

- Aquatic plants (streams)
  - 30 of 31 stream QA sites re-surveyed; one site dry.
  - Re-locating the 100 m survey stretch successfully in most cases.
  - Taxonomic agreement between main CS2007 and QA surveys was low: mean agreement around 31%; main survey tended to record about 1.9 fewer taxa than QA.
  - Reasons for discrepancies: misidentifications, incomplete searches, slight relocations, seasonal differences, vegetation disturbance, boundary definition issues.
  - Most errors involved rare taxa (<1% cover); over 60% due to overlooked taxa by the main survey, not misidentification.
  - Commonly missed taxa included certain bryophytes, mosses, grasses, and some algae.
  - Derived MTR (multitaxa richness) scores tended to be higher in QA surveys by about 5.6 taxa on average, though not statistically robust.
  - Conclusion: Plant surveys in streams are inherently variable; QA highlights need for improved bryophyte/algae identification and thorough site search; performance may bias inter-year comparisons if biases are consistent.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - 31 stream sites; relocation of the 500 m RHS stretch had high concordance in most features.
  - Bridges/culverts counts matched at 70% of sites; minor differences likely due to slightly different 500 m reach boundaries.
  - Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) values showed significant bias: QA scores tended to be lower by about 6.9 units on average, driven largely by subjective classification of bank-face and bank-top vegetation (e.g., moorland vegetation classified differently).
  - upland moorland zones showed greatest disparity due to interpretive differences in vegetation structure.
  - Overall implication: RHS subjective components contribute to variation; objective counts (bridges/culverts) are more reliable but still susceptible to reach relocation differences.
- Hydrochemistry
  - Parameters ranked similarly between main CS2007 and QA data; strong correlations for soluble reactive phosphorus, alkalinity, pH, conductivity; TON showed less consistent correlation due to temporal gaps (two ponds with large TON differences linked to longer time between surveys).
  - Conclusion: Field and lab procedures are consistently applied; hydrochemical results are broadly repeatable when sampling timing is close.
- Wetland plants (ponds)
  - 16 ponds surveyed; 59% mean taxon agreement between main and QA surveys; 100% agreement at five ponds.
  - Discrepancies due to misidentifications, pond boundary definition (winter water level), and seasonal plant community changes.
  - Commonly missed pond taxa included grasses, sedges, rushes, and small submerged aquatics; seven taxa missed at more than one site (notably Juncus effusus and Agrostis stolonifera).
  - Implication: First pond-wide plant survey in CS2007; QA establishes baseline variability and training needs for pond flora assessment.

## Implications for data strategy and governance

- Uncertainty and variability
  - Acknowledges inherent uncertainty in environmental measurements; QA provides baseline for error estimation and interpretation of change.
  - Temporal, spatial, and inter-surveyor competence contribute to variability; precise relocation and boundary definitions are critical.
- Baseline for future surveys
  - CS2007 freshwater QA results inform improvements in field protocols, training focus (bryophytes, algae, grass-like taxa), and data collection procedures.
  - Establishes the need for tighter QA-main survey timing (ideally within two weeks) to minimize temporal error.
- Data quality controls and standards
  - Highlights challenges due to subjective judgments (e.g., RHS vegetation classification) and the importance of consistent metadata, definitions, and taxonomic standards.
  - Provides actionable findings to strengthen community of practice and cross-team consistency.

## Recommendations for future data management and practice

- Training and expertise
  - Enhanced identification training for aquatic bryophytes, algae, and inconspicuous plant taxa; targeted refresher on grass-like species.
- Protocols and survey design
  - Improve and standardize criteria for classifying vegetation structure to reduce subjective variability (especially in RHS).
  - Emphasize returning to the exact same survey stretch and precise boundary definitions; minimize relocation errors.
  - Aim to conduct QA and main surveys within two weeks of each other to reduce temporal differences.
- Data capture and integration
  - Maintain consistent use of digital data entry systems (IRIS, RAPID); ensure accurate georeferencing and survey stretch delineation.
- Continuous learning and iteration
  - Use QA findings to refine protocols and training ahead of future CS cycles; focus on plant groups and survey elements most prone to error.
- Reporting and benchmarking
  - Treat QA data as a baseline for assessing future freshwater surveys; explicitly report uncertainty and potential biases when estimating change.

## Conclusion

- The CS2007 freshwater QA study provides a foundational assessment of data quality and repeatability across aquatic plants, RHS, hydrochemistry, and pond flora.
- It identifies key sources of error (taxonomic identification, survey stretch relocation, boundary definitions, and temporal differences) and confirms strong repeatability for some hydrochemical measures.
- The findings guide targeted improvements in training, standardization, and protocols to enhance data reliability and the ability to detect true ecological change in future surveys.
