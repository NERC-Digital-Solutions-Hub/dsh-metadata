- Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

## Raster data

- Five raster products in total.
- A 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarise the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata for the raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: UK.

## Documentation and metadata

## Implications for data leaders

- Provides flexible formats to meet diverse user needs and integration into data systems.
- Enables assessment of data granularity (detailed vector vs. broader raster summaries) for planning and decision-making.
- Open access to multiple rasters supports quick overview and cross-platform compatibility; shapefile option supports detailed, attribute-rich analyses.
- Emphasizes the importance of metadata and documented class schemes to ensure discoverability and correct application across teams and networks.
