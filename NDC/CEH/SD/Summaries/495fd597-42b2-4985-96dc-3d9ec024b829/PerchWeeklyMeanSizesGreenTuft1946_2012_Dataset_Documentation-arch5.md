# Perch weekly mean sizes from Green Tuft 19462012

## Overview
- Dataset of weekly mean sizes (cm) of mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, UK, sampled 1946–2012.
- Part of long-running Windermere perch monitoring (north and south basins) initiated 1943; data primarily collected by FBA and since 1989 by CEH and its predecessor IFE.
- Related datasets available in the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre; dataset cited in Ohlberger et al. (2014).

## Sampling Design and Methods
- Perch captured with unbaited, wire-netting traps (dimensions: 740 mm × 590 mm × 640 mm; 12 mm hex mesh)
- Traps deployed for 6 weeks per year in gangs of five; typically six sets per spawning season
- Location: spawning ground at Green Tuft in Windermere’s north basin; depths 2–7 m
- Daily deployment and lifting during daylight; traps set approximately 7 days apart
- Processing: all perch enumerated, measured (total length to 1 mm), weighed (to 1 g), and sex/reproductive state determined

## Data Processing and Quality Assurance
- Derived weekly mean sizes of mature perch from the processed catch
- Quality control: measurements checked by permutations of three individuals

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Presence of QA indicators in the dataset:
  - NS: week not sampled
  - ID: week with insufficient data
- Potential limitations due to sampling effort variations, site- and time-specific methodology, and data completeness over the multi-decadal span

## Access, Usage and Licensing
- Accessibility aligns with NERC EIDC data sharing practices; metadata and related datasets available through CEH/CEH EIDC portals
- Intellectual property rights held by NERC CEH/FBA; data suitable for ecological and phenology analyses with proper citation
