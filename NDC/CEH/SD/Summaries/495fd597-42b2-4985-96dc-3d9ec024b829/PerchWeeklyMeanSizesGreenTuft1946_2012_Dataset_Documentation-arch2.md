# Perch weekly mean sizes from Green Tuft 19462012

- Overview
  - A dataset of weekly mean sizes for mature Perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, UK, sampled 1946–2012.
  - Part of long-term fish monitoring in Windermere (north and south basins); data collected since 1943, with CEH/its predecessor continuing since 1989 (FBA initially).
  - Used in ecological analyses such as Ohlberger et al. (2014) on phenology and population responses to trophic mismatch.

- Data contents and format
  - File: PerchWeeklyMeanSizesGreenTuft1946_2012.csv (CSV, ~10 KB).
  - Columns: Year, Week, Mean_size (cm), QA_code (NS = week not sampled; ID = insufficient data).
  - Time span: Weekly measurements across 1946–2012.
  - Related datasets available via NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (metadata links provided).

- Sampling site and location
  - Green Tuft, Windermere, North Basin (also monitored in the south basin; this dataset derives from Green Tuft in the north).
  - Approximate grid reference: NY374019 (OS Grid), 337402,501968 (OSGB36 Easting/Northing).

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Perch trapped using unbaited, wire-netting traps (dimensions listed in the study) deployed during the spawning season.
  - Typical protocol: six sets of traps, deployed for about six weeks (late April to early June), at depths of 2–7 m, in daylight; lifts usually after ~7 days.
  - All perch from each trap group pooled for laboratory processing.

- Collection methods and laboratory work
  - In the lab: enumerated and processed in full (except when large catches required sub-sampling by length class).
  - Measurements: total length to 1 mm, wet mass to 1 g; determine sex and reproductive state.
  - Purpose: compute weekly mean sizes of mature perch.

- Data quality and provenance
  - Quality control: measurements verified by permutations of three individuals.
  - Original and cited references include Paxton et al. (2004) for methodology and recruitment influences.

- Related datasets and references
  - Related dataset: Windermere monthly temperatures 1946-2012 (metadata link provided).
  - Data use: a key input for phenology and population-response analyses (e.g., Ohlberger et al. 2014).

- Relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Provides a standardized, long-term time series of size structure in a key fish species.
  - Enables consistent assessment of environmental health, phenology, and trophic interactions over decades.
  - Data management: dataset and metadata intended for storage and portal upload, supporting data sharing and accessibility for monitoring and policy evaluation.
