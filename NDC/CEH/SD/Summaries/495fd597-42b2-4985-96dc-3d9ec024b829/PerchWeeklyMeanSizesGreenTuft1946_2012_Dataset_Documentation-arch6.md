# Perch weekly mean sizes from Green Tuft 1946-2012

## Overview
- Dataset of weekly mean sizes of mature perch (Perca fluviatilis) from Green Tuft, Windermere, Cumbria, sampled 1946–2012.
- Collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and later by the CEH/IFE since 1989.
- Used in Ohlberger et al. (2014) and linked to related datasets on Windermere fish catches and water temperature.

## Data contents
- File: PerchWeeklyMeanSizesGreenTuft1946_2012.csv
- Size: 10 KB
- Format: CSV
- Columns: Year, Week, Mean_size (cm), QA_code
  - QA_code: NS = week not sampled; ID = week with insufficient data

## Sampling site and location
- Site: Green Tuft, Windermere, Lake Windermere, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate grid reference: NY374019 (OS Grid); Easting/Northing 337402, 501968

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Perch monitored in Windermere’s north and south basins; Green Tuft samples from the north basin.
- Collection method: unbaited, wire-netting traps
  - Trap dimensions: 740 mm x 590 mm x 640 mm
  - Mesh: 12 mm hexagonal
  - Target size range: 90–300 mm total length (size-unbiased)
- Deployment: traps set for 6 weeks in gangs of five each year
  - Timing: late April to early June
  - Depths: 2–7 m
- Sampling cadence: usually six trap sets per spawning season
- Processing: all perch pooled per site and brought to the laboratory

## Analytical methods
- Laboratory processing of entire catch (when numbers allow, subsampling by length class)
- Measurements for each perch: total length (to 1 mm), wet mass (to 1 g), sex, and reproductive state
- Used to calculate mean size of mature perch for each sampling week

## Quality control
- Measurements checked by permutations involving three individuals

## Collection and data provenance
- Perch trapping methodology reference: Paxton et al. (2004) Journal of Fish Biology
- Data produced by FBA and CEH/IFE lineage; dataset documented alongside related Windermere data (e.g., monthly temperatures) for long-term ecological studies
