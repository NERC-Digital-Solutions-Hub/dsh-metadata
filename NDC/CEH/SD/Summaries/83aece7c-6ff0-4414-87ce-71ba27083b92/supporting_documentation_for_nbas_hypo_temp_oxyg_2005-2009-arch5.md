# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009.

- Overview: Ongoing long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling in the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England; focused on hypo-temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements.

- Variables and data content:
  - Hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L.
  - Measurement location and depth: ~60–62 m depth, from a boat at a buoy in the deepest part of the lake.
  - Timeframe: January 2005 through end of 2009.
  - Data file format: CSV with columns Date, Hypo_temp_c, Hypo_DO_mgL and corresponding descriptions.

- Sampling regime and collection methods:
  - Instrument: WTW oxi340i meter.
  - Procedure: Lowered to the sediment and raised to about 0.5 m above it for measurement.
  - Frequency: Fortnightly sampling.

- Quality control and data quality:
  - Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Double entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

- Data structure details:
  - Columns in CSV:
    - Date: Date of measurement.
    - Hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature (°C).
    - Hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (mg/L).

- Provenance and funding:
  - Funding: Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
  - Dataset provenance: Part of a long-term monitoring program; data collection supported through the NERC grant.

- Governance and reuse notes for Data Stewards:
  - Ensure metadata documents the sampling regime, depth, instrument, and location details to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Plan for quality control and calibration steps; document any corrections or transformations.
  - Manage data availability and potential embargoes; track updates to the dataset.
  - Consider storage and cataloging in appropriate data portals to facilitate discovery and interoperability.
