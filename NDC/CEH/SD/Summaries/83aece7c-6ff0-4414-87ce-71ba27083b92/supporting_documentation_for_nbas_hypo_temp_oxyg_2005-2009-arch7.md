# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009. Feuchtmayr, H., De Ville, M.M., Fletcher, J.M., James, J.B., Thackeray, S.J. (2024)

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring dataset from Fortnightly sampling in the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Variables available for download: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) in °C and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL) in mg/L.
- Sampling depth: 60–62 m, using a WTW oxi340i meter lowered from a boat to the sediment and retrieved about 0.5 m above the sediment.
- Location: measurements taken at a marked buoy at the deepest part of the lake.
- Time period: January 2005 through the end of 2009.
- Data suitable for GIS visualization as part of map-based analyses of lake processes.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Frequency: fortnightly measurements as part of ongoing monitoring.
- Equipment and process: WTW oxi340i meter deployed from a boat; measurement taken at ~60–62 m depth near the deepest part of the lake.
- Location specificity: tied to a buoy at the deepest lake point, enabling spatially-referenced data points.

## Quality control
- Data are raw and have not been quality controlled or calibrated yet.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked for consistency.
- Gaps are due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure
- Format: comma-separated values (CSV) file.
- Columns (with descriptions):
  - Date: Date of measurement.
  - hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg per litre.
- Notes: Each row corresponds to a single measurement event at the specified depth and location.

## Accessibility and scope
- Data are available for download as a CSV file.
- Coverage: North Basin of Windermere, depths 60–62 m, January 2005–December 2009.
- Spatial scope is tied to the buoy location at the deepest part of Windermere; exact coordinates are not provided in the summary.

## Funding and provenance
- Collected under Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1.
- Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
