# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009

- Overview
  - Long-term monitoring dataset with fortnightly sampling in the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
  - Variables available: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c, °C) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration (hypo_DO_mgL, mg/L).
  - Timeframe: January 2005 to the end of 2009.
- Sampling regime and collection site
  - Measurements taken at depths between 60 and 62 m from a boat at the deepest part of the lake, near a marked buoy location.
- Measurement methods
  - Measurements conducted by lowering a WTW oxi340i meter to the sediment and pulling it back up to approximately 0.5 m above the bottom to take readings.
  - Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring program with fortnightly sampling.
- Data structure and format
  - Downloadable CSV with columns:
    - Date (date of measurement)
    - hypo_temp_c (hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius)
    - hypo_DO_mgL (hypolimnion dissolved oxygen in mg/L)
- Quality control and limitations
  - Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data are due to weather conditions or staff shortages.
- Data coverage and availability
  - Data are part of the North Basin Windermere long-term monitoring dataset and available as a CSV file.
