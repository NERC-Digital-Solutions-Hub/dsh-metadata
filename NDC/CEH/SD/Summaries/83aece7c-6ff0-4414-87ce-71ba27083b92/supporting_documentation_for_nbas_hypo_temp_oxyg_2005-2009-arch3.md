Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009. Feuchtmayr, H., De Ville, M.M., Fletcher, J.M., James, J.B., Thackeray, S.J. (2024)

## Overview
- Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset from North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Fortnightly sampling from January 2005 to the end of 2009.
- Measured hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL).
- Measurements taken at a depth between 60 and 62 m from a boat at a marked deepest-location buoy.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling schedule.
- Depth targeted: 60–62 m.
- Instrument: WTW oxi340i meter.
- Procedure: meter lowered to near the sediment, then pulled up about 0.5 m to take the measurement.
- Location: deepest part of the lake, from a boat at the buoy.

## Quality Control
- Data presented are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data have been double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure
- Format: comma-separated values (CSV).
- Columns:
  - Date: Date of measurement.
  - hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L.
- Each record includes descriptive labels for the variables within the CSV (e.g., Description fields explaining each column).
- Timeframe covered: January 2005 through 2009 (end of 2009).

## Data availability and usage
- Data are available to download as part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset.
- Funded as part of UK-SCaPE, delivering National Capability.

## Funding
- Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) award NE/R016429/1.
- Part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field collection, raw data status, basic data integrity checks, and clear data structure with descriptive metadata.
- Highlights practical constraints in monitoring data—raw status, incomplete quality control, and data gaps due to operational factors.
- Emphasizes the need for robust metadata and governance to enable reuse, sharing, and subsequent quality assurance for policy evaluation and decision-making. 
- Illustrates data accessibility considerations and the role of funding in sustaining long-term environmental monitoring.
