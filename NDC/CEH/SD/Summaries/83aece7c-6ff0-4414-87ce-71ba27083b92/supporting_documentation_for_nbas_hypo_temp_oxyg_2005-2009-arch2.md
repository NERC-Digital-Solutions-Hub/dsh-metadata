Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009. Feuchtmayr, H., De Ville, M.M., Fletcher, J.M., James, J.B., Thackeray, S.J. (2024)

## Overview
- Part of an ongoing fortnightly long-term monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Time period: January 2005 to the end of 2009.
- Measured variables: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c, °C) and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL, mg/L).

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Sampling frequency: fortnightly.
- Depth and location: measurements taken from a boat at the deepest part of the lake (marked buoy), at depths between 60 and 62 m.
- Instrument and procedure: a WTW oxi340i meter lowered to the sediment and pulled back up about 0.5 m to take the measurement.

## Data structure
- Format: comma separated values (CSV).
- Columns:
  - Date: Date of measurement.
  - Hypo_temp_c: Hypolimnion temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Hypo_DO_mgL: Hypolimnion dissolved oxygen concentration in mg/L.

## Quality control
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data are due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Accessibility and storage
- Data available to download as a CSV file, accompanying the ongoing long-term monitoring dataset.
