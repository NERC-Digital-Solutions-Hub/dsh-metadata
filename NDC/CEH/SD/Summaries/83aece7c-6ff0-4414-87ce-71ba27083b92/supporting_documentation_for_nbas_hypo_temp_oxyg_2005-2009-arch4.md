# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009

- Overview
  - Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset from fortnightly sampling in the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
  - Datasets available: hypolimnion temperature (hypo_temp_c) in °C and hypolimnion dissolved oxygen (hypo_DO_mgL) in mg/L.
  - Measurements taken at depths of 60–62 m from a boat at the deepest part of the lake, using a WTW oxi340i meter.
  - Recording location: at a marked buoy; depth interval around 0.5 m above the sediment.
  - Time frame: January 2005 through the end of 2009.

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Fortnightly sampling as part of a long-term monitoring effort.
  - Equipment: WTW oxi340i meter; readings taken during a single dive to near the sediment.
  - Site conditions: measurements conducted from a boat at the deepest lake location, at a marked buoy.
