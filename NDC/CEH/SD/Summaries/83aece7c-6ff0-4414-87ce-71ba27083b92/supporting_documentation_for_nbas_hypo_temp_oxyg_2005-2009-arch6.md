# Hypolimnion temperature and oxygen data from North Basin of Windermere 2005 to 2009. Feuchtmayr, H., De Ville, M.M., Fletcher, J.M., James, J.B., Thackeray, S.J. (2024)

## Overview
- Part of an ongoing long-term monitoring dataset with fortnightly sampling in the North Basin of Windermere, Cumbria, England.
- Variables: hypo_temp_c (hypolimnion temperature in °C) and hypo_DO_mgL (hypolimnion dissolved oxygen in mg/L).
- Timeframe: January 2005 – end of 2009.
- Measurement method: at a depth of 60–62 m, using a WTW oxi340i meter; lowered to the sediment and pulled back up ~0.5 m.
- Location: boat at a marked buoy in the deepest part of the lake.
- Data format: CSV available for download with columns Date, Hypo_temp_c, Hypo_DO_mgL (plus Description fields).

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling as part of the long-term Windermere monitoring program.

## Quality Control
- Data are raw and not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
- Double entered and visually checked.
- Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Data structure
- CSV file with columns:
  - Date: date of measurement
  - Hypo_temp_c: hypolimnion temperature in °C
  - Hypo_DO_mgL: hypolimnion dissolved oxygen in mg/L
  - Description fields corresponding to each variable (Date of measurement; Hypolimnion temperature; Hypolimnion DO)
