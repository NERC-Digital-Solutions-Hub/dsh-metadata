# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) nutrient exchange fluxes between sediment cores and overlying site water

- What the dataset measures
  - Fluxes of Oxygen, Non Purgeable Organic Carbon (NPOC), NOx, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Phosphate, and Silicate between sediment cores and overlying site water.
  - Observations derived from submerging sediment cores in seawater and measuring concentrations in the overlying water.

- Study sites and habitat context
  - Locations: Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands).
  - Site descriptions represent contrasting habitats and sediment types: saltmarsh and mudflat; Essex with clay soils vs Morecambe Bay with sandy soils.
  - Broad differences in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation between Essex and Morecambe Bay.

- Temporal coverage
  - Field sampling conducted during winter and summer campaigns in 2013.

- Sampling design and procedures
  - 12 quadrats sampled per site; sediment cores 8 cm in diameter used for incubation.
  - Cores incubated in tanks with locally collected seawater under daylight-simulating conditions.
  - Light and dark treatments to capture variability in fluxes due to photosynthesis/respiration.
  - Oxygen flux measured via Winkler titration after core acclimation and 90-minute incubation; headspace samples fixed and analyzed similarly.
  - Nutrient fluxes (NPOC, NOx, Ammonia, Nitrite, Nitrate, Phosphate, Silicate) measured from headspace water before and after a 3-hour incubation; samples filtered (0.2 μm) to remove microbes and particulates; autoanalyzers used for concentrations.

- Data values and interpretation
  - Fluxes expressed as rates per unit area (μmol/m2/hour).
  - Positive flux = sediment-to-overlying water; negative flux = overlying water-to-sediment.
  - Nitrate values derived from NOx and nitrite measurements.
  - All data rounded to appropriate units and converted to standardized flux units.

- Data formats and documentation
  - Nutrient and carbon concentrations collected as .txt files; calculations performed in Excel; final data provided as a CSV file.
  - Dataset includes a detailed field description table with: Row Number, Season (Winter/Summer), Location (Essex/Morecambe), Site (e.g., AH, FW, TM, CS, WS, WP), Habitat (Mudflat, Saltmarsh), Quadrat Number, Scale (A-D), and flux fields for Light/Dark O2, Light/Dark NPOC, Light/Dark Phosphate, Light/Dark Silicate, Light/Dark Ammonia, Light/Dark Nitrite, Light/Dark Nitrate/NOx.

- Calibration, quality control, and data processing
  - All instruments calibrated with appropriate standards; data quality control applied to autoanalyzers.
  - No anomalous data points removed from the dataset.
  - Data normalization includes adjusting fluxes for control (no-sediment) conditions and converting to flux per area; nitrate values calculated from NOx and nitrite.

- Referenced methodology
  - For detailed methodology and context, consult Thornton et al. (2007) on sediment-water inorganic nutrient exchange and nitrogen budgets in estuarine systems.

- Staff and provenance
  - Responsible personnel: Anne Cotton, Graham Underwood, John Green, Terry McGenity, and Alex Dumbrell.

- Data stewardship considerations
  - Ensures alignment with data governance principles: accurate metadata, consistent units and formats, clear provenance, and documentation of methods.
  - Document data collection context, site metadata, and experimental conditions to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Plan for updates, versioning, and appropriate sharing through relevant portals and catalogue holdings.
  - Be mindful of potential limitations due to seasonal variation, differences across sites, and the complexity of converting and aggregating flux data across multiple cores and treatments.
