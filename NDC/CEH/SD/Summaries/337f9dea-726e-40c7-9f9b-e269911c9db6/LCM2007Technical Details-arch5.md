# Land Cover Map 2007

- Overview
  - Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats to suit diverse user needs.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

- Data Formats and Coverage
  - Vector data
    - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing how this information was derived.
    - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectare.
    - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Raster data
    - Five raster products:
      - One 25 x 25 m raster providing the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel.
      - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters that summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
    - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
    - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK for both vector and raster products.

- Documentation and Metadata
  - Detailed metadata for LCM2007 raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Specific documentation sections referenced:
    - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
    - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
    - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

- Governance Implications for Data Stewards
  - Ensure alignment of data formats with user needs and maintainability across vector and raster products.
  - Verify metadata completeness and provenance as described in the Dataset Documentation.
  - Manage format-specific standards (e.g., shapefile attribute schemas and GeoTiff metadata) to support discoverability and reuse.
  - Handle data updates and provide access to the associated documentation to support data quality and interoperability.
