# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides UK land cover data in two primary formats: vector (parcel-based) and raster (pixel-based).
- Vector data is the most detailed, with polygons and attributes describing land cover and metadata on how the information was derived.
- Raster data comprises five products; includes a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel and four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarizing the 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata and documentation accompany both formats.

## Vector data

## Raster data
- Scales: 25 m pixel size (for the 25 x 25 m raster) and 1 km pixel size (for the four 1 x 1 km rasters)
- Supply Format: GeoTiff
- Coverage: UK
- Description: five raster products; a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel plus four 1 x 1 km rasters summarizing the 25 m raster
