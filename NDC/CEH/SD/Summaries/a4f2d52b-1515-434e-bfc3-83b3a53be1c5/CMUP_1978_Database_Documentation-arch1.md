# Terrestrial habitat and vegetation data from the marginal uplands of Cumbria, 1978

## Overview
- A survey of terrestrial habitats and vegetation in marginal uplands of Cumbria, England, conducted in 1978.
- 262 plots of 200 m2 each were surveyed using stratified sampling across the county.
- Data collected include vegetation (vascular plants, bryophytes, macro-lichens) and habitat characteristics; soils were collected but not documented or currently available.

## Geographic and Temporal Coverage
- Location: Cumbria, England.
- Time period: 1978.
- Privacy: Specific site locations are not provided to protect landowner privacy.

## Data Categories
- Vegetation data: vascular plants, bryophytes, macro-lichens (within 200 m2 plots; nested sampling with increasing quadrat sizes).
- Habitat data: habitat types within each plot and within the full 1 km square; slope and aspect measurements.
- Soil data: collected but not documented or accessible as of 2017.
- Growth forms and taxonomic details: includes growth form codes (e.g., aq, b, f, fe, g, l, ma, m, s, ss, w) and BRC species codes.

## Survey Design & Methods
- Sampling framework: based on an environmental classification of Cumbria (1975) with 16 strata; marginal uplands represented by strata 9–12.
- Site selection: 52 one-kilometre squares selected as survey sites; each square contains 5 plots of 200 m2.
- Vegetation sampling: nested quadrat system recording species at 4 m2, 25 m2, 50 m2, 100 m2, and the full 200 m2; new species are recorded as quadrats increase in size.
- Habitat sampling: pre-defined habitat categories recorded both within plots and across the whole 1 km square; slope measured with a clinometer; aspect measured with a Silva compass.
- Plot distribution: 262 plots distributed randomly with 5 plots per 1 km square.

## Original Purpose and Applications
- Built on a 1975 environmental classification to enable predictions and monitoring of changes in marginal uplands (33% of Cumbria) due to agricultural practices.
- Aimed to enable ecological classification, monitoring, and potential predictive analyses of vegetation, habitats, and environmental parameters over time.

## Access and Usage Notes
- Soil data not documented or available in this dataset (as of 2017).
- The dataset provides a detailed, standardized framework for analyzing marginal upland vegetation and habitat relationships, suitable for cross-referencing with other Cumbria datasets and for ecological classification or monitoring studies.
