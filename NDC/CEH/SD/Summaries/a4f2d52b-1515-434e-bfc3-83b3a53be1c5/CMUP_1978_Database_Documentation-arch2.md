# Dataset Summary

- Dataset Name: Terrestrial habitat and vegetation data from the marginal uplands of Cumbria, 1978

- Description: Survey of terrestrial habitats and vegetation in marginal upland areas of Cumbria. 262 plots of 200 m2 were sampled using stratified sampling with standardized methods to record plant species, habitat types, major biota, and soils (soils data documented here but not available as of 12/9/2017).

- Geographic Coverage: Cumbria, England

- Time Period: 1978

- Data Categories
  - Vegetation data: vascular plants, bryophytes, lichens
  - Habitat data: habitat categories (within plots and within 1 km squares), slope, aspect
  - Soils: collected but not documented here / not currently available

- Survey Design & Methods
  - Stratified sampling across the county; marginal areas represented by selected land class strata
  - Sample frame: 16 strata (1975 framework); marginal strata 9, 10, 11, 12
  - 52 one-kilometre squares selected; within each, 5 plots of 200 m2
  - Vegetation data collected with a nested quadrat system: 4 m2 → 25 m2 → 50 m2 → 100 m2 → 200 m2
  - Habitat data recorded both inside plots and for the whole 1 km square; precise habitat class definitions provided
  - Slope measured with clinometer; aspect measured with Silva compass
  - Plot location within squares selected at random; all vascular plants, bryophytes, and macro-lichens recorded
  - Growth forms and species lists compiled (Appendix 1 lists species)

- Data Management
  - Data management by C. Wood, Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, Lancaster

- Original Purpose
  - Build on 1975 environmental classification of Cumbria to monitor changes in marginal uplands (approximately 33% of Cumbria)
  - Enable predictions and monitoring of vegetation, fauna, and soils changes due to agricultural practices in marginal areas

- Note on Privacy and Access
  - Specific site locations are not provided to protect landowner privacy
  - Some soils data are not documented here and may not be available

- Key Concepts for Monitoring Analysts
  - Standardized, stratified sampling framework with hierarchical vegetation sampling
  - Clear documentation of methods (nested quadrats, habitat typing, slope/aspect measurements)
  - Well-defined data products and cross-references to related Cumbria datasets
  - Emphasis on data provenance, quality, and access through appropriate portals
