# Collection/generation methods

- Overview
  - Wild field voles (Microtus agrestis) trapped in Kielder Forest, Northumberland, UK, across 2015–2017.
  - Seven sampling sites (initially four per session, with reassignment leading to seven sites total); 46 trapping sessions at ~2-week intervals; traps checked morning and afternoon.
  - Voles tagged with PIT tags on first capture; a range of morphometric, demographic, and infection data collected; blood samples stored for molecular analyses.
  - Data are organized in a dataset file long_blood_qpcr_FV.2.csv with extensive metadata and assays, including gene expression and pathogen screening.

- What was collected
  - Field data per capture: site, date, session, grid treatment, trap counts, operator, times on grid/out, trap ID, species, chip ID, capture status, age, sex, reproductive state, body mass, body length, fat scores, parasite counts (mites, ticks, fleas), and treatment status.
  - Biological samples: tail blood (up to 50 µl) stored in RNAlater (-20°C briefly, then -80°C).
  - Gene expression data: relative concentrations for a panel of immune-related genes generated by SYBR Green qPCR (including AR, CD8A, FOXP3, GATA3, IL10, IL17, IL1B, IL4, INFG, ORAI1, plus many others listed across qPCR plates 1–3).
  - Endogenous controls and standards: Ywhaz and Actb as reference genes; calibrator sample created from pooled splenocyte cDNA; additional synthetic calibrators used for some genes (Tollip, Il1rap, Irf2).
  - Pathogen data: infections by Babesia microti (18S) and Bartonella spp. (16S) measured by SYBR Green qPCR; cross-validation with RNA-Seq-derived pathogen reads in a subset (n = 44).

- Data structure and content
  - Dataset: long_blood_qpcr_FV.2.csv containing fields such as bloodNum, site, dateCapt, session, gridTreat, trapsOut, trapsWorking, ope, timeGrid, timeOut, trap, species, chip, NRW, alive, age, sex, repro, bodyW, bodyLen, pelvCond, dorslCond, bodyCond, parasite counts (miteLaela, miteListro, miteMyo, tick, flea), treatment info (treat, frontline, profender), tailNum, enteredBy, entryDate, year, and numerous qPCR expression fields (e.g., AR, CD8A, FOXP3, GATA3, IL10, IL17, IL1B, IL4, INFG, ORAI1, plus many other gene targets across plates 1–3).
  - Units and scales: body mass (g), body length (mm), fat scores (1–5), gene expression as relative quantities (RQ values via ΔΔCt), pathogen loads as qPCR-based relative measures; plate and well-level controls noted.

- Experimental design and sampling regime
  - Longitudinal component: live sampling of individuals across multiple time points.
  - Cross-sectional component: sampling following culling at selected times.
  - Trapping setup: grid layouts with 3–5 m spacing; large numbers of traps per site; consistent trapping effort across the study.

- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
  - Field: live trapping with Ugglan traps; sampling across seven forest clear-cut sites.
  - Laboratory: SYBR Green qPCR assays to quantify immune gene expression; standardization with in-house designed primers; RNA extraction from splenocytes in RNAlater; cDNA synthesis with DNase treatment; 384-well plate automation (Pipetmax) and QuantStudio 6-flex real-time PCR system.
  - Data processing: ΔΔCt method for relative expression, with plate-specific calibrators to normalize across runs; quality checks via melt curves and amplification plots; duplicate/ triplicate replication and controls on each plate.

- Calibration and quality assurance
  - Primer validation: de novo design with validation for specific amplification and ~100 ± 10% PCR efficiency.
  - Endogenous controls: Ywhaz and Actb for normalization.
  - Calibrators: main pooled calibrator sample (from splenocytes across site) plus synthetic fragments for underrepresented targets ( Tollip, Il1rap, Irf2) to ensure robust quantification.
  - Plate design: three standard plate layouts used across plates; samples spread across plate triplets to avoid confounding plate with sampling group.
  - Data processing: gene expression values reported as RQ (relative quantity) via ΔΔCt using calibrators; extensive per-well QC with inspection of melting curves and amplification plots.
  - Pathogen validation: infection data for Babesia microti and Bartonella spp. validated by comparison with independent pathogen reads from RNA-Seq; strong concordance observed (r^2 ≈ 0.81 for both pathogens).

- Data availability and documentation
  - Data collection and analysis methods are linked to primary publications:
    - Jackson et al. 2011. The Analysis of Immunological Profiles in Wild Animals: A Case Study on Immunodynamics in the Field Vole, Microtus agrestis. Molecular Ecology.
    - Wanelik et al. 2019; 2021 preprints/blogs describing related immune and pathogen findings.
  - The dataset is intended for upload to data portals and catalogues, with metadata to support discovery, reuse, and replication.
  - Documentation includes explicit field definitions, units, and processing steps to enable data users to interpret gene expression results and pathogen data consistently.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewardship
  - Potential gaps between user needs and available dataset scope; need to capture, maintain, and communicate data provenance and context.
  - Timeliness of data sharing and ensuring data creators adhere to metadata and formatting standards.
  - Integration across multiple systems and formats; handling large volumes of combined field, lab, and omics data.
  - Legacy databases and bespoke, non-interoperable solutions may be required for certain components; emphasises need for standardized data governance and update mechanisms.

- Reuse and provenance
  - The dataset supports analyses of immunological profiles and pathogen infections in wild voles; linked to broader work on immune expression, life-history outcomes, and host–pathogen dynamics.
  - Primary references provide methodological context and validation for QPCR workflows and infection assessments.
