# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview

- Provides UK-wide data in two formats: vector and raster.
- Vector data: most detailed product; each polygon corresponds to a land cover parcel with attributes and metadata on derivation; minimum mapping unit is 0.5 ha; supply format is ESRI Shapefile.
- Raster data: five products; a 25 x 25 m raster assigns the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m data; metadata available in the dataset documentation; supply format is GeoTiff.

## Data Formats and Access

- Vector: ESRI Shapefile; UK coverage; includes land cover attributes and metadata describing derivation.
- Raster: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes; 25 m raster with Broad Habitat per pixel; 1 km rasters summarize the 25 m data; GeoTiff format; UK coverage.

## Documentation and Metadata

- Detailed metadata and attribute definitions are provided in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Tables available in the documentation:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat subclasses.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Considerations

- Supports data governance through defined formats, scale options, and provenance via metadata.
- Enables discovery and reuse by providing distinct representations (detailed vector vs generalized rasters) and comprehensive documentation.
- Important to maintain metadata completeness and ensure interoperability across systems and portals.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards

- Ensure proper cataloging of both vector (Shapefile) and raster (GeoTiff) formats.
- Verify alignment with internal standards for attributes and metadata; reference Tables 1–3 for attribute definitions and raster metadata.
- Manage updates and versioning by tracking changes documented in the dataset documentation.
