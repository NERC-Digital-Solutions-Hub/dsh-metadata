# Land Cover Map 2007

- Overview
  - Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) provides land cover information for the UK in both vector and raster formats to suit different user needs and monitoring applications.
  - Includes metadata detailing how information was derived to support transparency and reuse.

- Data formats and coverage
  - Vector data
    - Most detailed product: polygons representing land parcels with attributes describing land cover and derivation metadata.
    - Minimum mapped unit: 0.5 hectares.
    - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
    - Coverage: United Kingdom.
  - Raster data
    - Five raster products in total.
    - 25 x 25 m raster indicating the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
    - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 x 25 m raster.
    - Supply format: GeoTIff.
    - Coverage: United Kingdom.
    - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.

- Metadata and documentation
  - Detailed metadata and attribute descriptions are available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Tables available in the documentation:
    - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
    - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
    - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets.

- Use for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides structured and interoperable land cover data to inform policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decisions.
  - Vector data offers detailed, provenance-rich information; raster data provides scalable summaries suitable for broad monitoring metrics.
  - Metadata and documentation support data governance, quality assessment, and appropriate data sharing and reuse.

- Practical considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
  - Leverage both formats: use vector data for detailed analyses and raster data for broad habitat change assessments.
  - Reference and validate against the provided dataset documentation and attribute tables.
  - Ensure alignment with data governance, openness, and metadata standards when incorporating into monitoring reports and dashboards.
