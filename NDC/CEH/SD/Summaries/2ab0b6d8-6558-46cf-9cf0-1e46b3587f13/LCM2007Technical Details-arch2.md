# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Formats and coverage

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata describing how the information was derived
  - Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 ha
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
  - Coverage: UK

- Raster data
  - Five raster products
  - 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarise the 25 x 25 m raster
  - Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel size
  - Supply format: GeoTiff
  - Coverage: UK

## Relevance for environmental monitoring (analyst perspective)

- Provides standardized, UK-wide land cover data suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time
- Enables data quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation through well-defined metadata and standard formats (Shapefile, GeoTiff)
- Supports multiple outputs (reports, maps, charts) and can be stored/uploaded to portals for sharing and reuse
- Dual formats (vector and raster) support a range of analyses and integration with other datasets to increase data value and facilitate data access.
