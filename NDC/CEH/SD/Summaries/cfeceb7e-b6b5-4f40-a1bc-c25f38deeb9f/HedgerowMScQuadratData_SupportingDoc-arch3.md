# Plant community basal data from a hedgerow cutting experiment in England, 2016

- Purpose and context
  - A dataset from an MSc project using the Hedgerow long-running experiments to study how hedgerow cutting regimes affect species richness of basal flora.
  - Data underpin a publication (Stanbury et al., 2020) on hedgerow management and its relevance to agri-environment schemes (ELS and HLS).

- Experimental design and aims
  - Study type: randomised block experiment (Experiment 2) examining cutting regime effects on basal flora richness.
  - Factors and levels (full factorial, 2 × 2 × 3):
    - Time of cutting: autumn (and late winter in some treatments within the design, but autumn-focused treatments are highlighted)
    - Intensity of cutting: standard cut back to old cut line vs incremental raising of cutter bar (about +10 cm per cut)
    - Frequency of cutting: annual, every two years, every three years
  - Sites: four hedgerow sites in England (WO, WB, WC, YC) with different dominant species; coordinates provided.
  - Duration: cutting treatments applied from September 2010 to January/February 2016; winter cutting not applied at WB due to site limitations.
  - Replication: three replicates of each treatment per site, contiguous hedgerow sections 15–20 m long.

- Field data collection and scope
  - Data collected on plant communities to assess biodiversity outcomes (flower production, berry yield, pollinator use, invertebrate abundance and structure) relevant to habitat quality and resources.
  - Plot sampling design: two quadrats per side of each plot (inner and outer), each 1 m wide × 10 m long; sampling up to 80 cm height.
  - Quadrat placement: inner quadrat toward hedge center; outer quadrat adjacent to hedge; spacing to minimize edge effects.
  - Data recorded: percent cover of each species (rounded to nearest 5% for 5–100%, nearest 1% for 1–4%; <1% recorded as 0.1%).
  - Quality controls: standard protocol; field data collected by qualified surveyors; expert verification of species lists; data checks for anomalies.

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Primary data file: HedgerowMScQuadratData.csv
  - Key columns (high level): EXPERIMENT, SITE, BLOCK_NO, PLOT_NO, TREATMENT, VISIT_DATE, VISIT_YEAR, QUADRAT, SPECIES_NAME, COVER
  - SITE codes: WB (Waddesdon Blackthorn), WC (Waddesdon mixed), WO (Woburn), YC (Yarcombe)
  - VISIT_YEAR indicates the year of sampling (2016 in the described dataset)
  - TAXONOMIC scope includes species names, bare ground, and plant litter; fine-grained cover data per quadrat/species

- Data quality and provenance
  - Documented quality controls: standardized protocol, experienced surveyors, expert species list verification, anomaly checks.
  - Data provenance linked to Defra project BD2114; managed by UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH); funding and student support acknowledged.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation
  - Provides empirical measures of habitat quality and plant community responses to different hedgerow management regimes.
  - Enables evaluation of policy options within agri-environment schemes (ELS/HLS) by comparing species richness of basal flora under varied cutting regimes.
  - Supports development of indicators related to hedgerow biodiversity, flowering resources, and herbaceous/woody plant community structure.
  - Metadata-rich dataset facilitating data sharing, reproducibility, and transparent governance (subject to any access restrictions noted in the full record).
