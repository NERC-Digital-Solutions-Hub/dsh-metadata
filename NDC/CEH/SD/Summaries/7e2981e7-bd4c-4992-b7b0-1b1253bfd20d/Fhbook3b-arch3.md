# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish guidelines for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) data collection to monitor environmental change, support policy, and inform future decisions.
  - Builds on CS1990 with standardized methods to achieve time-series consistency and alignment with national biodiversity and sustainability objectives.

- Context for monitoring frameworks
  - Emphasizes repeatable, standardized field recording to enable robust trend analysis.
  - Integrates a two-tier approach: ground-truth field data with remote sensing and broader habitat classifications.
  - Aims to support government and agency policy needs (e.g., biodiversity action plans, sustainability indicators).

- Sampling framework and design (highlights)
  - Re-surveys 508 squares from CS1990; planned to total around 568 squares in 1998.
  - Representational strategy across six country units with subdivisions for land classes to ensure coverage and comparability.
  - Mix of re-sampled time-series squares and newly defined class squares; upland sampling proposed.

- Planning, logistics, and field operations
  - Six teams handling approximately 95 squares each; typical survey duration per square around four days.
  - Flexible scheduling, travel logistics, and cost control; prioritizes minimizing revisits.
  - Old squares surveyed in the same sequence as 1990; new squares mapped alongside nearby existing squares when feasible.

- Equipment, access, and permissions
  - Comprehensive field provisioning (FABs, GPS, maps, safety gear, marking plates, cameras, etc.).
  - Landowner permissions required; proactive communication and on-site verification essential before proceeding.

- Data recording, coding, and mapping
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) consolidates data collection for a square, including ownership, physiography, vegetation, and land use.
  - Mapping approaches balance change detection with de novo mapping, using two habitat frameworks: Mappable Broad Habitats (lowland) and Plottable Broad Habitats (upland).
  - CS1990 mapping codes retained for new squares; results from 1990 inform 1998 change assessments in old squares.
  - Use of theme maps, BAP maps, and data-recording forms to align field observations with national reporting needs.
  - Extensive vegetation coding system (including numerous species and mosses/lichens) with standardized procedures for relocation, recording, and uncertainty handling.
  - GPS data collection included as an Annex to improve precision and repeatability of plot relocation.

- Plots and plot types (sampling designs)
  - Multiple plot types with explicit relocation and recording protocols to minimize overlap and ensure consistent spacing.
  - Plot families include: X PLOTS (main vegetation mapping), Y PLOTS (targeted vegetation sampling), U PLOTS (unclosed habitats), B PLOTS (boundaries), A PLOTS (arable field margins), H PLOTS (hedgerows), D PLOTS (hedgerow diversity), S/W PLOTS (streams/watersides), and R/V PLOTS (roadsides/verges).
  - Each plot type specifies relocation, layout, marking, and recording rules, emphasizing GPS/plate-based relocation and non-overlapping placement.

- Data quality and species identification
  - Standardized species lists (e.g., ~200-species quick list) with sections for unlisted species.
  - Consistent nomenclature and observation protocols to minimize observer error.
  - Emphasis on documentation of uncertainties and reproducible identification decisions.

- Vegetation recording, plots, and relocation
  - Areal plots, nested plots, and detailed plot sketches to ensure precise relocation.
  - Systematic recording of non-crop vegetation near margins, hedgerows, streams, and other features.
  - Relocation relies on metal marker plates, ground plans, GPS when feasible, and field sketches.

- Ponds, erosion, and supplementary studies
  - Ponds data aligned with Lowland Pond Survey 1996; ongoing documentation of pond presence and changes since 1990.
  - Erosion studies (MAFF-led) to document erosion and sedimentation; field methods log erosion scars within X plots and are integrated into national sedimentation assessments.

- Species identification and data quality control
  - Stable rules for species identification, with acceptable combinations for closely related taxa when exact IDs are difficult.
  - Observer consistency and standardization across teams to minimize measurement error.

- Annexes and supplementary materials
  - Annex 1 outlines GPS data collection, including setup, logging, file naming conventions, and data quality checks.
  - Background notes connect CS2000 to broader policy and environmental monitoring contexts.

- Section 10- Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Three sampling types:
    - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna, and microbiology (processed at ITE Merlewood).
    - Calluna sampling: assessment of foliar nitrogen in Calluna vulgaris to explore correlations with nitrogen deposition; 30–50 g of current-year growth per sample, mailed to ITE Merlewood.
    - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff in coordination with field teams.
  - Detailed collection procedures for soil cores, packaging, and dispatch instructions to ITE Merlewood; strict post and transport logistics to preserve sample integrity.

- Section 11- Photography
  - One camera per team; film and stock replenishment; photograph every vegetation plot.
  - Photographs must include square/plot identifiers and clear reference features; composition guidelines emphasize visible markers and landmarks.

- Section 12- Procedures after survey
  - Post-survey data checks to ensure completeness; avoid transcription unless essential.
  - Arrangements to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex 1 - Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step guidance on battery power, satellite visibility (PDOP target < 6), stationary vs moving feature logging, and file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Instructions for data logging, error checks, and handling obstructions; guidance on using GPS keypad and recording frequency.

- Endnote on monitoring value
  - CS2000 formalizes a robust, repeatable framework for long-term environmental monitoring across GB, enabling trend analysis, policy support, and biodiversity assessments.
  - Balances change detection with de novo mapping, integrates broad habitat frameworks with detailed plot-based sampling, and provides detailed field protocols to maintain data comparability across years and sites.
