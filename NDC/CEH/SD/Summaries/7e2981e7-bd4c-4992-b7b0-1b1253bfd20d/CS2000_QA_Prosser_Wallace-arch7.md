# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- AQuality Assurance (QA) assessment of CS2000 fieldwork was conducted on a sub-sample of squares to measure consistency and reliability across plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover estimates, landcover mapping, and change detection.
- 38 of 519 squares were selected; one quarter of each square was resurveyed, covering 234 plots across nine CS2000 plot types.

## Aims

- Quantify accuracy of CS2000 field recording and comment on change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency.
- Explain differences in terms of observer error, plot location/relocation, plot type, management and seasonal effects.
- Relate CS2000 QA findings to the CS1990 baseline.

## Methods and Scope

- QA sample: 38 squares (one quarter resurveyed); 234 plots analyzed; 34 of the squares were included in the CS1990 QA sub-sample.
- Plot types include quadrats (various sizes), road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and arable margins; a limited number of new arable plots were discussed but not deeply analyzed due to small sample.
- Plate and plot relocation, landcover and boundary feature recording, and change recording were examined using Annex A/B protocols and CS2000 survey metadata.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation and Plate Recovery
- Plot relocation success: about 86.7% of full searches could relocate all plots; CS2000 relocation efficiency varied by plot type.
- Surveyors accurately relocated about 60% of plots; roughly 25% relocated to an acceptable extent; ~15% inadequately relocated (notably Y-plots at 23% failure).
- Plate recovery by QA assessors: about 69.3% of CS2000 plates located; eight-year relocation was demonstrated as feasible though not perfect, with some misplacements (e.g., wrong boundary side, wrong bank of a stream).
- Overall interpretation: relocation is possible after eight years, but consistency is variable; total recovery estimates suggest a substantial portion of plates/plots could not be re-located exactly.

### Species Concordance and Plot-Level Accuracy
- About 71% of CS2000 species records were confirmed by QA assessors; around 2% non-concordances due to management or seasonal changes.
- Initial recording accuracy in 1998 QA approximately 73%, slightly lower than the CS1990 QA (~78%), largely due to plot relocation and mis-location issues.
- Detailed mis-match analysis shows mis-identifications, overlooking species, and plot orientation/location as major error sources.

### Vegetation Cover Estimates
- For the 30 most frequent, appreciable-cover species, several cover estimates differed significantly between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors (some seasonal effects evident).
- Overall agreement on cover levels was reasonable (notably improved in some species) but notable discrepancies remained for certain grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens).

### Direction of Vegetation Change
- DECORANA ordination axis shifts between original survey and QA were generally insignificant.
- No reliable directional bias detected in the direction of change across plot types or landclasses.

### Landcover Mapping and Codes
- Landcover codes categorized into primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes.
- Concordance between CS2000 and QA:
  - Primary landcover codes: 88% agreement.
  - BAP codes: 77% agreement.
  - Primary boundary codes: 85% agreement.
  - Principal qualifying landcover codes: 73% agreement.
  - Boundary qualifiers: 83% agreement.
- When comparing primary landcover codes excluding BAP codes: overall concordance about 91.6%; including BAP codes yields about 87.5%.
- Landuse sample points (species awarded cover): overall concordance around 63%; some species (e.g., Lolium perenne, Dactylis glomerata) showed notable discrepancies in cover assignments.
- Boundary features (walls, hedges): high consistency for boundary features; primary boundary codes showed total concordance around 85%, with code concordance around 92%.

### Change in Land Use and Change Concordance
- Changes recorded between 1990 CS and CS2000 showed substantial inconsistency:
  - Overall change concurrence: 51.4%.
  - Change not noted by CS2000: 33.9%.
  - Change recorded but not substantiated by assessors: 14.7%.
- A large portion of changes since 1990 may have been missed or not correctly coded, suggesting caution when using CS2000 change data for trend analysis.

### Hedge Diversity and Boundary Details
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Mean number of species per hedge-related plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
- Hedge boundary coding and hedge shape classification showed moderate agreement, with some difficulties in applying new hedge codes.

### Arable Plots
- Only five arable plots; concordance was poor (approx. 30.6% agreement for species presence/absence across TI vs T2).
- Seasonal variation and operator unfamiliarity with ruderal/arable weeds contributed to high mis-match rates.
- Recommendation: for arable margins, plan at least two visits to reduce mis-recording and seasonal bias.

## Synthesis and Implications for GIS Data Products

- Data quality variances exist across plot relocation, species identification, and cover estimation, which can impact map accuracy and change-detection analyses.
- Landcover mapping shows high to very high concordance for primary codes and boundaries, supporting reliable map products at broad scales; BAP and certain descriptor codes benefit from stricter application or revised protocols.
- Change detection at landscape scale should be treated with caution due to substantial non-concurrence between CS2000 and QA assessments.
- Boundary and hedge data are relatively robust, but occasional coding inconsistencies (e.g., hedge types, boundary height, stockproof status) highlight the need for clear, updated code usage and field verification procedures.
- For GIS workflows, archived CS2000 QA results emphasize the importance of:
  - Documenting plot relocation accuracy and potential positional errors.
  - Maintaining consistent coding schemes and providing ongoing training on difficult taxa and boundary features.
  - Incorporating multi-temporal QA checks when using change statistics for policy-relevant analyses.
  - Planning multi-visit surveys for arable margins and other seasonally variable habitats to reduce mis-recording.

## Notable Quantitative Highlights

- Plot relocation: 86.7% plots satisfactorily relocated; 60% accurately relocated; ~15% inadequately relocated; 23% failure for Y-plots.
- Plate recovery: 69.3% plates located by QA assessors; eight-year relocation feasible but imperfect.
- Species concordance: 71% of records confirmed; ~2% mis-concordances due to management/seasonal effects.
- Vegetation cover: mixed but generally decent agreement; several species show significant cover differences between CS2000 and QA.
- Change concordance: 51.4% overall; 33.9% not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated.
- Landcover codes: primary codes 88% concordance; BAP codes 77%; overall primary land cover agreement 87.5% (excluding BAP), 91.6% (excluding BAP) when assessed separately.
- Hedge diversity: 124 total species; 74.2% agreement; mean species per plot 5.89 (QA) vs 5.16 (CS2000).
