# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Purpose and scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and assess the reliability of change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and region.
- Relate QA findings to previous comparative work (ITE surveys).
- Recommend methodological changes to improve accuracy and confidence of future statistics.

## Background and context
- Field investigations involve many recorders; some variation is expected despite training and supervision.
- Prior QA exercises (1989 pilot, 1990 autumn QA, 1990 training course) highlighted difficulties in plot relocation, species recognition, and observer bias.
- Emphasis on separating true ecological change from recording error to avoid misinterpreting trends.

## Methods and approach
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; two independent assessors used original sketch maps for plot relocation.
  - 1991: Expanded to 1-km squares from 32 terrain classes; included photographs to aid relocation; self-assessment with group squares.
- Plot types and sampling:
  - Six main plot types (Quadrats: 200 m² X-plots, 4 m² Y-plots; Linear plots; Road verges; Hedges; Streamsides; Boundaries).
  - One quarter of each square resurveyed to include all plot types; landcover/feature points recorded.
  - Plates used to mark quadrats; relocation also tested for plates and features.
- Data and comparisons:
  - Species lists compared between time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2) using several concordance indices.
  - Coverage estimates (percent cover) for species recorded at both times analyzed.
- Key metrics:
  - Percentage agreement: common species divided by combined total (T1 + T2).
  - Agreement: common species divided by total recorded at time 1.
  - Similarity/accuracy metrics: derived from T1 and T2 data to gauge reliability.
  - Initial efficiency of recording (percentage accuracy) after removing T2 errors.
- Additional analyses:
  - DECORANA (first axis) to assess ecological gradient shifts between years.
  - ANOVA to test differences by plot type and landclass (lowland vs upland).

## Major findings

### Overall data quality and concordance
- Overall concordance across plots (focusing on species lists) around 60.9% to 74% depending on method and data-cleaning steps.
- Initial QA (Autumn 1990) showed around 60% agreement; full 1990 QA reported higher alignment after adjustments.
- The 1991 reassessment (with photographs) demonstrated a highly significant increase in species number per plot (1990 mean ~20.7–20.9 vs 1991 ~23.4), indicating real seasonal/annual differences and improved detection, not just better recording.

### Sources of variation (types of error)
- A: Mis-identifications (T1 errors)
- B: Species overlooked on the initial survey (T1 omissions)
- C: Over-zealous recording (recording beyond plot boundaries)
- D: Seasonal/annual changes affecting species presence
- E/F: Management changes or crop/season effects
- G/H: Plot mis-location or mis-orientation at T2
- I/J: Locational mismatches or “overlooked” species at T2
- Overall, seasonality and relocation difficulties contributed substantially to differences; mis-identifications and mis-location were major contributors.

### Plot relocation and plate effectiveness
- Plate relocation success improved in 1991; plates found in autumn 1990 were about 71% successful on a 5-minute search; 1991 results showed varying recovery rates, with plates and plots showing different recoveries by plot type.
- X-plots and road verges relatively easier to relocate; Y-plots (smaller plots) most challenging; recommendation to better mark or orient these plots.

### Species-level and land-use patterns
- Some species showed genuine population changes between years (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis, Alliaria petiolata, Holcus lanatus). Others appeared affected by under-recording in 1990 (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).
- Smaller, less prevalent species were more prone to mis-match; bryophytes and certain grasses were particularly challenging; recommendation to enhance bryophyte coverage in training and QA.
- By landclass:
  - Lowland arable (LC) had notably lower recording accuracy compared with other landclasses; uplifted by growing season changes and higher species diversity.
  - Overall, upland plots (UP) tended to be more stable, with less seasonal effect.
- Mapping and codes:
  - Primary land-use codes were generally reliable (high concordance ~88–95% across comparisons).
  - Boundary codes were less consistent (around 80–83%), with difficulties magnified when multiple assessors or season changes were involved.
  - Qualifiers and more granular boundary codes contributed to interpretive variation.

### Mapping vegetation and cover conformity
- For vegetation cover, concordance at nine-point grids showed variability:
  - Some dominant species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica, Festuca spp.) showed significant but limited changes in cover between years.
  - Overall, high concordance for dominant species at a point but much lower concordance for co-dominants.
- The study recommended reducing emphasis on detailed cover of many species and focusing on the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.

### Ecological axis shifts and interpretation
- DECORANA first-axis scores indicated shifts consistent with previously detected land-use changes, with some year-to-year variation likely due to drought and climatic differences.
- Across plot types, axis shifts generally aligned with expected trajectories (e.g., upland vs lowland gradients), though the magnitude varied by landclass.

## Recommendations and guidance for data management

### Data collection and QA process
- QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey date to minimize variation due to seasonal changes.
- Use photographs to re-establish exact plot positions; annotate photographs with plot context and distances to features.
- Maintain and annotate metal plates for plot locations where feasible; allocate additional manpower for relocation in unenclosed/more remote areas.
- Include clear plotting aids for Y plots (4 m²) with precise orientation and measurement; consider standard tape-based layout and fixed SE corner placement.

### Documentation, codes, and metadata
- Review and refine land-use coding to reduce ambiguity:
  - Subdivide upland grassland codes (e.g., upland grassland vs upland improved meadow/pasture).
  - Add a distinct lowland rush pasture code.
  - Recognize and codify lowland/wet heath as distinct vegetation types.
  - Limit boundary codes to hedges and associated descriptive qualifiers; reserve more detailed land-use qualifiers for mapping context.
- Simplify coverage coding to emphasize the most prevalent species per parcel; reduce reliance on extensive cover data to improve reproducibility.
- Improve definitions for challenging categories (e.g., marsh, moorland, bog) to reduce misclassification.
- Enhance guidance for bryophyte inclusion and identification; align with vegetation classifications and improve early QA focus on bryophytes and grasses with subtle distinctions.
- Capture provenance and QA metadata:
  - Record whether QA data come from same-year or different-year surveys.
  - Document plot relocation success, plate status, and any photograph-assisted re-positioning.

### Training and workforce
- Emphasize field-characteristics to distinguish similar taxa (especially grasses) during training.
- Provide habitat-specific species lists and identification aids, including vegetative traits for common grasses.
- Ensure field handbook and code lists are aligned; reduce ambiguity to minimize mis-codings.

## Practical implications for data governance and stewardship

- Standardization and reproducibility:
  - The study underscores the need for rigorous, standardized field procedures, consistent coding schemes, and explicit metadata to support data reuse and trend analysis.
- Provenance and audit trails:
  - Document QA activities, year alignment, plot relocation aids (plates, photos), and changes to methods to support auditability and data lineage.
- Data quality metrics:
  - Maintain quantitative quality indicators (e.g., percentage accuracy, agreement indices, relocation success rates) in data catalogs to inform downstream users about data confidence and limitations.
- Code and metadata governance:
  - Implement updated codebooks reflecting new codes (e.g., upland vs lowland subdivisions, river/wetland classifications) and ensure historical data can be mapped to updated schemes.
- Resource planning:
  - Recognize the resources required for relocation in difficult terrains and plan for additional staffing and equipment when conducting large-area, multi-year vegetation surveys.

## Conclusions

- Photographs and precise plot-location aids substantially improve the relocation and recording accuracy, particularly in unenclosed areas.
- Season and year alignment significantly affect species presence/absence data; QA should be tightly coupled to the timing of the original survey.
- While primary land-use mapping codes are robust, boundary and finer descriptors require clearer definitions and training.
- The QA highlights the value of targeted training, standardized methodologies, and streamlined, reproducible data coding to support reliable ecological statistics and long-term land-use monitoring.
