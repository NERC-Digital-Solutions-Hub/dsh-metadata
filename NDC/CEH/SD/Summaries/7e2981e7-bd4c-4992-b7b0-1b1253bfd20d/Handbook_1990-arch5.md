# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Purpose and scope
- Aim: update land-use datasets, monitor ecological changes, and provide current, comparable data for scientific evaluation and policy planning.
- Foundation: standardized field recording across multiple years (1977/78, 1984, 1988) with a planned resurvey in 1990 and enhancements such as satellite imagery linkage.
- Output: a harmonized dataset describing land use, vegetation, landscape features, and habitat types, enabling change detection and landscape-scale analyses.

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Emphasis on standardization, quality control, and clear documentation to ensure data usability across observers and over time.
- Data collection is conducted by six ITE Research Stations, with permanent markers and repeatable plot locations to support long-term comparability.
- Ownership, permissions, and stakeholder engagement are integral (farmer/landowner information, access permissions, and updating ownership records).
- Data handling lifecycle: data captured in Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), supplemented by maps, aerial imagery, photographs, and later consolidated and archived at ITE Merlewood.
- Data quality challenges highlighted: incomplete user needs, timely data delivery, diverse systems/ formats, large or difficult-to-transfer datasets, and field-based variability in recording.

## Data collection framework and standards

### Data types and components
- Mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling constitute the core data elements; biodiversity data include vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens.
- Physiography, inland water bodies, coastal features, boundaries, and land-cover types are captured with structured coding.
- Woodlands/forests, hedgerows, fences, walls, buildings/structures, and transport infrastructure (roads/verges/footpaths) are systematically codified.
- Special modules for ownership, farmer/landowner information, and human-use designations (designated/non-designated recreation areas) are included.

### Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and data coding
- FABs are central to data capture; each square is documented with a consistent page structure, including ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, and boundary details.
- Data codes are extensive and hierarchical:
  - Primary and secondary codes for land cover, vegetation types, and boundary features.
  - Alpha and numeric codes compactly represent complex attribute combinations (e.g., boundary type and condition).
  - Codes distinguish current vs. no longer present features, and differentiate real ground truth from API-derived guidance.
- Emphasis on neat, legible data entry; pencil use is encouraged for erasability; careful, on-site coding to reduce later lab adjustments.

### Plot design and sampling design
- Large vegetation plots: 200 m2 (two nested 4 m2 subplots within) to capture detailed vegetation structure and composition.
- Five large quadrats plus five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) per square, distributed across different land-cover types to cover habitat diversity.
- Linear plots: up to 5 per square (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) to capture boundary vegetation and linear habitat variation.
- Boundary/plausible relocation logic: predefined rules for relocating plots if land use changes or boundaries disappear; 10 m minimum separation between plots to avoid overlap.
- Five small quadrats placed in five different semi-natural or natural land-cover types in each square, with locations determined after mapping land cover types.
- Permanent markers: metal plates placed to enable future relocation; field sketches and measurements recorded for precise localization.

### Vegetation recording and species data
- Detailed procedures for recording plant species in nested quadrats; a core list of around 200 common species is used, with provisions for unlisted species.
- Percent cover estimated in 5% bands; multiple layers allowed; dominant and mosaic cover captured with coded combinations.
- Combination codes are allowed for closely related species when identification is uncertain; bryophytes and lichens are recorded using a restricted list.
- Color and diagrammatic conventions are provided to manage complex mosaics and to minimize data confusion in the field and lab.

### Aerial photography interpretation (API)
- API is used to aid feature identification and boundary delineation, but ground-truth decisions prevail; API-provided boundaries may be overridden by field evidence.

### Freshwater biota sampling (NELUP/IFE)
- Two streams/standing water biota sampling streams per square: freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) and standing water biota (NELUP, water beetle focus).
- Sampling locations selected to reflect the square’s two characteristic water habitats; samples preserved and labeled for transport to Merlewood.

### Photography
- Photography of each vegetation plot using print film; plot number clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge to document context and location.

## Procedures, permissions, and field operations

### Permissions and landowner engagement
- Justification for obtaining access permissions: legal access and farmer/landowner goodwill; to facilitate data collection and background information.
- Clear procedures for handling permission refusals at part or whole-square levels; contingencies include abandoning the square or relocating plots when feasible.

### Field workflow and logistics
- Teams organized by six ITE stations; flexible scheduling; travel time optimization; no overtime in initial plan (time-off-in-lieu for significant overtime).
- Mapping leads to fieldwork planning: ensuring complete square coverage, route planning, and integration with prior survey years for consistency and comparability.

## Data management, quality assurance, and challenges

- Emphasis on standardized field handbook and practice to minimize inter-observer variation.
- Quality control includes standardization of field recording, use of a Field Handbook, and post-survey checks for omissions and consistency.
- Permanent markers and repeatable coordinates enable longitudinal studies and plot relocation across survey years.
- Challenges noted:
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs.
  - Timely data provision from data creators.
  - Interoperability across multiple systems and formats.
  - Handling large datasets and non-interoperable legacy systems.
  - Keeping updated with changing land-use and boundaries.

## Data handling, storage, and sharing considerations

- Primary data capture via FABs, maps, API outputs, and field photos; later consolidation and archival at a central institution (ITE Merlewood).
- Considerations for data sharing include documentation of data collection methods, code definitions, and field procedures to enable reuse by external researchers and organizations.
- Documentation supports future resurvey efforts, meta-analyses, and habitat-change modeling (e.g., linking top-down remote sensing with ground-truth field data).

## Endnotes and context
- The manual reflects a comprehensive, standardized approach to longitudinal land-use and vegetation surveys, with explicit guidance on field methods, coding, plot relocation, and data governance to support data stewards in managing, preserving, and sharing high-quality ecological datasets.
