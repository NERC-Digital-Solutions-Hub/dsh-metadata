# CS2000 Field Handbook

## Data collection goals and scope
- Provides field data collection guidelines for CS2000 surveys across Great Britain.
- Aims to generate national, spatially referenced datasets for soil quality, Calluna vegetation, and freshwater biota, with integration into larger ecological analyses and policy context.
- Emphasizes standardized procedures, sample handling, and data provenance to support time-series analyses and robust datasets.

## Sampling types and targets
- Soil sampling: three replicate soil samples per 1 km square X-plot center, focusing on soil chemistry, soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
- Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen concentration to support deposition analyses and critical-load assessments.
- Freshwater sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with survey teams.
- All sampling is designed to be representative within each square and aligned with the survey's broader spatial framework.

## Field equipment and logistics (data relevance)
- Standard equipment plus regionally distributed items for soil sampling (special pipes, envelopes, bags) and lab subsystems.
- Detailed distribution scheme ensures each team has necessary tools for sampling, packaging, and transit to the processing facility (ITE Merlewood).

## Soil sampling procedures (step-by-step)
- In each X-plot center (2 x 2 m), identify the center’s north corner and mark a point 15 cm north for the first sample.
- Use a long black pipe (15 cm length, 5 cm diameter) to collect the first soil core; drive pipe into soil to >5 cm depth; extract soil, cap, label, and store in a labeled bag for posting.
- At 15 cm east of the first point, collect the second soil sample with a short white pipe (8 cm length, 4 cm diameter); seal ends with caps and bag, place in envelope for posting.
- At 15 cm west of the first point, collect the third soil sample following the same method as the second.
- Post the sealed envelopes to ITE Merlewood as soon as possible; store the longer black core separately in the car until collection by regional coordinators.
- Record any deviations or notable soil features on accompanying notes included with the samples.

## Calluna sampling
- Collect within each 1 km square where Calluna vulgaris occurs, using current year's growth (CYG) shoots.
- Randomly sample 30–50 g fresh weight, selecting CYG from multiple plants; seal in provided bags and label clearly.
- If samples are wet, allow partial drying before sealing; despatch to ITE Merlewood as directed (via station or post) with proper receipts for reimbursement.

## Freshwater sampling
- Conducted by specially trained IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field surveyors; timing coordinated to fit survey schedule.

## Data capture and recording (FABs, labeling)
- Data collection uses Field Assessment Forms (FABs) to capture soil chemistry, soil fauna, microbiological status, and Calluna data, with precise labeling and documentation requirements.
- Pre-labeled envelopes, bags, and pipes ensure traceability by square and plot, enabling later linkage to the appropriate square and X-plot in the dataset.
- Samples are stored securely (cool box for soil cores) and transported to processing facilities per protocol.

## GPS data collection (Annex 1)
- Ensure at least four satellites and a low PDOP (ideally below 6) before logging data.
- Distinguish stationary (plot-level) vs moving (feature or boundary) data collection modes.
- Create unique data files for every plot/feature, using a naming scheme that encodes square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); include feature references when applicable (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
- Use predefined attribute lists to rapidly select plot IDs; ensure accurate start/stop logging with clear on-screen prompts.
- Maintain awareness of potential obstructions and adjust GPS setup (reposition antenna if needed) to maximize data quality.

## Photography protocol
- One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and context relative to landmarks.
- Include square/plot identifiers on a prominent board in each image; ensure features are obvious, permanent, and visible with proper scale.
- Compose shots so the plot and reference features are clearly captured; minimize excessive sky in frames.

## Procedures after survey (QA and data handover)
- Review data sheets at day’s end to ensure no features are omitted.
- If necessary, data may be transcribed to fresh maps or forms only in exceptional circumstances (damage to original materials).
- Arrange prompt transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations to maintain data integrity and timeliness.

## Annexes and references (data management context)
- GPS data collection details (equipment checks, battery management, almanac updates, and PDOP considerations).
- Guidance on integrating field data with processing facilities (ITE Merlewood).
- Reference to the attribute and feature code lists used during data capture to maintain consistent taxonomy and coding across surveys.
