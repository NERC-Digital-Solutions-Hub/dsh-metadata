# Mapping Quality Assurance Exercise

- Aimed to deliver high-quality, field-m collected data on habitats and features that are compatible with previous approaches, stored in a geodatabase, and readily analysable alongside other national datasets.
- Digital field mapping was introduced in 2007 using Surveyor software to reduce interpretation bias, improve data capture, and enable early QA via an interactive wiki.
- QA included cross-checking between surveyors and QA teams, with field visits to ensure protocol compliance and to assess accuracy of mapped data, attributes, and change coding.
- The study identified strengths in digital data capture and QA processes, but also highlighted definitional and methodological challenges, especially for certain habitat types and upland mosaics.

## Data Collection and Management

- Digital mapping in the field with mandatory fields and prompts to ensure consistency and reduce handwriting/spelling errors.
- Data uploaded to an interactive wiki soon after collection, enabling early validation and guidance.
- QA teams conducted field visits to verify protocol adherence and used a geodatabase to align QA data with survey data.
- Data management supported by a Publishing/QA workflow and documentation of work done on datasets.

## QA Methodologies and Analyses

- 4.1 Direct comparison of aggregated areas/lengths/points per square (CS vs QA).
- 4.2 Raster data comparisons: conversion of polygons to 10x10 m cells to compare Broad Habitats, enabling spatial and area-based analyses.
- 4.3 100-point grid overlay: 100 points per square to assess concordance of Broad Habitats; used to identify mis-matches.
- 4.4 Attribute analyses: reference IDs and species attributes compared between CS and QA datasets.
- Additional analyses included surveyor efficiency (visit status layers) and the extent/coverage of surveyed areas.

## Key Findings

- Habitat-level comparisons (Table 6.1a/6.1b):
  - In most squares, a large majority of Broad Habitats were recorded by both CS and QA.
  - Mean differences between QA and CS for many Broad Habitats were generally small (often below 3–4%), though some habitats showed larger discrepancies.
  - Notable issues for certain habitats include Improved/Neutral Grassland, Dwarf Shrub Heath vs Blanket Bog, Urban vs Grassland classifications, and upland mosaic mappings.
- Raster data comparisons (Table 6.2a/6.2b):
  - Overall agreement across squares averaged about 76%, with some squares showing very high concordance (e.g., 364 at 98%) and others much lower (e.g., 261 at 49% or 773 at 23%).
  - Agreement by Broad Habitat varied by square, with some mis-matches concentrated in specific habitats and locations.
- 100-point grid concordance (Table 6.3a/6.3b):
  - Generally high concordance for many squares (e.g., 364, 359), but notable low concordance in a few squares (e.g., 773 at 19%, 261 at 41%).
  - The matrix highlighted particular sensitivity for certain habitat codes and combinations, illustrating definitional and landscape impacts on classification.
- Species attributes in polygons (Table 6.4/6.5):
  - About 45% of QA polygons had at least one species listed matching the co-located CS polygon.
  - Among matched polygons, 77% also had matching Broad Habitat codes; overall species concordance across matched polygons around 40%.
  - Lolium perenne and several common species showed relatively higher concordance, but many other species exhibited substantial discrepancies due to differences in habitat coding and dominant species perception.
- Change recording (Section 9):
  - Change coding (Real change, Error change, No change) largely aligned between CS and QA for most habitats and feature types, though some complexities remained, particularly for habitat-related changes.
  - The digital system helped capture change details more comprehensively, but required training and adaptation.

## Habitat Definitions and Taxonomy Issues

- Some inconsistencies arose from habitat definitions and their application:
  - Neutral vs Improved Grassland often overlapping in species composition, leading to potential allocation differences.
  - Woodland definitions (Broadleaf vs Coniferous) and the field handbook’s guidance on woodland composition led to some mismatches.
  - Upland mosaics posed difficulties, as mosaicked areas were disaggregated into component habitats, increasing potential mismatches.
  - Machair on Scottish dunes caused anomalies in the Sand Dune/Strandline classification.
  - Blanket Bog and Dwarf Shrub Heath showed notable mis-matches in upland areas, prompting calls for refined definitions and further work.
- These issues underscore the need for ongoing harmonization of habitat definitions and training to improve cross-team consistency.

## Data Stewardship Implications

- Evidence that digital data capture and wiki-based QA significantly improve data quality, timeliness, and auditability.
- Necessity of clear, up-to-date habitat definitions and consistent field-handbook guidance to minimize classification differences.
- Importance of provenance, versioning, and metadata to track changes across survey iterations and QA analyses.
- Need for ongoing training and documentation to reduce variability across survey teams, especially for complex or mosaicked habitats.
- Recommends continued alignment of field data collection with QA methods, robust cross-walks between habitat codes, and transparent reporting of discrepancies.

## Data Availability, Discoverability, and Reuse

- Data are stored in a geodatabase and linked to QA analyses, with workflow documentation and change records.
- Wiki-based QA facilitates transparency, guidance, and issues tracking, aiding data discoverability and reuse.
- Findings provide a basis for refining habitat classifications and enhancing future survey methodologies, supporting long-term data governance and interoperability with other national datasets.

## Recommendations for Future Practice

- Standardize and regularly update habitat definitions to reduce cross-team discrepancies, with clear documentation of decisions (especially for Blanket Bog, Neutral/Improved Grassland, and woodland types).
- Expand and target training to address identified areas of inconsistency (upland mosaics, machair-related habitats, urban grassland allocations).
- Maintain and enhance metadata and provenance tracking, including versions and change histories, to support reproducibility and governance.
- Continue using digital collection tools and integrated QA workflows (geodatabase, wiki checks) to sustain data quality improvements and enable timely data sharing.
- Develop targeted follow-up analyses to understand how species composition influences habitat allocation, and to refine the habitat definitions and allocation matrices accordingly.
- Ensure interoperability with external datasets by aligning classifications and providing crosswalks to common taxonomy standards.
