# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Executive summary
- A nationwide rural environment monitoring program designed to produce current, standardized datasets for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Combines ground-truth field surveys with satellite/remote-sensing approaches to create a Britain-wide land cover map and track ecological changes.
- Uses a two-tier sampling design across 512 sites (128 new sites in 1990; 128 re-surveyed from 1977/78; 256 with prior vegetation plots relocated as needed).
- Emphasizes standardization, data quality control, and accessible outputs (maps, reports, charts) stored in appropriate portals for reuse and scrutiny.

## Objectives and data outputs
- Update land-use and land-cover databases to support ecological analysis and policy evaluation.
- Link bottom-up field survey data with top-down remote sensing for integrated change detection.
- Produce consistent datasets suitable for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and trends in the countryside.
- Outputs include detailed mapping, vegetation and landscape data, and standardized datasets stored centrally for reuse.

## Study design and sampling framework
- Six survey stations organize 512 squares total, with teams from six ITE Research Stations; each station surveys ~85 squares.
- Sampling aims:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m² plots per square (valley-scale mapping) to capture major habitat components.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m × 2 m plots in natural or semi-natural land cover types to sample finer-scale variation.
  - Linear plots: up to five plots along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides to capture boundary and linear-habitat variation.
- Sample sites include both new and previously surveyed squares; relocations handled if land use changes or access issues arise.
- Permanent marking: use metal plates to relocate plots in future surveys; standardised relocation procedures across plot types.
- Field procedures accommodate inaccessible or altered landscapes (e.g., relocation on nearest suitable boundary, documentation of changes).

## Equipment and logistical planning
- Field equipment and data collection materials provided by Merlewood (FABs, aerial photographs, maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers) and by local ITE stations (maps, pens, camera, field gear).
- Survey teams must secure permissions before surveying any square; if permission is refused, predefined escalation and replacement procedures apply.
- Travel and scheduling emphasize minimizing repeated visits and overtime (time-off-in-lieu offered for significant overtime).

## Data recording and field books (FAB)
- Data Recording (FAB) forms accompany 1:10,000 scale enlarged maps; data codes annotate features with primary and secondary codes.
- FAB content includes: square number, ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland/water features, land use, vegetation, boundaries, buildings/structures, and communications.
- API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) supports feature identification not visible on maps; guidelines specify how API features are recorded and interpreted in the field.
- Each square’s FAB is organized as a booklet; neat, legible completion is essential for later analysis.
- Ownership and farmer information sheets capture contact details and engagement quality; a coding system rates farmer cooperation.

## Mapping and coding (6.1)
- Mapping is the core spatial activity: annotate 6" = 1:10,000 maps with multiple data codes to describe land cover, boundaries, roads, hedges, and other features.
- Codes are combined via alpha-numeric box codes to capture complex mosaics efficiently (e.g., A for a specific boundary-type combination).
- Two main code types:
  - Primary codes: mandatory for every mapped feature.
  - Secondary codes: used to qualify or elaborate; used sparingly.
- Boundaries and features must be mapped and interpreted on-ground; mark features that no longer exist with a specific code (e.g., 999).

## Aerial photography interpretation (API) and FAB filling
- API supports identifying features not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundary delineation, new structures) and updating semi-natural boundaries.
- FAB filling guidance emphasizes clear, neatly completed pages, consistent use of codes, and inclusion of sketches, measurement data, and photographs.
- Field staff are encouraged to document changes with notes and to relocate plots using documented guidelines if land cover or ownership changes.

## Vegetation sampling and field methods (6.2)
- Standardised vegetation recording uses a standard form and four plot types:
  - 200 m² large quadrats (primary habitat mapping unit).
  - Nested smaller quadrats within large plots (to capture richness and abundance at different scales).
  - Five 4 m² quadrats (for semi-natural vegetation types).
  - Up to five linear plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
- Plot layout:
  - Large quadrats placed at a representative “centre of gravity” of habitat; relocation if not representative.
  - Permanent metal markers placed near quadrat corners for relocation; exact positioning documented with sketches and distances.
- Species recording:
  - A standard list of ~200 common plant species plus bryophytes and lichens; species identified to the extent feasible in the field, with allowances for difficult identifications (combinations accepted).
  - Cover estimates in 5% intervals; total cover can exceed 100% due to layering.
  - For vegetation mosaics where a single dominant code cannot capture the unit, multiple primary codes may be used with the dominant one first.
  - Special attention to bracken and other dominant ground covers; use crosses to mark rare or small components.
- Data handling:
  - All vascular plants recorded; heavy emphasis on accurate mapping of species presence, percent cover, and location within nested quadrats.
  - Permanent markers linked to each plot to enable future re-sampling and change detection.

## Plots and sampling design details
- Quadrats:
  - Five large 200 m² quadrats per square placed in different land cover types where possible.
  - Five small 2 m × 2 m quadrats placed in natural/semi-natural habitats to supplement large quadrats’ data.
- Linear plots:
  - Hedgerows (H1–H5), Streamsides (S1–S5), Roadside (R1–R5) with 1 m width along defined features.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots provide a basis; 1990 rules allow relocation to ensure sampling of all habitat types within the square.
- Verges and other roadside features:
  - Verge plots sampled at multiple widths to capture variation in edge communities.
  - Additional verge plots sample different road types (A/B roads, yellow-tarmac roads, construction tracks).

## Freshwater sampling (7)
- Two freshwater biota sampling programs per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE program) – fully described in a separate handbook.
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP program) – focusing on water beetles; two sample points per square.
- Sample design aims to reflect the two characteristic water habitats of each square (lakes/lochs, ponds, pools, flushes, bogs).
- Sampling logistics:
  - Samples collected with sieve, preserved in formalin, labeled with square and date, and transported back to Merlewood promptly.

## Photography and data quality
- Photography: prints of vegetation plots taken to document general appearance and landmarks; plot number clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge.
- Data quality and consistency:
  - Emphasis on reducing observer variation through standardized field handbook and training.
  - Quality control to ensure consistent field recording across observers and years.

## Permissions, ownership, and field ethics
- Permissions are essential for full-square access; refusals trigger predefined contingencies (replacement square or amended coverage).
- Before fieldwork, letters to landowners and farm occupiers explain the survey; coordinators manage access negotiations.
- Ownership details are recorded on the FAB, with a scoring system to indicate cooperation and potential contacts for future surveys.

## Data management and long-term goals
- Data are stored in standardized formats and uploaded to appropriate portals for sharing and scrutiny.
- The two-tier approach (ground-truth field data plus satellite imagery) enables linking bottom-up and top-down perspectives, enhancing pattern detection and projection accuracy.
- The 1990 resurvey builds on earlier surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) and aims to establish a robust, comparable long-term dataset to monitor countryside changes through the 1990s and beyond.
