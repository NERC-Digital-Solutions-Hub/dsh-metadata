# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- GIS-ready data framework
  - Structured, codes-based system linking maps, plots, and vegetation data.
  - Supports change detection in old squares and robust mapping for new squares.
  - Designed to integrate with policy frameworks and satellite-based land-cover mapping.

- Survey design and data management for GIS
  - Field survey operates in 1 km squares with a planned continuation of time-series (CS1990 baseline extended to CS2000).
  - Distinct plot types and sampling regimes designed to capture habitat, vegetation, and land-cover change.
  - Mapping and data-recording are tied to 1:10,000 maps with standardized coding schemes for features.

- Sampling protocols (for GIS data inputs)
  - Soil sampling (within each X-plot centre)
    - Five replicate soil samples per square (taken in each centre plot of every X-plot).
    - Three cores per centre plot: one long black pipe (15 cm) and two short white pipes (8 cm) arranged at specific offsets (15 cm north, east, and west of centre).
    - Samples are mailed to ITE Merlewood in labeled envelopes; quick processing for short-lived samples.
  - Calluna vulgaris sampling (for nitrogen deposition analyses)
    - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from random plants.
    - Label bags, seal, and post to ITE Merlewood; attention to sample dryness and proper packaging.
  - Freshwater sampling
    - Conducted by accredited IFE staff; coordinated timing with CS2000 field teams to avoid conflicts.
  - GPS data collection
    - Annex provides detailed steps for recording stationary and moving features, file naming, sampling rate, and data logging.
    - File naming convention: square number and plot/feature id (e.g., 501X4.PSE); mobile feature names include a prefix (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
    - PDOP guidance: aim for PDOP below 6 for 3D fixes; ensure clear sky view and manage obstructions with equipment adjustments.

- Data recording, mapping, and coding
  - FABs (Field Assessment Books) integrate data sheets with 1:10,000 maps; document ownership, permissions, and plot characteristics.
  - Feature coding system ties map features to primary CS1990 codes; supports addition, alteration, or removal of codes as changes occur.
  - Annexed procedures for relocating plots using GPS, ground plans, and reference marks to maintain spatial consistency over time.

- Photographic documentation
  - One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot with reference features clearly visible.
  - Reference features should be obvious, unique, permanent, and within a viewable distance.
  - Photographs labeled with square/plot identifiers and positioned to include a marker board for scale and location context.

- Data quality, training, and standardization
  - Emphasis on consistent field recording to minimize observer variation.
  - Clear guidance for mosaics, boundaries, and complex land-cover scenarios to maintain comparability over time.
  - Training and quality control procedures to ensure GIS-ready, harmonized datasets.

- Procedures after survey
  - Daily data checks to prevent omissions; limited re-transcription of data unless critical.
  - Timely transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing and storage.

- Annex and ancillary GIS considerations
  - GPS data collection procedures, battery management, almanac updates, and extending aerial signal reception when needed.
  - Comprehensive documentation of GPS settings, file naming, and data file management to support future data integration and provenance.

- Practical outcomes for GIS specialists
  - A robust, codes-driven data model that links map layers, plot-level vegetation data, and ancillary sampling datasets.
  - Facilitates spatial analyses of soil, vegetation, and freshwater data at national scales with consistent change-detection capabilities.
  - Enables policy-aligned, satellite-assisted land-cover mapping and habitat classification through standardized GIS-ready outputs.
