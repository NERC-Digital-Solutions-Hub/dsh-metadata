# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Field handbook for the CS2000 programme, combining ground surveys with remote-sensing to monitor land use, vegetation, and landscape features in Britain.
- Aims to provide current, comparable datasets for scientific evaluation, policy development, biodiversity indicators, and to support time-series analyses with standardized procedures to reduce observer variation.

## Study Design and Data Components
- Sampling in 1 x 1 km squares; CS2000 expands CS1990 squares (508 → 568) with re-surveys of existing squares and new additions.
- Time-series continuity: re-survey previous squares and include new ones to extend coverage.
- Three main data components:
  - Mapping: change in land cover and landscape features; reporting by broad habitats and country units.
  - Plot-based vegetation sampling: multiple plot types to capture open, semi-natural, and diverse habitats.
  - Validation/verification sampling: ensures data quality and change detection reliability.

## Mapping and Field Data Collection
- Mapping modalities updated from CS1990 to CS2000:
  - Map change only for old squares.
  - Map new squares with de novo land-cover inventories.
  - Report by broad habitats with upland/lowland differentiation.
- Broad Habitats framework standardizes outputs; separate approaches for enclosed vs. plottable upland/open landscapes.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) consolidates data sheets and maps; emphasis on precise, traceable coding and change-tracking indicators.
- Change reliability indicators help qualify results (e.g., 701 genuine change; 702 probable mis-recording).

## Plot Types, Sampling Intensity, and Relocation
- Diverse plot types to capture habitat heterogeneity:
  - X plots (Large, 200 m2) with nested 4 m2 subplots.
  - Y plots (Small, 2 m x 2 m) in semi-natural habitats.
  - U plots (Unenclosed) in plottable broad habitats.
  - B plots (Boundary) along field edges.
  - A plots (Arable field margins) for edge vegetation.
  - H and D plots for hedgerow structure and diversity.
  - S/W plots (Streamside/Waterside) and R/V plots (Roadside/Verge) for transport-related variation.
- Ground plans, metal plates, GPS, and standardized marking enable repeat relocation across years.
- Sampling strategy designed to balance coverage with effort, supporting change detection and habitat assessments.

## Vegetation Sampling, Taxonomic Coding, and Data Quality
- Standardized vegetation recording with 200 common species checklists; nested plots capture within-plot composition; 5% cover categories.
- Bryophytes and lichens tracked from restricted lists with specific rules; nomenclature aligned with historical conventions; allowances for genus-level IDs in difficult taxa.
- Extensive coded vocabularies for flora and mosses/lichens (e.g., thousands of codes for species and groupings) to ensure consistent data entry and interoperability.
- Data coding supports mosaics and feature-specific codes; change-tracking across CS1990 to CS2000 transitions.

## Data Management, Metadata, and Access
- Emphasizes tracking data sources and metadata to ensure discoverability, reuse, and long-term usability.
- Datasets intended to be discoverable via data portals; appendices cover GPS data collection, relocation procedures, and detailed coding schemes for cross-year compatibility.

## Field Operations, Permissions, and Safety
- Landowner consent required for all surveys; clear procedures for partial or full access refusals.
- Logistics address team flexibility, travel planning, safety, equipment handling, and maintenance.

## Photography and Post-Survey Procedures
- Photography: one camera per team; films provided; photographs of every vegetation plot with visible reference features and square/plot identifiers.
- Post-survey: thorough data sheet checks; minimize reliance on re-drafting forms; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS Data Collection: Annex and Procedures
- Annex 1 provides detailed GPS data collection workflows:
  - Battery checks, satellite counts, PDOP guidance (aim for PDOP < 6 for robust 3D fixes).
  - Stationary and moving position logging; unique file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE) for each plot/feature.
  - Data logging controls, start/stop procedures, and handling of almanac updates.
  - Battery charging, power management, and strategies to mitigate obstructions (e.g., elevating the aerial).
- Emphasizes high-quality geospatial data to support precise plot locations and boundary delineations.

## Relevance for Analysts
- Provides a robust, standardized framework for collecting, coding, and integrating large-scale field data with remote-sensing outputs.
- Supports robust time-series analyses, change detection, and cross-source data integration through clear data standards, metadata, and version tracking.
- Highlights common data-organization challenges (observer variation, access constraints, standardization, code management) and offers structured mitigation strategies.
