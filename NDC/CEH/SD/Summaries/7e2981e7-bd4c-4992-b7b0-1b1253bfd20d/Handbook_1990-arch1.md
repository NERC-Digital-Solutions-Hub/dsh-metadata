COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Aim to monitor and analyse changes in the rural environment to update land use databases, identify patterns, and inform predictions and policy decisions.
  - Builds on two prior surveys (1977/8 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System; integrates ground-based field data with satellite/remote sensing approaches.
  - Two-tier approach: ground-truth field surveys linked to a land cover map; intended to enable bottom-up understanding and top-down projection of landscape change.
  - Plan for a further resurvey in 1990 with expanded data capture and greater collaboration; total sample: 512 sites with enhanced detail and metadata, enabling trend analysis through to 1990 and beyond.
  - Emphasis on standardised field recording to reduce observer variation and to make datasets robust for statistical analysis and modelling.

- Study design and sampling framework
  - 512 squares surveyed in 1990, grouped into six teams from six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square expected to require about three survey days; flexible scheduling with coordinated planning to minimise travel and avoid unnecessary revisits.
  - Sample design includes 128 new squares (not previously surveyed in 1984/70s) and 128 squares with prior data to maintain continuity; overall aim to capture changes in land cover, landscape features, and vegetation.
  - Additional data capture will integrate satellite imagery with a bottom-up field survey to build a Britain-wide land cover map.
  - Quality control stresses standardisation across observers, with a Field Handbook and accompanying definitions to ensure consistency.

- Data collection framework (FAB, plots, sampling)
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling expanded to include vegetation plots and aquatic habitats.
  - Data handling built around the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) to combine maps, field notes, and plot data; data will be codified using a structured coding system (primary and secondary codes, alpha-coded combinations).
  - Emphasis on traceability: maintain data sources, document decisions in the field, and ensure datasets are discoverable with metadata.
  - API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) supplements ground data to help identify features not easily captured on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees, boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types).

- Equipment and field materials
  - Materials supplied by Merlewood: FABs, aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, recording forms, weatherproof clipboards, markers, poles, tapes, markers for boundaries, and sampling gear.
  - Local ITE stations supply location mapping tools, basic drawing and recording supplies, cameras, field guides, and safety equipment.
  - Surveyors provide personal gear (clothing, lunch, water, etc.).

- Permissions and access
  - Permissions required to access all parts of each square; contacting landowners and occupiers is essential for background information and practical access.
  - If permission is refused, procedures include abandoning the square or shifting to a replacement square, with escalation as needed.
  - Coordinators maintain ownership lists and keep notes on access history and special requirements.

- Data recording and mapping (FAB)
  - FABs consolidate per-square data and maps; all pages should be neatly completed with the square sequence number visible.
  - Ownership, occupation status, and farmer information collected to understand land management context; dynamic ownership changes recorded.
  - A detailed physiography/inland water/coastal section captures topography, drainage, water bodies, and related land cover features.
  - A detailed “Cover types” section records land cover categories (e.g., upland grass, moorland heath, calcareous grassland, aquatic margins, bracken, unmanaged grass, crops, etc.) with species codes where density is ≥ 25%.
  - Species and bryophyte/lichen lists included for vegetation accounting; a restricted set of taxa is recorded; unlisted species added as needed.
  - For woodland and trees, field notes classify canopy, age, structure, management state, species composition, and boundaries; double-coding ensures accurate representation of mixed uses and boundaries.
  - Boundary, fences, hedges, walls, verges, and other boundaries are enumerated with a hierarchical coding scheme to capture complexity (stockproofing, height, gaps, and management status).

- Data coding, standardisation, and quality assurance
  - Two coding levels: primary codes (mandatory) and secondary codes (additional qualifiers); alpha codes used to condense complex code sets.
  - Codes arranged to preserve logical data flow (e.g., boundary type followed by its characteristics); long codes are avoided by using alpha composites.
  - Minimum mapping units and lengths defined (e.g., 1/25 hectare minimum, 20 m minimum length for boundary units).
  - In-built rules for field decisions to prevent lab-only guesswork; exceptions are allowed with explanatory notes.
  - Clear conventions for digitising and sharing data, with an emphasis on forward compatibility and discoverability.

- Plot types and field methods (6.2 and subsections)
  - Large quadrats (200 m2): five 200 m2 quadrats per square, placed in representative habitat zones; nested within each quadrat are smaller sub-quads for detailed species recording; quadrats are permanently marked and relocation-ready.
  - Small quadrats (2 m x 2 m): five additional quadrats in natural or semi-natural land covers; used to capture fine-scale variation.
  - Laying out and recording: quadrats oriented along N–S and E–W axes; measurement strings indicate boundaries; permanent markers placed for relocation; sketches and photos accompany FAB entries.
  - Boundaries and linear plots: five linear plots per square for hedgerows (10 x 1 m), streamsides, and roadsides, positioned along major vertical features; 1 m wide strips recorded; additional plots to represent multiple boundary types where present.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots: guidelines for placement relative to the adjacent boundary or feature; problems resolved with relocation when necessary.
  - Location/relocation across years: if hedgerows/streams have changed since earlier surveys, plots relocated to nearest permissible feature following standardized rules; ensure plots remain at least 10 m apart if necessary.
  - Species identification: standard taxonomic approach with predefined acceptable species combinations where exact identification is difficult; bryophytes and lichens included per a fixed list.

- Vegetation data collection specifics
  - Species lists include approximately 200 common taxa (plants, grasses, herbs) with explicit coding for the most frequent species; unlisted species added as needed.
  - Estimation of cover: recorded in 5% increments; total cover can exceed 100% due to layered vegetation.
  - Habitat and land-use coding: detailed assignment of land-use categories, with notes on management, grazing, and disturbance.
  - Bracken and scrub treated with specific codes; woody canopy and understory are documented with canopy codes and age classes when relevant.
  - Permanent marking and relocation: metal plates mark quadrats; precise relocation facilitated by coordinates, maps, and local features; photographs capture sites.

- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP)
  - Two standing-water samples per square when possible, plus additional freshwater sampling opportunities (e.g., streams/ditch transects) for biodiversity inventory.
  - IFE (Institute of Freshwater Ecology) sampling protocol documented separately; NELUP sampling (Newcastle University) focuses on water beetles; field points marked on the same map as the IFE point.
  - Sample handling: collected biota placed in labeled bottles with formalin; time-limited searching to minimize habitat disturbance; transport back to Merlewood for analysis.

- Photography and data capture
  - Photographs taken for every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark features; plot numbers and positioning clearly shown in images.

- Procedures after fieldwork
  - End-of-day review of FABs to ensure completeness; avoid post hoc transposition unless damage to original forms necessitates it.
  - Timely transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations; data and materials handled with careful chain-of-custody procedures.

- Outputs, data governance, and accessibility
  - Emphasis on generating current, comparable datasets with robust metadata to support cross-site comparisons, trend analyses, and model development.
  - Data sources and datasets prepared for discoverability; publication-ready summaries and mappings to support policy, research, and decision-making.

- Particular challenges and considerations for data analysts
  - Data gaps, scale mismatches, and access barriers historically affect ecological data; this protocol explicitly addresses standardisation, documentation, and cross-dataset integration to improve analytic quality.
  - IT and data-management challenges anticipated, with an emphasis on QA, reproducibility, and the ability to reuse data across projects and time.
  - The integration of field data with satellite imagery is designed to support predictive modelling of land-use change and its ecological consequences.

- Timeline and availability
  - The 1990 survey will follow the established methods with enhancements for more detailed data capture; results and datasets are intended to support ongoing scientific evaluation of ecological systems in the countryside and enable monitoring of trends through 1990 and beyond.
