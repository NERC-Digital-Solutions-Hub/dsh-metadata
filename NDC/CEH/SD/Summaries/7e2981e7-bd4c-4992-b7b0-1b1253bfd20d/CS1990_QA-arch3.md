# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- A comprehensive quality assurance (QA) evaluation of the 1990 Countryside Survey, detailing the scope, methods, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in environmental health monitoring outputs.

## Aims

- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the Countryside Survey 1990 and assess the reliability of recorded change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, timing (season), plot location, and other factors (geography, drought).
- Relate QA findings to previous ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to enhance accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Methods

- Two QA exercises:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of plots; included self-assessment in a subset; used a single 1km square from each of 32 terrain classes; 28 squares surveyed by one assessor; each quarter of a square resurveyed for plot types represented.
- Plot types assessed (six groups; with sub-division):
  - Quadrats: 200 m^2 (X-plots) and 4 m^2 (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots (1O m)
  - Road verges
  - Hedges
  - Streamsides
  - Boundaries
- Plate relocation and plot positioning: relocation using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector; additional ground truthing at designated points.
- Data quality measures:
  - Species concordance across time (multiple indices)
  - Cover estimates comparison
  - DECORANA ordination analysis to examine ecological gradients
  - Mapping codes and land-use classifications
- Data handling: comparisons between original T1 (1990) and QA T2 (1990/1991) results; analysis by landclass aggregates (LC, LG, MA, UP) and plot types.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Plate/plot relocation success varied by method and plot type:
    - Autumn 1990: 71% recovery rate within five minutes for plates; 65% plate and 87% plot recovery in some categories.
    - 1991 QA: higher restoration success for plates and plots across types (varied by plot type, e.g., X, road verge, boundary, etc.).
  - Relocation outcomes categorized as:
    - Plate and plot relocated
    - Plate not found but location adequate
    - Plate not found with insufficient information to relocate
- Species concordance and changes
  - Overall species agreement between time points around 60% (early QA) to about 61% (full QA); initial autumn QA suggested ~60–61% agreement.
  - 1991 reassessment showed a notable increase in mean species number per plot (1990 mean ~20.7; 1991 mean ~23.4); significant statistical difference when pooling all plots.
  - Variation sources (A–I classes) attributed to mis-identifications, overlooked species, over-recording, seasonal effects, plot mis-location, and management changes; total mis-match around 39% with an overall accuracy around 60–74% depending on calculations.
  - Seasonal and drought effects were substantial: drought in 1990 reduced detectability of many species; wetter/normal growing season in 1991 increased recorded species counts.
  - Landuse impact: lowland arable and lowland grassland showed lower accuracy than upland areas; upland squares exhibited relatively less seasonal impact.
- Effects of seasonal/annual variation and climate
  - Differences in species frequency between 1990 and 1991 often reflected genuine ecological changes (some weeds and grasses increased) and, in many cases, under-recording in the original survey.
  - Across years, some species (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) appeared to reflect real population changes, while others (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis) seemed affected by under-recording in the initial survey.
  - Overall, a combination of real ecological change and recording variation contributed to observed differences.
- Cover estimates
  - Comparison of cover values for common species showed significant differences for some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, p ~0.004) between 1990 and 1991; other species showed no significant changes.
  - Separate landclass analyses indicated variability in cover estimates; bryophyte and grass identifications were particularly variable.
- DECORANA ordination and ecological gradients
  - Axis 1 shifts generally followed expected upland–lowland gradients and responses to land-use changes; some plots showed larger axis shifts due to crop changes, relocation issues, or cover-value disagreements.
  - By plot type, X plots and certain others showed consistent axis movement trends; upland plots showed different magnitudes of change.
- Mapping and land-use coding
  - Primary land-use code allocation was generally reliable; minor categories were less reliably mapped due to limited frequency and clearer definitions in major categories.
  - Boundary codes and descriptive qualifiers showed more variation; some codes (e.g., for forb cover and hedge condition) were misused due to undefined handbook definitions.
  - Concordance for primary land-use codes was high (around 88–95% in some comparisons); boundary codes and qualifiers showed more variability, influenced by whether same assessors revisited squares.
  - Mapping of vegetation cover at nine-point grids showed limited, but meaningful, concordance; most common/co-dominant species were less consistently recorded across times.
- Recommendations for mapping and coding
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes and provide simple, dichotomous decision aids for recording.
  - Sub-divide certain upland codes (e.g., 102 upland grassland) to distinguish between improved pasture and unimproved grassland.
  - Introduce codes for lowland rush pasture and recognisable wet heath as distinct vegetation types.
  - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence; cover species composition with qualifiers; tighten definitions for hedge and boundary coding.
  - Limit forb cover and hedge condition codes to clearly defined states; refine and harmonise code definitions to reduce misclassification.
- Mapping of species cover
  - Two most prevalent species should be recorded for land-use parcels to improve reproducibility; overall, cover mapping is more reliable for dominant species but less so for co-dominants.
  - Recommend focusing mapping on the most apparent species at a point to improve reproducibility.
- Training and data handling recommendations
  - Emphasise bryophyte recording in training and include a broader species list for habitat-specific surveys; consider additional species for national vegetation classification.
  - Train surveyors to distinguish grasses with similar vegetative characteristics more reliably.
  - Conduct QA in the same year as the initial survey; minimize seasonal variation by aligning QA timing with the survey period.
  - Improve plot relocation aids: annotate photos with distances and bearings; ensure plot markers (plates) are used consistently; ensure Y plots are oriented and positioned precisely using tapes.
- Practical workflow recommendations
  - Use photographs to re-establish exact plot positions; require annotating photos with location context.
  - For unenclosed land, allocate extra manpower for locating and relocating plots.
  - Annotate and standardise distances and bearing information on sketches and photographs to facilitate relocation.
  - Limit the time lag between initial survey and QA to reduce seasonal/annual discrepancies.

## Conclusions

- Photographs and improved relocation aids significantly enhance plot relocation accuracy, especially in unenclosed land.
- Seasonality and drought during the initial survey markedly affected species detection and cover estimates; aligning QA with the same growing season and year as the original survey is crucial.
- Land-use mapping is generally robust, but boundary coding and qualitative qualifiers require clearer definitions and standardisation.
- The QA demonstrates that while there is notable variability in species lists and cover estimates, the overall framework for monitoring environmental vegetation change is sound if measurement error sources are mitigated.
- The study supports targeted improvements in training, plotting protocols, metadata sharing, and code definitions to strengthen the reliability of long-term environmental monitoring data.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- For managers and authors of monitoring frameworks, the document illustrates the importance of:
  - Rigorous QA processes closely tied to survey timing and protocols.
  - Transparent data governance, metadata completeness, and openness of underlying data.
  - Standardised, well-documented field methods and coding schemes to minimise inter- and intra-surveyor variation.
  - Use of photographic aids and physical markers to improve spatial relocation and reproducibility.
  - Clear prioritisation of key data types (e.g., dominant species and land-use codes) to improve consistency and comparability over time.
  - Ongoing training focused on problematic taxa (grasses, bryophytes) and habitat-specific considerations to enhance data quality for policy evaluation and future decision-making.
