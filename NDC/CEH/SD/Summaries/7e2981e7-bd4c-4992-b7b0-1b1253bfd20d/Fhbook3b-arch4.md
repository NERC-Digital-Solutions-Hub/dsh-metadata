# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Establishes a standardized, repeatable field data collection program to update land-use and biodiversity datasets and monitor changes over time.
- Aims for time-series consistency, cross-year comparability, and linkage to broader policy-relevant outputs (e.g., soil sustainability indicators, biodiversity reporting).

## Data Standardization and Coding
- Field recording is standardized using a structured coding system with primary and secondary codes and embedded hierarchies (FAB framework) to enable complex mosaics and change tracking.
- Clear guidelines for when to create new parcel numbers, annotate changes, and handle boundary mosaics.
- Taxa are organized into defined groups (e.g., FORBS/WOODY SPECIES; MOSSES/LICHENS) with standardized abbreviations and cross-references to ensure comparability with previous surveys.

## Datasets and Sampling Design
- Sampling spans multiple data types: flora (species lists), soils, soil fauna, soil microbiology, Calluna vegetation, and freshwater biota.
- Field program built around 1 km square sampling, with plot-based (X-plots) and centre-plot approaches for vegetation and soil sampling.
- Long-term dataset designed to support change detection, with explicit plans for repeat surveys and cross-year comparisons.

## Field Procedures and Quality Control
- Detailed procedures for field recording, mapping, and relocation to ensure reproducibility across observers and years.
- Emphasis on permanent markers, standardized data sheets (FABs), and consistent plotting to maintain data integrity over time.
- Photography protocol to document plots with clear reference features and plot identifiers.

## Soil Sampling (Section 10.1–10.7)
- Five replicate soil samples per square within each X-plot to assess chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), fauna diversity, and microbiology.
- Sampling conducted using a specified set of pipes and procedures; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage.
- Rigorous packaging and posting requirements, with attention to shelf-life of certain sample types.

## Calluna Sampling
- Foliar nitrogen sampling to relate Calluna nitrogen concentrations to deposition data, enabling regional assessments against critical loads.
- Sampling within each 1 km square where Calluna vulgaris occurs; standardized collection (current year’s growth) with careful handling and drying as needed.

## Freshwater Sampling (in coordination with IFE)
- Freshwater biota sampling conducted by accredited IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams.

## Photography (Section 11)
- One camera per team; photographs of every vegetation plot with reference features.
- Photos must include square/plot identifiers on a visible board; composition emphasizes plot area and identifiable references.

## Procedures After Survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey checks to ensure all features are recorded; maps and FABs transported back to ITE stations promptly.
- Guidance on data integrity safeguards and handling damaged or incomplete data sheets.

## Annex: Collecting GPS Data
- Step-by-step instructions for GPS data collection, including battery checks, satellite counts, and PDOP (accuracy) considerations.
- Procedures for recording stationary (plot locations) and moving features, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), and data logging controls.
- Guidance on equipment handling, power management, almanac updates, and troubleshooting (e.g., antenna extension, obstructions).
- Importance of standardized attribute lists for quick entry and a reference sheet to speed plot identification.

## Relevance and Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates how to design and operate a long-term, nationwide data program with rigorous standardization, traceability, and cross-sector collaboration (ITE, IFE).
- Provides governance mechanisms for data collection, quality control, training, and relocation of plots to sustain a robust, policy-relevant dataset.
- Shows explicit data lineage and change-tracking practices (parcel/plot IDs, code translations, mosaics) to support transparent data evolution over time.
- Balances broad landscape-level data (plots, mosaics, habitats) with fine-grained sampling (soil cores, plant plots) to capture both macro- and micro-level ecological dynamics.
- Offers a comprehensive blueprint for managing heterogeneous data types (species lists, soils, microbiology, freshwater, GPS-derived coordinates) within a unified governance framework.
