# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

- Anguage: National estimates of change in Broad Habitat areas (Habitat 1–17) for Great Britain between 1990, 1998 and 2007, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Coverage: Estimates are summarized by Land Class and Broad Habitat, based on Countryside Survey data.

## Data details (CS1990_98_07_Broad_Habitat_Change.csv)

- YEAR_FROM: Year of the starting survey.
- YEAR_TO: Year of the ending survey.
- LAND_CLASS: ITE Land Class code (from Bunce et al. references).
- BROAD_HABITAT: Broad Habitat code.
- BROAD_HABITAT_NAME: Text description of the Broad Habitat.
- MEAN_CHANGE: Mean estimated change in Broad Habitat area (000s hectares) between the two years.
- LOWER_95PCT_LIMIT: Lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the change.
- UPPER_95PCT_LIMIT: Upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the change.
- SIG_5PCT: Significance at the 5% level (Yes/No) for the change.
- Broad Habitat mappings (examples): Broad Habitat 1 = Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland; Broad Habitat 2 = Coniferous Woodland; Broad Habitat 3 = Boundary and Linear Features; Broad Habitat 4 = Arable and Horticulture; Broad Habitat 5 = Improved Grassland; Broad Habitat 6 = Neutral Grassland; Broad Habitat 7 = Calcareous Grassland; Broad Habitat 8 = Acid Grassland; Broad Habitat 9 = Bracken; Broad Habitat 10 = Dwarf Shrub Heath; Broad Habitat 11 = Fen, Marsh, Swamp; Broad Habitat 12 = Bog; Broad Habitat 13 = Standing Open Waters and Canals; Broad Habitat 14 = Rivers and Streams; Broad Habitat 15 = Montane (1998–2007 only); Broad Habitat 16 = Inland Rock; Broad Habitat 17 = Urban.

## Methodology and classification

- National estimates are derived from the 2007 ITE Land Classification and the Countryside Survey 1990, 1998, and 2007 data.
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al., 2008; Barr (1990, 1998); Barr, Jackson guidance and related sources.
- The Countryside Survey results are generated from 1 km survey squares; detailed statistical methodology in Scott (2007) Technical Report No. 4/07.
- ITE Land Classification (2007) provides the framework for linking land cover to Broad Habitat categories.

## Use and interpretation

- Use MEAN_CHANGE along with LOWER/UPPER_95PCT_LIMIT to assess magnitude and uncertainty of habitat change between the two years.
- Use SIG_5PCT to determine statistical significance of observed changes at the 5% level.
- The dataset enables cross-Habitat and cross-Land Class comparisons to identify patterns in land-use change across Great Britain.
- Data are suited for informing policy, planning, and research on habitat change, with attention to the confidence intervals and significance indicators.
