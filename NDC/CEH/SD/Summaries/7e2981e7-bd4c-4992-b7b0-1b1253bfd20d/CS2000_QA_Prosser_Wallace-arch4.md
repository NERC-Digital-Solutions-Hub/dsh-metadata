# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- Quality assurance (QA) exercise for the Countryside 2000 field survey to assess consistency and reliability across a large-field program.
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares from 1998; one quarter of each square resurveyed, totalling 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Focus: evaluate plot relocation, species concordance, vegetation cover accuracy, land-use mapping, and change recording to gauge data quality and comparability with CS1990.

## Aims and Scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Assess efficiency of plot relocation and identify observer/bias effects.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, plot location/relocation, plot type, and management/seasonal effects.
- Relate CS2000 findings to the CS1990-CS2000 comparability framework.
- Evaluate the mapping of land cover and boundaries, including hedge/wall management, and changes since 1990.
- Provide objective assessment to inform data quality and future data use.

## Methods
- Selection: 38 squares; 234 plots recorded across seven main plot types (quadrats, X/Y plots, U plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries; arable margins included where applicable).
- Relocation protocol: buried plates, original sketch maps, surveyor photographs, and metal detectors used to relocate plots eight years on; comparison with 1990 QA relocation benchmarks.
- Data collection and QA: CS2000 surveyors recorded species lists and cover; QA assessors re-recorded using identical methods; codes for land cover and boundaries compared.
- Annexes detail plotting grids, plate/plot localization, and sampling procedures.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation
- Relocation rate: 86.7% of 210 full plots could be satisfactorily relocated; 60% accurately relocated, ~25% relocated with some accuracy, ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; overall potential total recovery (including approximate) estimated around 40–45%.
- Eight-year relocation feasibility: similar to 1-year QA outcomes; some misplacements occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of features); some plates repurposed for new plots, complicating future relocalization.

### Species Concordance and Diversity
- Species concordance (presence) CS2000 vs QA: around 73–74% for presence; CS2000 mean species per plot 17.9; QA mean 20.4; QA tends to yield longer species lists.
- Overall pattern: similar plot-ordering by richness as CS1990; road verges often more species-rich than streamsides in CS2000 era.
- Mis-matches: major source is overlooked species (approx. 39–41% in TI categories); misidentifications and orientation/location errors also contribute.
- Changes in species lists: the QA generally increases recorded species due to more thorough searching; same assessors used in multiple QA rounds show similar efficiency patterns.

### Vegetation Cover
- Cover estimates: generally matched between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors for principal species; several grasses showed significant differences in mean cover (notably Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus vaginatum) with some seasonal effects influencing results.
- Overall, cover concordance for key species was reasonable, with some species showing higher discrepancy, influenced by season and plot/location issues.

### Change in Vegetation/Area Characteristics
- Direction of change (via DECORANA): overall axis shift insignificant; no directional bias between CS2000 and QA across plot types.
- Change concordance: 51.4% overall; 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes noted by CS2000 but not substantiated by QA.
- Implication: substantial portion of change since 1990 may have been missed or inconsistently recorded; highlights difficulty in reliably capturing temporal changes over eight years.

### Land Cover Mapping and Boundaries
- Primary land cover codes: overall concordance high; excluding BAP codes, concordance ~91.6%; including BAP codes ~87.5%.
- BAP codes: good overall concordance (77.4%), with some predictable disagreements for larger habitats and misclassification across boundaries; suggested boundary reclassification could improve accuracy.
- Boundary features: primary boundary codes show strong concordance (~92%); hedge/wall shape codes less consistent (~67.5%), with some mis-matches due to new coding schemes and omissions.
- Boundary heights and stockproof status: high concordance (boundary height ~89–92%, stockproof ~83–89%); few omissions.

### Change Recording and Land Use Change
- Change coding: concordance for recorded changes was modest; many changes observed by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA, and many changes were not noted by CS2000 at all.
- Change data quality concerns: potential miscodings, additions, or omissions; changes in crop, hedge types, and boundary configurations frequently recorded inconsistently.

### Hedge Diversity and Arable Plots
- Hedge diversity plots: total 124 species recorded; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%; hedges showed higher-than-expected species richness in QA.
- Arable margins: very small sample (five plots); concordance between CS2000 and QA was extremely poor, likely due to seasonal variation and lesser familiarity with ruderal species; two-visit sampling recommended for future arable margin work.

## Implications for Data Leaders (Data Quality, Governance, and Strategy)

- Data reliability and comparability: QA indicates strong robustness in primary land cover and boundary coding, and reasonable species concordance, but highlights notable gaps in change detection, hedgerow coding, and arable margin assessments.
- Location and relocation governance: eight-year relocation using plates is feasible but imperfect; relocation accuracy is a key data-quality risk affecting downstream analyses and change detection.
- Coding standards and metadata: high concordance for core land cover codes but more variance for hedge/wall coding and BAP classifications; explicit metadata on code usage, seasonal timing, and boundary conditions is essential for future reuse.
- Change capture and temporal analysis: substantial portion of changes not recorded or not substantiated; data users should treat eight-year change signals with caution and consider cross-checks or supplementary data sources.
- Seasonality and observer effects: season and observer differences substantially influence species lists and cover estimates; commercial data products should incorporate seasonality notes and standardized training to reduce variability.
- Data product design: build robust data dictionaries, version-controlled land-use codes, and transparent QA/audit trails; clearly document location accuracy, mapping accuracy, and change-detection methodologies to enable reliable reuse across organizations.

## Recommendations for Future Data Practices

- Enhance plot relocation accuracy: strengthen plate-based protocols, improve sketched-location practices, and incorporate regular retraining to minimize orientation/mis-location errors.
- Standardize species identification: develop updated taxonomic keys and reference materials; implement double-checks or independent identifications for problematic genera (e.g., Poa, Agrostis).
- Improve change detection methodology: refine coding rules for change strings; increase sampling frequency for arable margins; consider additional QA rounds focusing specifically on change recognition.
- Strengthen hedgerow and boundary coding: expand and harmonize hedge/wall coding schemes; reduce omissions by aligning with field protocols and updating annex codes.
- Data governance and provenance: maintain thorough data lineage from CS1990 to CS2000; document QA decisions, changes in codes, and rationale for reclassifications; implement data quality dashboards to monitor ongoing reliability.
- Use of QA results in data products: apply QA-derived uncertainty estimates to analyses; flag plots with lower relocation reliability or higher mis-match rates; provide guidance to analysts on confidence levels for different data layers (land cover, boundaries, hedges, changes).
