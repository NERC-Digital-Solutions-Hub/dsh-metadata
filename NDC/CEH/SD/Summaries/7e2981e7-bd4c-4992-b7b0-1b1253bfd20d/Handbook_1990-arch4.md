# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Aim to update and monitor rural land use and ecological data to keep land-use databases current and relevant.
  - Combines field sampling with satellite imagery to enable bottom-up ground truthing and top-down mapping; two-tier approach enhances detection of change over time.
  - Emphasizes standardised data collection, quality control, and interoperability within the wider data community.

- Data system and standards
  - Core data elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; data captured on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs).
  - Data coding: extensive alpha-numeric code lists (primary and secondary codes) to describe land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, waters, and ownership; codes support complex mosaics while enabling compact map annotation.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) provides guidance for identifying features not on base maps, with field-validated interpretation rules.
  - Importance of clear, consistent field recording to minimise observer variation and enable robust statistical analysis of change.

- Planning, sampling design, and governance
  - 512 squares organized into six groups; six ITE Research Stations coordinate field teams (~85 squares per group).
  - Each square planned for multiple survey visits; flexible scheduling and travel-based logistics; no overtime payments (with time-off-in-lieu for large overtime).
  - Permissions and landowner engagement are integral; procedures defined for partial or full access refusals, with contingencies to abandon or relocate plots as needed.
  - Documentation and ownership/landowner information captured to support access and future surveys.

- Equipment, field procedures, and logistics
  - Equipment kit includes FABs, aerial photos, maps, weather gear, surveying tools, and safety items; local stations provide supplementary items; surveyor-provided gear also expected.
  - General field procedure emphasizes initial site assessment, securing access to the full square, planning a route for thorough coverage, and post-survey data review for omissions.
  - Emphasis on standardised field operations to ensure data comparability across observers and years.

- Data collection and recording (FAB)
  - FAB is the primary data-recording booklet; pages and sections cover ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, vegetation, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, and designations.
  - Use of a structured coding system to annotate features on 1:10,000 maps; combinations of codes used to capture multi-layered land-cover information.
  - Controller guidance for field decisions: decisions must be made in the field; if necessary, notes or comments should accompany codes.
  - Special attention to boundaries (stockproofing, changes over time), ownership clarity, and feature condition.

- Vegetation and habitat sampling
  - Quadrats: large 200 m2 plots with nested sub-quadrats; five large quadrats per square plus five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats placed in diverse land-cover types.
  - Linear plots: up to five linear plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides to capture habitat gradients.
  - Plot relocation rules: pre-positioned quadrats relocated with precision; if land use changes, relocate on boundary boundaries to closest suitable habitat; documentation of changes is required.
  - Percent cover, species inventories, and restricted lists for bryophytes/lichens; persistent marking with metal plates for long-term relocation.
  - Sampling strategy aims to cover major land-cover types proportionally to their area and to sample additional, rare habitat types.

- Freshwater biota and sampling
  - Two freshwater sampling streams: fresh-water biota from flowing waters (IFE) and standing water (NELUP at Newcastle University, water beetles emphasis).
  - From each square: two standing-water samples chosen to reflect characteristic water habitats (lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, flushes, bogs, etc.).
  - Sample handling: standardized collection, fixation, labeling, and prompt transport to Merlewood; detailed site descriptions captured on the sheet.

- Photography and documentation
  - Print film photography of each vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark context; plot number clearly displayed on a board at plot edge.

- Data handling, quality control, and subsequent survey
  - End-of-day checks recommended to avoid omissions; data may be transcribed onto new maps only in exceptional circumstances.
  - All FABs and samples should return to ITE stations promptly for processing and integration.
  - 1990 document emphasizes quality control measures to standardise recording across observers and years; training and a Field Handbook are seen as vital prerequisites.

- Outputs, impact, and continuity
  - Data used to monitor changes in land cover and landscape patterns; integration with satellite imagery to produce a Britain-wide land cover map.
  - Ground-truthing and up-scaling support modelling of ecological processes and change in rural environments.
  - Findings planned to feed DOE/CC and the broader Land Use Programme, with a commitment to ongoing collaboration and shared best practices.

- Key references and contacts
  - Background and methodological framework available through ITE (Merlewood Research Station) and ITE Environmental Information Centre; detailed procedures and codes are documented for field teams and data analysts.
