# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Objective
  - Quantify accuracy and reliability of CS2000 field recording and change statistics.
  - Assess plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, vegetation cover estimates, landcover mapping, and boundary/hedge coding.
  - Compare CS2000 outputs with QA assessments and relate findings to previous CS1990 QA results.

- Scope and Methods
  - Sample: 38 of 519 squares from CS2000; one quarter of each selected square rerecorded (234 species plots across nine plot types).
  - Focus areas: plot relocation, plate stability, species records, vegetation cover, landcover and boundary coding, hedge diversity, and land-use changes.
  - QA execution: relocation tests, species concordance checks, cover estimates, and coding comparisons using the CS2000 protocol and Annex guidance; both surveyors and assessors produced codes for direct comparison.
  - Additional analyses: DECORANA ordination to assess directional bias, ANOVA for axis scores, and per-plot and per-code concordance calculations.

- Key Findings

  - Plot relocation and plate recovery
    - Recovery: 86.7% of plots relocated satisfactorily (210 full plots examined across CS2000 vs QA).
    - Relocation performance (CS2000 surveyors): ~60% accurately relocated, ~25% relocated approximately, ~15% inadequately relocated.
    - QA assessors: ~87% plate recovery (consistently high with CS1990 QA results); overall, relocation success similar to earlier timesteps.
    - Plate specifics: 69.3% of plates located by assessors; about 40–45% could be recovered if counting both exact and approximate matches.
    - Notable difficulty: small habitat plots (Y-plots) had higher failure in relocation (~23%).

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (QA typically produced longer species lists).
    - Overall initial recording accuracy: about 73% concordance; non-concordances largely due to plot relocation differences rather than misidentification alone.
    - Change over time: 1990 vs 1998 QA comparisons show similar efficiency in locating and identifying species; some changes attributed to management/seasonal effects between surveys.
    - Relative performance: CS2000 vs QA concordance similar to or slightly improved relative to CS1990 vs QA, with observed differences largely linked to plot location and relocation accuracy.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - Across the 30 most frequent, appreciable-cover species, several significant differences between CS2000 and QA were detected (e.g., six species showed significant cover differences; some attribution to seasonal effects).
    - Overall cover agreement: strong alignment for several grasses and herbs, but some species showed statistically significant differences in mean percent cover (p-values cited for Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum, among others).
    - Specifics: some species exhibited substantial discrepancies in cover assignments, though overall qualitative patterns (ranking of common species) were broadly similar.
    - Boundary and landuse points: cover estimations at landuse sample points achieved moderate concordance overall, with particular species showing higher or lower agreement (e.g., Lolium perenne and several grasses showed higher agreement; some clover and boundary-associated species showed variable concordance).

  - Change in frequency and land-cover change
    - Change statistics: better than not, but still imperfect; overall axis-1 DECORANA ordination showed shifts in axis scores that did not track with large changes in agreement percentages.
    - Change concurrence: 51.4% of changes were concordant between CS2000 and QA; 33.9% of observed changes were not noted by CS2000; 14.7% were recorded as change but not substantiated by QA assessors.
    - Interpretation: substantial portion of observed changes since 1990 may have been missed or misinterpreted, suggesting reliance on plot data for change assessment with cautious interpretation.

  - Landcover mapping and boundary coding
    - Primary land cover codes: high level of concordance between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors; overall primary land cover agreement around 87.5% (excluding BAP); BAP codes somewhat lower (around 77–84% depending on metric).
    - BAP coding: differences largely reflect ecological class boundaries and changes in broad habitat types; some boundary delineations (e.g., where 1990 boundaries should have been amended) contributed to discrepancies.
    - Land-use primary and boundary qualifiers: strong concordance for primary boundaries (about 92% code concordance; 85% boundary height agreement; stockproofness around 83–89% depending on metric).
    - Boundary features: hedge and wall codes showed substantial agreement, though hedge-shape codes had limited success with the new codes; occasional omissions noted.
    - Change in land-use codes: relatively low concordance for some string-level changes (e.g., hedge types, crop changes, and stockproof status) indicating a need for careful interpretation and possibly revised coding practice for future surveys.
    - Overall: mapping and boundary coding demonstrated robust reliability, with some specific code mismatches reflective of evolving classification schemes and seasonal or management changes.

  - Hedge diversity and arable plots
    - Hedge diversity (19 samples): total of 124 species recorded; 92 common species; overall agreement around 74.2% with surveyor efficiency at 77.4%; mean species per plot CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
    - Arable plots: only five plots; concordance between surveys was very poor (about 30.6% agreement), with a total of 111 records across plots and notable misidentification and seasonality effects; two visits per arable margin suggested for improved reliability.

- Data Quality Metrics and Comparisons
  - Overall landcover and boundary coding showed strong agreement with QA results; minor disagreements largely stem from boundary reclassifications, new coding schemes, or changes after 1990.
  - Cover and species-record concordance varied by species and plot type, with certain grasses and boundary-associated taxa driving much of the differences.
  - Change detection between surveys demonstrated substantial unresolved signal, highlighting the need for cautious interpretation of change statistics and the value of robust field verification.

- Practical Implications for Data Support
  - The CS2000 QA confirms substantial reliability in field data collection and boundary mapping, enabling confident use of the dataset for habitat_change analyses, trend assessment, and policy-support work.
  - Geographic relocation challenges underscore the importance of stable marking (plates) and precise plotting to minimize location-based mis-matches.
  - The observed differences in species cover emphasize the need for standardized identification keys, timing of surveys, and possibly calibration exercises to reduce seasonal and observer bias.
  - Change analysis should be treated with caution; reliance on plot data over time remains informative but requires explicit documentation of uncertainty and potential misclassifications.

- Annexes and Methodological Artifacts
  - Annex guidance covered QA protocol, plot types, plate-plot relocation procedures, and data-recording strings used for field verification.
  - Annex B details dates, squares, and efficiency metrics per square, illustrating historical consistency and the complexity of cross-time QA matching.
  - Annex A/B/C (referenced) provide the formal QA workflow, plotting grids, and coding conventions used in the comparison process.

- Summary of Key Figures (highlights)
  - Plot relocation: CS2000 exact relocation ~60%; approx relocation ~25%; inadequate ~15%; QA plate recovery ~69–87% depending on measure.
  - Species concordance: mean species per plot CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4; overall initial accuracy ~73%.
  - Vegetation cover: several significant differences in individual species’ cover; overall cover-code concordance ~74.4%; landuse-point cover concordance ~63.0%.
  - Change detection: overall change concurrence ~51.4%; substantial portion of changes not noted or not substantiated by QA.
  - Landcover codes: primary code concordance ~88–91% (excluding BAP); including BAP codes lowers overall concordance; primary boundary code concordance ~92%.
  - Hedge diversity: total 124 species; common 92; agreement ~74.2%; mean species per hedge plot ~5.16 (CS2000) vs 5.89 (QA).
  - Arable plots: very low concordance (≈30.6%) with only five plots, indicating limited reliability for arable-margin subtypes in this QA cycle.

- Conclusion
  - The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates robust overall reliability for most mapping and boundary coding components and substantial consistency in habitat-type delineations, with notable caveats around plot relocation, species identification/cover assignment, and change detection. The results inform improvements in data collection protocols, coding schemes, and QA practices for future surveys to enhance data quality and confidence in data-driven insights.
