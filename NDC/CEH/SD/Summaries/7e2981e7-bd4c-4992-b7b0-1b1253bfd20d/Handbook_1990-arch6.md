COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to update land-use datasets and support broader ecological and policy work through data collection, monitoring, and development of data products.
  - Builds on ITE Land Classification System; compares 1977/78 and 1984 surveys to assess changes in land cover and landscape features.
  - Plans a two-tier approach integrating ground-truth field data with satellite imagery; emphasizes current datasets for scientific evaluation and trend detection.
  - Highlights the need for standardized field recording, quality control, and collaboration; promotes data creation and use across multiple topics.

- Data collection framework
  - Three core elements: mapping (extensive geospatial annotation), recording quadrats (vegetation units), and sampling (biological and environmental sampling).
  - Data captured on Field Assessment Books (FABs) and 1:10,000 maps using standardized codes; combines primary and secondary codes with alpha shortcuts to maximize information while saving space.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) supports identifying features not on maps; final FAB is a consolidated field booklet.
  - Outputs include detailed maps, coded data sheets, and supporting notes to enable subsequent analysis and cross-site comparison.

- Planning and survey design
  - Six ITE Research Stations coordinate teams, each responsible for roughly 85 squares; total planned sites around 512 with a two-year resurvey cycle.
  - Survey logistics emphasize flexibility, minimizing travel time, and avoiding excessive revisits; no overtime pay, with time off in lieu for large overtime accumulations.
  - Three survey modes: local daily travel, short-term away, and longer residential groups; planning decisions guided by station coordinators.
  - Permits and permissions are a formal prerequisite to access all land parts; procedures exist for replacements if access is denied.

- Equipment and field resources
  - Provided by Merlewood: FABs, 1:10,000 aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear, navigation aids, identity cards.
  - Local ITE stations supply location-specific materials and field gear; surveyors provide personal equipment.

- Permissions and access
  - Formal letters to landowners/farmers; teams verify permissions on-site and identify appropriate contact persons.
  - If access is refused for parts or whole squares, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon or modify the square and how to document the decision.
  - Documentation includes ownership details, contact information, and, where possible, background information to facilitate future surveys.

- Data recording and the FAB (Filling in the FAB)
  - FABs integrate: mapping data, recording quadrats, and sampling records; a single FIELD ASSESSMENT BOOKLET for each square.
  - Instructions emphasize neatness, legibility, and complete coverage; each page must show the square series number and ownership details, with clear mapping of ownership units.
  - Codes system: primary, secondary, and boundary codes; instructions for encoding complex mosaics or multiple land uses; use of X for point data; avoid clutter by placing codes directly adjacent to features.
  - Documentation of boundary types, ownership, and any changes or notes is required; API-derived boundaries are guidance only and may be overridden by ground truth.

- Plot types, layout, and relocation
  - 6.2.3 Plot types:
    - Quadrats: five large 200 m2 quadrats, plus nested smaller quadrats (4 m2 and smaller) for detailed vegetation recording.
    - Linear plots: up to 5 plots along hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides; additional rules for placement near boundaries and within linear features.
    - Boundary plots: placed at boundaries along hedgerows/fences; relocated to reflect major habitat changes or boundary adjustments.
    - Boundary and linear plots have strict relocation rules if previous plots no longer exist or have shifted.
  - Permanent markers: metal plates or buried markers placed to ensure future relocatability; documentation includes distances and bearings on map and FAB.
  - Plot relocation guidelines account for land-use changes, crop edges, and consistency with historical plots; randomization used when new habitat types appear or when old plots become unsuitable.

- Vegetation data collection and species coding
  - Vegetation sampling uses a standard list of ~200 common species (herbs, grasses, bryophytes); unlisted species recorded at the bottom with nested plot numbers and estimated cover.
  - Cover is estimated in 5% increments; maximum 100% per nested plot, with mosaics described by dominant codes; when multiple codes apply, the dominant or most representative code is recorded first.
  - Special handling for difficult identifications: acceptable species combinations are predefined to maintain consistency with historical surveys.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with a restricted list; some samples may be collected for later identification.

- Sampling design and freshwater biota (7)
  - Freshwater biota collected from flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP) with standardized labeling and rapid transport to Merlewood.
  - Each square yields two freshwater biota samples, biased toward vegetated water bodies; samples are preserved with formalin and properly labeled.

- Photography and data integrity
  - Photography required for every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark context; plot number clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge.

- Procedures after survey
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no omissions; avoidance of data re-entry where possible; if needed, re-transferring data is discouraged but allowed if essential.
  - FABs and samples are transported to ITE Stations promptly for processing and analysis.

- Practical notes and timeline
  - Document originally prepared in 1990 and revised in 1991; emphasizes ongoing standardization, quality control, and cross-year comparability to monitor rural land-use changes over time.

- Target outcomes for data support
  - Establishment of a robust, reproducible data collection workflow that supports cross-site comparisons, trend analysis, and integration with remote sensing data.
  - Generation of high-quality, well-documented field data products (FABs, maps, and coded vegetation data) ready for downstream analytics and policy-relevant insights.
