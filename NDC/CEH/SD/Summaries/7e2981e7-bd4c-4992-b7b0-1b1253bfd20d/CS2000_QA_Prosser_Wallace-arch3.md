# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- QA exercise to measure consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work due to multiple recorders.
- Goals:
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
  - Assess plot relocation efficiency.
  - Explain differences in recording due to observer error, plot location, management, and season.
  - Relate findings to CS1990 by comparison.

## Methods and scope
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares; in each square one quarter rerecorded; 234 plots across nine plot types analyzed.
- Plot types included quadrats and linear plots (road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
- Plate and plot relocation: locating buried plates marking quadrats eight years after original burial; comparison with 1990/1991 QA.
- Data collected included: species lists, cover estimates, landcover/mapping codes, and boundary features.
- QA assessed both field recording and mapping components, plus change between CS2000 and QA.

## Key findings

### Plot relocation efficiency
- For CS2000 plots and plates:
  - 60% of plots accurately relocated by CS2000 surveyors.
  - About 25% approximately relocated; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - 69.3% of plates recovered by QA assessors; 23.3% additional plates located; total recovery possibly up to ~40–45%.
  - 8-year relocation performance comparable to 1991 QA (87.1% in 1991 vs 69.3% plate recovery; overall relocation effort acknowledgeable but variable).
  - X (4m) Habitat Plots hardest to relocate (23% failure).
- Conclusions: Relocation after eight years is feasible but variable; assessors could locate roughly 69% of plates, with overall plot relocation around 60%.

### Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9; QA 20.4 (increase of about 14% in QA lists, likely due to longer lists from assessors).
- Overall, 71% of CS2000 records confirmed by QA; 2% non-concordances due to real changes (management/seasonal effects).
- Initial field-recording efficiency (species present) approximately 73%, similar to the CS1990 QA after accounting for plot relocation differences.
- QA found similar patterns to 1990 QA for species mis-matches, including some mis-identifications, overlooked species, and seasonal effects.
- Direction of vegetation change: DECORANA analysis showed no significant axis shift overall; no directional bias in plot-type or landclass.

### Vegetation cover estimates
- Comparison of cover for top 30 frequent species showed mixed results.
- Some significant differences between CS2000 and QA (notably grass species like Holcus lanatus; Dactylis glomerata; Anthoxanthum odoratum; Elymus repens; Eriophorum vaginatum in certain plots), often attributable to season or plot location/orientation.
- Generally better agreement in cover for several species (e.g., Lolium perenne, Agrostis spp.), but some mismatches persisted.
- Overall pattern: QA tended to produce longer species lists; cover values showed both agreement and notable discrepancies depending on species.

### Landcover mapping and boundary coding
- Primary land cover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA.
  - Primary land cover concordance: about 88% (excluding BAP); BAP codes: ~77%.
  - Overall primary land cover agreement: about 87.5%.
  - When compared to 1990 QA, concordance improved slightly due to easier BAP coding in some cases.
- Boundary features:
  - Primary boundary features concordance: about 85%; code concordance: ~92%.
  - Hedge/wall code accuracy: hedge shapes and boundary conditions showed more modest concordance (67.5% overall for boundary codes; some mis-match between surveyors and assessors on wall types and hedge shapes).
- Change in land use and boundary codes:
  - Change assessment concordance was relatively low: overall change concurrence 51.4%; many changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA; a sizable portion of changes since 1990 were missed.
  - Examples of discordance included mis-coding root changes (e.g., hedges, crops) and occasional spurious changes due to location/orientation issues.
- Landuse coding changes and boundary changes were among the more challenging areas, with notable instances of mis-location/orientation affecting change assessment.

### Hedge diversity and arable plots
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples; 124 total species recorded; 92 common species; mean per hedge plot 5.16 CS2000 vs 5.89 QA):
  - Overall hedge concordance about 74.2% with survey efficiency around 77.4%.
  - Hedge assessments showed a tendency to miss some woody species in the hedge diversity component.
- Arable plots (5 plots):
  - Concordance between CS2000 and QA was extremely poor.
  - Differences largely attributed to seasonal variation and lower familiarity with ruderal species; suggests at least two visits per arable margin plot for robust data.

### Changes in frequency of prevalent species
- Across plot types, around 35% of species records showed mis-matches between CS2000 and QA at the plot level.
- Frequency analyses indicate some common species were recorded inconsistently or misidentified; oversampling of common grasses and under-recording of certain species noted.
- Some species (e.g., Poa trivialis, Rumex spp., Galium spp., Anthoxanthum odoratum) showed notable discrepancies in frequency and/or identification.
- Overall interpretation: many mis-matches tend to average out when aggregated across multiple plots, but they remain a source of error in individual plot comparisons.

## Overall conclusions
- CS2000 field work shows generally robust performance in species recording and landcover mapping, with QA indicating no strong directional bias in changes between CS2000 and QA.
- Mapping and coding of primary land cover and boundary features are fairly reliable, with higher concordance for primary codes and boundaries than for some finer hedge/structure details.
- Change detection between CS2000 and QA is the least reliable component, with substantial discordance and many real changes not being captured, partly due to seasonal effects and coding complexities.
- Data and metadata management, along with explicit data sharing, were identified as ongoing considerations to support data governance and open sharing, echoing general monitoring framework concerns.
- Compared with earlier CS1990 QA, CS2000 QA shows improvements in several respects (e.g., mapping concordance and breadth of data), though arable margins and some vegetation-cover aspects remain challenging due to seasonality and observer variability.
- Practical implications:
  - For future monitoring, plan multiple visits for arable margins and hedgerow-related plots to reduce mis-recording and capture seasonal changes.
  - Emphasize precise location/orientation, improved plot overlap between surveyors and QA assessors, and continued attention to metadata, data quality, and change coding conventions to improve comparability over time.
