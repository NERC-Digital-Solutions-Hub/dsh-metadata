# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- National estimates of Broad Habitat change (Habitats 1–17) for Great Britain between 1990, 1998, and 2007 using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Estimates are summarized by Land Class and rely on mapping methodology described in multiple referenced sources.
- Data derive from the Countryside Survey (CS) project and are intended to support understanding of habitat change over time.

## Data structure and fields
- YEAR_FROM: Year of the start survey
- YEAR_TO: Year of the end survey
- LAND_CLASS: ITE Land Class code (Bunce et al. 1996; 1981; 2007)
- BROAD_HABITAT: Broad Habitat code
- BROAD_HABITAT_NAME: Broad Habitat name (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, etc.)
- MEAN_CHANGE: Mean change in area of the Broad Habitat for the relevant Land Class (000s ha) between the two years
- LOWER_95PCT_LIMIT: Lower 95% confidence limit for the change (000s ha)
- UPPER_95PCT_LIMIT: Upper 95% confidence limit for the change (000s ha)
- SIG_5PCT: Significance at the 5% level (Yes/No)

## Habitat classification and naming
- Broad Habitat codes and corresponding names are defined (Broad Habitat 1 = Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland; Broad Habitat 2 = Coniferous Woodland; Broad Habitat 3 = Boundary and Linear Features; Broad Habitat 4 = Arable and Horticulture; Broad Habitat 5 = Improved Grassland; Broad Habitat 6 = Neutral Grassland; Broad Habitat 7 = Calcareous Grassland; Broad Habitat 8 = Acid Grassland; Broad Habitat 9 = Bracken; Broad Habitat 10 = Dwarf Shrub Heath; Broad Habitat 11 = Fen, Marsh, Swamp; Broad Habitat 12 = Bog; Broad Habitat 13 = Standing Open Waters and Canals; Broad Habitat 14 = Rivers and Streams; Broad Habitat 15 = Montane (1998–2007 only); Broad Habitat 16 = Inland Rock; Broad Habitat 17 = Urban).

## Methodology and provenance
- Estimates are generated from the Countryside Survey data and the 1 km survey sample squares; national estimates are derived from these samples (referenced in Scott 2007, CS UK 2007 Technical Report No. 4/07).
- Mapping methodology and classification are described across multiple sources (Maskell et al. 2008; Barr 1998; Barr 1990; Bunce et al. 2007; Jackson 2000).
