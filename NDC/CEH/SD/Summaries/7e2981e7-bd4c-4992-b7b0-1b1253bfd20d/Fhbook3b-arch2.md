# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose: Provide standardized, time-series ecological monitoring methods enabling analysis of environmental health and policy performance.

- Scope: Field methods for nationwide countryside monitoring in 1 km squares, with standardized data collection, mapping, plotting, and data handling to support policy evaluation and scientific analysis.

## Data collection framework and sampling types

- Three sampling types conducted within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris (heather) sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (carried out by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Soil sampling goals:
  - Five replicate samples per square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status
  - Samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing and storage
- Calluna sampling goals:
  - Collect current year's growth (CYG) shoots for foliar nitrogen analysis to assess nitrogen deposition impacts
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted in parallel by IFE staff; coordination with CS2000 field teams
- Data outputs:
  - Time-referenced, spatially explicit datasets intended for integration with national reports, remote sensing, and broader ecological analyses

## Sampling procedures and field logistics

- Centre of gravity: Sampling points defined within 2 x 2 m centre plots inside each X-plot
- Soil sampling protocol (three cores per square, 15 cm north/east/west of centre point)
  - Two white short pipes and one long black pipe used for cores
  - Proper sealing, labelling, and immediate post to Merlewood for rapid processing of short-duration samples
  - Detailed step-by-step handling to maintain sample integrity and traceability
- Calluna sampling protocol:
  - Collect CYG Calluna shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from several plants within the square
  - Seal, label, and post as directed; drying considerations if wet samples
- Sample dispatch:
  - Calluna samples either posted directly to Merlewood or shipped from the research station
  - Receipt and reclaim procedures documented on T&S forms

## Vegetation plotting and recording

- Plot types and configurations within CS2000:
  - X plots: Large 200 m² vegetation plots with nested subplots
  - Y plots: Small 2 m × 2 m baseline plots
  - U plots: Unenclosed 2 m × 2 m plots across diverse habitats
  - B plots: Boundary plots (hedgerows, walls, fences)
  - A plots: Arable field margins (100 m × 1 m)
  - H plots: Hedgerow plots (10 m × 1 m)
  - D plots: Hedgerow diversity plots (30 m hedgerows)
  - S/W plots: Streamside/waterside plots along watercourses
  - R/V plots: Roadside/verge plots
- Plot relocation and marking:
  - Permanent markers and relocation protocols to ensure repeatability
  - New squares require establishing representative plots reflecting habitat diversity
- Vegetation recording and species lists:
  - Standard sheets with 200 common species on checklists; additional unlisted species recorded with Latin names
  - Nested plots within X plots; Q-values indicate nested plot data
  - Bryophytes and lichens captured with restricted lists; using CS1990-compatible nomenclature and codes when possible
- Coding and mapping:
  - Broad habitat mapping with ground-truth validated codes
  - Transition from CS1990 to CS2000 change-detection mapping for time-series consistency
- Special topics within vegetation work:
  - Ponds and aquatic features tracked using historical pond data
  - Erosion and soil dynamics integrated through MAFF-supported studies
  - Montane and upland habitats treated with de novo mapping where necessary

## Data quality, standardisation, and outputs

- Emphasis on observer standardisation to reduce time-series variability
- Quality control procedures and training documented to ensure comparability across observers and years
- Outputs:
  - Maps, charts, and reports suitable for biodiversity action plans and environmental indicators
  - Datasets designed for integration with national reports, remote-sensing data, and broader ecological analyses

## Data handling, access, and workflow after survey

- Data integrity checks:
  - Post-survey review of FABs and data sheets to ensure completeness
  - Avoidance of unnecessary re-transcription; re-mapping only if essential
- Sample and data transport:
  - FABs and samples transported to ITE stations as soon as possible
- Data accessibility considerations:
  - Standardised coding schemes and documented definitions to facilitate long-term data reuse and cross-study integration

## Annexes and supporting details

- Plant and moss/lichen coding:
  - Extensive CS2000 code lists for vascular plants and mosses/lichens
  - Crosswalks to CS1990 and standardized nomenclature; 200 common species on checklists; additional unlisted taxa captured with Latin names
  - Codes support detailed ground surveys, change detection, and long-term comparability
- GPS data collection (Annex 1):
  - Step-by-step guide for GPS setup, battery/power checks, satellite visibility (need at least four satellites, aim for PDOP < 6)
  - Stationary vs moving position logging procedures; unique file naming per plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4)
  - Data file management, rate settings, and feature naming to ensure traceability
  - Handling obstructions and antenna extension options; guidance on entering plot identifiers via Magellan keypad
  - Post-processing and battery charging guidance; almanac updates and error considerations
- Photography and documentation:
  - Cameras provided per team; photographs of each vegetation plot with clear reference features and plot identifiers
  - Composition guidelines to ensure legibility and future retrievability
- Procedures after survey:
  - Daily data checks, options for re-transcription only if necessary, and timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations
- Additional equipment distribution:
  - Lists of items distributed to teams (cool boxes, pipes, envelopes, etc.) and packaging requirements for shipment

Note: The CS2000 Field Handbook outlines a comprehensive, highly structured approach to re-surveying and expanding countryside monitoring, with explicit guidance on planning, data collection, mapping, coding, plot design, and change detection to support robust, time-series environmental analysis.
