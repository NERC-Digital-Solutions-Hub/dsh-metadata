COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Objective and scope
  - Purpose: quantify the accuracy and reliability of CS2000 field recording and assess change statistics, plot relocation, observer bias, plot type effects, and comparability with CS1990.
  - Sample and scope: 38 of 519 squares from CS1998, with one quarter of each square rerecorded (total 234 species plots across nine plot types); 38 squares included, some previously used in CS1990 QA.
  - Key focus areas: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, accuracy of percentage cover, direction of change bias, landcover coding, and landuse change recording; mapping and boundary feature recording also evaluated.

- QA methods and scope of data
  - Plot types and locations were rerecorded following a standard protocol (Annex A/B). Plate locations, sketch maps, and field photographs were used to relocate plots eight years after burial.
  - 234 plots were analyzed across plot types including quadrats, road verges, streamsides, hedges/boundaries, arable margins, etc.
  - Comparisons: CS2000 field records vs. QA reassessment; and CS2000 vs CS1990 where applicable.
  - Outputs included: relocation success, species concordance, vegetation cover, landcover codes, boundary data, hedge data, and landuse change.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation efficiency
    - Overall relocation success: 86.7% of plots could be satisfactorily relocated (210 plots with full search).
    - Exact relocation: about 60% of plots were accurately relocated; ~25% relocated but not exactly; ~15% not adequately relocated.
    - Plot type differences: Y-plots most difficult (23% failure).
    - Plate recovery: 69.3% of CS2000 plates recovered (vs. 65.2% in 1991 CS1990 QA); eight-year relocation feasible but some searches were less than wholehearted, leading to new plates being used in places.

  - Species concordance and recording accuracy
    - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4 (all plots); QA typically produced longer species lists, with increases similar to prior QA comparisons (CS1990 QA showed ~13–14% increases in mean species lists).
    - Overall initial recording accuracy: about 73% (71% of records confirmed by assessors; 2% non-concordant due to real changes or seasonal/management effects).
    - Causes of non-concordance (TI vs T2 variations) were dominated by overlooked species (roughly 39.8%), mis-location/orientation, and mis-identifications; seasonal effects contributed to some T2 variations.
    - Direction of change: DECORANA ordination showed no significant axis shift overall; no directional bias detected across plot types or landclasses.

  - Vegetation cover
    - General agreement between surveyors and assessors on cover values; six principal species showed significant differences in cover between CS2000 and QA for some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus vaginatum), often linked to seasonal timing or observer differences.
    - Some differences were attributed to seasonal effects; overall, cover agreement remained reasonable but with notable species-specific discrepancies.

  - Landcover mapping and change mapping
    - Primary land cover codes: high concordance; 88% agreement for primary land cover codes; BAP codes 77% concordance; overall primary land cover agreement 87.5% (improved vs 84.3% in CS1990 QA).
    - Landcover change recording: concordance for change generally low; overall change concurrence 51.4%; changes not noted by CS2000 33.9%; changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors 14.7%.
    - Valuation of change: some real changes were missed by the surveyors, partly due to reliance on 1990 strings; in many cases, changes noted were not corroborated.

  - Boundary features and hedge data
    - Primary boundary features: high consistency; total concordance 85.0%; code concordance 92.0%.
    - Boundary height and stockproof status: high concordance (boundary height 89.2%; stockproof 83.8%); minimal directionality bias.
    - Hedge shapes: limited success with new hedge codes (374–380); many hedges still categorized with code 374 (box-shaped hedge); notable mis-match between wall condition codes (306 vs 307) due to differing interpretation of “sound” versus “deteriorating” boundary features.

  - Hedge diversity plots
    - Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%, surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
    - Hedge data generally consistent but with several omissions in hedge-specific species recording.

  - Arable plots
    - Very limited sample (five plots); concordance was extremely poor (about 30.6% agreement); seasonal variation a major factor; suggests the remaining arable margin work should include at least two visits to capture ruderal species reliably.

  - Change analysis and overall interpretation
    - For the quadrat scale, axis scores from DECORANA showed no consistent directional shift between CS2000 and QA data, indicating no systematic bias in change direction across plot types.
    - When changes are aggregated, many individual plot-level changes appear due to location/orientation errors or recording variability; overall, the dataset demonstrates substantial reliability but also highlights limitations in detecting and recording real changes over time.
    - The QA exercise confirms CS2000 data are generally robust and fit for monitoring environmental change, but cautions that change data require careful interpretation and corroboration.

- Overall conclusions and implications for data use
  - CS2000 QA indicates high general reliability and strong mapping code concordance, with meaningful improvements in primary landcover agreement over CS1990.
  - Plot relocation eight years post-burial is feasible, but maintaining exact plot and plate locations remains a challenge; this has implications for precise time-series analyses.
  - Species recording is broadly reliable, but systematic issues remain: overlooked species, mis-identifications (especially among grasses), and location/orientation errors contribute to non-concordances.
  - Change detection at the plot level is the most fragile component; many recorded changes are not substantiated by assessors, suggesting a need for cautious interpretation of change statistics and possibly enhanced field checks.
  - For data users and policymakers, the CS2000 QA supports confidence in broad environmental monitoring outputs (habitat classification, boundary/landuse mapping, hedge features) while highlighting caution in drawing conclusions about fine-scale or rapid change without corroborating observations.
  - Practical recommendations include additional visits for arable margin plots, continued emphasis on accurate plot relocation protocols, and ongoing refinement of coding schemes for land cover and boundaries to reduce misclassifications.

- Data handling and QA references
  - QA methodology followed standardized procedures with Annex A/B detailing target plots, relocation protocols, and mapping comparisons.
  - Findings are intended to inform subsequent CS2000 fieldwork, data storage, and public portals, ensuring standardized, auditable environmental monitoring outputs.
