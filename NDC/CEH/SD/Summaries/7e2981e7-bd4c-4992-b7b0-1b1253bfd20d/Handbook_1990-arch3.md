# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aims and scope
  - Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise policy, evaluate progress, and inform future decisions.
  - Update land-use and landscape datasets to enable current scientific evaluation of ecological systems and monitor countryside changes.
  - Link top-down remote sensing with bottom-up field data to improve pattern detection and provide ground-truth evidence.
  - Create a two-tier data approach: satellite-enabled land-cover mapping integrated with detailed field survey data.

- Monitoring framework design
  - Nationwide sampling of 512 sites (squares) divided into six groups, surveyed by six ITE Research Stations.
  - Two-tier approach: ground-truth field data (land cover, vegetation, landscape features) plus remote-sensing linkage via satellite imagery and land-cover maps.
  - Permanent markers and repeatable protocols to enable future resurvey and trend analyses.
  - Emphasis on standardisation to minimise observer variation; quality control and detailed field Handbook underpin consistent recording.

- Data collection, standards, and governance
  - Primary data collection instrument: Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) comprising maps, recording sheets, and coding schemes.
  - Extensive data coding system (primary and secondary codes) to annotate vegetation, land use, boundaries, buildings, water bodies, and other features.
  - Codes designed to be visually compact (alpha-numeric combinations) yet descriptive; mandatory use of primary codes; avoid over-complication by limiting multiple primary codes.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) used as guidance for feature identification and boundary delineation, with ground-truthing as the priority.
  - Clear instructions for data quality, legibility, standardised units, and when to substitute notes or comments.
  - Data sharing and governance considerations: data used to inform policy-relevant analyses; public sharing of underlying data is acknowledged as a potential barrier in other contexts and was addressed through documented procedures and metadata where relevant.

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - Square sampling and planning
    - 512 squares planned; six groups of survey teams; each square anticipated to take about three survey days.
    - Flexible scheduling to manage travel time, minimize returns to the same site, and optimize fieldwork efficiency; no overtime payments (time off in lieu for large overtime accruals).
    - Three planning approaches: daily local travel; extended blocks away from base; multi-week sampling for grouped squares.
  - Equipment and field logistics
    - Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking plates, sampling tools) and supported by local ITE Stations and surveyors.
    - Identity and permission procedures emphasized; prior contact with landowners/occupants to secure access; failure to obtain permission triggers predefined contingencies.
  - Data collection (FAB)
    - Data recording emphasizes complete, neat FABs; each page linked to a specific square and contains ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, vegetation, boundary details, buildings, and other features.
    - Complex vegetation and land-cover mosaics are recorded with dominant primary codes and supplementary notes; use of X markers for point information (e.g., individual trees).
    - Special attention to moorland, grassland types, hydrology, and boundary descriptions to ensure consistent interpretation across observers.
  - Plot types and layout
    - Large 200 m2 quadrats (five per square) placed in semi-natural/natural vegetation; five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats placed in differing habitat types; multiple nested quadrats record species composition and cover.
    - Linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) and boundary plots positioned to sample habitat gradients; strict spacing rules to avoid overlap and ensure representativeness.
    - Permanent markers and precise positioning using cardinal bearings; relocation rules described for re-surveys and squares recorded in earlier years (1977/78, 1988).
  - Data collection specifics
    - Mapping fieldwork: annotate enlarged 1:10,000 maps with a predefined set of data codes; ensure maps clearly show actual vs. interpreted boundaries; API guidance flags are subordinate to on-ground evidence.
    - Vegetation sampling: standardized procedures for recording species presence and cover; nested quadrat methodology; 5% cover categories; total plant lists include a restricted species set and bryophytes/lichens.
    - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP): two samples per square from standing waters and vegetated habitats; strict time limits and standardized bottle labeling; samples transported for analysis.
  - Photography and documentation
    - Photography of vegetation plots to capture general appearance and landmarks; plot and marker positions documented on visible boards for reference.
  - Post-survey handling
    - End-of-day checks to ensure no omissions; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly for processing and archiving.

- Outputs, applications, and uptake
  - Data contribute to:
    - Monitoring changes in land cover/land-use and landscape features across Britain.
    - Ground-truthing remote-sensing products and advancing two-tier monitoring frameworks.
    - Scientific analyses and modelling of ecological change, supporting DOE ECOLUC and related programmes.
  - Long-term value stems from repeatable methods, enabling trend analyses and cross-year comparisons (1977/78, 1984, 1988, 1990).

- Particular challenges and risk factors
  - Data availability and data quality
    - Earlier datasets showed issues with data standardisation and metadata quality; variability in field recording highlighted as a major contributor to statistical uncertainty.
    - Ensuring metadata completeness and consistent recording across observers is critical.
  - Access and permissions
    - Gaining access to land is essential; refusals can waste survey effort; procedures exist for handling partial or full access denial and for selecting replacement squares.
    - Engagement with landowners and occupants is central to fieldwork success.
  - Data governance and openness
    - Public sharing of datasets can be a barrier; the survey embodies clear governance practices, documentation, and data handling standards to support openness while respecting access constraints.
  - Labor, logistics, and cost
    - Travel time and logistical constraints drive scheduling; overtime policies require management via time off in lieu.
    - Coordinated planning across six stations ensures efficient use of resources and coverage.

- Key components and workflow at a glance
  - Scope: nationwide monitoring of rural environments using a two-tier approach (field data + remote sensing linkage).
  - Sample design: 512 squares, six grouped teams; 1990 resurvey with new sites and relocation rules.
  - Data capture: FAB-based mapping, vegetation quadrats, linear plots, ownership and farmer information, boundaries, buildings, physiography, and hydrology codes.
  - Plot methodology: fixed large quadrats, smaller nested plots, linear plots, and boundary plots with precise layout and permanent markers.
  - Freshwater sampling: two sample types (IFE and NELUP) from standing waters; standardized collection and handling.
  - Output and governance: robust data products for policy evaluation, scientific analyses, and monitoring of long-term countryside change.
