# CS2000 Field Handbook

## Overview and aims
- Standardises field data collection for Countryside Survey 2000 to produce current, comparable GB datasets on land use, vegetation, and landscapes.
- Emphasises time-series integrity, cross-observer consistency, and alignment with national policy frameworks.
- Supports long-term data reuse and national conservation/governance goals through rigorous metadata and documentation.

## Data scope, structure, and  core data streams
- 568 1 x 1 km squares across Great Britain (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man); includes both old and new squares for time-series.
- Core data modules and streams:
  - Mapping and landscape features (FABs and large-scale maps)
  - Vegetation composition and plots (AreA, X, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V plots)
  - Miniature plots for monitoring changes (hedgerows, streams, roadsides)
- Output formats and documentation (FABs, data forms, theme maps, biodiversity-focused maps).

## Data capture, codes, and metadata
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as central data-capture tool; records location, dates, participants, ownership, physiography, hydrology, land use, boundaries, and reference codes.
- Coding framework:
  - Primary vs. secondary codes; standardized alphanumeric codes for land cover, vegetation, boundaries, and structures.
  - Structured handling of mosaics; avoidance of surveyor-created codes where possible.
  - New Parcel Number system with cross-referencing (CS1990) to document changes year-over-year.
- Vegetation data:
  - Standardised plots with fixed species sequence (top 200 species + unlisted species); 5% cover categories; trees/overhangs noted; bryophytes/lichens on restricted lists.
- Spatial documentation:
  - Features mapped on enlarged OS 1:10,000 maps; relocation of permanent plots using GPS and metal plates; guidance from aerial imagery and API conventions; ground-truth prioritized.

## Planning, permissions, and access
- Landowner/farmer permissions required; prior letters and on-site confirmation standard.
- If access is denied or partially denied:
  - Abandon or replace the square as appropriate.
  - Proceed with accessible portions and adjust plotting per guidelines.
- Relationships with landowners tracked by Station Coordinators.

## Field procedures and quality assurance
- Team structure and scheduling:
  - Six teams responsible for ~95 squares each; typical survey ~4 days per square.
  - Old squares surveyed in the same order as 1990; new squares aligned with nearby neighbors for consistency.
- Equipment and care:
  - Equipment provided; surveyors responsible for care; damaged items reported.
- Data quality and standardisation:
  - Standardised Field Handbook to minimise observer variability.
  - Emphasis on training, quality control, and clear guidance for atypical cases; field notes encouraged.

## Mapping and change detection (CS2000 methodology)
- Mapping philosophy:
  - New squares mapped de novo; old squares mapped for genuine change since 1990.
- Broad Habitats framework:
  - Two-tier: Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs) for enclosed lowland; Plottable Broad Habitats for upland/unenclosed areas.
- Change management:
  - Unique parcel numbering; CS1990 cross-referencing to link 1990 data with 1998 changes.
  - Data Recording Forms document changes with rules for adding parcels, amending codes, or creating mosaics.
- Hydrology and ponds:
  - Updated pond definitions and pond maps cross-checked with prior data.
- GIS integration:
  - Maps, theme maps, and BAP maps linked to FAB data; parcel-level linkage maintained across observations.

## Data recording, plot types, and field details
- Plot types and purposes:
  - Areal and nested X plots for vegetation; U plots for upland habitats; B plots for boundaries; A plots for arable margins.
  - H and D plots for hedgerow characterization and diversity; S/W plots for streams/watersides; R/V plots for roadsides/verges.
- Metadata and relocation:
  - Comprehensive species code lists; bryophyte/lichen codes; precise relocation guidelines with permanent markers (metal plates, references).

## Data access, documentation, and annexes
- Annexes support GPS data collection (geospatial relocation and documentation).
- Documentation designed to support cross-year analysis, long-term reuse, and alignment with national frameworks.
- Emphasis on metadata richness (ownership, physiography, hydrology, land use, access permissions).

## Practical takeaways for Data Stewards
- Standardisation is fundamental: strict adherence to FAB structure, plot types, and coding to ensure time-series comparability.
- Metadata richness matters: document ownership, physiography, hydrology, land use, and access alongside spatial data.
- Change management is embedded: use New Parcel Numbers and CS1990 cross-referencing for audit trails.
- Data quality controls: invest in observer training, quality checks, and clear guidance for atypical cases; encourage field notes.
- Spatial-temporal integration: align field data with OS maps, aerial imagery, GPS data, and BAP frameworks to support policy goals.
- Accessibility and reuse: maintain robust documentation and standardized codes to enhance discoverability and reusability.

## Sampling and photography (sections on soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling)
- Sampling types:
  - Soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling; freshwater sampling conducted by IFE staff.
- Soil sampling workflow:
  - Five replicates per square across center plots; 2 x 2 m X-plots; three cores transported for analysis.
  - Specific pipe-based sampling protocol; quick shipping of certain samples to ITE Merlewood; strict handling and labeling.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Collect current-year growth within squares; random sampling from Calluna vulgaris plants; careful handling and timely despatch to ITE Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Conducted by accredited IFE staff; coordination with CS2000 co-ordinators.
- Logistics:
  - Detailed distribution lists and envelopes for sample packaging; post-desk logistics to ensure timely processing.

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Photography:
  - One camera per team; photos of vegetation plots with reference features; include square/plot identifiers on a visible board.
  - Photos should capture plot context and landmarks with careful composition; avoid excessive sky.
- Procedures after survey:
  - Review data sheets daily to ensure no omissions; avoid transposing data unless necessary; transport FABs and samples promptly to ITE stations.
- GPS data collection (Annex):
  - Step-by-step GPS data collection, file naming conventions, and data logging controls; considerations for PDOP, satellite visibility, and almanac updates.
  - Details on battery power, data file naming (e.g., 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4), and plot identifier shortcuts.

## Annexes and GPS data collection specifics
- GPS data collection guidance includes:
  - Battery checks, satellite count, PDOP targets, stationary vs. moving position logging, and file naming conventions.
  - Instructions for starting/stopping logging and post-processing of GPS data.
  - Callouts on obstructions, antenna placement, and handling of out-of-date almanacs.
- Attribute reference and quick-access lookup aids for plot identifiers to streamline data entry.
