# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Scope and Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Explain differences in recording due to observer error, time of year, plot location, and information type.
- Relate conclusions to previous comparative work and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Background
- Field investigations with many recorders inherently vary; QA seeks to measure consistency and reliability across major field components.
- Earlier QA exercises (1989, 1990 partials) informed training and methodology refinements.
- Focus areas include plot relocation, species recognition, and cover estimates, with attention to data accessibility and standardisation challenges.

## Methods and Design
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded to include photographs of plots; same assessors reassessed a single 1 km square from each terrain class; additional self-assessment of 28 squares.
- Plot types (six total): X plots (200 m2), Y plots (4 m2), roadverges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries; a metal plate at quadrat corners used for relocation where possible.
- Additional procedures: Nine predetermined points per quarter for landcover and boundary features; use of sketches, photographs, and metal detectors to locate original plot corners.
- Data handling: Comparison of plot-level data across times; multiple concordance/accuracy indices; analysis by landclass and plot type.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation and Data Completeness
- Plate relocation success: 71% recovery rate autumn 1990 (with five-minute search). In 1991, overall recovery for plates and plots was 65% and 87%, respectively.
- Plot types differ in relocation difficulty: X plots easiest; Y plots hardest; roadverges easiest to relocate; plate-based relocation more challenging in unenclosed uplands.
- Recommendation to improve relocation: use metal markers where possible; annotate photographs to link with plots; consider distance and bearing details.

### Species Recording and Change Statistics
- Overall species list concordance between original survey (1990) and 1991 QA: around 60.9% (using multiple concordance indices); naive % agreement around 45% in earlier autumn 1990 QA.
- 1991 reassessment showed a significant increase in mean species per plot (1990: ~20.2–22.8; 1991: ~23.4), with statistical tests confirming a real difference, not only observer improvement.
- Seasonal and annual effects: drought and growing-season differences substantially influence observed species richness; upland vs lowland responses differ.
- Causes of variation (categories): A misidentifications, B overlooked species, F seasonal/annual changes, G/H relocation problems, I2 relocation/location mismatches; many observed changes attributed to seasonal/management changes rather than true ecological shifts.
- Bryophyte and grass recording: bryophytes under-recorded; grasses with similar vegetative features pose identification challenges; training recommended to improve grasses and bryophytes identification.

### Landclass and Plot-Type Effects
- Lower accuracy in lowland arable-dominated classes (LC) compared with other landclasses; upland (UP) plots showed relatively higher consistency.
- DECORANA analysis (first axis) indicates a gradient from shade-intolerant to shade-tolerant species; 1990–1991 shifts align with previous trends (1978–1988 ECOLUC period) but exhibit year-to-year variation, possibly climate-driven.
- Across plot types, relocation and seasonality effects vary; X and roadverge plots relocate more reliably than Y plots; upland plots less affected by seasonal variation than lowland plots.

### Mapping Landuse, Boundaries, and Species Cover
- Landuse primary codes: generally high reliability; marsh and certain upland categories (e.g., 114 marsh, 102 upland grassland) showed definitional ambiguities; recommendations to subdivide certain upland categories and to create clearer definitions for wet heath and rush pastures.
- Boundary codes: overall good concordance, but common mis-matches occurred between hedge-related codes and vegetation categories; recommendation to simplify and constrain boundary codes (e.g., hedge status) and use qualifying codes to describe composition.
- Species cover mapping: moderate-to-high concordance for dominant species at grid points (81% for single dominant species); lower concordance for co-dominants (around 34%); overall, top two species recording recommended to improve reproducibility.
- Mapping of landcover and boundaries shows high reliability for primary codes but greater interpretation variability with boundary qualifiers and forb-cover codes (some codes poorly defined in the handbook).

## Recommendations (Key Actions)

- Field procedures and training
  - Retain lichens in surveys with minor modifications; provide species samples and habitat information during training.
  - Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey date to separate genuine ecological change from observer/seasonal effects.
  - Emphasize bryophyte and grass identification in training; consider adding species lists and habitat context.
  - Improve guidance on cover data and tree/shrub cover to reduce inconsistencies.

- Location and relocation improvements
  - Photographs during fieldwork are valuable; ensure observers annotate photos and link them to plots with distance/bearing context.
  - Use metal marker plates for X plots wherever feasible; allocate additional manpower for upland relocation.
  - For small Y plots, position with a ground-based tape and orient with the side rather than the diagonal; place at the SE corner.

- Plot and photographic documentation
  - Annotate photographs with features and ensure accompanying sketches reference identified features.
  - Collect distance and compass bearing data to aid relocation in unenclosed areas.

- Landuse and vegetation coding
  - Subdivide upland grassland categories (e.g., upland improved meadow, upland grassland, etc.).
  - Add a dedicated lowland rush pasture code and recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type.
  - Increase the number of primary landuse codes and provide simple, unambiguous dichotomous coding schemes.
  - Limit mapping to the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility.
  - Restrict boundary coding to hedge presence, with detailed hedge composition captured via qualifying codes.
  - Improve forb-cover codes (some were undefined); refine and standardize cover coding to reduce misclassification.

- Data handling and reporting
  - Maintain alignment of QA with the same season/year as the original survey to minimize seasonal biases.
  - Archive datasets with rich metadata and ensure discoverability.
  - Report and interpret changes with caution, attributing differences to crop changes, management, seasonal effects, or relocation issues as appropriate.

## Conclusions for Future Surveys
- Photographic aids are essential for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; time should be allocated for annotating photos and linking them to sketches.
- Plate-based relocation is largely successful; however, relocation in upland/unenclosed areas is time-consuming and may require extra resources.
- Y plots require improved ground-positioning methods and standardized positioning protocols.
- Species-level recording benefits from targeted training on grasses and bryophytes; seasonal effects must be controlled by sampling in the same season as the original survey.
- Landuse and boundary coding demonstrate high reliability with room for standardisation; mapping should prioritise dominant species/events and reduce excessive reliance on detailed cover for less prevalent taxa.
- Overall, the quality of the 1990 Countryside Survey data is solid but improvable through method refinements, better training, and tighter season/year alignment of QA activities.
