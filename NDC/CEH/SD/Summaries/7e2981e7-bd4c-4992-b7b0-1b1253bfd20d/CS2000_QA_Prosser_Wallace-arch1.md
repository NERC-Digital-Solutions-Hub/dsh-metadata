# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Aim and scope
- Purpose: quantify consistency and reliability of CS2000 fieldwork; assess accuracy of field recording, change statistics, plot relocation, and landcover mapping; relate findings to the CS1990 QA as a benchmark.
- Scope: QA of 38 of 519 squares (selected sample); resurvey of one quarter per square across 234 species plots (nine plot types); comparison with CS2000 original data and with the 1990 CS survey.

## Methods and setup
- Sample and plots: 38 squares; 234 plots per square; 210 plots assessed in the QA section; seven main plot types (quadrats and linear plots) including road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, hedges, etc.
- Relocation and plate tracking: attempted relocation of buried plates marking quadrats eight years after burial; assessment categorized as:
  - I) plate and plot located
  - II) plate not found but location closely matched
  - III) plate not found; approximate relocation
  - IV) insufficient plate info; abandoned
- Data comparisons: analyzed species concordance, vegetation cover estimates, direction of change (via DECORANA ordination), landcover mapping codes (primary, secondary, cover, boundary), and changes in landuse strings since 1990.
- Annexes: detailed methodology for mapping, timing, and efficiency metrics.

## Key findings

### Plot relocation
- Of 210 plots with full search, 86.7% satisfactorily relocated.
- Assessors successfully relocated 60% of CS2000 plots exactly; ~25% relocated in a reasonably close manner; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% (eight years after burial), comparable to 1991 QA of the CS1990 survey (65.2%); overall interpretation suggests 40–45% of CS2000 plates were effectively recovered, with many new plates introduced as a side effect of search difficulties.
- Implication: eight-year relocation is feasible but exhibits substantial uncertainty; some relocation errors occurred (e.g., wrong bank side, misalignment with hedges or streams).

### Species concordance
- Approximately 6,000 records across 210 plots analyzed; 71% of CS2000 records were confirmed by QA; 2% attributed to real management/seasonal changes.
- Initial recording accuracy in CS2000 around 73%, similar to CS1990 when accounting for plot relocation differences.
- QA findings indicate a generally similar efficiency of search to the 1990 QA; same magnitude of increase in species lists from CS2000 to QA as observed in CS1990/1991 QA.
- Overall: substantial concordance but notable mis-match sources include plot location/orientation and seasonality effects.

### Vegetation cover
- Visual cover estimates for species >5% were compared; mean covers for several species differed significantly between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), with some differences likely due to season.
- Cover-code concordance: 74.4% for species cover codes; some species showed lower agreement (e.g., Lolium perenne, 35–37% in some comparisons); higher agreement for several common grasses (Lolium, Agrostis, etc.).
- By landuse sample points, overall concordance for species cover bands was ~63.0%; many discrepancies tied to mis-location, management changes, or seasonal variation.
- Conclusion: cover estimates are reasonably reliable for common species but show noticeable disagreement for several grasses and seasonal species.

### Change in frequency of prevalent species
- When assessing dominant species across plots, QA data generally followed the same ranking order as CS2000; mis-matches tended to reflect overlooked species or mis-location/orientation.
- The same pattern as in prior QA exercises: some species over- or under-recorded relative to QA, with season and plot positioning contributing to differences.

### Landcover mapping and boundary features
- Primary landcover codes: overall concordance excluding BAP codes 91.6%; BAP codes concordance 77.4%; overall primary landcover agreement 87.5%.
- BAP (broad habitat) codes showed some expected confusions (e.g., mixing dwarf heath and wet heath; boundaries between BAP types).
- Boundary features: primary boundary features showed strong concordance overall (85.0% with code concordance 92.0%); hedge and wall codes showed moderate concordance (around 67.5%); some mis-match due to new coding schemes and misapplication of older codes.
- Change in landuse codes between CS2000 and QA: concordance in assigning change was 51.4%; 33.9% of changes were not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes were recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
- Implication: landcover mapping and boundary classification are generally reliable, but detection of changes since 1990 is less consistent, indicating a need for careful interpretation of change data and potential under-recording of changes.

### Hedge diversity and arable plots
- Hedge diversity plots covered 19 samples; total species recorded 124 with 74.2% agreement and 77.4% efficiency between CS2000 and QA.
- Arable plots (five sampled) showed very low concordance; high seasonal variation and uncertainty in ruderal species identification noted; two visits per arable margin recommended for future work.

### Direction of change and bias
- DECORANA ordination shows no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA (mean axis scores: CS2000 = 387.8; QA = 392.0; p = 0.847).
- When aggregated by plot types and landclasses, no systematic bias detected in plot positions between original and QA data.

## Overall conclusions for data users
- Data quality: CS2000 fieldwork demonstrates generally high reliability and coherence with CS1990 QA results, especially for plot relocation methods, landcover mapping, and boundary coding.
- Strengths:
  - High primary landcover agreement (87.5%) and strong boundary code concordance (92.0%) between CS2000 and QA.
  - Plot relocation largely feasible across an eight-year interval; substantial proportions of plots were accurately or closely relocated.
  - Consistent direction of change analysis with no detectable bias in overall axis scores.
- Cautions:
  - Change recording reliability is moderate to low (51.4% concordance), with many real changes potentially missed or misinterpreted.
  - Arable margin plots and certain grass species show notable discrepancies; seasonality and plot orientation/location errors contribute to mismatches.
  - Hedge and some land-use adjustments require careful interpretation due to coding and boundary changes.
- Implications for future work:
  - Improve change-detection protocols and update of boundary codes to reflect recent changes.
  - Consider additional sampling visits in arable margins to reduce seasonality effects.
  - Maintain robust plate/re-location procedures or adopt enhanced locator methods to improve relocation success in long-term follow-ups.
