# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- A quality assurance (QA) exercise accompanying the Countryside Survey 2000 to assess consistency and reliability across field teams.
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares (QA) selected from the 1998 CS field program; within each square, one quarter resurveyed.
- Scope: 210 plots analyzed (234 species plots across 9 plot types); comparisons made against CS1990 and CS2000 protocols.
- Goals: evaluate plot relocation efficiency, species record concordance, accuracy of percentage cover estimates, potential directional bias in habitat-change detection, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and recording of land-use changes.

## Aims
- Quantify field recording accuracy in CS2000 and assess change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and observer/bias effects.
- Relate findings to CS1990/CS2000 comparability.
- Assess land-cover/mapping accuracy and the recording of land-use changes.

## Methods and Scope
- Sampled 38 squares with 234 plots re-recorded across seven main plot types (quadrats and linear plots) including road verges, streamsides, boundaries, and hedge/field-margin plots.
- Plate and plot relocation was tested eight years after burial; location accuracy compared to 1990 results and to QA of the CS1990 survey.
- Data collected included species presence/absence, species counts, cover estimates, land-use codes, boundary features, hedge conditions, and boundary stockproof status.
- Annexes describe detailed protocols for plot location, vegetation sampling, and QA procedures; CS2000 mapping and coding schemes were used for direct field-comparison with prior surveys.

## Key QA Findings

- Plot relocation
  - Overall relocation success: 86.7% of full searches could locate plots satisfactorily.
  - Exact relocation: about 60% of CS2000 plots were exactly relocated; ~25% relocated with some shift; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; total plausible recovery around 40–45% (including plates newly introduced).
  - Hardest plots: 4 m Habitat (Y-plots) with ~23% non-relocation rate.
  - Implication: eight-year plate/plot relocation is feasible but requires robust procedures to minimize mis-location and replacement of plates.

- Species concordance
  - Approximately 6000 records analyzed; 71% confirmed by assessors as present at the time of resurvey; ~2% due to real management/seasonal changes between surveys.
  - Initial recording accuracy estimated at 73%, slightly lower than CS1990 (c. 78%), largely due to plot-location errors in CS2000.
  - Seasonal and management effects contribute to mismatches; mis-identifications and location errors are notable contributors.

- Estimates of vegetation cover
  - For the 30 most frequent, cover estimates showed some significant differences for several species (primarily grasses); some discrepancies attributable to seasonality.
  - Overall, there was reasonable agreement between surveyors and assessors on cover levels, with some species showing stronger agreement than others.

- Direction of vegetation change
  - DECORANA analysis shows no significant directional bias in axis scores between CS2000 and QA results, when stratified by plot type and land class.
  - Indicates the overall directionality of change is not systematically biased by observer or plot type.

- Land-cover mapping
  - Codes grouped into primary land-cover, secondary/describe, and cover codes; mapping accuracy assessed at point locations and across land parcels.
  - Primary land-cover agreement: ~88%; including BAP (broad habitat) codes: overall primary land-cover agreement ~87.5%; BAP-specific concordance ~77%.
  - Highest concordance for primary boundary features: ~92% code concordance; overall boundary-related mapping concordance ~85%.
  - Some mis-matches notable in specific codes (e.g., misclassification of Lolium-rich pastures, arable vs. nearby codes); BAP coding was easier and more consistent than detailed unenclosed vegetation codes.

- Recording of change
  - Change-concordance between CS2000 and QA: 51.4% overall.
  - Change-noted by CS2000 but not substantiated by QA: 33.9%.
  - Change recorded but not substantiated by CS2000 assessors: 14.7%.
  - Conclusion: substantial proportion of changes since 1990 may have been missed or misrecorded by CS2000; field data may be more reliable for detecting changes, but require careful interpretation and documentation of coding decisions.

- Hedge diversity plots
  - Hedge plots: 19 samples; total species recorded 124; concordance between surveyors and QA ~74.2%; surveyor efficiency ~77.4%.
  - Mean species per hedge plot: 5.89.
  - Hedge mapping appeared to have been treated as secondary in QA; some woody species were overlooked in the hedge-diversity subset.

- Arable plots
  - Very small sample (five plots) with notably poor concordance.
  - Seasonality and difficulties in identifying ruderal species contributed to discrepancies; two visits per plot recommended for future arable-margin work.

## Data Quality Metrics and Observations
- Across land-cover mapping and boundary features, overall concordance between CS2000 and QA generally high (up to ~92% for primary boundary codes).
- Coverage of species and abundance (cover codes) showed substantial agreement but with notable exceptions for grasses and certain forbs; seasonal variation affected some results.
- Change detection between timepoints showed limited concordance, indicating caution when inferring real change from survey data without QA support.
- The QA process validates that field data collection practices are robust but highlights areas needing clearer protocols and training (plot relocation, coding consistency, change recording).

## Implications for Data Stewards

- Data governance and stewardship implications
  - Robust geolocation and plate/plot marking are crucial for reproducibility across time and teams; consider standardized, tamper-evident markers and mandatory recording of plate status.
  - Standardized data entry and coding guidelines are essential to minimize misclassifications, especially for grass taxa and land-use codes; improve training and reference materials.
  - Metadata should explicitly capture survey times, seasonality, plot orientation, and potential changes in management practices to interpret changes accurately.
  - Change detection requires explicit, auditable workflows; ensure surveyors document perceived changes and reasons, and that assessors verify changes with explicit criteria.
  - Land-cover mapping demonstrates strong consistency, but ongoing refinement of unenclosed vegetation categories and BAP coding is warranted to maintain high accuracy.
  - Arable margins and hedge-related data need targeted QA steps and potentially increased visitation frequency to reduce seasonally driven discrepancies.

- Operational recommendations
  - Strengthen field protocols for locating plots and recording location/orientation to reduce mis-location errors.
  - Introduce or reinforce cross-checks between surveyor codes and QA assessments, especially for high-mismatch categories.
  - Provide enhanced reference materials for grass species identification and for discriminating similar taxa (e.g., Poa species, Rumex/Ranunculus groups).
  - Consider two-visit sampling or alternative approaches for arable margin plots where high variability and seasonality affect concordance.
  - Maintain and improve documentation of changes in hedgerows, boundaries, and land-use features to support future change analyses.

## Conclusion

- The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally high reliability and consistency of CS2000 field data, particularly for land-cover mapping and boundary coding, with substantial concordance between surveyors and QA assessors.
- However, notable issues remain in plot relocation accuracy, arable-margin data, species-level identification (especially grasses), and change-recording consistency.
- These findings inform data governance practices for long-term datasets: emphasize rigorous geolocation/plate protocols, standardized coding and metadata, robust change-tracking, and targeted training to improve data quality across all thematic areas.
