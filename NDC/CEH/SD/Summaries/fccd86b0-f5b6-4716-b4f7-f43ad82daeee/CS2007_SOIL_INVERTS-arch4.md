# Soil invertebrate data 2007 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain Version: 1: 02-6-2016 CS2007_SOIL_INVERTS.csv file details:

## Overview
- CS2007_SOIL_INVERTS.csv contains soil invertebrate (mesofauna) counts from 0-8 cm depth.
- Data collected from up to 256 1km squares across Great Britain during 2007.
- A total of 921 soil cores were analysed; 3–5 cores were randomly selected from 5 plots within each 1 km square.
- Identification performed to major taxa (Taxonomic level 1); Collembola and mites identified to morphotype level.

## Data content and structure
- Key fields include:
  - SQUARE (1km square sampling site code)
  - PLOT (plot identifier within each square)
  - YEAR (survey year)
  - TAXON counts (e.g., ACTO acari total, ARAN araneae, CHTO chilopoda, etc.)
  - TOTAL_CATCH (total invertebrates per core)
  - COLL_TOTAL, AC_COLL_TOTAL (collembolan and acari totals per core)
  - TOTAL_TAXA (taxa richness), SHANNON (diversity index)
  - LC07, LC07_NUM (ITE Land Classification 2007)
  - COUNTRY, COUNTY07, EZ_DESC_07 (geographic descriptors)
- Data use requires acknowledgement of Countryside Survey data owned by NERC-CEH; copyright retained.

## Data collection, processing, and protocols
- Laboratory protocol:
  - Soil invertebrates extracted from cores using a dry Tullgren extraction method over 5 days.
  - Specimens collected in bottles with 70% ethanol preservative.
  - Identification to major taxa; Collembola and mites further identified to morphotype level.
- Documentation and protocols:
  - Protocols drawn from Countryside Survey Soils Manual (2008).
  - Methods, QC, and data handling documented in detail within the manual.

## Quality control and assurance
- Quality Control (QC):
  - After taxonomic identification to level 1, every 1 in 10 of the first 500 samples re-counted/identified by a second staff member; discrepancies resolved.
  - Mislabeling corrected; minor losses of very small taxa possible during transfer; adjustments noted for future reassessment.
- Quality Assurance (QA):
  - Adherence to Defra/NERC joint Codes of Practice; relevant QA documentation referenced.

## Sampling framework and coverage
- Sampling strategy:
  - Britain stratified into Land Classes to reflect environmental gradients, enabling national statistics and cross-country comparability (England, Scotland, Wales).
  - 591 sample squares surveyed in 2007: 289 England, 107 Wales, 195 Scotland.
- Depth and sampling history:
  - Earlier Countryside Surveys sampled 0-15 cm; 2007 sampling focused on 0-8 cm depth for soil invertebrates.
  - Sample locations chosen to maximize geographic coverage and represent environmental variation.
- Power and sampling adequacy:
  - Power analyses conducted prior to 2007 to ensure sufficient sample numbers for major measurements (e.g., pH, loss on ignition) and taxa-level reporting; some analyses used reduced samples where appropriate.

## Processing, analysis, and documentation
- Field and laboratory processing:
  - Field sampling protocols provided; cores logged, processed, and archived with standardized procedures.
  - 5-day extraction, identification, and counting performed following established protocols.
- Statistical analysis:
  - Carried out by a Chartered Statistician per procedures agreed by the Countryside Survey Project Board.
- Documentation and references:
  - Key methodologies and outcomes are documented in Emmett et al. (2008) Countryside Survey: Soils Manual; CS Technical Report No. 3/07.
  - Supporting publications and the Countryside Survey website provide broader context and data governance references.
