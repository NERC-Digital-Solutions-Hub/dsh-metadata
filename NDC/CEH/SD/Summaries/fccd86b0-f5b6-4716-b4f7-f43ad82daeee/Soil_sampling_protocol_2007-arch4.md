# A1.1. Soil sampling protocol

- Purpose and scope
  - Defines field procedures for collecting soil core samples across 120 squares using specified core types (C, F, N, P) and obtaining a composite sample.
  - Emphasizes accurate labeling, proper storage, and timely dispatch to designated laboratories (CEH Lancaster/Bangor).

- Data elements and metadata considerations
  - Core identifiers (C, F, N, P) with fixed dimensions and specific orientation notes (e.g., Core P must be right-side up).
  - Spatial references relative to the centre quadrat: C located 15 cm south; F located 15 cm east of C; N located 15 cm south of C (30 cm from south corner); P located 15 cm west of C.
  - Records of any sampling problems (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulder) and notes in an envelope.
  - Composite soil sample data includes 8–10 sub-samples from along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, depth 15 cm.

- Field collection procedures
  - Equipment setup includes an Electric Cold Box charged during vehicle operation and a mains charger for accommodation.
  - For each X-plot, collect four cores (C, F, N, P) in a defined sequence per centre quadrat locations.
  - Core sampling steps:
    - Clear vegetation; position pipe upright; cut bottom edge; push into ground to depth; place grey plastic plate; hammer to level with soil surface.
    - If depth is insufficient or the pipe breaks, use spare pipes and record the issue.
    - Remove pipe carefully to avoid soil loss; clean exterior; adjust bottom if needed.
    - Reiterate for all centre quadrats in the X-plot (five sampling locations per square).
  - Core-specific handling:
    - Core C (Black): 15 cm south of centre quadrat; bag and seal.
    - Core F (Short White): 15 cm east of Black; leave litter layer intact; cap ends; bag and seal.
    - Core N (Long White): 15 cm south of Black (30 cm from south corner); cap ends; bag and seal.
    - Core P (Long Grey): 15 cm west of Black; ensure correct orientation; cap ends; bag and seal.
  - Composite soil sample (8–10 sub-samples):
    - Use long thin trowel to depth 15 cm; collect 8–10 sub-samples around the quadrat boundary.
    - Combine into a single bag up to the top of the top white panel; seal and place in a secondary bag.
    - Record any sampling issues and ensure minimal disturbance to vegetation when necessary.

- Sample storage and dispatch
  - Core-specific storage:
    - Core C (Black): store in its bag; after all black cores for a square are collected, group and place in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until return to regional coordinator.
    - Core F (Short White): place in a larger bag with other short white cores; store in the cool box; after five samples, place in a CEH Lancaster mailbag; seal and post promptly.
    - Core P (Grey): place with other long grey cores in the cool box; after five samples, post to CEH Lancaster.
    - Core N (White): place with other long white/grey cores; store in the cool box; post to CEH Bangor.
  - General soil sample bag: place in the cool box immediately; post to CEH Lancaster as soon as possible.
  - Postage and submission timing:
    - Post samples as soon as possible; if not possible by the last post Thursday, store in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday.
    - Do not post on Fridays; if local post boxes are unsuitable, use an appropriate Post Office.
    - Refer to OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices.

- Data quality, governance, and practical considerations
  - Emphasizes traceability through proper labeling (bags, mailbags) and consistent core positioning.
  - Encourages documentation of irregularities (vegetation, roots, stones) and reasons for deviations in associated envelopes.
  - Highlights the need for timely data/product delivery to coordinators and laboratories to maintain sample integrity.
  - Acknowledges potential challenges (scattered data sources, need for quick verification, and logistical constraints) and mitigations through clear protocols and standardized naming/labeling.
