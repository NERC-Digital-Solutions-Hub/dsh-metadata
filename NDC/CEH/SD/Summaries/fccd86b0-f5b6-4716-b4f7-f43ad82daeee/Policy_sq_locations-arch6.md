# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares. All other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (Natural Environment Research Council), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, both vital for future surveys, environmental integrity, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports the public interest by protecting the integrity and feasibility of the CS program.

## What may be released and at what precision

- Location data can be released at varying levels of precision depending on need:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence when approximate location is sufficient.
  - Very precise six-digit grid references require exceptional justification; CEH may process data to avoid releasing exact locations, with permission.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (maps of habitats, features) carry confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit locations.
- In very exceptional cases, external release of precise locations may be allowed if the requester demonstrates that their own data/IP are equally or more confidential, preventing CEH from processing alongside CS data.

## Conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensed purpose.
- At the end of the licensing period, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square locations.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences, with签signature by a senior authorised official from the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds for decisions.
- CEH aims to support reasonable preprocessing analysis within CS partnership timelines; requests from other organizations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential CS data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to work with location data; CEH involvement may be part of collaboration or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data support work

- For projects requiring CS square locations, initiate consultation with CEH to determine licensing needs and permissible data precision.
- Ensure compliance with confidentiality, security, and license terms; plan for finite license periods and data destruction.
- Align project data governance with JCOP or equivalent standards if required by the licensing terms.
