# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The document outlines the development of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) from 1978 to 2007, detailing how GB countryside data were stratified, sampled, classified, and reported over time.
- Primary goal: create a representative, time-consistent framework to sample and estimate habitat and land-use features across Great Britain, enabling national, regional, and country-specific reporting.

## Core concepts and approach

- Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of diverse land types.
- ITE Land Classification: a multivariate framework built from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to divide land into distinct classes with similar ecological characteristics.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares classified into land classes; for each class, a set of centre squares is sampled, with surrounding squares allocated to each centre to reflect local variation.
- National estimates are derived by combining per-square data with the area and characteristics of each land class.

## Chronology and evolution of the Land Classification and sampling

- 1978 (CS1978): First national ecological survey using a stratified sampling frame based on an initial ITE Land Classification with 32 classes. 1 km squares centered within a 15 x 15 km grid were classified (1228 centre squares; plus 4 surrounding squares per centre). Final sample: 256 squares (8 per class). National habitat estimates were computed from mean habitat area per square within each land class.
- 1984 (CS1984): Second field survey expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384). Results published, continuing use of the original 32-class framework.
- 1990 (CS1990 All Squares): Emphasis shifts to land-use and habitat mapping with satellite-derived land cover. Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed. All features from CS1984 were recorded again, plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation data. Results used the expanded, all-squares classification.
- 1998 (CS1990 Revised; CS2000 planning): Land Classification updated to support Scotland reporting and to improve regional/local estimates. Class count expanded to 40. Considerations included separate country reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and the need for robust upland habitat estimates.
- 2000 (CS2000): Implementation of separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) by subdividing land classes into country-specific versions, aggregating sparse classes within each country, adding 19 extra squares to ensure representation of new classes, and additional upland sampling module (30 extra squares) to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused reporting prompted further adjustments:
  - Sub-division of land classes into England-with-Wales country units, creating five new class variants (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Number of strata increased to 45; total Welsh sampling increased with 43 extra Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: no corresponding extra Welsh squares; some classes (5e, 15e) remained with only 4 squares each, deemed acceptable for England reporting.
  - The revised framework maps show England, Wales, and Scotland with updated land-class classifications and sampling allocations.

## Sampling design specifics and outputs

- Class structure and representation:
  - Original classes increased from 32 to 40 (1990) and then to 45 (CS2007) to support more granular country reporting, particularly for Scotland and Wales.
- Sample allocation and density:
  - CS1978: 256 squares overall (8 per class).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; larger emphasis on national, regional estimates).
  - CS2000: 569 squares (GB total; additional country-specific sampling and upland module).
  - CS2007: 591 squares (GB total; expanded Wales representation and country-unit subdivisions).
- Country-based reporting:
  - Transition from purely GB-wide estimates to England-with-Wales and Scotland country units, with class sub-divisions and aggregations to maintain adequate sample sizes within each country.
  - Wales received substantial additional sampling in CS2007 to support Wales-only reporting.
- Upland habitat focus:
  - CS2000 introduced an upland module with 30 additional squares to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- National estimates and methodological note:
  - Changes in the Land Classification affect cross-survey consistency of stock/area estimates. Preference is given to using the latest classification for country-specific estimates to maintain internal consistency within a survey, while older classifications may be used for cross-survey comparisons.

## Data management and reporting practices

- The strategy emphasizes maintaining a transparent link between environmental classifications, sampling design, and resulting estimates.
- Results are presented with clear references to land-class areas, class-specific sampling rates, and the geographic scope of estimates (GB-wide and country-specific).
- Figures and tables (e.g., maps of land-class distributions and sample squares) accompany reports to illustrate the spatial framework and sampling density.

## Key takeaways for data-driven decision-making

- Stratified sampling anchored to an explicit land classification enables robust, scalable estimates of habitat and land-use features across GB, with the ability to generate country-specific reports.
- The ITE Land Classification evolved to accommodate devolution and to provide finer resolution for Wales and Scotland, while maintaining comparability with earlier surveys.
- Systematic expansion of sample size and targeted upland modules improved the precision of habitat estimates in under-sampled or regionally important areas.
- Clear documentation of sampling design, class definitions, and country-specific adaptations is essential for reproducibility, interpretation, and discovery of the underlying datasets.
