# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose and scope: This section outlines the equipment and supplies required to perform standardized soil core sampling in X-plots, with attention to data integrity and sample handling.
- Vehicle and power: Electric Cold Box should be kept cool by charging when the vehicle is driven; an electrical mains charger is provided for use in accommodation.
- Field tools and materials:
  - General tools: 2 knives, 2 pairs of pliers, hammer, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel
  - Measuring and labeling: Notebook & pen
  - Packaging and transport: Parcel tape, spare cores, X-plot core packs (with cores, end caps, labelled bags), stamped & addressed mailbags (for 5 X-plots)
- Data and governance readiness: Emphasis on accurate labeling, traceability, and readiness to share underlying data with appropriate governance, acknowledging potential barriers such as metadata gaps and the need for data quality controls at the source.

## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling plan and locations:
  - For each X-plot, take soil cores at five locations within each square, approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat.
  - Five core types (C, F, N, P) plus a composite sample (see below) are collected per square; sampling occurs across 120 squares.
- Core descriptions and positions:
  - Core C: Black, 15 cm long × 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre quadrat corner.
  - Core F: Short white, 8 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; litter layer should remain intact.
  - Core N: Long white, 15 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat); ensure correct orientation.
  - Core P: Long grey, 15 cm long × 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm west of the black core; bevelled end must be placed on the soil surface.
- Sampling procedure (for each core):
  - Ensure the correct core is used for its designated position.
  - Clear vegetation and fresh plant material from the sampling site.
  - Insert the pipe upright, cut around the bottom edge, and push into soil through any roots; if very stony, move the sampling point and record.
  - Hammer the pipe into the soil until the top is level with the surface; use the grey plate on top of the pipe to level it.
  - If insufficient soil depth, move sampling point and retry; use spare pipes if needed.
  - Extract the pipe carefully to avoid soil loss; scrape / clean the exterior; cut the bottom end if needed to level with pipe end.
  - Record any problems (e.g., large roots, obstacles) in the envelope; note unusual vegetation, cow pats, or boulders and move as required for a homogeneous sample.
- Storage of individual cores (pre-combined):
  - Place each core into its corresponding labelled bag.
  - Repack into the pack with other cores of the same type as needed.

## A1.1.3. (Composite soil sample) and handling details
- Composite soil sample collection (for a given SQID):
  - Collect 8–10 sub-samples using the long thin trowel along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat to a depth of 15 cm.
  - Place all sub-samples into the labelled bag; repeat along at least two sides of the quadrat to form a square.
  - If the bag is not full to the indicated level, add more sub-samples until full.
  - When full, seal the bag and double-bag it as needed.
  - Move vegetation as required to access the soil surface and ensure a consistent composite sample.
  - Record any issues in the envelope.
- Handling notes:
  - Maintain soil integrity and avoid disturbing the litter layer for Core F.
  - Use the same bagging and labeling conventions as for individual cores to support traceability.

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C (Black):
  - Store in its individual bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag.
  - Keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle; cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator.
- Core F (Short White):
  - Place in its bag, then into a larger plastic bag with other short white cores from the same square; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected for the square, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post as soon as possible.
- Core P (Grey):
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores for the square; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected for the square, post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag.
- Core N (White):
  - Place in its bag with other long grey cores for the square; store in the cool box immediately.
  - After all 5 samples are collected, post in the CEH Bangor mailbag.
- Composite soil sample bag:
  - Place in the cool box immediately; then post in the CEH Lancaster mailbag as soon as possible.
- General posting guidelines:
  - Post samples as soon as possible.
  - If last post is on Thursday, store in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday; do not post on Fridays.
  - If local post boxes cannot accept packages, use a convenient Post Office.
  - Use OS map data or Road Atlas to locate appropriate post offices.
