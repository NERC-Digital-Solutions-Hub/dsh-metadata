# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Location confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- The policy is framed as being in the public interest.
- Access requests are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and release conditions
- Location data can be disclosed to determine whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit (10x10 km grid) references may be released under licence; precise six-digit locations require special handling.
- In very exceptional cases, six-digit location data may be released externally under licence if the requester demonstrates that their IP-sensitive data requires equal or higher confidentiality than CS data and cannot be processed by CEH.
- Spatial data from within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms.

## Licensing terms
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and was destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor individual landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; a clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy’s principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences (four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support within moderate-demand scenarios; other organizations’ requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH may provide support as part of collaboration or for payment, with negotiation on a case-by-case basis.
