# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Objective and scope
- Documents soil sampling across three time points (1978, 1998, 2007) to detect significant change in soil properties.
- Uses power analyses to determine the number of samples required (referencing Emmett et al. 2008).
- Aims to establish protocols for sampling design, measurements, and data handling to support policy scrutiny and future decisions.

## Sampling design
- Coverage:
  - 1978 and 1998: 256 squares sampled.
  2007: 591 squares sampled.
- Plot structure:
  - Within each country square (CS square), 5 x-plots are sampled (CS x-plots).
  - x-plots are not replicates; they may span different land uses and soil types.
- Relocation and repeat identifiers:
  - x-plots can be relocated due to land use change, access, or uncertainty in original location.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) for tracking across survey years.
- Spatial layout and sampling area:
  - Each sampling point is within a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot; cores are collected from around the four corners of this plot (approx. 2–3 m apart).

## Sampling methods and depth
- Depths:
  - Top 15 cm sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm depth for invertebrate sample).
  - In 1978, soil pits were dug to sample the top 15 cm.
- Techniques:
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; some cores not full due to stones or shallow soils.
  - 2007 included core photographs and measurements of core dimensions for some cores.
- Core specifics:
  - Some samples were black cores (15 cm deep, 5 cm ID) and others white, with varying measurement sets.

## Measurements and data scope
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990s/2007: broader suite with multiple cores, different measurements per core:
  - Measurements typically include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, depth of organic layer, soil moisture, texture indicators (hand texture), Olsen P, minerals/metals, mineralisable N, and photographs.
  - Some measurements are only available for a subset of plots (e.g., metals, specific core types).
  - Across 2007, measurements were taken for all 591 squares for several parameters; some measurements were limited to the original 256 squares or to 2 of the 5 x-plots per square for certain variables.
- Data release notes:
  - Certain data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation
- Consideration of land class structure:
  - Analyses may be biased if land class structure is ignored; without adjustment, results reflect stock and change of the population rather than regional estimates.
- Recommended modelling approach:
  - Use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each square.
  - Recognize that design-based approaches (dispersed sampling) can increase overall precision and regional coverage when estimating national or regional metrics.
- Practical guidance:
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation.
  - Review CS publications that exploit the data for context and methodological insights.

## Data governance, access, and guidance
- Metadata and data access barriers:
  - Data may have incomplete metadata, requiring contact with original data creators.
  - Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier for some datasets.
- Data management and openness:
  - Emphasis on data quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and clear presentation (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Data governance processes are important to ensure data meet standards and remain up to date.
