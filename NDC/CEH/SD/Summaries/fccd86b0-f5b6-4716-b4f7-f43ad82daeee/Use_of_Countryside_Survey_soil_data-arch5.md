# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Soils were sampled in CS in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
  - 256 squares sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007 soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
  - Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Samples come from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates due to varying land uses, soil types, etc.
  - x-plots may be relocated over time if a plot is destroyed, access is denied, or relocation certainty is lacking.
  - Each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1), referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
  - Samples with the same repeat identifier are from the same location, though the exact sampling point may be ~2–3 m from previous corners of a permanently marked 2m × 2m plot.

- Sampling procedures
  - Top 15 cm of soil is collected (8 cm for invertebrate samples); 1998 and 2007 used a soil core hammered into the soil and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit to collect the top 15 cm.
  - In some soils, full core collection was not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and detailed core dimension measurements were taken in 2007 for 2 of the 4 cores sampled.

- Measurements and laboratory work
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1990: some soil mapping was conducted.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (Table 1).
  - No chemical analyses are performed by soil horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density was measured in 2007, but not using the ISO whole-core bulk density method.
  - A full description of methods and implications is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Data structure and measurements across years
  - For 2007, measurements include pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other core-specific measurements.
  - The number of samples varies: some measurements cover all 591 squares; other measurements cover only the original 256 squares or limited x-plots within those squares.
  - Table 1 lists the measurements by core type; some data are released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

- Statistical analysis guidance
  - Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change estimates for the overall population, while incorporating land classes yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
  - A mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - Design-based approaches (dispersed observations) can increase regional precision and coverage; spatial structure is not the primary focus.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

- Data governance and documentation notes
  - Some measurements and core data are released only after the 2009 Soils Report; data availability is year- and measurement-dependent.
  - Data are tied to unique identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1) and have undergone changes in sampling locations over time, requiring careful provenance tracking.
  - The dataset references extensive methodological detail in Emmett et al. (2008), indicating the need for traceable metadata and method notes.
