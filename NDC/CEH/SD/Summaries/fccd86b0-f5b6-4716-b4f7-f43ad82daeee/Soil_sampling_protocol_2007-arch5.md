# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose for Data Stewards: Ensure field sampling is performed consistently and data collected (soil cores and composites) are properly labeled, stored, and dispatched for subsequent use and discovery.
- Equipment and setup:
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool by vehicle charging; mains charger for accommodation)
  - Field tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel
  - Documentation and logistics: notebook & pen, parcel tape, spare cores, packs for X-plots
  - 1 pack per square containing:
    - X-plot packs with labeled bags, end caps
    - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots
- Data governance implications:
  - Clear labeling and packaging enable traceability and reduce misidentification
  - Provision of spare cores supports data integrity when equipment fails
  - Adequate documentation aids metadata completeness and audit trails

## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Data items and structure:
  - Core types and positions per X-plot in each square:
    - Core C: Black, 15 cm long, 5 cm diameter (located 15 cm south of the centre-quadrat corner)
    - Core F: Short White, 8 cm long, 4 cm diameter (15 cm east of the Black core; leave litter layer intact)
    - Core N: Long White, 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter (15 cm south of the Black core)
    - Core P: Long Grey, 15 cm long, 4 cm diameter (15 cm west of the Black core; orientation must be bevelled end on surface)
  - Composite soil sample: 8–10 sub-samples collected along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, depth ~15 cm
  - Sampling locations: five sampling locations per square, across all X-plots
  - Spatial considerations: if vegetation, cow pats, boulders, or roots impede sampling, move to a new point and record the change
- Data quality and provenance controls:
  - Verify correct core placement and correct core type for each position
  - Remove surface vegetation and fresh plant material from cores
  - Maintain orientation and prevent soil loss when extracting cores (avoid breaking or distorting pipes)
  - If a core breaks or distorts, substitute with a spare pipe
  - Use the appropriate tools to extract, trim bottom ends, and prepare cores for bagging
  - Record any anomalies (e.g., unusual vegetation, obstacles) in the envelope with a note
- Metadata considerations:
  - Position relative to centre-quadrat, distance from southern/northern/eastern/western references
  - Core order and which square and X-plot the sample belongs to
  - Any deviations from protocol and corrective actions taken

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Data management and storage steps:
  - Return all four cores to the vehicle and store by core type:
    - Core C (Black): bagged; store together with other Black cores in a spare plastic bag; keep cool in cardboard box; away from direct sunlight until return to regional coordinator
    - Core F (Short White): bag in larger plastic bag with other Short White cores; store in cool box; after five samples, place in mailbag for CEH Lancaster and post promptly
    - Core P (Grey): bag with other Long Grey cores; store in cool box; post after all five samples
    - Core N (White): bag with other Long Grey cores; store in cool box; post to CEH Bangor after all five samples
  - Composite soil sample bag: place in cool box immediately; later post in mailbag for CEH Lancaster
- Dispatch and timing:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post Thursday is not feasible, place in cool box over weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Friday
  - If local post boxes cannot accept packages, use a nearby Post Office
  - Reference OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices
- Data governance and supply chain considerations:
  - Maintains chain-of-custody through labeling, bagging, and mailbags
  - Ensures timely delivery to designated CEH labs to preserve data quality
  - Standardized packaging and routing enable reproducibility and data discoverability

## Posting

- Data handoff and discoverability:
  - Samples are posted to CEH Lancaster (for F and P composites and C) or CEH Bangor (for N cores) as specified
  - Clear documentation and labeling support downstream data cataloging and dataset integration
- Risk and contingency planning:
  - Weekend storage in cool box reduces risk of temperature-sensitive degradation
  - Avoids Friday posting to minimize weekend delays and potential sample compromise
