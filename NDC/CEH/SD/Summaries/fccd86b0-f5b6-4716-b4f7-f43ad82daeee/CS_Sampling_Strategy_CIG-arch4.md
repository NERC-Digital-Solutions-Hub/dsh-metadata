# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the latest field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify GB sampling for ecological and land-use survey work.
  - Emphasises time-series value and linkage to predecessors, ensuring continuity and comparability across surveys.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to represent ecological variation and minimize bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) define land classes; initially 32 classes, later expanded.
  - Sample unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; initial approach used centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares classified to extend representation.

- Key developments and their implications
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
    - 32 Land Classes created using environmental attributes; eight samples per class (256 total) across GB.
    - National habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square by class and total class areas.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Increased sample per class to 12 squares; total 384 squares.
    - Methodology remained based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
    - Expanded classification to include all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; repeat vegetation and habitat data collected.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - Early 1990s (Classification refinements)
    - Recognised need to classify every GB square; developed surrogate-based multivariate classifications due to computing limits.
    - 62% correspondence between original 1228-square classification and new classifications; non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes, preserving mean class characteristics.
  - 2000 (CS2000: separate country estimates)
    - Addressed policy needs to produce England/Wales and Scotland-specific results.
    - Land Classes subdivided by country units; total 40 strata after aggregation and subdivision; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; Welsh-specific adjustments included.
    - Introduction of uplands module planned to improve estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007: Wales-focused reporting and further refinements)
    - Responded to devolved governance needs for Wales by creating Wales-specific Land Class sub-divisions (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanding to 45 strata.
    - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class); England adjustments to compensate for Welsh additions (some classes with as few as 4 squares).
    - Land Class maps revised for England with Wales and Scotland; Wales receives targeted sampling to improve Wales-only estimates.
    - Wales and England distributions adjusted to support country-specific environmental policy needs.

- Sampling framework and data governance
  - Sample allocation and country splits
    - CS1990 used a GB-wide approach; CS2000 and CS2007 introduced country-unit stratification to provide England & Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
    - Class sub-division and aggregation ensure adequate representation within each country unit.
  - Data quality, consistency, and time-series considerations
    - Changing Land Classifications across surveys can affect national estimates; two approaches discussed: (a) latest country-specific classification for country estimates, (b) original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
    - Emphasis on documenting and managing classification changes to preserve comparability of time-series data.
  - Upland module
    - Optional upland habitat sampling added to CS2000 to improve precision for upland estimates in England and Wales.

- Outputs and documentation
  - CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 reports document sampling frames, class structures, and country-specific estimates.
  - Land Classification maps updated to reflect country-focused sampling frameworks (England with Wales, Scotland; and Wales-specific sub-classes in later surveys).
