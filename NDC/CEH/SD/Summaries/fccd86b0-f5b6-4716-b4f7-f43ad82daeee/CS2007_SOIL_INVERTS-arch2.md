# Soil invertebrate data 2007 [Countryside Survey], Great Britain

- Provides soil invertebrate (mesofauna) counts from 0-8 cm depth, sampled in 2007 across up to 256 1 km squares in Great Britain.
- Data are part of the Countryside Survey (CS2007) and are © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.

## Sampling strategy and scope

- Based on Countryside Survey’s rigorous, stratified design across Great Britain.
- GB divided into Land Classes reflecting major environmental gradients to ensure national representativeness and comparability across England, Scotland, and Wales.
- 591 sample squares surveyed in 2007: 289 England, 107 Wales, 195 Scotland.
- Soil samples from top 0-15 cm collected in 1978 methodologically adjusted for 2007: 0-8 cm mesofauna samples from the western corner of Main Plots within each selected square.
- 921 soil cores analyzed in total; 3-5 cores randomly selected from 5 plots per square for analysis.

## Field and laboratory methods

- Extraction: dry Tullgren method (5 days) from soil cores; collection into 70% ethanol preservative.
- Identification: major taxa identified to Taxonomic level 1; Collembola and mites identified to morphotype level; other groups counted to genus/species as available.
- Field and lab processing documented in Countryside Survey Soils Manual (CS Technical Report No. 3/07).

## Quality Assurance and Quality Control

- Field/lab protocols standardized; standard samples and blind replicates included in analytical runs.
- Methods cross-checked when changes occurred; re-analysis conducted using original methods or alternative labs when issues identified.
- Verification: for the first 500 samples, 1 in 10 re-counted/identified by a second staff member; differences resolved and records updated.
- Outcome: t-test comparisons showed no significant differences between original and validated fauna counts; acknowledges potential minor loss of the smallest invertebrates during transfer.

## Data management and usage

- Protocols, QC/QA procedures, archiving, and data manipulation details available in Emmett et al. 2008 CS Soils Manual; data management and analysis aligned with CS project governance.
- Data intended to support national statistics and environment-health interpretations; outputs suitable for reports, maps, and charts; datasets stored and accessible via appropriate data portals, with clear acknowledgement requirements.

## Notes and limitations

- Sampling size and power analyses performed to ensure robust reporting for major habitats and country-level reporting.
- Some taxa analyses focused on morphotype level for Collembola and mites; minor losses possible for the smallest taxa during transfer.
- Depth specificity: data reflect 0-8 cm mesofauna counts from cores within 1 km squares across GB, with standardized sampling locations across years for comparability.
