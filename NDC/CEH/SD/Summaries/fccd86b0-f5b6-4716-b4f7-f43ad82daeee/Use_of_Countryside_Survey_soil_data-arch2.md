# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Sampling design
- Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007; 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares, while 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location
- Sampling uses CS x-plots within each CS square, with 5 x-plots per square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
- Some x-plots were relocated over time due to destruction, access denial, or uncertainty about original location; each site has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Repeated samples may come from the same location but from around a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot, typically 2–3 m apart.
- See Emmett et al. (2008) for details.

## Sampling
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998 and 2007 used soil cores hammered into the soil; 1978 used a soil pit.
- In some soils, full core collection was not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed core dimensions were recorded for 2 of the 4 cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements; not all measurements are done on every core (see Table 1).
- Samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements; chemical analyses by horizon are not conducted.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not by ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
- Further methodological details and implications are available in Emmett et al. (2008).

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock and change of the population, while accounting for land classes yields national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; CS recommends using a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
- CS design emphasizes dispersed observations for regional estimates rather than focusing on spatial structure.
- Users are advised to consult CEH before analysis and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

## Additional notes
- Table 1 lists measurements per core; some measurements are available for all 591 squares, others only for original 256 squares or a subset of x-plots.
- Data release: some measurements were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.
