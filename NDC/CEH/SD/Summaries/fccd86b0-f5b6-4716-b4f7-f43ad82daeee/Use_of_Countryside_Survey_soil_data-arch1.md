# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Aims and context
  - Documents sampling design, measurement protocols, and statistical considerations for soils data in Countryside Survey (CS) 2007, with reference to prior years (1978, 1998) and power analyses to detect significant change.

- Sampling design and timeline
  - Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 squares; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples in 2007.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
  - Some plots relocated across years due to destruction, access, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each sampling location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1): samples with the same ID originate from the same location, though actual sampling may be 2–3 m apart around a 2 m × 2 m plot.
  - See Emmett et al. (2008) for more details.

- Sampling methods
  - Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples) in 1998 and 2007 using a soil core; 1978 used a pit to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 for 2 of the 4 cores sampled (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements and laboratory work
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990s onward: soil mapping occurred; multiple cores per x-plot in 1998 and 2007; different cores carry different measurements (see Table 1).
  - No horizon-specific chemical analyses; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO whole-core method).
  - CEH report (Emmett et al. 2008) provides full methods and implications.

- Measurements recorded (CS 2007)
  - LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, Bulk density, Core dimensions, Photograph, Depth of organic layer, Hand texture, Soil moisture, Olsen P, Metals.
  - Data coverage varies:
    - All 591 squares for LOI, pH, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals (on subset).
    - Original 256 squares for several measurements (e.g., %C, %N, metals on restricted x-plots).
    - Metals data available for 2 of the 5 x-plots within the original 256 squares.
  - Some measurements released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.

- Data structure, availability, and guidance
  - In 2007, all 591 CS squares were sampled for certain measurements; others were limited to the original 256 squares.
  - Multiple cores per x-plot within a square; different cores have different measurements.
  - Data and metadata are linked to repeat identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1); exact core locations may vary within the sampling plot.
  - Researchers are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Statistical analysis and interpretation guidance
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change estimates rather than national estimates.
  - If land classes are included, results are weighted to produce national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not universally used in CS soils analyses.
  - Because the CS structure is not primarily spatially focused, a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to account for multiple x-plots per square.
  - For design-based approaches, a dispersed set of observations improves precision and regional coverage; for regional estimates, broad spatial placement is advantageous.
  - Researchers should consult CEH and review existing publications using CS data (via the CS website) for appropriate analysis practices.
