The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Documents the Sampling Strategy and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify field sampling for Countryside Survey GB from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes a stratified, random sampling framework linked to an environmental land classification to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across Great Britain (GB).
- Describes how classifications were developed, revised, and applied to enable national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.

## Core Concept: Stratified Sampling via ITE Land Classification
- The ITE Land Classification (initially 32 classes) provides strata that reflect environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to guide sampling and estimates.
- Sampling units were 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) with surrounding squares allocated to classes to aid classification robustness.
- The approach aimed to minimize bias by ensuring representation across ecological variation through stratification rather than purely random sampling.

## Evolution by Survey Year

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification (CS1978)
- Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 center 1 km squares; surrounding four squares classified for each center.
- Classified set comprised about 6,039 km squares; eight samples per class, totaling 256 squares surveyed.
- National habitat estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square with the land-class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey (CS1984)
- Expanded survey to 12 center squares per land class (total 384 squares); eight previously visited remained.
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
- Moved to classifying every GB square (not just a subset) using a revised approach; satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to the programme.
- 508 squares surveyed; added urban/seascape corrections; CS1990 results published with the 1990 main report.

### 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification (CS2000)
- Recognized need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and better upland habitat estimates.
- New Land Classification extended to cover every GB square using key climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates; earlier 32-class system expanded to 40 classes.
- Adjusted sampling to enable separate country estimates:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions.
  - Aggregation of under-represented rump classes within countries.
  - Added 19–plus samples to ensure adequate class representation; extra samples allocated to balance England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific adjustments (e.g., sub-division of Land Class 17) and Isle of Man replacements.
- Introduced upland habitat module with additional 30 squares for England and Wales to improve upland estimates.
- Outputs included revised Land Classification maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; Table 2 summarizes survey numbers and distributions; Figure 5 shows sample squares.

### 2007 – Welsh-focused Adjustments (CS2007)
- Devolution increased demand for Wales-only habitat reporting; Wales received more sampling to improve Welsh-class representation.
- Created country-unit sub-classes (5 new in Wales/England mix: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
- Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure a minimum of six squares per Welsh class; no corresponding English increase in response, though precision impact deemed small.
- England classes 5e and 15e left with four squares each to maintain reasonable precision.
- Revised class maps for England, Wales, and Scotland; England-Wales framework used for CS2007 sample distribution.

## Land Classification and Data Outputs
- Land Classification maps underpin sampling and national estimates; original maps described as part of the 1978 framework with ongoing refinements.
- Tables and figures document class descriptions, sample counts, and geographic distribution (e.g., Table 1: original 32 classes; Table 2/3: CS1990–CS2007 sample numbers; Figure 4–7: revised class maps and sample grids).
- Note on national estimates: shifting classification systems affects consistency; CS1990 vs CS2000 vs CS2007 national estimates require careful cross-walking or consistent use of the latest classification for internal consistency.

## Country-level and Special Modules
- Separate country estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) were introduced to reflect policy needs; Isle of Man samples were replaced to maintain country-specific integrity.
- Wales-only and upland modules were incorporated to deliver more accurate, policy-relevant estimates for specific regions and habitat types.

## Practical GIS Implications
- Time-series analyses must account for changes in land classifications (32 -> 40 -> 45 classes) and country-unit subdivisions.
- Spatial data integration across surveys requires crosswalks or consistent classification usage to maintain comparability.
- Outputs include detailed Land Classification maps aligned with country units, supporting policy reporting and habitat/change monitoring.

## Takeaways for GIS Practitioners
- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy is a historically rich, stratified framework built on the ITE Land Classification to produce robust habitat estimates at GB, country, and upland levels.
- The framework evolves to address policy needs for Wales and uplands, necessitating careful handling of class definitions, sampling density, and cross-year comparability.
- GIS work should prioritize maintaining consistent class definitions over time, document classification changes, and implement crosswalks when integrating multi-year survey data.
