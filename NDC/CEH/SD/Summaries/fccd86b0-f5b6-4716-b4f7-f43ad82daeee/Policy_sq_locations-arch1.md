# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future surveying permissions.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- CS partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
  - Natural England (NE)
  - Welsh Government (WG)
  - The Scottish Government (SG)
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
  - Forestry Commission (FC)
  - Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
  - Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

- When location data may be released and precision levels
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Six-digit grid references require pre-processing analysis by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances may external licence release be granted, with legal demonstration that the external data carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares could be used to identify square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit location data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational duties.
  - End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP) if requested.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; releases must not enable pinpointing square locations.

- Responsibilities and processes
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with clauses reflecting policy; signed by a senior signatory from the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under FOI Regulations.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical notes for analysts
  - The policy emphasises balancing data utility with safeguarding sampling integrity and landowner relations.
  - Where feasible, processing can be done by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations.
  - Public data remains available for other aspects of the CS dataset, separate from confidential square locations.
