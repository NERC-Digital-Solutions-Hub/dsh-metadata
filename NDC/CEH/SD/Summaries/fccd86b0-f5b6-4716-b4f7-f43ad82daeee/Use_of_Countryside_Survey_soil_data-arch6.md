# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils were sampled in the Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- 256 squares were sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007, 591 CS squares were sampled, though not all measurements were made on all samples.
- Power analyses were conducted to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and structure
- Soils are sampled from the CS x-plots, with 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc.
- Over time, x-plots may be relocated if a plot is destroyed, access is denied, or relocation certainty is lacking.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) corresponding to a square and repeat plot.
- Samples with the same identifier come from the same location, though exact sampling positions are typically 2–3 m apart within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling method
- Top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for the invertebrate sample) collected.
- 1998 and 2007 used soil cores; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Sometimes full cores could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were recorded for 2 of the 4 cores.

## Measurements and data scope
- 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements across cores (Table 1 provides the breakdown).
- No chemical analyses were performed by soil horizons; samples were homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method); a full description and implications are available in Emmett et al. 2008.
- Table 1 (referenced in the text) lists the measurements per core; in 2007, measurements included: LOI, pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, and mineralisable N (various combinations across original 256 squares and all 591 squares).

## Data release notes
- Some measurements were restricted and released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical analysis guidance
- Analyses should consider land class structure; ignoring it yields stock and change estimates for the population rather than national estimates that are weighted by land classes.
- Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS structure should be accounted for.
- A mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to handle multiple x-plots within each CS square.
- Design-based approaches emphasize dispersed, broad sampling to improve regional estimates.
- For analysis and interpretation, CS data users are advised to consult CEH and review published CS outputs on the CS website.
