# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets the rules for access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to location data; all other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Both are essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public-interest rationale: protects the ability to continue surveys and inform environmental policy.

## When and how locations may be released
- General usability: approximate locations can be identified within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references (10x10 km squares) under licence.
- Higher precision: six-digit grid references require processing by CEH to avoid releasing precise locations; in very exceptional cases, six-digit data can be released under licence if the requester demonstrates that their own IP-sensitive data holds equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could be used to infer square locations and are released only under the same exceptional circumstances as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- End of license: licensees must confirm destruction of data in writing.
- Data must not be shared with third parties in a way that could compromise square confidentiality; not used to plan visits or check compliance by landowners.
- Potential licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria.
- A clause prohibits attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate confidentiality clauses; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access requests and decision grounds.
- CEH will, subject to moderate demand, support internal pre-processing analyses needed by CS partners; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to data usage; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
