# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, a stratified system used since 1978 to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
  - Emphasises linking time-series survey data to detect change in environmental features and policy-relevant metrics.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to reduce bias and capture ecological variation across land types.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) used to divide GB into land classes; central square approach initially classified, with surrounding squares added to reflect class context.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the sampling unit for field surveys; centre squares originally classified, with adjacent squares allocated to classes to reflect landscape context.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) as the multivariate method underpinning the initial classification.

- Evolution of the sampling framework (chronology)
  - CS1978 (1978, field survey 1977–1978)
    - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1228 central 1 km squares (plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
    - 8 squares surveyed per class; total 256 squares.
    - National estimates for habitat areas calculated from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by the class area.
  - CS1984 (1984, field survey)
    - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384) to improve precision.
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - CS1990 (1990, field survey)
    - Transition to an All Squares Land Classification; every 1 km square in GB classified.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added land-cover mapping; included repeat of earlier quadrats.
    - National estimates based on the revised, comprehensive classification (results published in 1993).
  - CS2000 (2000, field survey)
    - Land Classification updated to enable separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland).
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; strata increased from 32 to 40.
    - 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; extra sampling adjusted to maintain relative representation across England & Wales.
    - Introduction of separate uplands habitat sampling module for England & Wales to improve upland estimates.
  - CS2007 (2007, field survey)
    - Wales-focused reporting requirements led to Welsh-only class subdivisions (creating new Wales-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate Welsh class representation.
    - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to 4 squares each; overall precision deemed acceptable given Welsh adjustments.
    - Revised class maps and updated sampling framework for England, Wales, and Scotland.

- National estimates and country-based reporting
  - CS1990 used a single GB Land Classification for national estimates across the UK.
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) with country-specific sampling frames.
  - CS2007 refined to support Wales-only reporting while maintaining England-wide estimates; introduced country-unit subdivisions and redistribution of squares to reflect country needs.

- Data outputs and reporting
  - Outputs include habitat area estimates, change statistics, and maps/charts derived from the stratified classification.
  - Emphasis on ensuring that the sampling frame allows robust national and country-level estimates over time.

- Challenges and methodological notes
  - Note on national estimates: changing the basic classification affects consistency of stock estimates; balance between raw consistency (using original classification) and comparability with newer surveys (using latest classifications) is discussed.
  - Handling of class representation shifts due to reclassification and reallocation of squares; some non-matching squares fall into neighboring classes, preserving overall class characteristics.
  - Data integration: ongoing need to make datasets more valuable through combination with other data sources and to ensure underlying data accessibility for broader reuse.

- Data accessibility and storage
  - Outputs are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, supporting accessibility and reuse by monitoring and policy analysts.

- Additional context
  - The document traces the development of the ITE Land Classification from its inception in the 1970s through the 2007 survey, highlighting how methodological choices were driven by the needs for time-series comparability, policy-relevant country reports, and refined upland/welsh data.
