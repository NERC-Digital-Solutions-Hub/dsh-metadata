# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Traces the evolution of the Countryside Survey field sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the linkage between stratified sampling, land classification, and national/country-specific habitat estimates.
- Highlights the impact of devolution (England, Scotland, Wales) on sampling design and reporting, plus an upland habitat module added in CS2000.

## The ITE Land Classification: a foundation for sampling
- Originated in the 1970s to stratify GB land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes.
- Used to ensure representative sampling across diverse landscapes by partitioning the population into strata.
- Class definitions (32 original classes, later expanded) underpin the selection of 1 km squares for field surveys.

## Sampling Framework across surveys

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis used to form 32 land classes from environmental data on 1 km squares (center of 15 x 15 km grid; 1228 squares classified; plus 4 surrounding squares per center).
  - Final sample: 256 field squares (8 per class) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - National estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in a class multiplied by class area.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Uses 1978 Land Classification for national estimates; results published on landscape changes.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square (incorporating urban/sea corrections).
  - Sample: 508 squares; plus repeat of 1978 quadrats; linkage to first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - National estimates based on 1990 classification; resulted in alignment with broader policy needs.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - Framework revised to support separate Scottish reporting; land classes increased to 40.
  - Addressed representation issues revealed by the updated classification.
  - National reporting began to accommodate country-specific estimates with Scotland in mind.

- 2000 (CS2000; Fifth Field Survey)
  - Further adjustments to enable England and Wales reporting, and separate upland habitat estimates.
  - Classification subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales; Scotland), creating more strata (40) and additional squares (including 19 extra to ensure adequate representation of new classes).
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates; replaced to maintain consistency.

- 2007 (CS2007; Welsh and England updates)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted new country-unit subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increased Welsh sampling to at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England did not receive equivalent increases in all classes; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at 4 squares if needed.
  - Overall Wales sampling intensified to support Wales-only estimates; England sampling adjusted accordingly.
  - Revised England/Wales/Scotland class maps and sample square distributions released.

## Country-specific reporting and upland module
- Separate country estimates implemented to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-only results, aligning with devolved policy needs.
- Wales-specific sampling expanded for robust Wales-only habitat reporting.
- An upland habitat module (30 additional squares) added to CS2000 to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

## Data outputs and interpretation
- CS surveys produce habitat area estimates by Land Class, with national, England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific reporting as data products.
- Tables and maps illustrate the distribution of sample squares across classes and countries.
- Note on national estimates: Changing the Land Classification across surveys affects consistency; two approaches exist:
  - Use the latest classification for within-survey consistency.
  - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey consistency.
- Documentation emphasizes provenance, class definitions, and the relationship between class areas and sample-based estimates.

## Governance implications for data stewards
- Versioning and provenance: Each CS cycle (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) used evolving Land Classifications; maintain clear version histories and mappings between classifications.
- Longitudinal comparability: When classifications change, provide crosswalks or notes to ensure users understand shifts in class definitions and their impact on time-series estimates.
- Country-unit reporting: Track and manage country-specific class subdivisions (e.g., Welsh and English variants) to support accurate England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only analyses.
- Upland module and supplementary data: Include metadata on added modules (upland survey) and their integration with core habitat estimates.
- Data quality and coverage: Monitor representativeness per class and per country, noting any classes with limited squares and the implications for precision.

## Challenges and considerations
- Representational balance: Ensuring adequate sample representation across an increasing number of Land Classes, especially after country-unit subdivisions.
- Data continuity: Managing shifts in land classification that affect cross-survey comparability and national estimates.
- Devolution-driven changes: accommodating Wales and Scotland reporting needs without compromising the integrity of England-wide estimates.
