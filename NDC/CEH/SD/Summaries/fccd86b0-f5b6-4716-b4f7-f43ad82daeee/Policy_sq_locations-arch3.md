# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- It ONLY covers survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Purpose and Scope
- Addresses confidentiality of CS square locations to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Ensures future scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission for ongoing surveys.
- Outline applies to location data; other CS data remain publicly available.

## Confidentiality Rationale
- Location confidentiality supports representativeness, landowner cooperation, and long-term survey viability.
- Public-interest justification; requests managed by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and Release Levels
- Approximate locations may be released to show whether squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references under licence.
- Six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; very exceptional circumstances may permit external provision under licence if IP protections are equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are released only under the same exceptional terms.

## Conditions of Release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals for the agreed purpose and period.
- Licences are finite; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of data.
- Data must not be released to third parties or used to locate specific CS squares or monitor landowners.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; there is also a clause prohibiting attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Roles and Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions according to policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; signatures from authorized representatives required.
- If access is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and rationale.
- CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with CEH prior to using data covered by this policy; CEH may participate or be consulted as scientifically appropriate, with possible payment or collaboration arrangements negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Data governance: clear controls on confidentiality, licensing, and purpose-limited use of location data.
- Data access management: structured licensing, time-bound access, and post-project data destruction.
- Balancing transparency and protection: public-interest sharing of data versus safeguarding sampling integrity and landowner cooperation.
- Compliance and accountability: formal procedures, annual reporting, and oversight by CEH/NERC.
- Inter-organisational coordination: defined responsibilities among CS partners and CEH to manage exceptional releases and pre-processing support.
