# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Field equipment for collecting and transporting soil core samples from X-plots across squares; data generated supports GIS-based mapping and provenance tracking.
- Primary items:
  - Electric Cold Box (kept cool; charged while vehicle is driven; connected to vehicle lighter socket)
  - Electrical mains charger for accommodation
  - 2 knives
  - 2 plastic plates
  - Hammer
  - 2 pairs of pliers
  - Mallet
  - Regular trowel
  - Notebook & pen
  - Long thin trowel
  - Parcel tape
  - Spare cores
  - 1 pack per square containing:
    - X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags
    - Stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Location and core types:
  - Cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square
  - Four core types (C, F, N, P) with specific dimensions and positions relative to the black core
- General sampling guidance:
  - If problems or comments arise, note in the envelope (e.g., vegetation, roots, boulders)
  - If vegetation or obstacles exist, move minimum distance to achieve a homogeneous location; record the issue
  - Ensure correct core is used in the designated position; clear surface vegetation
  - Core collection steps include inserting the pipe upright, cutting the bottom edge, hammering to level with soil surface, extracting without losing soil, and sealing ends with caps
  - Avoid loss of soil from ends, especially in dry/sandy soils
  - Record any issues, and preserve soil on exterior of the pipe; maintain correct orientation for specific core types
- Core types and locations:
  - Core C: BLACK, 15 cm long × 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of centre quadrat (15 cm south of black core used as a distance reference)
  - Core F: SHORT WHITE, 8 cm × 4 cm; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact
  - Core N: LONG WHITE, 15 cm × 4 cm; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner of the centre quadrat)
  - Core P: LONG GREY, 15 cm × 4 cm; located 15 cm west of the black core; core must be oriented correctly (bevelled end on soil surface)
- Composite soil sample (SQID) for each square:
  - 8–10 sub-samples taken with long thin trowel along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat, depth ~15 cm
  - Place sub-samples into a single labelled bag; fill to the top white panel
  - If under-filled, take additional sub-samples until the bag is full
  - If vegetation, cow pats, or boulders impede sampling, adjust location and record
  - After collecting 8–10 sub-samples, seal and place the composite bag into its own bag (as required)

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Storage at the vehicle:
  - Core C (BLACK): store in its own bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, store together in a spare plastic bag; keep in a cardboard box in the vehicle (cool, away from direct sunlight) until returned to regional coordinator
  - Core F (SHORT WHITE): place in its bag, then in a larger plastic bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP
  - Core P (GREY): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the CEH Lancaster mailbag, seal, and post ASAP
  - Core N (WHITE): place in its bag with other long grey cores; store in the cool box; after all 5 samples, place in the CEH Bangor mailbag, seal, and post ASAP
- General “Soil Sample Bag” handling:
  - Place this sample in the cool box immediately; then mail to CEH Lancaster as soon as possible
- Posting guidelines:
  - Post samples as soon as possible
  - If last post on Thursday cannot be met, place samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday
  - Do not post on Friday
  - If local post boxes cannot accept the parcels, use a convenient Post Office
  - Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices to locate appropriate posting options

- Data and GIS relevance:
  - The protocol provides precise spatial references (relative distances from the centre quadrat and directions) for geo-referencing cores
  - Distinct core codes (C, F, N, P) and associated metadata enable consistent map-based labeling and provenance tracking across 120 squares
  - Sample storage and dispatch steps ensure sample integrity and traceability for linkage with geospatial datasets and lab results
