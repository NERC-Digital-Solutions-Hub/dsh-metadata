# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Purpose: Support standardized soil core sampling across X-plots with attention to sample integrity, traceability, and timely submission.

## A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Core locations: Approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot; five sampling locations per square.
- Problem handling: If sampling issues arise or special observations are needed (e.g., large roots, cow pat, boulder), note in the envelope and adjust location for a homogeneous sample.
- General approach: Move as needed to avoid unusual vegetation or obstructions; record any deviations.

## Taking the cores

- For each core, use the correctly labeled bag for the X-plot and collect the four cores at their specified positions.
- Pre-sampling prep: Clear vegetation and surface debris.
- Core extraction: Insert the pipe upright, cut the bottom edge as needed, push into soil, and level with the surface using a grey plastic plate; avoid losing soil at either end.
- Core integrity: If the pipe breaks or distorts, substitute with a spare pipe; carefully extract to preserve soil at both ends.
- Debris removal: Scrape soil from the exterior of the pipe; trim bottom if needed.
- Core orientation: Ensure correct orientation for each core (C Black, F Short White, N White, P Grey) and seal ends with caps.
- Core IDs and positions:
  - Core C: Black, 15 cm long x 5 cm diameter; located 15 cm south of the centre-quadrat corner.
  - Core F: Short White, 8 cm long x 4 cm diameter; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact.
  - Core N: White, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm south of the black core.
  - Core P: Grey, 15 cm long x 4 cm diameter; 15 cm west of the black core; ensure correct upright orientation.
- Composite soil sample: 120 squares only; 8–10 sub-samples collected along the boundary of the 5 m quadrat to 15 cm depth, combined into one bag; fill to the top white panel; seal and bag appropriately.
- Problem documentation: If issues occur or notes are required (e.g., vegetation, cow pat), record in the envelope.

## A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- Core C (Black): Store in its bag; once all black cores for a square are collected, keep together in a spare bag; place in a cardboard box in the vehicle; keep cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to the regional coordinator.
- Core F (White) and Core P (Grey): Place in their respective bags, combine with other similar cores from the square, store in the cool box; after all five samples are collected, pack in a mailbag labeled for CEH Lancaster; seal and post ASAP.
- Core N (White): Place with other long grey cores from the square in the cool box; after five samples, mail in the CEH Bangor mailbag; seal and post ASAP.
- Soil Sample Bag: Place in the cool box immediately; post as soon as possible in the CEH Lancaster mailbag.
- Posting instructions: Post samples as soon as possible. If posting cannot occur by the last post on Thursday, place the samples in the cool box over the weekend and post on Monday. Do not post on Friday. If local post boxes don’t accept these packages, use a convenient Post Office. Refer to OS map data or Road Atlas to locate Post Offices.
