# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data remains publicly accessible.
- CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environment, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square a CS square falls in.
- Six-digit grid references: only on very exceptional grounds; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations; otherwise, external release requires demonstrating equal or higher confidentiality protection for related IP.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality risks and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

## Licence conditions for release
- Confidentiality must be preserved; data stored securely and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are time-bound for specific projects; data must not be retained for unrelated responsibilities.
- End of licence: written confirmation data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No release to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or monitor individual landowners.
- If requested, licensees must show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality thresholds.
- License terms prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations or to claim such derivations.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using these principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences (four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) signed by a senior authorised official.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and justifications.
- Internal pre-processing support from CEH is available within reasonable demand; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as part of collaboration or for payment, negotiated case-by-case.
