# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and aim
  - Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
  - Goal: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
  - Public-interest justification; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When and how locations may be released (precision levels)
  - Access allows identification of survey squares within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate locations.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; exceptional external release may be approved if IP/confidentiality protections are demonstrated to be equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could enable square identification and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licences must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite in duration and data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
  - After licensing period, licencees must confirm data destruction in writing.
  - No release to third parties that could compromise square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; users must not attempt to derive precise locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using defined principles.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; licences require senior-level sign-off from the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH supports decision under relevant Act/Regulations.
  - CEH provides an annual report detailing applications for access and the justification for decisions.
  - CEH should provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand to CS partners; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.
