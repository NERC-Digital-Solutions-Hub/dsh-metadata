# A1.1.1. Equipment

- Electric Cold Box to keep samples cool; charged while vehicle is driven; mains charger for accommodation.
- General field tools: 2 knives, 2 plastic plates, hammer, 2 pairs of pliers, mallet, regular trowel, long thin trowel, notebook & pen, parcel tape.
- Spare cores and packing: spare cores, 1 pack per square containing X-plot packs with cores, end caps & labelled bags, stamped & addressed mailbags for 5 X-plots.

# A1.1.2. Soil core samples

- Sampling location: cores taken approximately 15 cm south of the south corner of the centre quadrat in each X-plot of every square.
- Record-keeping: if problems or comments arise, note in the envelope; if unusual vegetation or obstacles, move minimum distance and record.
- Core collection workflow: for each core, use the labelled bag, clear vegetation, insert pipe upright, cut bottom edge, push into soil, place grey plate and hammer to level with surface, ensure sufficient depth, replace broken pipes with spares, extract carefully to avoid soil loss, clean exterior, trim bottom if needed, ensure correct core orientation, repeat for all required cores.
- Core types and positions:
  - Core C: Black, 15 cm long x 5 cm Ø; located 15 cm south of the centre-quadrat corner.
  - Core F: Short White, 8 cm long x 4 cm Ø; located 15 cm east of the black core; leave litter layer intact; caps placed on ends.
  - Core N: Long White, 15 cm long x 4 cm Ø; located 15 cm south of the black core (30 cm from the south corner).
  - Core P: Long Grey, 15 cm long x 4 cm Ø; located 15 cm west of the black core; oriented with bevelled end on the soil surface.
- Composite sampling: 120 squares total; 1 composite soil sample per X-plot filled to the top of the top white panel with 8–10 sub-samples collected along the 5 m quadrat boundary to 15 cm depth with the long thin trowel.
- Sub-sampling details: move vegetation as needed, insert trowel to form a square, harvest 8–10 sub-samples per quadrat side, combine into a single bag, ensure bag reaches top white panel, seal in double bag if needed.
- Quality notes: record any sampling problems or deviations in the envelope.

# A1.1.4. Soil sample storage and dispatch

- General storage: take all 4 cores back to the vehicle; store according to core type.
- Core C (Black): store in its bag; when all black cores for a square are collected, group in a spare plastic bag; store in a cardboard box in the vehicle, cool and out of direct sunlight until returned to regional co-ordinator.
- Core F (White): place in its bag with other short white cores from the square; store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal, and post ASAP.
- Core P (Grey): place in its bag with other long grey cores, store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal, and post ASAP.
- Core N (White): place in its bag with other long white/grey cores, store in the cool box immediately; after all 5 samples are collected, place in the mailbag labelled for CEH Bangor, seal, and post ASAP.
- Soil Sample Bag: place in the cool box immediately; as soon as possible place in mailbag labelled for CEH Lancaster, seal, and post.
- Posting timing: post samples as soon as possible. If last post Thursday is missed, keep in the cool box over the weekend and post Monday. Do not post on Friday. If local post boxes are unsuitable, use a convenient Post Office. Check OS map data or Road Atlas for Post Offices.
