# Plant pollinator interactions for potential networks 2018

- Overview
  - A dataset of pairwise plant-pollinator interactions for bees, hoverflies, and butterflies, intended to support construction and analysis of potential plant-pollinator networks when combined with species occurrence data.
- Data scope
  - 16,712 unique interactions
  - 499 plant species and 485 pollinator species (206 bees, 56 butterflies, 223 hoverflies)
  - Collected from 1985–2015 across Great Britain
  - Mostly derived from biological recording data (about 73%), with some unpublished experimental data and published interactions
- Collection methods
  - Sources: Bees, Wasps and Ants Recording Society (BWARS), Butterflies for the Millennium (BNM), Hoverfly Recording Scheme (HRS)
  - Interactions recorded as incidental metadata with occurrence records
  - Interactions identified by algorithmic text matching of pollinator records to valid plant names or synonyms, followed by data cleaning
  - Exclusion criteria applied to ensure ecological relevance (only plants with flowers visited by insects and with potential for pollen transfer)
  - Some genus-level matches used when species-level identification was not available; 79 genera treated as interacting across all recorded species within those genera; approximately 7% of interactions come from genus-level assumptions
- Quality control and limitations
  - Manual checks by experts (CEH and BWARS) for key indicators of flower visitation (e.g., “nectaring”, “feeding at”)
  - Acknowledgement that some records may be spurious without exhaustive manual verification
  - Not a complete GB record of plant–pollinator interactions; coverage gaps exist for species and links (e.g., ~76% bee, ~95% butterfly, ~83% hoverfly, ~55% insect-pollinated plant species represented)
  - Interactions reflect flower visitation rather than confirmed pollination and assume consistency across space where co-occurring
  - Where possible, datasets should be supplemented/validated with observational or molecular data
- Data structure
  - File: plant_pollinator_interactions_for_potential_networks_2018.csv
  - Columns:
    - POLLINATOR_NAME: Scientific name of pollinator
    - Description: Nomenclature used (as per BWARS/HRS/UKBMS)
    - PLANT_NAME: Scientific name of plant
    - Description: Nomenclature as in PLANTATT
    - Group: Pollinator group (Bees, Hoverflies, or Butterflies)
- Practical use for monitoring frameworks
  - Enables creation of large numbers of replicate networks to study patterns of network structure under consistent limitations
  - Facilitates integration with species occurrence data to evaluate network properties and policy-relevant metrics
  - Highlights data governance considerations: provenance, metadata quality, openness of underlying data, and the impact of data gaps on decision-making
