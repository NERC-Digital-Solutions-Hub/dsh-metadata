# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A multi-agency code governing high-quality, fit-for-purpose research funded by UK government bodies.
- Emphasises quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS), with a focus on rigorous, auditable practices from planning through to dissemination.
- Applies to all types of research funded by the listed bodies and is intended to ensure responsible governance, competence, and continuous improvement.

## Relevance to Data Stewards

- Supports data governance by privileging documented procedures, audit trails, data provenance, and version control.
- Encourages clear roles, responsibilities, and competence to ensure datasets are produced, managed, and shared with integrity.
- Highlights the need for metadata, data handling, storage, retention, and traceability of data from collection through to publication and reuse.
- Underlines that datasets should be fit-for-purpose, with appropriate documentation and quality assurance activities enabling discovery, reuse, and updating.

## Key Provisions

### 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor is responsible for overall research quality, including adherence to in-house policies.
- Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Project Leader (PI) is responsible for all project work, including that of subcontractors; clear, documented roles are required.

### 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to protect data and results quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of capability and maintain training records.

### 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessment and develop a clear, written project plan addressing research design, methods, and objectives.
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body; ethical approvals or licences considered where relevant.
- Regular reviews of timetables and plans; significant amendments require pre-approval.

### 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs require funding-body approval; errors post-publication must be reported and corrective action taken.
- Embrace continual improvement through regular process reviews.

### 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with applicable health and safety laws and standards.

### 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label, track, and retain samples/materials with clear storage conditions and disposal routes.
- Storage conditions must be monitored and recorded; traceability through analysis and use is required.

### 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

### 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented with clear audit trails, versioning, and traceability to primary data.
- Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose and traceable modifications.

### 9. Research / work records
- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader ensure validity.
- Location and integrity of records must be defined and retained securely for an agreed period.

### 10. Field-based research
- Fieldwork complies with environmental legislation; emissions and discharges managed to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based activities.

## Annex – Examples of Documentary Evidence

- Responsibilities: organisation structure, personnel lists, subcontractor agreements, clearly defined roles.
- Personnel competence: CVs, training records, awareness of JCoPR obligations.
- Project planning: risk assessments, updated plans, milestones, statistical validation, ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal audits, corrective actions, publication policy and authorisation procedures.
- Health & safety: training records and compliance documentation (e.g., H&S plans).
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, storage logs, handling procedures.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: consistent storage (hard copy/electronic), archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments and mitigations.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards

- Ensure datasets are accompanied by robust metadata, provenance, and version histories aligned with the Code’s emphasis on auditability.
- Prioritize documentation that links raw data to processing steps, analytical methods, and decision points to support reproducibility.
- Maintain clear data governance practices, including data retention timelines, storage conditions, and access controls in line with project plans and ethical approvals.
- Support ongoing data quality through planned checks, validation records, and evidence of continual improvement.
- Facilitate compliance demonstrations through organized records, auditable processes, and ready-to-audit documentary evidence as outlined in the Annex.
