# HEADWATER STREAM SECTION ONLY

## Overview
- AXIS II project builds on UK Countryside Surveys (CS1990, CS1998/CS2007) to assess headwater streams and ponds using compatible methods with minor updates.
- For headwater streams, re-surveyed elements per square: water chemistry, diatom community, macroinvertebrate community, hydromorphological/physical characteristics (River Habitat Survey Amended), and for ponds: water chemistry, macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, and pond environmental attributes.
- Purpose: provide standardized, repeatable data across squares to monitor ecological condition and support data sharing across networks.

## Sampling design and site layout
- Sampling in each square: 500 m headwater stream reach for RHS-related surveys; a 100 m aquatic plant survey within that reach.
- In squares containing ponds, randomly selected pond surveyed for specified elements.
- Photo documentation and marker boards used to aid relocation and interpretation of sampling areas (macroinvertebrates, diatoms, MTR plants).
- Site selection aims to maximize RHS survey length within the square and the catchment portion inside the square.

## Data collection components

### Water chemistry (Headwater streams)
- Indicative chemistry sample collected at downstream end of macroinvertebrate area; analyzed for alkalinity, conductivity, pH, SRP, TON.
- Field measurements: pH and conductivity with a Hanna Combi meter; ensure calibration and proper rinsing between sites.
- On-site filtration for SRP and TON using 0.45 µm filters; label and process samples promptly.
- Samples stored in padded pre-addressed envelopes; lab results due within ~2 weeks after receipt.

### Diatom sampling (Headwater streams)
- Follow DARES method; sampling centered on RHS mid-point (spot-check 6), with substratum selection (cobbles preferred; alternatives from Fig. 4).
- Substrata options: cobbles/small boulders, emergent macrophytes, submerged macrophytes; if none, record inability to sample.
- Sample fixation: Lugol’s iodine in the field or lab; label containers with square, site, date, sampler, and preservative.
- Environmental data collected alongside diatoms; samples kept cool and dark until processing.

### Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
- Uses standard UK kick sampling within a 10–15 m stream reach; four minutes total sampling time (three minutes pond-net sample plus one minute manual search).
- Equipment: pond-net (900 µm), sample bags/pots, waders, life jacket; avoid sampling fish or rare taxa; record notable species and relocate cues.
- Sampling across habitats in proportion to their area; continuous time-based bursts recommended; avoid deep, inaccessible, or unsafe areas.
- Sample fixing: use 40% formalin to achieve ~4% formaldehyde; label containers with square, date, and sample type; transport in labeled containers and store properly.
- Environmental data collected for the sample area (width, depth, velocity, substratum, bed features, shading, etc.) using the RIVPACS form.

### Environmental data and habitat data
- Environmental measurements taken along the macroinvertebrate sample area (width, depth, surface velocity, substratum composition, bed features).
- Substratum estimated in four size classes; percentages must sum to 100%.
- Record additional habitat features (bedrock, filamentous algae, moss, higher plants) and site context (street lighting within 20 m).
- Sketch map of the 50 m sampling reach and a photo documenting site features for relocation.

### Aquatic plant surveys (Mean Trophic Rank - MTR)
- 100 m reach surveyed for macrophytes and bryophytes; species presence and cover recorded on a 9-point scale.
- Sampling centered on macroinvertebrate site; includes emergent and submerged species; grapnel used to retrieve channel species when appropriate.
- Biomass of dominant submerged species weighed (three samples) after field processing; wet-weight biomass measured with field equipment.
- Plant samples identified to species where possible; maintained as reference specimens for lab confirmation if necessary.
- Photographs of plants and site features captured to aid identification and relocation.

## Data capture and management systems

### River Habitat Survey (RHS) and RAPID
- RHS data collected in the field using the RAPID digital data entry system.
- Section G (channel vegetation), Section K (extent of channel features), and Section L (channel dimensions) include AXIS II-specific fields (e.g., weir/dam location, fence length, slope measurements, side/bar features).
- Spot-check data require GPS coordinates (spot-checks 1, 6, 10) and data validation through a “Check Data” function; incomplete entries prompt iterative correction until complete.

### Dares/Diatom and Macroinvertebrate data entry
- Diatom sampling and macroinvertebrate sampling data entered through electronic forms on site (DARES for diatoms; RIVPACS forms for macroinvertebrates), ensuring linkage to the respective square and sampling point.
- On-site data capture supports rapid integration with laboratory workflows once samples are returned.

### Aquatic plants data entry (IRIS)
- Aquatic plant surveys entered in IRIS; Page 1 records plant species and percent cover; Page 2 logs physical site attributes (channel width, depth, slope, shading, biomass, etc.).
- Species listed by major groups; indeterminate specimens supported with lab confirmation and specimen labeling per IRIS guidance.

## Sample handling, transport, and storage
- Explicit labeling of all samples with square, site, date, sampler, and preservatives.
- Clear instructions for transport: macroinvertebrate pots stored in labeled boxes; diatom samples kept at CEH Bangor; aquatic plant specimens sent to CEH Wallingford; plant lab confirmations as needed.
- Transport Emergency Card (TREM) included for formaldehyde-containing samples; highlights hazards and emergency actions.

## Quality control and data integrity
- At-site validation using RAPID/IRIS checks; errors reported one at a time to enable correction before proceeding.
- If RHS plant or diatom sampling cannot be completed, square still logged with date, sampler, and notes; essential to complete environmental data for the site.
- Standardized terminology and scales (e.g., DAFLOR for RHS vegetation, 9-point cover scales for MTR) to ensure consistency across surveys.

## Safety and governance
- Safety considerations addressed for sampling in potentially hazardous watercourses; use of life jackets, PPE, and risk assessment prior to sampling.
- Handling and storage of hazardous preservatives (formalin, Lugol’s iodine) and adherence to COSHH and lab safety guidelines.
- Clear responsibilities and roles within survey teams (A/B designations for freshwater surveyors; task sequencing to ensure proper order of sampling).

## References and revisions
- Document references to Environment Agency manuals, CS/AXIS guidelines, and updates to methodologies (e.g., DAFOR to DAFLOR, updated RHS sections, and new data entry workflows).
- Acknowledges crosswalks to previous CS manuals and the AXIS II amendments for streamlined data collection and analysis.
