# Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme FIELD HANDBOOK Freshwater, Version 2013.02

- Purpose and scope
  - Welsh Government AES-funded monitoring programme (Glastir) to evaluate effectiveness of management interventions on climate change, biodiversity, soil and water quality, and woodland expansion.
  - Aims to quantify status and trends in the environment and to identify drivers of change (land use, climate, pollution) beyond Glastir interventions.
  - Outputs inform policy decisions, monitor progress, and support future strategies; synthesis seeks to attribute environmental changes to multiple drivers.

- Survey design and sampling framework
  - 4-year rolling survey cycle (2013–2016 first cycle) to maximize spatial coverage and detect temporal trends cost-effectively.
  - Two components:
    - Wider Wales Component: baseline estimation and national trends for Glastir.
    - Targeted Component: links to Glastir priority areas and aims.
  - Common spatial unit: 1 km2 grid across Wales; integration across metrics.
  - Sampling strategy: 300 randomly selected 1 km squares plus targeted Glastir priority areas.
  - Stratification and exclusion criteria:
    - Stratified sampling within Land Classification of Great Britain (Bunce et al. 2007) to minimize within-stratum heterogeneity and maximize between-strata diversity.
    - Randomly sampled squares proportioned to stratum size; exclusion of squares with >75% urban land or >90% sea.
  - Harmonisation with Countryside Survey GB for potential future data integration.

- Field data collection and sample analysis
  - Field methods: standardized collection for up to 300 1 km squares; detailed procedures in Field Handbook (O’Hare et al., 2013).
  - Diatoms (GMEP_STREAM_DIATOMS_2013_16.csv; GMEP_STREAM_DARES_2013_16.csv)
    - Diatom counts from water samples; identification to species level with high-resolution microscopy.
    - Data presented as percentage of sample; quality control via external consultant (Bowburn Consultancy).
  - Invertebrates (GMEP_STREAM_INVERTS_2013_16.csv; GMEP_STREAM_SITE_INFO_INVERTS_2013_16.csv)
    - Sorting and identification to species where possible; abundance data collected for diagnostic indices.
    - QA includes re-analysis of a subset by a second analyst.
  - Water chemistry (GMEP_STREAM_WATER_CHEMISTRY_2013_16.csv)
    - Parameters: phosphate (PO4-P), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), alkalinity; field measurements for conductivity and pH.
    - Laboratories (UKCEH Lancaster) use accredited methods; standard QA and reporting.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS) data (GMEP_STREAM_RHS_MAIN_2013_16.csv; GMEP_STREAM_RHS_SPOTCHECK_2013_16.csv; GMEP_STREAM_RHS_BANK_2013_16.csv)
    - RHS sections A–Q, spot checks (E, F, G) and bank/field attributes (H and I sweeps).
    - Includes site-level descriptors, habitat features (riffles, pools, vegetation, bank top/face, substrate, etc.), and indicators of habitat impact.
  - Macrophytes (GMEP_STREAM_MACROPHYTES_MTR_2013.csv)
    - Macrophyte species and Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) data for streams (2013 only).
  - Spot-check nuisance species and RHS-themed notes (GMEP_STREAM_RHS_SPOTCHECK_2013_16.csv)
    - Notable nuisance plants and overall RHS impact narratives (e.g., Hogweed, Himalayan balsam, Japanese knotweed).
  - Data management and quality assurance
    - DEFRA Joint Codes of Practice (JCoPR) followed to ensure data quality and robust scientific processes.
    - UKAS accreditation for UKCEH laboratories; metadata and data provenance emphasized.

- Data products, metadata, and data sharing
  - Extensive tabular data describing sampling locations, measurements, and habitat attributes (multiple CSV tables with fields for site IDs, coordinates, LC land classification, year, measurements, and metadata descriptors).
  - Emphasis on clear metadata, traceable measurement units, and standardized nomenclature to enable cross-site comparability and future integration with GB datasets.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is encouraged to support transparency, but may be restricted by governance or data-sharing considerations.

- Governance, data management, and data quality
  - Governance processes implemented to ensure data quality, sharing, and updates (data management standards at source; clear QA procedures).
  - Metadata adequacy identified as a potential barrier in some contexts; effort required to verify data suitability for reuse.
  - Data flow includes synthesis, integration across metrics, and dissemination to stakeholders with clear reporting formats (reports, charts, dashboards).

- Outputs, dissemination, and stakeholder engagement
  - Outputs designed to be integrated into reports and dashboards to illustrate Baseline, trends, and Glastir-specific outcomes.
  - Stakeholder consultation and dissemination activities embedded to ensure outputs are usable for policy decisions and future monitoring planning.
  - Data governance ensures underlying data can be shared appropriately to support transparency and external analysis.

- Challenges and considerations for monitoring-framework authors
  - Data gaps and data quality issues (data availability at adequate standards; timely access).
  - Organizational silos hindering data sharing within and between bodies.
  - Barriers to using existing data when datasets must be publicly shared.
  - Keeping data up to date and maintaining adequate metadata for reuse.
  - Data transformation and integration challenges across multiple metrics and scales.
  - Establishing and enforcing data governance to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and updated appropriately.

- References and further reading
  - Key methodological and governance references (Bunce et al. 2007; Field Handbook 2013; DEFRA/JCoPR; CEH/UKAS practices; and related Glastir reporting materials).
  - Final and annual reports detailing the Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme’s development and findings (2014–2016 and later summaries).
