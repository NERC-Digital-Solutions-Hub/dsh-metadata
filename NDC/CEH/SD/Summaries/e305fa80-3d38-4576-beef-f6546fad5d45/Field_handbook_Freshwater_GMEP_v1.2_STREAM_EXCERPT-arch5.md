# HEADWATER STREAM SECTION ONLY

## Overview and Purpose
- AXIS II builds on UK Countryside Surveys to assess headwater streams and ponds using compatible methods (CS2007) with minor updates.
- Survey elements per square: headwater streams (water chemistry, diatom community, macroinvertebrate community, habitat, aquatic plant community); randomly selected ponds within squares (water chemistry, macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, physical attributes).
- Fieldwork is conducted on a standardized 500 m stream reach (and 100 m plant survey) to ensure consistent data across sites.

## Data Governance, Standards, and Metadata
- Uses standardized environmental assessment methods (RHS River Habitat Survey, DARES diatom sampling, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR aquatic plant survey).
- Data are captured and managed with electronic field systems: RAPID for RHS, IRIS for aquatic plants, RIVPACS forms for macroinvertebrates.
- Metadata requirements emphasized: square number, site name, date, sampler, NGR/GPS, reach length, sampling point locations, and environmental context.
- Clear labeling and traceability for samples and data entries to support downstream analysis and re-location of sites.

## Data Capture Methods and Electronic Systems
- Water chemistry, biological sampling, and habitat data are collected per square with a defined sampling sequence and site layout (RHS, DARES, RIVPACS, MTR).
- Field data entry:
  - RAPID for River Habitat Survey (RHS): spot-check data, GPS at specific checks, channel attributes, bank and vegetation features, slope, width, depth, substrate, and other hydromorphological details.
  - IRIS for aquatic plant survey (MTR): 100 m reach; presence/cover of macrophytes and bryophytes; biomass measurements; physical habitat data; specimen collection for lab confirmation.
  - RIVPACS electronic form for macroinvertebrates: 10–15 m reach; standardized kick/sweep sampling, manual searches, and habitat-proportional sampling; includes environmental variables and sample area mapping.
- Data validation: on-site validation with “Check Data” in RAPID/IRIS to identify and correct errors before submission; fields marked as missing produce prompts until completed.

## Sample Handling, Fixatives, Storage, and Transport
- Sample labeling: pre-labeled containers with square number, stream/pond name, date, sampler initials, and preservative name.
- Fixatives and preservatives:
  - Macroinvertebrates: 40% formalin in the sample bag to achieve ~4% formaldehyde equivalent.
  - Diatoms: Lugol’s iodine preservation; storage in airtight, cool, dark conditions; short-term storage required due to iodine sublimation risk.
- Transport and storage:
  - Samples moved in clearly labeled containers; hazardous materials protected (TREM card for road transport).
  - Macroinvertebrate samples stored at CEH Bangor until couriered to APEM Ltd; diatom samples stored at CEH Bangor until couriered to Bowburn Consultancy Ltd; aquatic plant samples couriered to CEH Wallingford.
- Field safety and sampling integrity:
  - Health and safety considerations summarized (waterway safety, weather, access, livestock, etc.).
  - Avoid sampling during spates; ensure sample area proportionality and habitat representation.
  - Photographs and marker boards to aid site relocation and future sampling.

## Data Quality Assurance and Validation
- On-site validation workflow in RAPID/IRIS ensures completeness and internal consistency per spot-check.
- Validation steps include addressing the nearest error first and re-checking until the dataset appears complete.
- For deviations (e.g., unable to sample a site), data are entered with notes explaining the reason.

## Data Access, Sharing, and Archiving
- Samples and data flow between field teams and CEH laboratories:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples: collected, labeled, fixed, stored, and couriered to APEM Ltd for processing.
  - Diatom samples: preserved and couriered from CEH Bangor to Bowburn Consultancy Ltd.
  - Aquatic plant specimens: sent to Pete Scarlett at CEH Wallingford for confirmation.
- Field data entered in RAPID, IRIS, and RIVPACS:
  - RHS data via RAPID; plant data via IRIS; macroinvertebrate data via RIVPACS.
- Data archiving and accessibility follow CEH/NERC protocols; results and datasets are managed to support re-location and long-term use.

## Roles, Workflows, and Practical Considerations
- Team roles: surveyors A and B with defined duties (sampling, recording, and data entry); tasks sequenced to ensure efficient data collection and accuracy.
- Workflow considerations include:
  - Locating sampling points using provided maps/grid references.
  - Conducting sampling in a sequence that minimizes disturbance and ensures data linkage across forms.
  - Capturing site environmental data in tandem with biological samples.
  - Documenting any deviations or safety issues and incorporating these into metadata notes.

## Particular Challenges for Data Stewards (as outlined in the document)
- Incomplete picture of user needs and priorities for data outputs.
- Timely ingestion of data from field teams and institutions.
- Ensuring data creators meet standards (metadata, formats, and consistency).
- Interoperability across multiple systems and formats; handling large datasets.
- Managing legacy or outdated databases requiring bespoke solutions.
- Ensuring ongoing updates and data sharing while respecting embargoes and data sensitivities.

## Endnotes and Compliance
- The document references and integrates established guidance (CS series, RHS, DARES, RIVPACS, MTR) and acknowledges updates (AXIS II amendments).
- Acknowledges copyright and licensing under NERC, with standard rights for internal research use and citation requirements.
- Safety and emergency procedures (TREM card) and contact information are provided for field transport scenarios.
