# River Habitat Survey - spot-check data

## Aim
- Capture RHS spot-check data (Sections E, F and G) to document river habitat characteristics and supply a standardized dataset for environmental monitoring and policy assessment.

## Context and purpose
- Part of the Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme (GMEP) in Wales, alongside broader AES monitoring.
- Aims to describe river habitat features and assist in assessing drivers of change beyond Glastir interventions, contributing to national-scale environmental status and trend indicators.

## Survey Design and Sampling
- 4-year rolling survey cycle (first cycle 2013–2016) to maximize site coverage while enabling year-on-year trend detection.
- Two components integrated across surveys:
  - Wider Wales component for baseline estimation, national trends and national reporting.
  - Targeted component linked to Glastir priority areas.
- Common sampling unit: 1 km grid squares (Spatial unit for integration with other surveys).
- Sample size: up to 300 x 1 km squares over the cycle.
- Sampling frame and stratification:
  - Randomly sampled squares within strata defined by the Land Classification of Great Britain to minimize environmental heterogeneity within strata and maximize differences between strata.
  - Half of squares targeted specifically at Glastir priority areas.
- Exclusion criteria:
  - Exclude squares with more than 75% urban land or more than 90% sea coverage.
- Data collection scope for RHS spot-checks:
  - Focused on Sections E, F and G of the River Habitat Survey (Environment Agency, 2003).

## Data Collection and Field Methods
- Data captured during 1 km square site visits using standardized field methods.
- Primary data types for RHS spot-checks:
  - Physical habitat attributes, bank and channel features, and related habitat descriptors.
  - Spot-check specific fields covering habitat components and site conditions.
- Field handbook cited for detailed methodologies and standardised data capture.

## Data Tables and Content (RHS Data within GMEP)
- GMEP_STREAM_RHS_MAIN_2013_16.csv
  - Contains RHS field data for main sections (A, B, C, D, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q) of the River Habitat Survey.
  - Includes site identifiers, spatial coordinates, Land Classification, and numerous habitat descriptors.
- GMEP_STREAM_RHS_SPOTCHECK_2013_16.csv
  - Contains RHS spot-check data for Sections E, F and G.
  - Includes 1 km square identifiers, spot-check numbering, habitat features, and related descriptors (e.g., bed, substrate, vegetation, and channel features).
- Additional RHS-related fields (for context):
  - Site details, bank characteristics, channel morphology, flow type, substrate, vegetation types, and various habitat measurements.
  - Data are structured to support integration with main RHS data and with broader GMEP outputs.

## Data Quality Assurance and Standards
- Followed DEFRA Joint Codes of Practice (JCoPR) for quality and transparency of scientific processes.
- UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) laboratories are UKAS accredited, ensuring accredited laboratory analysis for relevant measurements.
- Quality control practices include random re-analysis of a subset of samples and standardized identification/classification protocols.

## Data Access, Storage and Integration
- Collected data are stored in standardized datasets and uploaded to appropriate data portals to ensure accessibility and long-term preservation.
- Design aligned with the Countryside Survey of Great Britain methodology to enable potential future integration and comparability with GB-wide analyses.
- The 1 km square sampling framework facilitates national and sub-national indicators and trend analyses.

## Drivers, Outputs and Usage
- Aims to synthesize across drivers of change (land use, climate, pollution) to quantify status and trends in river habitat quality beyond Glastir interventions.
- Outputs intended for reporting on environmental health, informing policy performance, and enabling scrutiny over time.
