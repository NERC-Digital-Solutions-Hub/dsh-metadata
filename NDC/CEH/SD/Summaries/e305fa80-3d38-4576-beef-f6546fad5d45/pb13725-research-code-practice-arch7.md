# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- A framework to ensure high-quality research processes (QP) and high-quality science (QS) across organisations funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, the Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, and NERC.
- Applies to all types of research funded or conducted under these bodies; emphasizes fitness for purpose, competence, and diligent conduct.
- Encourages proactive governance, risk assessment, and, where possible, independent audits of research systems.

## Principles for GIS-focused work
- Emphasises both quality of the science (Aims, approaches, knowledge extraction) and quality of the process (rigor, reproducibility, auditability).
- Fitness for purpose is the overriding principle; researchers should be competent and adequately trained from the start.
- Compliance is driven from the top levels of funded organisations.

## Compliance and monitoring
- Contractors must indicate acceptance of the Code when applying for funding.
- Discussions about inappropriateness or non-applicability can be recorded; may lead to risk assessments and additional controls.
- Contractors are responsible for ensuring subcontractors comply.
- Monitoring may involve formal third-party audits against appropriate standards (e.g., UKAS audits in past programs).

## 1. Responsibilities
- The contractor organisation is responsible for overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers and supervisors must foster good scientific practice and skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is accountable for all project work, including subcontractors.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect result quality.
- Documented evidence of capability and safety compliance must be provided.
- Training records must show awareness of the Code’s provisions.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct an appropriate risk assessment to identify factors influencing success.
- Produce a clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, etc., and obtain agreement with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular progress reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.
- Ensure alignment with ethical approvals and licences where relevant.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require formal authorization and senior-level sign-off where appropriate.
- Notify Funding Body of post-publication errors and initiate corrective actions promptly.
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Label, track, and store samples/materials clearly and durably; retain for an agreed period.
- Storage conditions must be defined and monitored if critical.
- Clear disposal routes and dates must be established and tracked.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Work environment must support safe operation, sample integrity, and good practices.
- Equipment must be appropriate, calibrated, and maintained; contingency plans for critical equipment.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) should exist for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented, including analytical and statistical procedures.
- Maintain a clear audit trail with version control; link secondary processed information to primary data.
- Validate methods as fit-for-purpose; trace modifications through development.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must be thorough enough to allow replication.
- Project Leader should regularly review staff records to ensure validity.
- Locate and securely store all critical data and records; retention period agreed with the Funding Body.

## 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution risk.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field activities as applicable.

## Annex: Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart; current personnel lists; documented subcontractor adherence; roles/responsibilities.
- Personnel competence: CVs; up-to-date training records; awareness of Code requirements.
- Project planning: risk assessments; regular timetable reviews; approved project plan; statistical validation; documented sampling procedures; ethical approvals and licences.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews; internal audits and corrective actions; publication approval procedures.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documentation; site-specific safety measures.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking; procedures; storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records; facility maintenance; SOPs for critical equipment.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control; validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: counter-signed or indexed records; consistent archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field work.
