# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Origin and scope
  - Issued on behalf of multiple UK funding and regulatory bodies (e.g., Defra, FSA, NERC, BBSRC, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, devolved administrations).
  - Applies to all research funded by these bodies and to research conducted in their institutes; aims for fitness of purpose across all types of research.
  - Launched May 2003; effective 1 June 2004; subject to ongoing review and revision.

- Purpose and core aims
  - Establishes a framework for proper conduct of research.
  - Distinguishes quality of the research process (QP) from quality of the science (QS).
  - Promotes best scientific practice, with competency, rigor, repeatability, and auditability.
  - Emphasizes “fitness for purpose” as the overriding principle.

- Compliance and monitoring
  - Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when applying for funding; may undergo risk assessment and discussions on inapplicable clauses.
  - Contractors are responsible for project compliance and for ensuring subcontractors adhere to the Code.
  - Monitoring through formal systems and potential third-party audits (e.g., UKAS); annual acceptance by institute directors for some funders.
  - The Code can be audited or evidence requested to ensure standard compliance.

- Responsibilities and competence
  - Organisation-wide responsibility for research quality and policy compliance.
  - Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skills development.
  - Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including subcontractors; clear roles documented for all staff.

- Project planning
  - Require risk assessment and a written project plan addressing research design, statistical methods, and objective alignment.
  - Plans should be agreed with the Funding Body; consider ethical approvals and licences.
  - Schedule regular plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

- Quality control
  - Planned, formal “fit-for-purpose” reviews of projects.
  - Outputs require funding-body-approved authorization; post-publication errors must be reported with corrective actions.
  - Continuous improvement through regular process reviews.

- Health and Safety
  - All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

- Handling of samples and materials
  - Clear, durable labeling; agreed retention periods with the Funding Body.
  - Storage, handling, tracking, and disposal routes must be defined and monitored.

- Facilities and equipment
  - Environment suitable for safe operation, sample integrity, and good practice.
  - Regular maintenance and calibration; contingency plans for critical equipment; SOPs for key equipment.

- Documentation of procedures and methods
  - All procedures and methods documented with audit trails, version control, and traceability to primary data.
  - Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose; traceable modifications.

- Research/work records
  - Records must enable replication; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
  - Clear storage location and integrity/security; retention period defined by Funding Body.

- Field-based research
  - Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risk.
  - All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based activities.

- Annex: examples of documentary evidence
  - Evidence categories include: organisational structure, roles/responsibilities, sub-contractor agreements, competence records, project planning documentation, risk assessments, internal audits, publication policies, health and safety plans, sample handling procedures, equipment maintenance logs, SOPs, document/version control, and records archiving.

- Relevance for environmental analysts
  - Supports standardized, auditable data practices and rigorous project management for environmental monitoring.
  - Facilitates higher data quality, reproducibility, and transparency, enabling robust assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.
