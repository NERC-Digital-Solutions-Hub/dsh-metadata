# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A framework for the proper conduct of research funded by UK bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, NERC).
- Emphasises fitness for purpose, quality of research processes (QP) and quality of science (QS), and the need for best scientific practice from the outset.
- Applies to all types of research funded by the listed bodies; acceptance and compliance are required as part of funding terms.
- Periodically audited and reviewed, with potential third-party verification (e.g., UKAS) to ensure standards.

## Principles behind the Code

- Researchers and contractors must pursue both high-quality processes (QP) and high-quality science (QS).
- QP underpins confidence in methods, procedures, repeatability, and auditable practices.
- Commitment to best scientific practice from project start; leadership must drive compliance.
- Research should be diligent, with competence and adequate training as foundations.

## Compliance with the Code

- Funding bodies require explicit acceptance of the Code when proposals are submitted (where applicable).
- Contractors should discuss clauses they consider inappropriate or non-applicable; discussions and outcomes become part of funding terms.
- Contractors must ensure projects and subcontractors comply with JCoPR provisions.
- For BBSRC- and NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring of Compliance with the Code

- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure compliance, applied consistently.
- Where possible, organisations should have formal third-party audits against an appropriate standard.
- Funders may audit contractors’ research systems or require evidence of compliance.

## Specific Requirements of the Code

1. Responsibilities
   - The contractor organisation is responsible for overall research quality and compliance.
   - Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice; Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including subcontractors.
   - Clear, documented responsibilities for all staff.

2. Competence
   - All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training supervised to avoid compromising quality.
   - Documented evidence of capability and up-to-date training records.

3. Project Planning
   - Conduct risk assessment; develop a clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, ethical/licence considerations.
   - Regularly review plans and timetables; record and pre-approve significant amendments with the Funding Body.

4. Quality Control
   - Implement planned quality assurance processes; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews.
   - Outputs require senior-level authorization; communicate errors to the Funding Body and take corrective actions; pursue continual improvement.

5. Health and Safety
   - Compliance with relevant health and safety regulations.

6. Handling of Samples and Materials
   - Clear, durable labeling; retention period agreed with the Funding Body; storage conditions specified and monitored if critical.
   - Traceable sample tracking and defined disposal routes and dates.

7. Facilities and Equipment
   - Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance of facilities and critical equipment.
   - Calibrations and contingency plans; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

8. Documentation of Procedures and Methods
   - Document all procedures with audit trails and version control; validate methods as fit for purpose and trace changes.

9. Research / Work Records
   - Records must be detailed and retrievable to permit repetition; maintain data integrity and security; critical data location recorded; retention period agreed.

10. Field-Based Research
   - Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution risks; apply all JCoPR provisions to fieldwork.

## Annex – Examples of Documentary Evidence

- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists (including sub-contractors), documented sub-contractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- Personnel Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of Code provisions.
- Project Planning: risk assessments, updated project plans, milestone records, validated statistical procedures, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits, corrective actions, approved publication policies.
- Health & Safety: training/compliance documentation, safety plans for hazardous work.
- Handling of Samples & Materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs for critical equipment, contingency procedures.
- Documentation of Procedures & Methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/Work Records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed digital files, consistent archiving.
- Field-Based Research: documented risk assessments for fieldwork.

## Relevance for Data Leaders

- Emphasises data quality (QP) and data integrity (QS) through rigorous processes, governance, and audit readiness.
- Highlights the need for comprehensive documentation, audit trails, version control, and method validation—core to reliable data products.
- Requires competent, trained staff and clear roles, supporting accountable data stewardship across teams and possibly subcontractors.
- Stresses project planning, risk assessment, and regular progress reviews—critical for managing data strategies and ensuring timely, policy-relevant outputs.
- Underlines data and sample handling, labeling, tracking, storage, retention, and disposal—key for data lineage, provenance, and long-term accessibility.
- Encourages continual improvement and formal validation of methods, aligning with mature data governance and quality assurance practices.
- Calls for governance across partnerships and networks, including sub-contractors, to ensure consistent data standards and metadata practices.
