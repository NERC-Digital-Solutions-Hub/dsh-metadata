# HEADWATER STREAM SECTION ONLY

## Aim and scope
- AXIS II builds on UK Countryside Surveys (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) to assess the biological condition of headwater streams and ponds.
- Survey methods are designed to be compatible with the CS2007 framework, with minor updates explained in Appendix 1.
- In headwater streams, re-surveyed elements per square: water chemistry; diatom community; macroinvertebrate community; aquatic plant community; hydromorphological/physical characteristics (River Habitat Survey Amended).
- In ponds within squares: water chemistry; macroinvertebrate community; aquatic plant community; physical characteristics (pond environmental attributes).
- Sampling units: 500 m headwater stream reach per square (RHS area), with a 100 m aquatic plant survey span centered on macroinvertebrate/water chemistry sampling; randomly selected ponds sampled within pond-containing squares.

## Key indicators and components
- Water chemistry (headwater streams): indicative sample for alkalinity, conductivity, pH, SRP, TON.
- Diatoms: sampled via DARES method; addressed to represent site diatom communities.
- Macroinvertebrates: surveyed using the standard RIVPACS method; 10–15 m reach with a standardized four-minute active sampling and a main kick/sweep effort.
- Habitat/physical characteristics: River Habitat Survey methods with minor AXIS II modifications.
- Aquatic plants: surveyed using Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) methodology; 100 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling location.
- Data capture: output is recorded electronically (RIVPACS forms for macroinvertebrates; RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants).

## Methods and indicators in detail

- Water chemistry
  - Indicative 1 L water sample for conductivity and pH; a separate filtered sample for alkalinity, SRP, and TON.
  - On-site filtration using 0.45 μm syringe filters; documentation and labeling on a dedicated Water Sample Information Sheet.
  - Samples stored in cool conditions; laboratories (CEH Lancaster) analyse results with a 2-week turnaround.

- Diatom sampling (headwater streams)
  - Location centered on RHS spot-check 6; sampling depth accessible with thigh waders.
  - Substrata options: cobbles preferred; alternatives include algae-covered cobbles, emergent or submerged macrophytes.
  - Sampling methods A–D depending on substratum; method selection based on substrate availability and algal presence.
  - Post-collection handling: preserve diatoms with Lugol’s iodine; store in cool, dark conditions; retain as reference specimens when necessary.

- Macroinvertebrate sampling
  - Location similar to diatom sampling but spans a longer reach (10–15 m) to capture habitat diversity.
  - Equipment: pond-net (900 μm), sample pots, waders, life jacket.
  - Four-minute active sampling: roughly nine to twelve bursts; main kick/sweep sample proportionate to habitat area.
  - Sampling approaches (A, B, C) based on site characteristics (shallow/wadeable, deeper, or main channel impossible to sample).
  - Manual searching before/after main sampling to capture surface and attached fauna.
  - Specimens preserved in 4% formaldehyde (final liquor ~4%) in labeled pots; transport with appropriate labeling and TREM card if road transport is involved.
  - Environmental data collected in conjunction with macroinvertebrate sampling using the RIVPACS form (width, depth, surface velocity, substratum, channel features, shading, water clarity, etc.).
  - Photos required: macroinvertebrate sampling area and RHS site features; site boards and markers used to aid relocation.

- River Habitat Survey (RHS)
  - The RHS survey covers a 500 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site; data captured electronically via RAPID.
  - AXIS II modifications introduce: location of significant weirs/dams, weir height, DAFLOR (modified DAFOR) for channel vegetation, side/point bars, bank and channel modifications, fencing length, channel slope measured thrice, and fenced parameters.
  - Spot-check data and overall tabbed pages: GPS readings for spots 1, 6, and 10; relocation features; channel vegetation types; extent of channel features; dimensions and influences.
  - Validation: built-in data checks; complete only after all missing data are resolved; field validation encouraged.
  - Sketch map: 50 m of channel with relocation features and landmarks to aid future site re-location.
  - Data export: RAPID interface for new site entry or export; QA ensures consistency and completeness before final submission.

- Aquatic plant surveys (MTR-based)
  - 100 m reach surveyed for macrophyte and bryophyte presence and cover on a 9-point scale; data also capture fencing, slope, silt drape, and wet weight of dominant species.
  - Survey method: wade to cover the 100 m reach, grapnel use for channel plants, careful identification to species where possible.
  - Cover estimation: species-specific % cover across the 100 m reach; suggested estimation approaches (square meter method; marginal vegetation method) with conversion tables (Table 6 and 7) to convert area into percent cover values and dominant species ranking.
  - Biomass: three biomass measurements for the dominant submerged macrophyte species, with wet weight measured after field centrifugation and drying in the field laboratory setup.
  - Specimen handling: collect undetermined samples for laboratory confirmation; sample labeling linked to IRIS entries; field data and specimens labeled with square number and specimen code.

## Data management, governance, and outputs
- Electronic data capture: field forms for each component (RIVPACS for macroinvertebrates; RAPID for RHS; IRIS for aquatic plants).
- Data validation: on-site checks to ensure data completeness and internal consistency; iterative corrections until data are complete.
- Data sharing and metadata: emphasis on recording provenance, ensuring datasets can be traced back to originators; sharing of underlying data is a consideration and may present barriers.
- Data governance: practice of quality assurance, data cleaning, transformation, and clear presentation of findings through reports, charts, or dashboards.
- Output formats: structured reporting for policy insight, including standardized metrics and cross-study comparability.

## Challenges and barriers
- Key obstacles in monitoring framework implementation:
  - Lack of data or data of insufficient quality.
  - Limited access to data, including delays or restricted availability.
  - Silos within/between organisations hindering data sharing.
  - Requirements to publicly share datasets can deter data usage.
  - Maintaining up-to-date data and metadata can impede sharing.
  - Inadequate metadata complicates verification against requirements.
  - Data formats requiring effortful transformation for usability.
  - Communicating complex findings clearly.
  - Establishing data governance processes to ensure standards and sustainable data storage and sharing.
