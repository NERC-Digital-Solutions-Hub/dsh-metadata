# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Overview and purpose
  - A governance framework for research funded by UK bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, NERC).
  - Aims to ensure fitness for purpose, quality of research processes (QP) and quality of science (QS), and to promote best scientific practice from project start.
  - Applies to all funded research; acceptance of the Code becomes part of research terms and conditions; may trigger risk assessments.

- Principles behind the Code
  - Emphasizes two interrelated quality dimensions:
    - QS: aims, approaches, discovery of new knowledge; scientific quality.
    - QP: rigor, repeatability, auditable procedures, and appropriate safeguards.
  - Top-level commitment to quality, competence, and diligent, fit-for-purpose research.

- Compliance with the Code
  - Contractors indicate acceptance when submitting proposals; may discuss inapplicable clauses.
  - Records of discussions become part of terms and conditions; potential formal risk assessments.
  - Contractors bear responsibility for project compliance; subcontractors must also adhere.
  - For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by Institute Director.

- Monitoring of compliance
  - Policies and processes must exist to ensure compliance and consistent application.
  - Bodies expect formal, potentially third-party audited quality assurance systems (fit-for-purpose).
  - Bodies may request evidence of compliance, including independent audits (e.g., UKAS).

- Specific requirements

  - 1. Responsibilities
    - Contractor organization bears overall research quality responsibility.
    - Managers and supervisors promote good scientific practice; clear roles for all staff.

  - 2. Competence
    - All personnel must be competent; training and supervision to ensure quality and safety.
    - Documented evidence of capability and training.

  - 3. Project planning
    - Risk assessment to identify factors affecting success; written project plan addressing design, statistics, etc.
    - Plans agreed with the Funding Body; consider ethical/licensing requirements.
    - Regular timetable/project plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

  - 4. Quality Control
    - Planned, formal “fit-for-purpose” reviews; outputs authorized as agreed with Funding Body.
    - Post-publication errors to be communicated; corrective actions initiated quickly.
    - Continuous improvement through regular procedure reviews.

  - 5. Health and Safety
    - Compliance with relevant health and safety regulations.

  - 6. Handling of samples and materials
    - Clear, durable labeling; agreed retention period; traceability through analysis/use; defined disposal routes.

  - 7. Facilities and equipment
    - Safe, appropriate working environment; equipment calibrated and maintained; contingency plans for critical equipment.

  - 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
    - Documentation of all procedures; audit trail with version control; validation of methods; traceability of modifications.

  - 9. Research / work records
    - Detailed, high-quality records enabling replication; regular reviews; secure, traceable storage for duration required.

  - 10. Field-based research
    - Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges/emissions; apply all JCoPR provisions to fieldwork.

- Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
  - Provides concrete evidence categories for each requirement (e.g., organisation structure, personnel lists, subcontractor agreements, training records, risk assessments, project plans, SOPs, audit records, H&S plans, sample tracking, calibration records, version-controlled documentation, archiving procedures, field risk assessments).

- Implications for monitoring frameworks (relevant to the archetype)
  - Integrate QP and QS into monitoring framework design to ensure both process quality and scientific validity.
  - Prioritize robust data governance: documentation, audit trails, version control, data provenance, and records retention.
  - Build in risk-based planning and periodic reviews to adapt monitoring plans as projects evolve.
  - Plan for third-party assurance or audits to demonstrate compliance and data integrity.
  - Define clear roles, responsibilities, and accountability for monitoring outputs and data governance.
  - Ensure handling of environmental samples and field data emphasizes traceability, safety, and regulatory compliance.
  - Use the annex evidence framework as a practical checklist for governance and reporting requirements in monitoring frameworks.
