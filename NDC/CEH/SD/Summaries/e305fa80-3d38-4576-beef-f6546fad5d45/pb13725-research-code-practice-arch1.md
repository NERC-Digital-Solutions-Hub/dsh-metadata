# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Background
- Developed by representatives from Defra, FSA, BBSRC, and NERC; endorsed by Northern Ireland, Scottish, and Welsh administrations; and by APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, NE, and VMD.
- Launched May 2003; effect from 1 June 2004.
- Joint UK audit programme by UKAS (2006) to assess post-1 June 2004 projects; findings shared in 2009 workshop.
- Revised by Defra and FSA with input from other bodies; applies to research funded by the listed bodies and to research in their own institutes.
- Overriding principle: fitness for purpose; aimed at ensuring quality of process (QP) and quality of science (QS).

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors should deliver both high-quality process (QP) and high-quality science (QS).
- QS covers project aims, approaches, and new knowledge; QP covers rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes.
- Emphasis on best scientific practice from project start; compliance driven from leadership.
- Framework for proper conduct of research; fitness for purpose and competence/training of researchers.

## Compliance with the Code
- Funding bodies require acceptance of the Code in research proposals (where applicable).
- Contractors should discuss inapplicable clauses; discussions and the Code become part of Terms and Conditions.
- Formal risk assessments may be requested.
- Contractors responsible for ensuring project and subcontractor compliance.
- For BBSRC- and NERC-funded work, Institute Director must provide annual acceptance.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Policies and processes should exist to ensure compliance; apply consistently across organisations.
- Organizations should, where possible, assure quality via formal systems audited against internationally recognised standards.
- Funding Bodies may audit contractor systems or request evidence that projects meet the standard (as per UKAS programme).

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisation: overall quality of research and compliance with policies.
- Managers/supervisors: maintain climate of good scientific practice and skills development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader: responsible for all work, including subcontractors; clearly defined responsibilities for all staff.

## 2. Competence
- Personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training must be supervised to prevent compromised results.
- Contractors must provide documented evidence of competence and training records.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessment to identify factors affecting success; develop a written project plan addressing design, statistics, etc.
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body; consider ethical approvals or licences.
- Regularly review timelines and plans; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Planned processes to assure quality; formal fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequency.
- Outputs require Funding Body-approved authorization; post-publication errors must be reported and corrective action taken.
- Continuous improvement through regular review of processes and procedures.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention period to be agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage and handling specified in project plans; monitor critical storage conditions.
- Track samples through analysis and disposal.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe operating environment; regular maintenance of facilities (e.g., fume cupboards).
- Equipment calibrated at appropriate intervals; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for all critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods documented; includes analytical/statistical procedures and audit trails with version control.
- Validation of methods as fit for purpose; traceable modifications.

## 9. Research / work records
- Records must enable replication; regular reviews by Project Leader to ensure validity.
- Location and integrity of critical data recorded; secure retention for agreed period; prevent unauthorized modification.

## 10. Field-based research
- Comply with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimise pollution.
- All provisions of the JCoPR apply to field-based work.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- 1. Responsibilities: org chart, personnel lists (including subcontractors), documented sub-contractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- 2. Personnel competence: CVs, training records, awareness of Code requirements.
- 3. Project planning: risk assessments, reviewed plans, approved milestones, statistical validations, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- 4. Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits, corrective actions, publication approval processes.
- 5. Health & safety: training/compliance documents, specific risk measures.
- 6. Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- 7. Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records, regular facility maintenance, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- 8. Documentation of procedures & methods: robust version control, validated SOPs.
- 9. Research/work records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files, archiving procedures.
- 10. Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
