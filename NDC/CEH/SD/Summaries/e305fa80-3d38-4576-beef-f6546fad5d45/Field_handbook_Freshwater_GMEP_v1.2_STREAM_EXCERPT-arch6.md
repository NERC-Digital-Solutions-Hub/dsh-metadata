# AXIS II Freshwater Manual – Headwater Stream Section Only

- Overview
  - The AXIS II project extends UK Countryside Survey approaches to headwater streams and ponds, surveying biological condition using compatible methods with the CS2007 framework (with minor adjustments). In headwaters, key elements are re-surveyed in each square: water chemistry, diatom community, macroinvertebrate community, and aquatic plant community, plus habitat (RHS). For randomly selected ponds within squares, additional pond-specific elements are surveyed (water chemistry, macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and physical attributes).

- Data collection framework
  - Field teams assess “the ask” and determine data needs, then locate and verify data sources, clean/transform data, and create self-serve products (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) for end users.
  - In each square, two freshwater surveyors (A and B) follow a defined duty distribution, with sampling centered around the RHS 500 m headwater reach and a 100 m aquatic-plant survey stretch centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point.
  - Data are captured in electronic field forms (RIVPACS, RAPID, IRIS) and linked to sample IDs, with on-site validation and post-field storage/shipping arrangements.

- Data elements and sampling components
  - Water chemistry (headwater streams)
    - Indicative chemical sample collected downstream of macroinvertebrate sampling area.
    - Measurements in field: conductivity and pH (on-site, using Hanna Combi meter).
    - Laboratory analyses from filtered water: alkalinity, soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON).
    - Sampling protocol includes on-site filtration using disposable 0.45 µm syringe filters and properly labeled sample bottles; samples fixed/stored and returned with accompanying information sheets for lab processing.
  - Diatom sampling (DARES method)
    - Centered on RHS spot-check 6 location; substrata options: cobbles (preferred), algae-covered cobbles, emergent macrophytes, submerged macrophytes.
    - Multiple methods (A–D) depending on substratum availability; at least five cobbles collected when using Method A, with thorough cleaning and transfer of diatoms to sample bottles; macrophyte-derived diatoms sampled with careful brushing and collection.
    - Samples preserved with Lugol’s iodine in the field or laboratory; stored in cool, dark conditions; environmental data recorded; photographic documentation required.
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
    - Standard kick sampling over a 10–15 m stream reach, with a four-minute active sampling window (three minutes for pond-net sampling plus one-minute manual search twice).
    - Sampling area chosen to include habitats in proportion to their cover; options A (shallow), B (deeper), C (main channel unreachable) depending on reach characteristics.
    - Manual searching for surface and hidden taxa; avoid capturing fish or protected species; samples fixed in 40% formalin; multiple bags/pots permitted with clear labeling; field safety and biosecurity procedures applied.
    - Environmental data collected concurrently (width, depth, surface velocity, substratum, bed features, shading, street lighting, etc.); a sketch map of the site is prepared for relocation.
  - Aquatic plants (MTR method)
    - 100 m reach surveyed for macrophytes and bryophytes; 50 m upstream and downstream of macroinvertebrate center point.
    - Presence and percent cover of species recorded on a 9-point scale; species identified to the extent possible (351 taxa list); grapnel used to sample submerged plants when needed.
    - Biomass measurements: three wet-weight samples of the dominant submerged species collected and weighed after field processing; if no submerged plants, biomass not measured.
    - Channel data collected (width/depth, slope, shading, fencing, silt drape, substrate, channel vegetation, etc.), with emphasis on submerged habitats and habitat features.
    - Data entered into IRIS with plant species lists, cover values, and physical site attributes; field specimens preserved or sent to laboratories (reference specimens) for confirmation.

- Data capture, electronic workflows, and validation
  - Macroinvertebrates and RHS data: captured in RAPID; field forms include coordinates (NGR), sample method, sampling time, proportionality notes, and spot-check data; validation checks ensure no missing data, with stepwise error correction until “This RHS survey appears to be complete.”
  - Plants data: captured in IRIS; page 1 collects species list and cover values; page 2 collects physical site data; validation ensures all fields are complete and sums total cover to 100%.
  - Diatoms data: captured in field forms for DARES, with sample metadata, substratum, environmental context, and preservation/storage details.
  - All sample labels include square number, site name, date, sampler initials, and preservative information; samples are transported according to lab protocols and stored in appropriate containers.
  - Sketch maps and photographs accompany each sampling event to aid relocation and interpretation in future surveys.

- Sample handling, transport, and storage
  - Macroinvertebrate and diatom samples transported in clearly labeled containers; CEH Bangor stores macroinvertebrate pots until processing by APEM Ltd; diatom samples kept at CEH Bangor until couriered to Bowburn Consultancy Ltd; aquatic plant reference specimens sent to CEH Wallingford for confirmation.
  - Transport emergency (TREM) cards accompany fixative containers; biosafety and handling guidelines observed.

- Safety, field practices, and quality assurance
  - Health and safety considerations guide sampling decisions; if multiple risk factors are “HIGH” or more than two are “MODERATE,” sampling is halted.
  - Field check-lists ensure all tasks are completed before leaving site.
  - The AXIS II report notes specific amendments to RHS, MTR, and diatom methods, focusing on field digital data entry and streamlined prodecures for consistency and data quality.

- Outputs and intended data products
  - Standardized, electronically captured datasets for each component (water chemistry, diatoms, macroinvertebrates, macrophytes) that feed into central analyses (lab results, community metrics, and habitat assessments).
  - Data are prepared for subsequent analysis, reporting, and comparison across squares and over time, enabling broader policy and conservation insights.

- References and context
  - Core references include River Habitat Survey guidance, DARES diatom methodology, RIVPACS macroinvertebrate framework, and Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) plant assessment, with AXIS II modifications documented (Appendix 1) and related lab procedures and safety documentation.

- Challenges acknowledged
  - Time spent understanding the ask and aligning teams; dealing with patchy data and multiple formats; accessing data across different systems; communicating complex results simply; promoting outputs for reuse. AXIS II addresses these through standardized, electronic data capture and explicit field procedures.
