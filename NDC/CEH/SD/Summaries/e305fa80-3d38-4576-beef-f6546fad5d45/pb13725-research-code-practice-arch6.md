# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- Purpose and scope: A framework for proper conduct of research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, BBSRC, and NERC; emphasizes fitness for purpose through quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS).
- Core aim: Ensure best scientific practice from the start; research should be diligent, competent, and adequately trained.

## Principles behind the Code

- Emphasis on QP (process quality) and QS (scientific quality):
  - QS covers project aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction.
  - QP covers rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes for gathering and interpreting results.
- Overriding principle: fitness for purpose.
- Top-level commitment to strong scientific practice across funded organisations.

## Compliance with the Code

- Contractors must indicate acceptance when submitting proposals; may discuss inappropriate or non-applicable clauses.
- Code terms become part of funding conditions; formal risk assessments may be required.
- Contractors are responsible for ensuring subcontractors comply.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by Institute Director.

## Monitoring of compliance

- Purpose: ensure policies and processes exist and are applied consistently.
- Organisations should implement formal quality assurance systems, ideally third-party audited to an appropriate standard.
- Funding Bodies may audit contractor systems or request evidence that projects meet the required standard (e.g., via UKAS audit program).

## Responsibilities

- The contracting organisation is responsible for overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors must foster good scientific practice and staff development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader is responsible for all project work, including sub-contractors; clear duties defined for all staff.

## Competence

- All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; trainees must be supervised to protect quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of capability and training records showing awareness of Code provisions.

## Project planning

- Conduct appropriate risk assessments to identify factors affecting success.
- Maintain a clear, written project plan addressing design, statistical methods, and other factors; agree plans with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular timetable/project plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.
- Align with ethical approvals or project licenses where relevant.

## Quality Control

- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require funding-body-approved authorisations; senior approval where appropriate.
- Notify funding body of errors after publication and initiate corrective action promptly.
- Regularly review processes as part of continual improvement.

## Health and Safety

- All research must comply with applicable health and safety regulations.

## Handling of samples and materials

- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage and handling provisions must be defined in project plans; monitor critical storage conditions.
- Track samples through analysis or use; define disposal routes and dates.

## Facilities and equipment

- Safe working environment; facilities to maintain sample quality and integrity; regular checks for special facilities.
- Equipment must be appropriate, calibrated, and in good condition; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

## Documentation of procedures and methods

- Comprehensive documentation of all procedures and methods; audit trail with document/version controls.
- Link secondary processed information to primary data.
- Methods must be validated as fit for purpose; traceability for modifications.

## Research / work records

- Records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Location and integrity of all records must be documented and safeguarded; retention for the required period.

## Field-based research

- Compliance with relevant environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risk.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field activities.
