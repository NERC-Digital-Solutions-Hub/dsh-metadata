# AXIS II Headwater Streams & Ponds Survey Methods

- The AXIS II project extends earlier UK Countryside Surveys (CS1990, CS1998/CS2007) and Lowland Pond Survey (LPS), implementing biological assessments of headwater streams and ponds using methods compatible with CS2007, with minor scientifically justified adjustments.
- Aims: survey the biological condition of headwater streams and ponds using standardized, comparable methods to enable monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time; integrate data into central portals and provide transparent outputs.

## Scope and Elements Surveyed

- Headwater streams (in each square): 
  - Water chemistry
  - Diatom community (DARES method)
  - Macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS method)
  - Hydromorphological/physical characteristics (River Habitat Survey amended)
  - Aquatic plant community (MTR method with minor modifications)
- Ponds (in squares containing ponds, randomly chosen): 
  - Water chemistry
  - Macroinvertebrate community
  - Aquatic plant community
  - Physical characteristics (pond environmental attributes)

## Methods and Standardisation

- Compatibility with CS2007 manuals; minor adjustments documented in Appendix 1.
- Core sampling framework:
  - Headwater RHS (River Habitat Survey) reach: 500 m length per square
  - Aquatic plant MTR survey reach: 100 m, centered on macroinvertebrate sampling
  - In ponds, the same sampling elements as listed above, minus additional RHS components
- Data and outputs are designed for standardised outputs (e.g., environmental health against standards) and long-term comparability.

## Site Setup and Sample Location

- Sampling locations are selected to maximise representativeness within a square and to align with RHS/DARES/DAFLOR considerations.
- Photographs are required for macroinvertebrate areas and other features; marker boards indicate location (M for macroinvertebrates; RHS; MTR for aquatic plants).
- For headwater streams, nested sampling stretches and sampling sequence are defined, with rules for non-standard streams (see figures and appendices in the manual).

## Data Collection and Management

- Field data collection is electronic:
  - Macroinvertebrates: RIVPACS electronic form
  - Diatoms: DARES data collection embedded in field forms
  - Aquatic plants: IRIS software (MTR methodology)
  - River Habitat Survey: RAPID system
- Data entry workflow:
  - Enter square, date, surveyors, and site-specific details
  - Use spot-check data and various subsections (vegetation, substrates, bank features, etc.)
  - Validate data on-site with built-in checks; correct errors iteratively until complete
- Storage and transport of samples:
  - Macroinvertebrate samples preserved with formalin and labeled for transport to CEH Bangor/APEM
  - Diatom samples stored at CEH Bangor and couriered to Bowburn Consultancy Ltd as batches
  - Aquatic plant samples sent to CEH Wallingford for confirmation; reference specimens preserved and labeled
- Documentation: Field survey check-lists to ensure all tasks are completed; transport emergency (TREM) card for fixative-containing samples during road transport

## Water Chemistry (Headwater Streams)

- Indicative chemical sample collected downstream of the macroinvertebrate sampling area; analysed for:
  - Conductivity and pH (in-field measurements with Hanna Combi meter)
  - Alkalinity, Soluble Reactive Phosphorus (SRP), and Total Oxidisable Nitrogen (TON) via filtered samples
- On-site filtration using 0.45 µm syringe filters; sample bottles labeled with square, date, and project
- Sample storage and lab submission guided by a field information sheet and CEH lab protocols

## Diatom Sampling (Headwater Streams)

- Location: same as macroinvertebrate sampling, centered on RHS spot-check 6
- Substrata-based sampling strategy to reflect site conditions; priority on cobbles/small boulders, with alternatives (emergent or submerged macrophytes) if cobbles unavailable
- Methods A–D cover cobbles, algae on cobbles, emergent and submerged macrophytes
- Sample fixing and storage:
  - Lugol’s iodine preservative; label with square, site, date, sampler, preservative
  - Store in cool, dark place; ship when sufficient samples collected
- Environmental data collected alongside diatom sampling; recorded on electronic forms

## Macroinvertebrate Sampling (Headwater Streams)

- Standard RIVPACS kick-sampling over a 10–15 m reach; total active sampling time is four minutes (one-minute manual search, three-minute pond-net sample)
- Sampling area and habitats sampled in proportion to cover; continuous diagonal transects recommended if site is homogeneous
- Sampling sequence and habitat targets:
  - Surface dwellers: first manual search (one minute)
  - Main kick/sweep: three minutes across diverse microhabitats
  - Submerged habitats: manual search part 2
  - Vegetation sampling and edge habitats included
- Exclusion: fish, amphibians, and notably large crayfish may be returned to water; report presence
- Sample handling:
  - Net contents transferred to labeled containers and fixed with 4% formaldehyde
  - Proper labeling with square, date, and sample type; storage in labeled pots
- Environmental data collected along the full macroinvertebrate sampling area (width, depth, surface velocity, substratum, bed stability, channel vegetation, shading, clarity, etc.)

## Aquatic Plant Survey (MTR Method)

- 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site; walked and surveyed for submerged and partly submerged macrophytes
- Data captured:
  - Species presence and percent cover on a 9-point scale (DAFLOR adjustments)
  - Biomass for the dominant submerged macrophytes (three measurements of wet weight in field)
  - Physical characteristics of the reach (slope, fencing, silt drape, etc.)
- Species identification to species level where possible; representative samples taken for laboratory confirmation
- Data entry via IRIS:
  - Page 1: species list and cover values
  - Page 2: physical site data and ancillary notes
- Plant samples fixed and stored; reference specimens prepared for confirmation

## Sketch Maps and Photographs

- Sketch map of macroinvertebrate site (approx. 50 m) showing permanent landmarks for relocation
- Site photographs to accompany each survey with numbered boards (for RHS, MTR, and macroinvertebrate sampling areas)

## Quality Control and Documentation

- Field checklist required to confirm completion of all tasks
- On-site data validation via RAPID and IRIS; “Check Data” ensures no omissions
- Documentation and provenance maintained for all samples and field records

## Transport, Safety, and Compliance

- Equipment includes safety gear (life jackets, waders), first-aid, signal devices, and field safety protocols
- Hazard management and biosecurity measures for nets and fixatives
- Transport emergency cards (TREM) used for fixatives during road transport

## Centre Coordination and References

- Data management and analysis workflow coordinate with CEH Bangor, Bowburn Consultancy, and APEM Ltd
- References include Environment Agency manuals (River Habitat Survey, diatom protocols), MTR/DARES/RIVPACS methodologies, and related CEH field guidance

- Challenges and aims aligned with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype:
  - Increasing the value and interoperability of monitoring datasets by integrating multiple data streams
  - Facilitating access to underlying data and ensuring standardized formats for scrutiny over time
