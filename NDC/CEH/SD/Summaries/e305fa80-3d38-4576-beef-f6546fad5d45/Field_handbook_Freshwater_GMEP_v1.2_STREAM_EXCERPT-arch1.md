# HEADWATER STREAM SECTION ONLY

- Purpose and scope
  - AXIS II project continues the Countryside Surveys (CS) lineage, surveying headwater streams and ponds with methods compatible to CS2007, with minor AXIS II amendments.
  - In headwater streams, survey every square for: water chemistry, diatom community, macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, and hydromorphological features (River Habitat Survey Amended).
  - In squares containing ponds, survey water chemistry, macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and pond environment.

- Survey design and site allocation
  - Headwater stream sampling: 500 m length of watercourse per square, with RHS concept defining sampling points (e.g., RHS spot-check 6 for chemistry/diatoms/macroinvertebrates; 100 m plant survey centered on that area).
  - Pond sampling: randomly selected pond within the square; survey covers pond water chemistry, macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and physical attributes.
  - Location strategy aims to maximize RHS within the square while staying within the square’s catchment limits; specific rules exist for non-ideal conditions (contact CEH staff for uncertainties).

- Data collection and electronic recording
  - Field data collected on standardized electronic forms:
    - RIVPACS form for macroinvertebrates and associated environmental data.
    - RAPID for River Habitat Survey (RHS) data, including spot-checks, channel attributes, vegetation, and geomorphology.
    - IRIS for aquatic plant (MTR) surveys and environmental measurements.
  - Built-in validation to check for missing data and inconsistencies; data must be validated on-site before leaving the square.

- Water chemistry (Headwater Streams)
  - Indicative water chemistry sample collected at each watercourse sampling point; analyzed for alkalinity, conductivity, pH, SRP, TON.
  - Sampling protocol:
    - Rinse two 1 L bottles three times with river water upstream of sampling point; collect downstream undisturbed water for analysis.
    - One bottle for conductivity and pH; one for filtered water for alkalinity, SRP, TON.
    - On-site filtering using disposable 0.45 µm syringe filters; label and prepare sample bottles with project/date/square details.
  - Recording and storage:
    - Record pH and conductivity readings on the RIVPACS sample sheet.
    - Filtered water samples stored in appropriate containers and sent to CEH labs with specimen information sheets.
    - Samples stored in a cool, dark place and lab results due within ~2 weeks of receipt.

- Diatom sampling (headwater streams)
  - Center sampling on the middle of the RHS reach (spot-check 6); follow the DARES method.
  - Substratum choices and methods (prefer cobbles; alternatives C and D for macrophytes or other substrates).
  - Sampling methods:
    - Method A: cobbles/small boulders with diatom films; collect five cobbles, brush biofilm, transfer diatoms to a sample bottle.
    - Method B: if filamentous algae cover is high; adjust cobble selection and brush to remove diatoms from algae and cobble surfaces.
    - Method C: emergent macrophytes; sample five healthy stems with submerged portions.
    - Method D: submerged macrophytes; sample from a dominant submerged species; collect diatom epiphytes.
  - Sample fixing and storage:
    - Label all containers; preserve with Lugol’s iodine (4% final) in the field or lab; store cool and dark.
    - Transport to CEH Bangor and Bowburn Consultancy according to protocol.
  - Environmental data and recording:
    - Record environmental variables on the DARES form; center data around the diatom sampling area; electronic entry (DARES form).

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS)
  - Sampling area and method
    - Standard kick sampling within a 10–15 m reach; total active sampling time approx. 3 minutes (with a 1-minute manual search and a 3-minute pond-net sample), plus 1 minute for initial surface searching.
    - Habitats sampled in proportion to their area; continuous diagonal transects recommended where site is homogeneous.
    - Equipment: 25 cm pond-net (900 µm mesh), sample bags/pots, waders, life jacket; nets washed before/after sampling.
  - Sampling sequence and approaches
    - Start with a 1-minute surface search, then main kick/sweep sample (3 minutes) across suitable habitats; finish with another 1-minute search for attached organisms.
    - If depth or conditions prevent standard kick sampling, adapt by sampling vegetation, still or deep areas, or banks.
    - Seek and collect from rocks, logs, vegetation; avoid harming fish or sensitive species; record presence of rare species (e.g., native crayfish) and relocate as required.
  - Sample fixing and storage
    - After sampling, transfer material into labeled pots with 40% formalin to reach ~4% formaldehyde; keep samples damp during transport.
    - Each sample bag/pot must be labeled with square, date, and sampler initials; transport in labeled containers with appropriate biohazard precautions (TREM card).
  - Environmental data and recording
    - Environmental data captured on the RIVPACS form for the full sample area (width, depth, velocity, substratum, bed features, shading, etc.).
    - Substratum and bed features used to classify habitat; velocity categories defined; include side and channel features; rail for channel vegetation and shading.
  - Sketch map and photographs
    - A sketch map (50 m of river) with relocation features and measurements; photographs of sampling area and marker boards for macroinvertebrate site relocation (M, RHS, MTR markers).

- Aquatic plant surveys (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR) 
  - Survey design and reach
    - 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point; wading or grapnel used to access submerged plants; cross channel at least four times per 10 m.
    - Include floating and submerged plants; exclude detached plant material except floating species.
  - Species identification and cover
    - Identify plants to species level where possible; use a standard taxonomic list (351 taxa for identification), with laboratory confirmation for uncertain samples.
    - Cover estimates on a 9-point scale; use DAFLOR for channel vegetation assessment: Dominant >75%, Abundant 75-51%, Frequent 50-33%, Less Frequent 33-26%, Occasional 25-11%, Rare 10-1%.
  - Biomass and measurements
    - Biomass of the dominant submerged species measured in triplicate: wet weight after drying the plant tissue; measure a 10 x 10 cm area from the upstream end of the plant; field centrifuge used if needed.
    - Biomass samples processed and weighed in the field, then combined for final biomass value.
  - Data recording and analysis
    - Data entered in IRIS plant module: species list, cover values, and physical site data; ensure total cover sums to 100% and all relevant fields are completed.
    - If no plants found in the 100 m reach, enter “no species entered” but still complete physical data fields.
  - Field equipment
    - Wading staff, plastic specimen bags, clinometer, field centrifuge, spring balance, identification keys, grapnel for macrovegetation.
  - Sample fixing and storage (plants)
    - Reference specimens (undetermined flora) bagged and labeled for later lab confirmation; specimens linked to IRIS IDs.

- Environmental data, channel morphology, and field methods
  - RHS (River Habitat Survey)
    - Flexible alignment around the macroinvertebrate sampling site; amendments for AXIS II include new questions on weirs/dams, bank permissions and fencing, channel vegetation, slope, and bank features.
    - DAFOR scale replaced with DAFLOR for channel vegetation.
    - Section G: record presence/absence and percent cover of vegetation types; Section K: side/bank bar configurations; Section L: channel dimensions and fenced lengths; Section F/H: spot-check validation.
  - Sketch map and relocation
    - Provide a sketch map with relocation markers; photograph site with a site board and coordinates marker to aid future relocation.
  - Data entry systems
    - RAPID for RHS data (spot-checks, vegetation, geomorphology, and channel attributes).
    - IRIS for aquatic plant data (MTR); ensure proper linkage between plant data and environmental attributes.
    - All forms include validation steps at data-entry time to ensure completeness and internal consistency.

- Safety, field procedures, and transport
  - Health and safety checks prior to sampling; high-risk conditions may deter sampling.
  - Transport and storage
    - Macroinvertebrate samples stored in transport boxes with TREM card; CEH Bangor and APEM Ltd. handle processing; diatom samples go to Bowburn Consultancy; plant samples sent to CEH Wallingford for confirmation.
  - Documentation and checklists
    - Field survey checklist completed by both surveyors to ensure all tasks are completed before leaving site.

- Amendments and references
  - AXIS II updates include on-site electronic data entry, modified RHS sections, revised DAFLOR scale, added weir/dam location fields, fenced-bank length, slope measurements, and biomass measurements in the field.
  - References include Environment Agency manuals (River Habitat Survey; Diatom methods; Mean Trophic Rank), CS surveys, and related methodological papers (Holmes et al., Murphy & Weatherby, etc.).

- Practical output and goals
  - Produce integrated, harmonized data across water chemistry, diatoms, macroinvertebrates, and aquatic plants for each headwater square and pond sample.
  - Enable robust correlations, pattern detection, and predictive analyses through standardized, well-documented data collection and electronic data capture.
