# Dataset: Small rodent dynamics at Lathkill Dale SSSI, Derbys, 1971-2005

## Overview
- 35 years of 6-monthly population sampling of bank voles (Myodes glareolus) and wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus) in a Derbyshire ash woodland.
- Includes a 4-year experiment on ash fruit supplementation in a nearby area.
- Aims to understand how food (masting), climate, and population density drive demographic rates; uses a state-space modelling approach.

## Aims and Context
- Explain between-year variations in reproductive and population growth rates for both species.
- Test effects of environmental variables (notably ash fruit-fall/masting and winter severity) on demography.
- Use experimental fruit additions to aid interpretation and separate food vs. weather influences.

## Data Collected
- Population data from live-trapping of adults and juveniles, with catch-mark-release and density indices derived from marked individuals.
- Trapping: 90 Longworth traps on a 0.45 ha grid, two 24-hour periods per sampling (Nov/Dec and May/June), roughly every six months from 1971–2005.
- Environmental data: annual ash fruit-fall (g per m^2 dry weight, edible seeds), measured Sep–Mar or Sep–Mar/Apr; winter severity via mean daily minimum temperature Dec–Mar.
- Experimental data: ash fruit supplementation (two winters) with a parallel control area to compare dynamics.

## Experimental Design
- Control area vs. Experimental area (0.45 ha each), located ~150 m apart.
- In winters with little natural fruit, 60 kg of heat-sterilized ash fruit distributed across the experimental grid.
- Both areas trapped on the same schedule to assess the demographic impact of added fruit.

## Modelling and Analyses
- State-space model applied to 33 years of data to link variables to reproductive and population growth rates.
- Density indices validated against model-generated population estimates.
- Examined independent effects of food (fruit-fall) and weather, plus delayed impacts lasting up to a year or more.
- Assessed density dependence in both species’ winter and summer growth rates.
- Findings from fruit-addition experiments supported the fruit-fall influence on bank vole demography.

## Key Findings
- September–March fruit-fall is the major driver of bank vole spring reproductive rate and population growth (both winter and following summer).
- For wood mice, September–March fruit-fall has a weaker influence on spring reproduction; December–March fruit-fall shows a weak influence on summer growth.
- Winter severity affects bank vole winter growth and wood mouse spring reproductive rate; neither species shows winter breeding.
- Density dependence significantly affects winter and summer growth rates for both species.
- Fruit-fall effects on bank vole demography can persist for a year or more.
- Annual ash fruit-fall reached 22.52 g/m^2 of edible seed (oak woodlands may exceed this but usually as shorter-term pulses).

## Location and Sampling Regime
- Location: Lathkill Dale, Derbyshire (SE corner coordinates provided), ash-dominated woodland (Fraxinus excelsior) with 90% canopy; soil stabilized scree with limestone bedrock.
- Area details: Control grid and nearby experimental grid, each 0.45 ha, trap layout 6×5 points (90 traps) with two 24-hour trapping periods per sampling.
- Long-term context: 1971–2005, with an additional controlled fruit addition experiment in 1981–82 and 1984–85.
- Data collection cadence: six-monthly intervals (approx. December–January and May–June).

## Data Access, Quality and Reuse
- Data analysed using standardized, transparent methods; results presented in clear formats (tables, figures/maps).
- Datasets are stored and intended to be uploaded to appropriate data portals for reuse and scrutiny, enabling cross-study comparisons and long-term monitoring value.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring
- Demonstrates how long-term, standardized wildlife monitoring, coupled with environmental measurements and targeted experiments, can disentangle complex ecological drivers.
- Highlights the value of linking mast events, climate, and density in population dynamics, with explicit attention to data quality, modelling, and data accessibility for policy and research use.
