# Temperature and copper effects on the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans

## Overview
- Metadata accompanying a dataset on how temperature stress and copper exposure affect Caenorhabditis elegans (N2 Bristol strain).
- Related to the journal paper on variable temperature stress and sensitivity to an additional chemical stressor.

## Experimental design and organism
- Organism: C. elegans (N2 Bristol) cultured on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar with Escherichia coli OP50, dark conditions at 20°C.
- Acclimation: Cultures acclimatized for several generations at selected test temperatures, with weekly transfers to fresh NGM.
- Exposures: Steady temperatures of 8, 12, 16, 20, 24°C and variable temperature regimes with daily fluctuations of ±4°C (ranges 8–16, 12–20, 16–24°C; 12°C, 16°C, 20°C averages) or ±8°C (range 8–24°C; 16°C average).
- Copper treatments: Copper chloride (CuCl2) added to NGM at 0, 1, 3, 8, 20, 40 mg/L.
- Replication: 12 replicates per treatment; control regimes had 24–36 replicates to accommodate experimental design.
- Life cycle start: Synchronized cohorts generated by exposing adults to copper-spiked plates to lay eggs, then removing adults and continuing with offspring to L4 stage before transfer to individual wells.

## Measurements and traits
- Traits recorded: 
  - Length of nematodes (µm) measured at the L4 stage.
  - Offspring count (fertile eggs and hatched larvae) per day, continued until death.
  - Time to first egg laid (derived from longitudinal counts).
- Observation cadence: Daily transfers and counts across reproductive and senescence stages; worms moved to fresh wells each day.
- End condition: Experiment terminated when the last worm died.

## Copper exposure and analysis
- Copper dosing: Stock CuCl2 solution prepared and integrated into fresh batches every five days to reduce copper immobilization in agar.
- Copper bioavailability assessment: Copper content measured in both water fraction and agar after 1 and 5 days to differentiate dissolved vs. agar-bound copper.
- Analytical method: Graphite furnace AAS (PerkinElmer Zeeman 5100) with blanks, spike references, and NIST 1577c bovine liver standard.
- Data quality: Standard QA procedures implemented to validate copper measurements.

## Data structure and variables
- Data file: temperatureandcoppereffectsonnematodes.csv
- Key columns and meanings:
  - Plate: TC-plate number; randomization of treatments across plates.
  - Replicate: replicate number.
  - Cu: copper concentration in mg/L agar.
  - Day: day after eggs were laid.
  - Length: body length in micrometers; measured from L4 onward.
  - Offspring: count of fertile eggs and larvae; zeros indicate no offspring.
- Termination indicator: After the last non-zero Offspring count, subsequent cells may be blank, with the worm considered dead.

## Data processing and analysis
- Statistical approaches:
  - One-way ANOVA with Tukey post hoc to compare temperature treatments for brood size, lifespan, and maximal length (non-Cu exposed).
  - Cumulative egg production modeled with a three-parameter log-logistic sigmoid model (DRC package in R).
  - Derived metric: Time to first egg (TFE) by solving the model for y = 1/d; standard errors provided for estimates.

## Temporal scope and provenance
- Data collection period: June–October 2013.
- Culture and experimental conditions, including acclimation and plate handling, tightly controlled to ensure consistency across temperature and copper treatments.

## Notes for visualization and GIS relevance
- The dataset is non-spatial by itself but contains rich temporal and treatment dimensions (temperature, temperature variation, copper concentration, time, reproduction, and growth).
- Potential GIS-oriented use: map or visualize response surfaces over temperature and copper axes, with time (Day) and plate/replicate as dimensions, enabling spatial-temporal-like analyses of biological response patterns when combined with geospatial context or when integrated into multi-layer environmental impact datasets.
