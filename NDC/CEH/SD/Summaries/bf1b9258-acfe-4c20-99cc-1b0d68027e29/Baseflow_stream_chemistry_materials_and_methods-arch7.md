# Water quality, nutrients and the water framework directive in an agricultural region: The lower Humber Rivers, northern England

- Study area and setting
  - Eastern part of the Humber Basin, covering land north and south of the Humber estuary (East Riding of Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire).
  - About one-sixth of the Humber Basin; contrasting geology: low-lying clay vales with low-permeability soils in the west, and higher ground with Chalk at the eastern edge (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds) reaching over 200 m a.s.l.
  - Intensive agriculture (≈90% of land) with cereals, sugar beet, oilseed rape, and root vegetables.
  - Climate and hydrology: Wolds receive higher rainfall; Chalk vs clay catchments show different runoff dynamics (baseflow indices ~0.45 vs ~0.90).
  - Main rivers: Hull (north of estuary) and Ancholme (south of estuary); historic maritime use, now largely amenity-driven.
  - Water management features: Ancholme valley drainage modified to a straight-cut main channel; lock at the estuary mouth reduces saline intrusion with bubble barrier and timing controls.

- Monitoring and data sources
  - Baseflow survey design
    - River waters collected at EA monitoring points and other key locations; where large towns exist, multiple sites to capture sewage-impacted vs. unimpacted reaches.
    - Coverage includes western and eastern Foulness, Hull upstream/downstream of Driffield, and multiple streams south of Humber (Ancholme and tributaries such as Rase, Kelsey Beck, West Drain, Skittle Beck, Freshey, Waith Beck, Lud, Great Eau, etc.).
    - Sampling conducted 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
    - In-field filtration (0.45 μm) prior to analysis for major nutrients and trace elements; unfiltered samples for total P; analyses performed the day after return to the lab for labile components; other determinants within two weeks.
  - Parameters and data types
    - Major cations/anions, soluble reactive P (SRP), total dissolved P, ammonium, nitrite, dissolved trace metals, total reactive trace metals, dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, total suspended solids, micro-organics.
    - Continuous water quality monitoring with Hydrolab Datasonde 3 units measuring pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature every 30 minutes on most major rivers; weekly (April–November) or fortnightly (other times) probe replacements to minimize biofouling; spot checks with calibrated portable meters at replacement times.
  - Data handling and standards
    - Samples stored and handled with specific temperature and filtration regimes; calibration and QA procedures described for field and laboratory measurements; references to established methods and prior studies for methodological grounding.

- Sample processing for chemical analysis
  - Sampling and collection
    - Prefer sampling from bridges to obtain mid-river, well-mixed water; use plastic, PTFE, and glass bottles depending on analyses; triple-rinse protocols for some bottles; depth 0.5–1.0 m to minimize surface contamination.
    - On-site measurements of pH, conductivity, and temperature with calibrated equipment; three readings averaged after gentle mixing.
  - Analytical methods and storage
    - Major ions and SRP and other determinations: filtered samples (0.45 μm) or other specified filtration; immediate or short-term storage at 4°C in darkness as required; analysis by ion chromatography, colorimetry, or ICP-MS depending on determinant.
    - SRP: modified Murphy and Riley method; colorimetric detection at 880 nm after reagent addition.
    - Ammonia: indophenol blue method after mixing with reagents; use EDTA to prevent precipitation; measurement at 635 nm.
    - Nitrite: diazotization with sulphanilamide and N-1-naphylethylenediamine; measurement at 543 nm.
    - Alkalinity: Gran titration with autotitrator (HCl) to pH 3.0; two-stage titration process described.
    - Carbon analyses: filtration for soluble/particulate carbon; duplicate analyses; dried and weighed filters or prepared samples for combustion and GC/HP-LC as appropriate.
    - Trace metals: filtration for dissolved fractions; acidification (1% HNO3); ICP-MS/ICP-AES analysis.
    - Sediments: filtration of well-mixed samples through dried filters; weight/dry mass determinations.
  - Quality and timelines
    - Filtration, storage, and analysis timelines are defined for each determinant; some analyses performed the next day, others within a couple of days; duplicate filtrations and blanks used for carbon and sediment work.
  - Special notes
    - Some samples are filtered differently depending on the target determinant (e.g., SRP, major ions, trace metals), with fractionation (dissolved vs. acid-soluble) achieved via sequential filtration and acidification steps.

- Continuous monitoring and replication
  - Hydrolab Datasonde 3 deployments across major Humber rivers for near-continuous parameter tracking (pH, conductivity, DO, temperature); weekly-to-fortnightly probe changes to minimize fouling; laboratory-calibrated spot checks performed during replacements.

- Relevance for GIS and data handling
  - Provides a spatially distributed, baselined dataset across multiple tributaries and reaches, suitable for map-based visualization of water quality gradients, pollution hotspots, and nutrient transport.
  - Detailed sampling design and analytical workflows support harmonization with other datasets and potential data standardization for cross-site comparisons.
  - Longitudinal data components (historic references and continuous monitoring) enable temporal analysis of watershed responses to agricultural practices and hydrological changes.
