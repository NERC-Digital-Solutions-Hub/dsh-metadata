# Water quality, nutrients and the water framework directive in an agricultural region: The lower Humber Rivers, northern England

## Overview
- Describes the eastern Humber Basin, focusing on agricultural land use and the hydrology of the Hull and Ancholme rivers.
- Outlines monitoring programs, sampling design, and laboratory analyses used to characterize water quality, nutrients, and related chemical parameters.
- Provides methodological detail on sample collection, processing, storage, analysis, and continuous monitoring instrumentation.

## Study area
- Geographic scope: eastern Humber Basin including land north and south of the Humber estuary, East Riding of Yorkshire, and northern Lincolnshire.
- Geology and soils: western area with low-permeability clay vales; eastern higher ground with Chalk (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds).
- Land use: predominantly arable farming (wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, root vegetables; cereals are dominant).
- Climate and hydrology: rainfall/runoff patterns differ between Chalk-derived and clay catchments; baseflow indices indicate distinct hydrological behaviour.
- Main rivers: Hull (north of estuary, Chalk aquifer as primary water source) and Ancholme (drained floodplain valley with low-permeability soils).

## Monitoring and data sources
- Baseflow survey design: multiple sampling sites near EA monitoring points; sometimes two sites per area to separate urban-influenced and less impacted stretches.
- Coverage: sites in both western (Foulness arm, Hull) and southern (Ancholme, Rase, Kelsey Beck, West Drain, other Lincolnshire streams) catchments; focused on urban and agricultural interfaces.
- Timing: sampling conducted 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
- Analyte scope: major ions, nutrients, trace elements, total phosphorus, and related water quality indicators; included calculations of EpCO2 and SI CaCO3.
- Data management context: methodologies referenced for reproducibility and inter-study comparability.

## Sample processing for chemical analysis
- Sampling locations and collection: samples taken from bridges for representative mid-river conditions; 0.5–1.0 m depth to avoid surface contamination.
- Containers and handling: use of plastic, PTFE, and glass bottles; three rinses for plastic/PTFE bottles; glass bottles used once.
- In-field measurements: pH, conductance, and temperature measured with calibrated instruments; triplicate readings for pH and conductivity.
- On-site calibration: pH buffers (pH 7.0 and 10.0) and conductivity standards; field checks at each site.
- Sample processing and storage by determinant: detailed processing, storage temperatures, and analysis methods for major ions, SRP, ammonia, nitrite, dissolved/total trace metals, dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, and suspended solids.
- Filtration and fractions: samples filtered to obtain dissolved vs particulate fractions (0.45 μm for most determinants; 0.8 μm for some organics); filtered samples stored appropriately; certain determinations acidified for dissolved fractions.
- Analytical methods (examples): SRP via Murphy and Riley method with ascorbic acid reduction; ammonia via phenol-nitroprusside and alkaline hypochlorite reagents; nitrite via sulphanilamide/N-1naphthylethylenediamine; alkalinity by Gran titration; carbon analyses by filtration and subsequent analysis; trace metals by ICP-MS/OES; organics by HPLC/GC.
- Turnaround: filtered/unfiltered samples stored on ice or refrigerated; analyses scheduled for the following day or within a couple of days as specified.
- Method references: explicitly cited foundational procedures and prior studies to support reproducibility.

## Continuous and field-based monitoring
- Hydrolab Datasonde 3 deployments: multiple probes installed on major Humber rivers for pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature.
- Schedule and maintenance: probes rotated weekly (April–November) and fortnightly at other times to minimize fouling; calibration against standard buffers and oxygen-saturated water.
- Supplementary measurements: spot pH, conductivity, DO, and temperature readings taken with calibrated field equipment when sensors are replaced.

## Data governance and stewardship implications
- Standardization: consistent sampling depths, container types, filtration procedures, and analytical methods to enable cross-site comparability.
- Metadata and provenance: explicit documentation of sites, dates, depths, and processing steps to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
- Quality assurance: field calibrations, triplicate measurements, duplicate filtering/analysis for some determinations, and regular instrument maintenance to ensure data integrity.
- Data timeliness and access: routine data collection and coordinated laboratory analyses to support timely data availability for interpretation and decision-making.
- Scalability and interoperability: methodologies aligned with established references to facilitate combining this dataset with other river monitoring datasets and long-term water quality assessments.
