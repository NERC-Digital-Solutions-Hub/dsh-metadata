# Water quality, nutrients and the water framework directive in an agricultural region: The lower Humber Rivers, northern England.

## Study Area
- Eastern Humber Basin region: land north and south of the Humber estuary, including East Riding of Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire (about one-sixth of the Humber Basin).
- Geology and soils: western part low-lying with clay vales; eastern part higher ground with Chalk (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds).
- Agriculture: major producer; ~90% of land used for crops (wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, root vegetables).
- Climate and hydrology: rainfall/runoff differences between Chalk-derived and clay catchments; main rivers Hull and Ancholme; historical maritime use, now oriented to amenity use.
- Water management: Ancholme drainage system modified in the 17th–19th centuries; lock at the estuary reduces saline intrusion; bubble barrier used to limit saltwater incursion.

## Monitoring and Data Sources
- Baseflow survey: river waters collected near EA monitoring points and other key sites; multiple sites where urban influence is present; sampling focused on northern Humber (Foulness arms, Hull) and southern Humber (upper/middle/lower Ancholme and tributaries).
- Sampling timing: conducted 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
- Site selection: included areas with urban influence to assess sewage impact; coverage across streams draining various soils.
- Sample handling (overview): filtration and preservation steps on-site and in-lab prior to analyses; multiple determinants measured with site-specific protocols; data linked to hydrological and chemical controls references.

## Sample Processing and Analysis
- Field sampling: samples collected from bridges to ensure mid-river mixing; varied container materials (plastic, PTFE, glass) depending on tests; depth 0.5–1.0 m to minimize surface contamination.
- On-site measurements: pH, conductivity, temperature via calibrated meters/probes; multiple readings averaged.
- Filtration and storage: majority of analyses used 0.45 μm or 0.8 μm filtration; samples stored at 4°C in the dark as required; immediate analysis for some determinations.
- Determinants and methods:
  - Major ions and SRP: filtered samples; ion chromatography for ions; SRP via colorimetric method (Murphy & Riley) with spectrophotometric detection at 880 nm.
  - Soluble reactive P (SRP), total P, ammonia (NH4+), nitrite (NO2-): described colorimetric procedures with spectrophotometric readouts at specific wavelengths.
  - Alkalinity: Gran titration using autotitrator with two-stage approach down to pH 3.0.
  - Carbon: dissolved and total carbon analyses after filtration; particulate carbon via filtration and combustion/gas analysis.
  - Metals: dissolved and total reactive trace metals via filtration and ICP-MS/IC; samples acidified with HNO3.
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulates: filtration and subsequent analyses.
  - Micro-organics: described but specifics depend on test type.
  - pH, alkalinity, conductivity, suspended solids: standard procedures with duplicate filtrations and gravimetric or electrochemical measurements.
- Quality control and references: detailed methodologies align with established references (e.g., Murphy & Riley, Mackereth et al.); duplicate samples, blanks, and calibrated instruments employed to ensure accuracy.

## Continuous Monitoring
- Hydrolab Datasonde 3 deployments: multiple units across major Humber rivers.
- Measurements: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), temperature at 30-minute intervals.
- Maintenance: weekly rotation Apr–Nov to minimize fouling; fortnightly otherwise.
- Calibration: laboratory-based calibration using standard buffers and oxygen-saturated water; spot readings with checks during site changes.

## Data Management and Implications for Data Leaders
- Comprehensive time-series and spatial data across rivers, sites, and determinants, enabling assessment of water quality, nutrient loads, and controls relevant to the Water Framework Directive.
- Detailed metadata and standardized methodologies support data discoverability, reproducibility, and comparability across studies.
- Data governance considerations evident in sample handling, storage conditions, filtration/processing protocols, and explicit analytical methods.
- Challenges implicit in data systems include ensuring consistent coverage across catchments with urban/rural gradients, maintaining data quality with multiple laboratories and field teams, and aligning methodologies with broader regulatory frameworks.
