# The LOIS river monitoring network: strategy and implementation.

- Overview of study area
  - Eastern Humber Basin covers land north and south of the Humber estuary, including the East Riding of Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire; about one-sixth of the Humber Basin.
  - Geography: western part is low-lying clay vales with low-permeability soils; eastern part has higher ground up to >200 m above sea level with high-permeability Chalk (Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds).
  - Agriculture dominates: ~90% of land cropped (wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, root vegetables); cereals dominate.
  - Climate/runoff: Wolds rainfall ~678 mm/yr with 275 mm/yr runoff; clay vales rainfall ~620 mm/yr with 318 mm/yr runoff; baseflow indices ~0.45 (clay) and ~0.90 (chalk), indicating different groundwater contributions.
  - Main rivers: Hull and Ancholme; historical maritime use, now focused on amenity value.
  - Hydrology: Hull sourced largely from Chalk aquifer; Ancholme drainage modified in the 17th–19th centuries to a drained, straight-cut channel; Ancholme mouth features a lock that limits saline intrusion; salt intrusion is locally controlled by timing of boat traffic, venting, and a bubble barrier.

- Monitoring and data sources
  - Baseflow survey design: river waters collected near EA monitoring points and other key sites; in some rivers multiple sites to capture sewage-impacted vs. un-impacted stretches (e.g., Foulness, Hull around Driffield, upper/middle/lower Ancholme, Rase, Kelsey Beck, West Drain, Skittle Beck, Freshey, Waith Beck, Lud, Great Eau).
  - Sampling period: 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
  - Sample handling in the field: water filtered in the field through 0.45 µm membranes before major, nutrient, and trace element analyses; unfiltered samples kept for total phosphorus; analyses performed next day (pH, alkalinity, nutrients) or within two weeks for others.
  - Analyte types and related references: major ions, nutrients, trace elements; guidelines and storage/analysis timelines drawn from Neal et al. (2000, 1997) and related hydrological literature.

- Sample processing for chemical analysis (on-site and lab workflows)
  - Sampling locations and bottle types: from bridges when possible to obtain mid-river mixing; plastic, PTFE, and glass bottles used depending on determinations; bottles rinsed and filled to minimize contamination; sampling depth 0.5–1.0 m.
  - Field measurements: pH, conductivity, and temperature with Mettler Checkmate modules; probes calibrated in the lab before use and checked in the field; pH calibrated with pH 7.0 and 10.0 buffers; conductivity calibration at 0 and 1413 µS.
  - Sample processing steps by determinant groups (typical workflow per determinate):
    - Filtration: 0.45 µm for SRP, major ions, and trace metals; 0.8 µm glass fibre for ammonium and nitrite; samples stored at 4°C in the dark as required.
    - Storage: various requirements (immediate analysis, 4°C in dark, acidified with HNO3 for dissolved metals).
    - Analysis methods: on- or near-site analysis following standard methods; on-site filtration and lab analyses follow specific protocols.
  - Specific determinant analyses and methodologies:
    - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): Murphy and Riley method; colorimetric reaction forming molybdenum blue; 880 nm measurement with a flow-through cell; standards 0–250 µg/L.
    - Ammonia: indophenol blue method with phenol-nitroprusside and alkaline hypochlorite reagents; EDTA added to prevent precipitation; 25°C incubation; 635 nm measurement; standards 0–150 µg/L.
    - Nitrite: sulphanilamide and N-1-naphthylethylenediamine dye formation; 543 nm measurement; standards 0–60 µg/L; analyzed on collection day.
    - Total alkalinity: Gran titration using Metrohm Titrino; calibration against pH buffers (pH 4.0 and 7.0) and standard HCl; titration to pH 3.0 in two stages; calculation of alkalinity per established methods.
    - Carbon analyses: filtration through GF/F; duplicate samples; dried and weighed filters; samples prepared for carbon analyses after filtration.
    - Sediments: filtration through GF/C; drying and reweighing of filters to determine sediment mass.
    - Dissolved trace metals and total reactive trace metals: filtration (0.45 µm) with 4°C storage in 1% HNO3; analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass/optical emission spectrometry.
    - Dissolved organic carbon: filtration through 0.8 µm glass fibre; immediate analysis or appropriate storage.
    - Particulate carbon: filtration through 0.8 µm glass fibre; subsequent analysis.
    - Micro-organics: storage at 4°C in the dark; analysis via HPLC/GC.
    - Alkalinity, pH, conductivity, and oxygen measurements: standard methods; field and lab cross-checks.
  - Continuous water-quality monitoring
    - Hydrolab Datasonde 3 multi-parameter probes deployed on major Humber rivers; parameters measured include pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature at 30-minute intervals.
    - Equipment rotation: weekly changes April–November and biweekly during other months to reduce fouling effects; field spot checks with calibrated meters when probes are replaced.

- Data management and broader context
  - The monitoring program is aligned with understanding hydrological and chemical controls in a major agricultural-river system and supports water quality assessments, similar to the aims of LOIS in linking data to policy and environmental frameworks.
  - Methodologies referenced underpin robust data quality, comparability, and the ability to track temporal changes across multiple determinants and sites.

- Endnotes and references
  - Foundational references include Neal, Robson, Jeffery, Harrow, and Neal (1997, 2000) on river-water chemistry and trace-element interrelationships, Mackereth et al. (1978) on water analysis methods, and related LOIS-related strategy work (Leek et al., 1997).
