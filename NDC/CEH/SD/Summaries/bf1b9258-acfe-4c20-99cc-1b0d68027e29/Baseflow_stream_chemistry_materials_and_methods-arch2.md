# Water quality, nutrients and the water framework directive in an agricultural region: The lower Humber Rivers, northern England

## Study area
- Eastern Humber Basin area north and south of the Humber estuary, including East Riding of Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire; about one-sixth of the Humber Basin.
- Landscape: western low-lying clay vales with low-permeability soils; eastern high ground with Chalk aquifer of the Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Wolds (over 200 m.a.s.l.).
- Land use: major agricultural production; around 90% of land dedicated to crops (wheat, barley, sugar beet, oilseed rape, root vegetables; cereals dominant).
- Hydrology: Chalk-sourced rivers in the east; Ancholme drains low-permeability soils; historical river regulation modified the Ancholme valley (mid 17th to early 19th centuries) to create a straight-cut main channel; a lock at the estuary mouth minimizes saline intrusion with timing, venting, and a bubble barrier.

## Monitoring and data sources
- Baseflow survey: river waters collected near EA monitoring points and key locations; multiple sites chosen to capture sewage-impacted and unimpacted stretches; sampling conducted 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
- Sampling locations span the western and eastern Foulness, Hull upstream and downstream of Driffield, Ancholme and tributaries (Rase, Kelsey Beck, West Drain), Skittle Beck, Freshey, Waith Beck, Lud, Great Eau, and other Lincolnshire Wolds streams.
- Sample handling: field filtration (0.45 μm) prior to analyses for major ions, nutrients, and trace elements; unfiltered samples for total phosphorus; on-site pH, conductivity, and temperature measured with calibrated equipment; lab analyses performed after return (within specified timeframes).
- Derived parameters: saturation indices such as EpCO2 and SI CaCO3 calculated from pH, alkalinity, Ca, and temperature (based on referenced methods).

## Sample processing for chemical analysis
- Sampling from bridges if possible to obtain mid-river, well-mixed water; bottle types vary by determinant (plastic, PTFE, glass) with specific rinsing and filling protocols.
- Depth of sampling: 0.5–1 m to minimize surface contamination.
- On-site measurements: pH, conductivity, temperature using calibrated meters; multiple readings averaged.
- Filtration and storage: various determinants filtered through 0.45 μm or 0.8 μm filters; samples stored at 4°C in dark when appropriate; some analyses performed immediately.
- Determinant-specific processing and storage:
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): filtered; colourimetric analysis (Murphy and Riley modification) at 880 nm.
  - Ammonia: colourimetric indophenol blue method with EDTA addition to prevent precipitation; measured after 1 h at 25°C.
  - Nitrite: azo-dye colorimetric method; measured at 543 nm; analyzed the day of collection.
  - Total alkalinity: Gran titration using autotitrator; two-stage titration to pH 3.0.
  - Carbon analysis: filtration and filtration blanks; drying and weighing of filters for carbon fractions.
  - Trace metals: filtered dissolved fraction stored in acidified bottles; ICP-MS/ICP-OES analysis; acid-soluble fractions prepared from unfiltered samples.
  - Dissolved and total reactive trace metals, dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon: respective filtration, storage, and analysis protocols.
  - Major ions and SRP: stored until analysis; SRP analyzed next day or within two days.
- General practice: duplicate filtration and analysis for carbon; immediate or near-immediate analysis for several determinants; acidification and handling to preserve metals and organics as required.

## Continuous monitoring of water quality
- Deployment of Hydrolab Datasonde 3 monitors across major Humber rivers to measure pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen (DO), and temperature.
- Data intervals: every 30 minutes; sensor changes occur weekly (April–November) and fortnightly at other times to reduce fouling.
- Field calibration: laboratory-calibrated pH (buffers 7.0 and 10.0), conductivity (0 and 1413 μS), and DO-equilibrated water; spot checks with portable meters when probes are replaced.

## Data quality and methodological context
- Use of established field and laboratory protocols for sampling, filtration, preservation, and analysis to ensure data comparability over time.
- Integration with broader hydrological and chemical studies in the Humber estuary and UK rivers (references to related datasets and methodologies).
- Emphasis on data provenance, standardised approaches, and potential for combining datasets to enhance monitoring value and policy relevance (as outlined in overarching aims for environmental analysts).
