# Water quality, nutrients and the water framework directive in an agricultural region: The lower Humber Rivers, northern England

- Study area and purpose
  - Eastern Humber Basin region: north/south around the Humber estuary, including East Riding of Yorkshire and northern Lincolnshire; about one-sixth of the Humber Basin.
  - Dominant land use: agriculture (roughly 90% of land for cereals, sugar beet, oilseed rape, root vegetables).
  - Geology and hydrology: Chalk aquifer in the Wolds; clay vales with low-permeability soils in the east; rainfall/runoff differences between chalk vs clay catchments (baseflow indices around 0.45 for clay vs 0.90 for chalk).
  - Main rivers: Hull and Ancholme; historical navigation; current emphasis on amenity value; features affecting salinity intrusion at Ancholme mouth (lock and bubble barrier considerations discussed but not central to monitoring design).

- Monitoring and data sources
  - Baseflow survey design: river samples collected near EA monitoring points and key locations; multiple sites where villages/ towns are present to capture sewage-influenced vs. less-impacted reaches.
  - Sampling schedule: 11–13 August 2006 under prolonged baseflow conditions.
  - Sampling scope: includes western/eastern arms of Foulness, Hull upstream/downstream of Driffield, Ancholme upper/middle/lower and tributaries (Rase, Kelsey Beck, West Drain), Skittle Beck, Freshey, Waith Beck, Lud, Great Eau; aim to cover drainage from Wolds to the North Sea.
  - On-site measurements: pH, conductivity, and temperature measured with field meters; probes calibrated in the lab before use and re-checked at each site.

- Sample processing and chemical analysis
  - Sampling and containers: samples taken from mid-river (0.5–1 m depth) using plastic, PTFE, and glass bottles as required; field filtration and preparation underway to ensure representative chemistry.
  - Filtration and storage: many determinants filtered on site through 0.45 μm membranes; specific filters used for different analyte groups; samples stored cold (4°C) in the dark as appropriate; some fractions analyzed immediately.
  - Determinant processing: detailed on-site and lab procedures for major ions, SRP, soluble reactive P, total P, ammonium, nitrite, dissolved/total trace metals, dissolved organic carbon, particulate carbon, alkalinity, pH, conductivity, suspended solids, and micro-organics; samples stored and handled to preserve integrity until analysis.
  - Analytical methods (typical approach):
    - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): colorimetric method (Murphy & Riley, 1962) with molybdate-ascorbic acid reagents; absorbance at 880 nm.
    - Ammonia: colorimetric indophenol method with phenol-nitroprusside and hypochlorite reagents; EDTA added to prevent precipitation; absorbance at 635 nm.
    - Nitrite: diazotisation method forming a red azo-dye; absorbance at 543 nm.
    - Total alkalinity: Gran titration with automatic titrator (pH calibration and acid titration to pH 3.0 in two stages).
    - Carbon analyses: filtration and preparation for dissolved/particulate carbon (GF/F filters, drying, weighing, analysis).
    - Metals and trace metals: filtration and acidification for dissolved fractions; ICP-MS/ICP-OES for measurement.
  - Continuous monitoring and rapid measurements: Hydrolab Datasonde 3 multi-parameter sondes deployed on major rivers to measure pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and temperature at 30-minute intervals; weekly changes Apr–Nov and biweekly otherwise to minimize biofouling; spot checks with portable meters during probe changes.

- Determinants and data types
  - Major ions and nutrients: SRP, ammonium, nitrite, total P, dissolved/particulate carbon, dissolved organic carbon.
  - Physical-chemical parameters: pH, conductivity, alkalinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen.
  - Trace metals: dissolved and total reactive fractions.
  - Sediments: suspended solids via gravimetric methods.
  - Data collection scales: field-based snapshot (baseflow period) complemented by continuous monitoring to capture temporal variation and diurnal/seasonal trends.

- Data quality and references
  - Methodological framework draws on prior studies and standard references (e.g., Neal et al. 1997, 1998; Mackereth et al. 1978) to support hydrochemical interpretation and quality control.
  - Emphasis on standardized sample collection, handling, and calibration to enable comparability across sites and over time, supporting integration with Water Framework Directive assessments.

- Relevance for analysis and decisions
  - Rich, multi-parameter data set across spatial gradients (chalk vs clay catchments) and through baseflow conditions to inform nutrient dynamics, carbon cycling, and water quality under agricultural pressures.
  - Data supporting correlative analyses, hydrological controls on nutrient transport, and potential predictive modeling for policy and management within the WFD framework.
