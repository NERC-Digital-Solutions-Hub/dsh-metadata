# Collection method

## Collection method
- RGB aerial imagery collected with a DJI Mavic Pro 2 unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV).
- Flight duration: 6 minutes.
- Date: 5 February 2020.
- Flight planning tool: Pix4DCapture.
- Ground pixel resolution (GSD): 0.01 m.
- Image overlap: 80% for both lateral and longitudinal directions.
- Ground Control Points (GCPs): 8 GCPs distributed throughout the dune; coordinates surveyed with a Trimble R8 differential GPS.
- Processing: Orthorectification and mosaicking performed with Pix4Dmapper using a fully automated Structure-from-Motion (SFM) photogrammetry workflow.

## Nature and Units of recorded values
- Pixel values correspond to Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels.
- Spatial resolution: 0.01 m per pixel.

## Quality Control
- GCPs identified manually within the imagery using Pix4Dmapper.
- Absolute coordinates of GCPs compared with the orthomosaic to calculate RMSE: 0.003 m in X, Y, and Z directions, indicating a high degree of relative accuracy.

## Details of data structure
- Data format: GeoTiff.
- Coordinate system: WGS84 / UTM zone 30N (EPSG:32630).
