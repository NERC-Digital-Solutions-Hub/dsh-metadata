# Collection method

- Aerial RGB imagery was collected with a DJI Mavic Pro 2 UAV during a 6-minute flight on 5 February 2020, planned with Pix4DCapture to achieve a ground pixel resolution of 0.01 m and 80% overlap (both lateral and longitudinal).
- Ground Control Points: 8 GCPs (5.8 per 100 photos) distributed across the dune, surveyed with a Trimble R8 DGPS to provide precise geolocation data.
- Processing workflow: Orthorectification and mosaicking performed using Pix4Dmapper with a fully automated Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry approach.
- Data characteristics: Imagery provides RGB pixel values at a 0.01 m resolution.
- Quality control: GCPs were manually identified in the imagery; RMSE of 0.003 m in X, Y, and Z indicates a high degree of relative positional accuracy.
- Data format and coordinate system: Output is in GeoTIFF format, using the WGS84 30N coordinate system (EPSG:32630).
