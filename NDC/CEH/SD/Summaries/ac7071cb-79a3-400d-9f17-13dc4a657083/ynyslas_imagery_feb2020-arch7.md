# Collection method

- UAV: DJI Mavic Pro 2
- Flight duration: 6 minutes on 5 February 2020
- Ground pixel resolution: 0.01 m (1 cm)
- Flight plan: Pix4DCapture with 80% lateral and longitudinal overlap
- Ground Control Points (GCPs): 8 GCPs (5.8 per 100 photos) distributed across the dune; coordinates surveyed using Trimble R8 DGPS

# Processing workflow

- Orthorectification and mosaicking performed with Pix4Dmapper
- Fully automated workflow based on Structure-from-Motion (SFM) photogrammetry
