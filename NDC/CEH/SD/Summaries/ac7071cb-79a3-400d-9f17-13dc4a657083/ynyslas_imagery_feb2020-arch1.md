# Collection method

- RGB aerial imagery collected with a DJI Mavic Pro 2 UAV during a 6-minute flight on 5 February 2020.
- Flight planning performed with Pix4DCapture; ground pixel resolution of 0.01 m; lateral and longitudinal image overlap set at 80%.
- Eight Ground Control Points (GCPs) distributed across the dune (5.8 per 100 photos) and surveyed using a Trimble R8 differential GPS.
- Orthorectification and mosaicking conducted with Pix4Dmapper using a fully automated Structure-from-Motion (SFM) photogrammetry workflow.

- Nature and units of recorded values: Pixel values for Red, Green, and Blue at 0.01 m resolution.

- Quality control: GCPs manually identified in the imagery within Pix4Dmapper; RMSE of 0.003 m in X, Y, and Z when comparing surveyed GCP coordinates with the orthomosaic coordinates, indicating high relative accuracy.

- Data structure details: Aerial imagery stored as GeoTIFFs; coordinate system is WGS84 30N (EPSG:32630).
