# Data overview

- Study context: Records of insect visitations to flowers in a wildflower seed mix trial conducted in a single field on two farms—Church Farm, Oxfordshire, and Lee Farm, West Sussex. Each plot is 20 x 5 m, with four seed mixes plus a control fallow.
- Collection period: Insect surveys conducted April to August in 2019, 2020, and 2021. Surveys occurred every 2–3 weeks, totaling eight survey periods per year. Farms were surveyed on two separate days for each period.
- Survey procedure: For each survey, every plot was walked lengthways, and insects visiting flowers within 2 m on either side were identified in flight or collected for lab identification.
- Data recorded: Insects visiting flowers recorded at a 'group' level (hoverfly, other fly, solitary wasp, solitary bee, bumblebee, honeybee, beetle, butterfly); bees, hoverflies, and butterflies identified to species level where possible and counted.
- Taxonomic detail: For each observation, records include Insect.taxa (group), Insect.genus, Insect.species, Flower.family, Flower.species, and Sex of the insect.
- Quality control: Wild bee and hoverfly specimens not identified on site were sent to experts (Steven Falk and Ellen Rotheray) for verification, with sub-samples processed to ensure accuracy.
- Data structure: Data stored in an Excel file named InsectData.csv with 14 columns: Year, Date, Month, Period, Farm, PlotID, Mix, Replicate, Flower.family, Flower.species, Insect.taxa, Insect.genus, Insect.species, Sex.
- Location and timing details: Coordinates provided for both farms; Year and Date fields indicate when data was collected; Period specifies the survey window within each year.
- Potential uses: Supports analysis of visitation patterns across seed mixes, farms, and years; enables creation of dashboards, pivot tables, and other data products to enable self-service exploration; supports data-driven insights into pollinator interactions with wildflower mixes.
- Notes on data scope: The dataset captures a longitudinal, replicated field experiment with multiple plots per mix, enabling comparisons of pollinator visitation across treatments and over time.
