# Data overview

## Scope and study design
- Records insect visitations to flowers in a wildflower seed mix trial conducted in a single field on two farms: Church Farm, Oxfordshire, and Lee Farm, West Sussex.
- Plot layout: 20 x 5 m contiguous plots; four different seed mixes plus a control fallow.
- Timeframe: Insect surveys conducted April–August in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
- Sampling cadence: Surveys occur every 2–3 weeks, totaling eight survey periods per year.
- Sampling procedure: Farms surveyed on two separate days near each survey period; for each plot, a central walk along its length was done, recording insects visiting flowers within 2 m on either side.

## Data collected and measurement units
- Insects visiting flowers were identified at the plot level to broad groups: hoverfly, other fly, solitary wasp, solitary bee, bumblebee, honeybee, beetle, butterfly.
- Bees, hoverflies, and butterflies identified to species level where possible and counted.
- Data are stored in an Excel CSV file (InsectData.csv) with 14 columns capturing metadata and observations.

## Data structure and variables
- Columns include: Year, Date, Month, Period, Farm, PlotID, Mix, Replicate, Flower.family, Flower.species, Insect.taxa, Insect.genus, Insect.species, Sex.
- The dataset links insect observations to specific plots, seed mixes, and flower species.

## Quality assurance and verification
- Specimens not identifiable by the primary identifiers were sent to external experts for confirmation (e.g., bee and hoverfly identifications).
- Sub-samples of specimens were also provided to experts to ensure consistent, accurate species identification.

## Metadata, standards, and governance implications
- Detailed, structured data schema with clear field definitions facilitates reuse for monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Multi-year, replicated design supports trend analysis across seed mixes and pollinator groups.
- Quality control measures demonstrate commitment to accurate identification and data reliability.
- The data are organized to enable downstream reporting, visualization, and governance processes, aligning with principles of data provenance and transparency.

## Limitations and considerations for monitoring use
- Species-level identifications are only possible where feasible; some records may be limited to group-level taxa.
- The study spans two farms in a single field context, which may limit generalizability to broader landscapes.
- While data governance concepts are evident (identification checks, metadata fields), explicit sharing policies or public data access are not described in this text.
