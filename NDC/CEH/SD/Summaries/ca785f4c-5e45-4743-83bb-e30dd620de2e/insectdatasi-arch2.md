# Data overview

- Study scope and sites
  - Insect visitation records from a wildflower seed mix trial conducted in a single field on two farms: Church Farm, Oxfordshire and Lee Farm, West Sussex.
  - Seed mixes sown in 20 x 5 m contiguous plots; treatments included four different seed mixes plus a control fallow.
  - Precise locations provided by geographic coordinates.

- Data collection timeline
  - Surveys conducted April to August in 2019, 2020, and 2021.
  - Each year had eight survey periods (approximately every 2–3 weeks).
  - Farms were surveyed on two separate days for each survey period.

- Methods and measurement units
  - During each survey, each plot was walked centrally; insects visiting flowers within 2 m on either side were identified on the wing or captured for lab identification.
  - Insect groups recorded (Insect.taxa): hoverfly, other fly, solitary wasp, solitary bee, bumblebee, honeybee, beetle, butterfly.
  - Bees, hoverflies, and butterflies identified to species level where possible and counted.
  - For each plot, records include: Year, Date, Month, Period, Farm, PlotID, Mix, Replicate, Flower.family, Flower.species, Insect.taxa, Insect.genus, Insect.species, Sex.

- Taxonomy, quality control and data validation
  - Specimens not identifiable in the field sent to experts (Steven Falk for bees; Ellen Rotheray for hoverflies) for confirmation, with sub-samples processed to ensure accuracy.

- Data structure and file details
  - Data stored in an Excel file named InsectData.csv with 14 columns corresponding to the fields listed above.
  - Data collection focuses on standardised observations of insect visitation to flowers, enabling cross-year and cross-site comparisons.

- Data quality and stewardship
  - Quality assurance procedures include expert validation and centralized identification where needed.
  - Data are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to support accessibility and reuse.

- Challenges and opportunities for analysts monitoring the environment
  - Increasing the value of datasets by linking with additional relevant data (avoiding single-use datasets).
  - Enabling access to underlying data used to produce outputs, to enhance transparency and reuse.

- Potential uses for environmental monitoring
  - Assess pollinator visitation patterns to different wildflower seed mixes.
  - Compare outcomes across seed mixes, plots, farms, and years to evaluate environmental health and policy performance.
  - Provide standardised, auditable outputs (reports, maps, charts) for monitoring programs.
