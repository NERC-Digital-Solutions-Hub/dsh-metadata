# Sampling regime

- Timeframe: Sampling was weekly from June 2011 to December 2011, then fortnightly from January 2012 onward.
- Related files: See Plynlimon_site_information.csv for details.

## Sample location information

- In 2013 (15/01/2013 to 24/09/2013), samples for Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Cyff (AE), and Gwy (AF) were collected ~100 to 150 meters upstream of the normal sample point due to a leaf litter addition experiment (15/01/2013–18/01/2013).
- Site coordinates:
  - Lower Hore: Easting 284337, Northing 287238
  - Lower Hafren: Easting 284228, Northing 287936
  - Cyff: Easting 282094, Northing 284246
  - Gwy: Easting 282281, Northing 285399

## Notes on reported values

- For hydrochemical values (18/10/2011–27/03/2012) below the limit of detection (LOD), reported value reflects the machine output.
- For hydrochemical values (17/04/2012–08/03/2016) below the LOD, reported as a value halfway between 0 and the LOD.
- LOD values are described in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
- 9999 in the Rainfall (mm) column indicates an overflowing rain gauge.
- Full determinant definitions and methods are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST).

## Quality control and data provenance

- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measured at CEH Bangor laboratories; CEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing quality assurance scheme.
- All other chemical analyses conducted at CEH’s Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group (CEH Lancaster); ISO 17025:2005 UKAS accreditation for many analyses.
- Data checked for missing values; blank cells denote missing data. Gaps may arise from insufficient samples (e.g., rain), instrument failure, halted analyses (e.g., metals ceased after 12/03/2013), or fieldwork errors.

## Data access and references

- The dataset references Plynlimon_site_information.csv for site details and Description_of_column_headings.csv for determinant definitions, with CAST vocabulary where possible.
