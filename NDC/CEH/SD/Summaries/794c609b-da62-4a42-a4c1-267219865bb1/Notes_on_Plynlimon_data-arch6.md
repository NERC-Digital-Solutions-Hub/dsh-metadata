# Sampling regime

- Sampling was weekly from June 2011 to December 2011 and then fortnightly from January 2012. See Plynlimon_site_information.csv for more details.

## Sample location information

- From 15/01/2013 to 24/09/2013 samples for Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Cyff (AE) and Gwy (AF) were taken about 100 to 150 meters upstream of the normal sample point due to a leaf litter addition experiment (15/01/2013 to 18/01/2013).
- Coordinates:
  - Lower Hore: Easting 284337, Northing 287238
  - Lower Hafren: Easting 284228, Northing 287936
  - Gwy: Easting 282281, Northing 285399
  - Cyff: Easting 282094, Northing 284246

## Notes on reported values

- For hydrochemical values from 18/10/2011 to 27/03/2012, values below the Limit of Detection (LOD) are reported as provided by the analysis instrument.
- For hydrochemical values from 17/04/2012 to 08/03/2016, values below the LOD are reported as half the LOD.
- LOD values are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
- A 9999 value in the Rainfall (mm) column indicates rain gauge overflow.
- Full determinant and method descriptions are available in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST).

## Quality control

- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measurements were conducted at CEH Bangor laboratories, which participate in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing scheme.
- All other chemical analyses were conducted at CEH’s Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group (CEH Lancaster) and are UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses.
- Data have been checked for missing values; blank cells indicate missing data, which may result from insufficient sample, instrument failure, halted analyses, or fieldworker error.
