# Sampling regime

- Timeframe of sampling
  - Weekly sampling from June 2011 to December 2011
  - Fortnightly sampling from January 2012 onward
  - Additional details available in Plynlimon_site_information.csv

- Sample location information (2013 leaf litter experiment)
  - From 15/01/2013 to 24/09/2013, samples for Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Cyff (AE), and Gwy (AF) were taken approximately 100–150 meters upstream of the normal sample point due to a leaf litter addition experiment (15–18/01/2013)
  - Site coordinates:
    - Lower Hore: Easting 284337, Northing 287238
    - Lower Hafren: Easting 284228, Northing 287936
    - Gwy: Easting 282281, Northing 285399
    - Cyff: Easting 282094, Northing 284246

- Notes on reported values and data handling
  - For hydrochemical values below the limit of detection (LOD):
    - 18/10/2011–27/03/2012: value reported as provided by the instrument
    - 17/04/2012–08/03/2016: below LOD values set to half the LOD
  - LOD values are described in Description_of_column_headings.csv
  - 9999 in the Rainfall (mm) column indicates a rain gauge overflow
  - Full descriptions of determinants and methods are in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST)

- Quality control and laboratory procedures
  - pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measured at CEH Bangor laboratories
  - CEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing quality assurance scheme
  - All other chemical analyses conducted at CEH Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group, CEH Lancaster
  - UKAS accreditation to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses

- Data completeness and governance
  - Data checked for missing values; blank cells indicate missing data due to insufficient sample (e.g., rain), instrument failure, halted analyses (e.g., metals analysis stopped after 12/03/2013), or fieldworker error
