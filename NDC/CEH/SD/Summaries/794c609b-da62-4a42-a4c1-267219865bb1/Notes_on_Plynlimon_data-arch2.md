# Sampling regime

- Sampling was weekly from June 2011 to December 2011 and then fortnightly from January 2012. See Plynlimon_site_information.csv for more details.

## Sample location information

- From 15/01/2013 to 24/09/2013, samples for Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Cyff (AE) and Gwy (AF) were taken approximately 100 to 150 meters upstream of the normal sample point due to a leaf litter addition experiment conducted from 15/01/2013 to 18/01/2013.
- Sample locations (Eastings/Northings): Lower Hore 284337/287238; Lower Hafren 284228/287936; Gwy 282281/285399; Cyff 282094/284246.

## Notes on reported values

- For hydrochemical values from 18/10/2011 to 27/03/2012, values below the detection limit (LOD) are reported as measured by the analyzing instrument.
- For hydrochemical values from 17/04/2012 to 08/03/2016, values below the LOD are reported as halfway between 0 and the LOD.
- LOD values are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
- A 9999 value in the Rainfall (mm) column indicates the rain gauge was overflowing.
- Full descriptions of determinants and methods are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST) where possible.

## Quality control

- pH, conductivity and alkalinity were measured at CEH Bangor laboratories, which participate in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing QA scheme to ensure consistency with other laboratories.
- All other chemical analyses were performed at CEH’s Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group (Lancaster) and the facility is UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses.
- Data have been checked for missing values; blank cells indicate missing data. Missing data can result from insufficient sample, instrument failure, analysis being stopped (e.g., metals analysis ceased after 12/03/2013), or fieldworker error.
