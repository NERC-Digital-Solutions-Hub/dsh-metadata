# Sampling regime

## Overview
- Sampling frequency: weekly from June 2011 to December 2011; fortnightly from January 2012 onward.
- For 15/01/2013 to 24/09/2013, targeted samples were taken ~100–150 meters upstream of the normal points at several sites due to a leaf litter addition experiment.
- Additional details and context are available in related metadata files (see Plynlimon_site_information.csv).

## Sample locations and changes
- Sites involved (and codes): Lower Hore (A), Lower Hafren (B), Cyff (AE), Gwy (AF).
- Sampling during the 2013 period was conducted at specific upstream coordinates to accommodate the leaf litter experiment.
- Coordinates provided:
  - Lower Hore: Easting 284337, Northing 287238
  - Lower Hafren: Easting 284228, Northing 287936
  - Gwy: Easting 282281, Northing 285399
  - Cyff: Easting 282094, Northing 284246

## Data reporting and value handling
- Below detection limit (LOD) handling:
  - 18 Oct 2011 – 27 Mar 2012: reported value is used as provided by the instrument.
  - 17 Apr 2012 – 08 Mar 2016: value set to a midpoint between 0 and the LOD.
- LOD details are described in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
- Rainfall data: a value of 9999 mm indicates the rain gauge overflow.
- Full determinant and method descriptions are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv, with CAST (CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus) terminology where possible.

## Quality control and laboratories
- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity analyses conducted at CEH Bangor laboratories; participation in LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing to ensure inter-laboratory quality.
- Other chemical analyses conducted at CEH Lancaster (Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group); UKAS-accredited ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses.
- Data quality: checks performed for missing values; blank cells indicate missing data.
- Common reasons for missing data include insufficient sample, instrument failure, stalled analyses (e.g., metals analysis ceased after 12/03/2013), or fieldwork error.

## Data governance and metadata
- Supplementary files referenced for full interpretation and provenance:
  - Plynlimon_site_information.csv (sample site details)
  - Description_of_column_headings.csv (determinants, methods, LODs)
- The dataset adheres to standardized reporting and quality assurance practices to support discovery, reuse, and interoperability, with documented handling of non-detects, anomalies, and updates.
