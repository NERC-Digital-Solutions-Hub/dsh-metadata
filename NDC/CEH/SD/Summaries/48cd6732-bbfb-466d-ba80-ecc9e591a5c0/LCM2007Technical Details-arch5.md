# Land Cover Map 2007

- Purpose and scope: Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in formats to suit diverse UK users, facilitating land cover information access and use.

## Data Formats

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: polygons representing land cover parcels.
  - Each polygon has attributes describing land cover and metadata describing derivation.
  - Minimum Mapable Unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: UK.

- Raster data
  - Five raster products that summarize the information.
  - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters: summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
  - Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
  - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Metadata and Documentation

- Detailed dataset documentation contains:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Availability and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards

- Ensure metadata quality and consistency across vector and raster formats, guided by the Dataset Documentation Tables.
- Maintain clarity on data scale, minimum mapping unit, and coverage to support interoperability and user needs.
- Facilitate access to both detailed (vector) and summary (raster) products, including freely available raster options.
- Document data derivation and attribute definitions to support discoverability and reuse.
- Manage linkage to the official Dataset Documentation for comprehensive metadata and class descriptions.
