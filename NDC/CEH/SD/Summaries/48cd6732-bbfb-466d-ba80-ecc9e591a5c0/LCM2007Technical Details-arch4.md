# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview for Data Leaders
- UK-wide land cover information available in two formats to suit different user needs and analysis workflows: vector data (most detailed) and raster data (summaries at different scales).
- Vector data: parcel-level polygons with land cover attributes and metadata on derivation; minimum mapable unit is 0.5 ha; supply format is ESRI Shapefile.
- Raster data: five raster products; a 25 x 25 m raster for the most likely Broad Habitat per pixel; four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarising the 25 m raster; supply format is GeoTiff; coverage is UK.

## Data formats and scales
- Vector: detailed parcel-level data with derivation metadata; recommended for high-resolution analyses.
- Raster: five products with 25 m resolution (Broad Habitat) and 1 km resolution rasters that summarize the 25 m data; formats are GeoTiff.
- Coverage: United Kingdom.

## Documentation and metadata
- Detailed metadata and description available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Tables 1–3 in the documentation cover:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for raster datasets

## Practical considerations for data governance
- Ensure discoverability and interoperability by clearly noting formats (Shapefile, GeoTiff) and scales (0.5 ha minimum for vector; 25 m and 1 km for rasters).
- Use the dataset documentation to interpret attribute definitions and habitat classifications.
- Consider aligning analyses across vector and raster formats for multi-scale insights.
- The documentation supports understanding data provenance, metadata quality, and update processes, which aids governance, versioning, and metadata management.
