# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

## Overview
- National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook detailing standardized field methods to collect woodland indicators.
- Each site comprises 16 plots, with data collected on ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot habitats, site descriptions, and soil samples.
- Includes guidance on permissions, relocation, data recording, and sample handling to enable long-term data comparability and reuse.

## Data architecture and datasets
- Datasets collected per site:
  - Vegetation plot: Ground flora (presence/absence across five quadrats; percent cover for the full plot; bryophyte notes limited to major species on soil).
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: Species, DBH measurements, heights; quadrant-based sampling for saplings and shrubs.
  - Plot description and habitats: Presence/absence of habitat attributes; frequency-oriented data with field notes.
  - Site description and habitats: Site-wide context and habitat attributes (open, rock, aquatic, marginal land use, etc.).
  - Soil sampling: One composite soil sample per plot (top 15 cm); labeled bags for each plot.
- Data codes and forms are standardized (Appendix IV; site and plot codes separate but linkable). Appendices provide reference lists (e.g., bryophyte species) to support identification and consistency.
- Outputs include species lists, abundance/cover estimates, structural measurements (DBH, height), habitat classifications, and soil properties.

## Data collection workflow
- Pre-field preparation:
  - Site location maps, plot location maps (1:50,000 and/or 2½" maps), and permission letters provided.
  - Landowner contact information recorded on Site Description sheet; permissions secured before surveying.
- Plot relocation and sampling:
  - Identify 16 random sampling points per site; relocate using compass, distance, and map-derived references (GPS discouraged to avoid map-based bias).
  - Establish a 14.14 m x 14.14 m plot with quadrats (center to corners) and record across five nested quadrats (2x2 m to full plot).
- Data collection sequence:
  - Vegetation plot (ground flora) recorded first to minimize disturbance.
  - Then trees, saplings, shrubs (DBH, height, species) across plot quarters; saplings/shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3).
  - Plot description and habitat attributes recorded next.
  - Soil sample collected concurrently from plot center; labeled and stored.
- Site-level data:
  - Complete site description and habitats form for the entire site, capturing inter-plot context and boundaries.
- Post-field:
  - All data forms (four per site) plus soil samples bundled and prepared for shipment to CEH Merlewood.

## Data quality, standards, and bias management
- Emphasis on accuracy and avoidance of subjective bias in plot relocation and data recording.
- Relocation method selected to minimize bias and maintain map-ground alignment, acknowledging historical changes over 30+ years.
- GPS discouraged to prevent bias from historical plot placements; careful scaling and ground-truthing with enlarged maps.
- Requirements to document any site changes (e.g., sites bisected by motorways) and to avoid recording plots on restricted land without permission.

## Permissions, governance, and provenance
- Surveyors responsible for obtaining access; use of a standard introduction letter to communicate background and intent.
- Landowner names/addresses recorded with results; landowner receive a full copy of results for their parcel.
- Data provenance is explicit: site and plot codes, recorder initials, date, and conditions captured on standardized forms.
- Site maps and original historic maps are used to ensure consistent placement, with attention to permissions and ownership.

## Data storage, labeling, and dispatch
- Per-site data packaging: four data forms per site, two soil sample sets, site description form; forms stapled and stored in site folders.
- Soil samples labeled in the field and again on the bags; samples stored in cool conditions before transport.
- Soil dispatch options include hand delivery, courier, or next-day post; best practice is to send within a week of collection.
- CEH Merlewood is the primary repository; clear labeling and packaging guidelines ensure traceability.

## Instruments, forms, and reference materials
- Field equipment list includes map extracts, plotting gear (center pole, corner poles, distance strings), sighting pole, compass, DBH tape, tapes, and measurement tools (clinometer/hypsometer).
- Recording forms:
  - Vegetation plot, Trees/Saplings/Shrubs, Plot description, Site description.
  - Appendices provide species lists (bryophytes) and detailed attribute codes for site and plot descriptions.
- Appendix VI covers soil analysis protocols (pH, loss on ignition) and lab procedures for processing soil samples.

## Appendices and reference data
- Appendix II: Vegetation plot data templates (ground flora, cover estimates, and species lists).
- Appendix III: Tree, sapling, and shrub data templates (species, DBH, heights, and cell conventions).
- Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats data structures with extensive attribute codes (A–N), including management history, regeneration, dead wood, epiphytes, habitats (rock, open, aquatic, vegetation), animals, and marginal land use.
- Appendix Ia/Ib: Bryophyte lists for pilot woodland sites and Great Britain.
- Appendix V: Field equipment specifics and per-site data packaging.
- Appendix VI: Soil laboratory protocols (pH and LOI determination).

## Practical considerations and end-to-end guidance
- Field work aims for comprehensive, high-quality, and comparable data across sites and over time.
- Acknowledge significant site changes since 1971; record changes and avoid dangerous or restricted areas.
- Ensure all data are complete and consistent across site and plot forms; verify linkage between site and plot data.
- Emphasize clear communication with landowners and timely return of soil samples to central repository.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Strong emphasis on standardized data schemas and cross-site comparability (site/plot codes, dataset structures, and attribute codings).
- Emphasis on data provenance, permissions, and governance to support ethical data collection and legal access.
- Workflow design prioritizes data quality, bias reduction, and traceability from field collection to central analysis.
- Detailed metadata and reference materials (Appendices) support reproducibility and long-term data reuse.
- Collaboration with multiple institutions (CEH, English Nature) to sustain data standards and storage.
