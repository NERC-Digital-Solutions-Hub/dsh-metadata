# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A comprehensive field methodology for surveying and classifying woodlands, producing standardized data on vegetation, habitats, soils, and site characteristics across many plots and sites.
- Aimed at enabling large-scale woodland classification datasets that are discoverable, reusable, and governance-ready.

## Overview and Aim
- Establishes standardized procedures to observe, record, and describe woodlands for national classification.
- Emphasizes data governance: consistent metadata, careful documentation, and clear responsibilities to ensure datasets are usable and up-to-date.
- Covers planning, permissions, data collection across plots, site-level habitat descriptions, soil data, herbarium specimens, and equipment.

## Access, Permissions, and Site Selection
- Prepare an outline plan to survey sites with minimal travel and regard for land access constraints.
- Obtain site access permissions; if consent is withheld, use backup sites and notify Merlewood for maps and sampling points.
- Build good public relations; communicate purpose clearly to landowners to avoid misperceptions about land purchase or interference.
- If permission is granted, determine best entry points to minimize disturbance and walking distance; avoid traversing fences or private barriers unnecessarily.
- If permission cannot be obtained, coordinate with Merlewood for alternative data (maps, sampling points, etc.).

## Sampling Framework and Layout
- Locate woods using maps (Ordnance Survey scales) and identify sampling points on a 22" site map (16 points per site).
- Primary data collection points must be located with accuracy around a 20 m radius, using a ground-based method that minimizes bias.
- Procedure for locating points includes selecting a nearby control point, aligning map and compass, pacing distances, and adjusting for slope if needed.
- A two-operator approach is recommended for efficient quadrat searches.

## Order of Recording Data (per site/plot)
- Four data sets per sampling point and two sets of samples:
  - Ground flora presence/absence across five progressively larger quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) with percent cover estimates.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, diameters at breast height (DBH), heights, dead vs live, and quadrant-based recording for saplings and shrubs.
  - Plot description and habitat attributes: presence/absence of defined habitat features (e.g., slope, aspect, glades, rocks, water bodies, habitats like bracken, brambles, epiphytes, lichens, etc.), with a structured coding scheme.
  - Soil data: a central pit and auger borings for a composite topsoil sample, plus horizon-based observations and a standard set of soil measurements.
- After plot-level data are recorded, complete a site-level description and habitat form to capture broader site characteristics and between-plot information.

## Ground Flora Data (a) and (b)
- Ground flora: for each plot, record presence/absence of species in all quadrats; provide abundance or cover estimates, with bryophytes collected as a comprehensive site sample (not by every quadrat).
- Saplings and shrubs: record all stems >5 cm DBH for trees, saplings (<5 cm DBH for saplings and shrubs) in diagonally opposite quarters; include dead stems with appropriate notation.
- The largest tree height is measured (using a specified height instrument) when applicable.

## Plot Description and Habitats (and Site Description)
- Plot-level attributes: slope and aspect; detailed habitat attributes are defined in appendices with explicit criteria (e.g., glades, rock features, aquatic habitats, bracken, nettle, bramble, moss banks, macrofungi on wood and soil, etc.).
- Include a central ground profile sketch and a description of major surface features.
- Site description and habitats form captures scale-wide site data, including marginal land use and boundary-type information.

## Soil Data and Soil Types
- Because of scale, a limited but informative soil data set is collected:
  - pH
  - Loss on ignition
  - Mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) by a simplified method
  - Retain samples for potential later analyses
- Field interpretation uses horizon-based soil description (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) including:
  - Litter and organic layers (A0)
  - Organic-mineral mixtures (A1/A2)
  - Weathered/depositional mineral horizons (B1/B2)
  - Underlying material (C)
- Major woodland soil types discussed: Podzolic soils (acid, leached), brown earth/brown forest soils (mull/moder humus), gleyed and skeletal soils, and calcareous soils (Rendzina, chalk/limestone-derived), with emphasis on dynamic, immature soils and mosaic patterns due to drainage and landform.
- A horizon color, texture, structure, moisture, and transition data are recorded; horizon thickness and depth are documented with depth-from/to notation to minimize cumulative error.

## Data Quality, Documentation, and Governance
- Emphasizes uniformity in species nomenclature, as well as proper herbarium collection:
  - Type specimens should be collected for all species observed; label specimens with field codes and ensure flowering material when possible.
  - Use strict naming conventions and maintain a comprehensive herbarium record to support later verification.
- Documentation includes:
  - Site Description and Habitat Form
  - Plot Description and Habitat Form
  - Appendices with instructions for herbarium, plot/site forms, soil data collection, and equipment checklists.
- Data handling requires careful checking for completeness, consistent coding, and avoidance of biases in sampling point selection and plot orientation.

## Equipment and Field Logistics
- Detailed field equipment lists for mapping, sampling, soil analysis, and specimen handling:
  - Field data sheets, maps, labels, bags, and storage boxes
  - Center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings
  - Measuring tools: compass, hypsometer, tape measures, calipers
  - Tools for soil collection: mattock, trowel, auger
  - Herbarium materials: blotting paper, mounting sheets, label sticks
  - General: spare tapes, tapes, stapler, insect repellent, etc.
- Packaging: site data sheets and bryophyte/herbarium specimens organized into labeled boxes, shipped via prepaid mail to Merlewood or designated facility.

## Completion and Submission
- After collecting 4 data sets and 2 soil sample sets for 16 plots, ensure:
  - All forms are fully filled and correctly labeled with site and plot numbers
  - Samples are securely labeled and packed
  - Equipment is accounted for and returned
- Ideally, ship completed sample boxes promptly to avoid backlog and ensure data timeliness.

## Appendices and Reference Material
- Include:
  - Herbarium collection instructions with specimen handling and naming
  - Examples of completed ground flora, tree/sapling forms
  - Instructions for completing plot and site description/habitat forms
  - Soil data collection and interpretation guidance
  - Equipment checklists and sample field forms
- Codes and attribute definitions are provided across site and plot forms to enable consistent data capture and later data processing.

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- The handbook provides a rigorous, codified framework for generating a large, standardized woodland dataset.
- Emphasizes governance-ready data through explicit permissions, standardized data collection protocols, thorough metadata, and robust documentation.
- Makes explicit the need for quality control, traceability, and careful handling of specimens and soil samples to ensure dataset integrity for downstream discovery, sharing, and reuse.
