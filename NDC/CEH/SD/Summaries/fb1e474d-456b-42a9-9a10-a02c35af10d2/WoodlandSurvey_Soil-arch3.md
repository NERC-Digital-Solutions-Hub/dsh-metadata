# Woodlands Survey soil data 1971-2001

- A long-term, site-based soil and vegetation dataset from 103 broadleaved woodlands across Britain, with repeated plot-level measurements conducted in 1971 and re-surveyed in 2000/2002/2003 (referred to as 2001).
- Purpose: enable analyses of ecological change and identification of principal drivers of change, informing monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation.

## Study scope and purpose
- Baseline data collected in 1971; follow-up surveys in the early 2000s using identical field methods to enable comparability.
- Data support analyses of change in vegetation composition, soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), and associations with environmental drivers.

## Survey design and methods
- Stratified sampling across the study area.
- Field methods aligned with Bunce & Shaw’s 1973 standardized woodland survey protocol; field handbook provided.
- Site-level and plot-level descriptors recorded; consistent data collection across time.

## Data collected and structure
- Biological: plant species composition in canopy and ground flora.
- Soil: pH (1971 and 2000s), Soil Organic Matter (SOM) (1971 and 2000s); QA repeats for select measurements.
- Management and habitat descriptors; major soil group classifications (MSG), soil group (SG), soil sub-group (SSG) with corresponding textual descriptions.
- Data organized by site (codes 1–103) and plots within sites (1–16).

## Temporal coverage and data lineage
- 1971 baseline survey; resurvey in 2000/2002/2003 (referred to as 2001).
- Driver analyses incorporate explanatory variables from the survey and external sources (e.g., atmospheric deposition, climate, canopy change, management).

## Data quality, metadata, and governance
- Repeated QA measurements (pH and SOM) on archived samples to support data reliability.
- Metadata and originator details documented; includes guidance for data provenance.
- Public sharing of underlying data is a consideration; users are advised to consult the associated publications for methodology and context.

## Analytical focus and drivers
- Analyses aimed at identifying the principal drivers of ecological change over the period.
- Drivers considered include atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen, climate variation, changes in canopy structure, and woodland management practices.
