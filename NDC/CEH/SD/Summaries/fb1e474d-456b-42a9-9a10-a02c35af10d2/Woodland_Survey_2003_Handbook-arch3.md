# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Field handbook for the National Woodland Survey 2002, adapted from 1971 baseline surveys, to identify environmental health indicators for policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
  - Guidance for field teams to standardise data collection across sites, enabling consistent monitoring of woodland condition, structure, and related habitats.

- Data measures and indicators
  - Vegetation plot (ground flora)
    - Five nested quadrats within a 14.14 x 14.14 m plot; record presence/absence of vascular plants in each quadrat and estimate percent cover for the full plot.
    - Focus on common bryophytes (recorded on soil) and overall ground flora, excluding bryophytes on tree bases or non-soil habitats.
  - Trees, saplings and shrubs
    - Trees: species and DBH >5 cm recorded for stems within the plot; height of the largest tree measured (clinometer or hypsometer); multi-stemmed trees noted.
    - Saplings and shrubs: height >130 cm and <=5 cm DBH recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); same measurement conventions as trees.
    - Dead trees and regeneration data captured with specific status codes.
  - Plot description and habitats
    - Presence/absence attributes within the plot to derive habitat frequencies; detailed attribute definitions provided in appendices.
  - Soil sampling
    - Composite top 15 cm soil sample from each plot; careful on-site collection, thorough labeling, and storage; double labeling to prevent data loss.
  - Site-level and habitat descriptors
    - Site description and habitats form captures wider site context and between-plot variation; margins and boundary features documented.
  - Open, aquatic, marginal land use, human-made features, and boundary types
    - Categorised habitat types (glades, rocks, water bodies, tracks, walls, roads, railways, etc.) and boundary types (fences, walls, banks, ditches, hedges, etc.) with explicit criteria.
  - Animals and birds
    - Evidence of signs and signs of presence for various species (mammals, birds, and other signs) collected to supplement vegetation/habitat data.
  - Marginal land use (<400 m distant)
    - Record land-use categories adjacent to the woodland (e.g., woodland types, scrub, orchards, arable, pasture, heath, rivers, roads).
  - Subjective overall impression
    - Per-site qualitative assessment (e.g., suitability, overall condition) and approximate survey duration.
  - Data integrity and cross-checks
    - Ensure plot attributes align with site attributes; check for coverage gaps and logical consistency across site and plot forms.

- Sampling design and relocation
  - Each site contains 16 random sampling points; relocation is ground-truthed using scaled maps and compass-derived bearings.
  - Map-to-ground correspondence adjusted per plot due to varying enlargement scales; guidance against using GPS to avoid bias relative to 1971 plot locations.
  - Emphasis on accuracy and minimising subjective bias in plot placement; acknowledge potential changes and site alterations over 30 years (e.g., roads, motorways encroaching).
  - If a plot location is now inaccessible, note the land-use change rather than recording, but still collect data where permitted.

- Field workflow and data collection
  - Pre-field preparations
    - Provision of site/location maps, site sketches, landowner introduction letter, equipment lists, and standardized forms.
    - Ensure all teams use consistent methods and equipment; CEH can supply specific tools (girth tapes, sighting poles) as needed.
  - Data collection sequence
    - Vegetation plot (ground flora) recorded first to capture near-undisturbed state, followed by trees, saplings, shrubs, plot descriptors, and soil sampling.
  - Recording forms and coding
    - Four main data forms per plot: Vegetation plot; Site description and habitats; Trees, saplings and shrubs; Plot description and habitat data.
    - One site-level form per site; two soil samples per site (across plots) and one site-level soil dispatch protocol.
    - Use pencil for field forms on waterproof paper; track quadrat numbers and % cover with standardized coding; ensure compatibility of site and plot attribute codes.
  - Soil sampling and handling
    - Collect top 15 cm soil per plot, remove litter or rocks as needed, and label bags with site and plot identifiers; store samples cooled and labeled for transport to CEH Merlewood.
  - Completion and data integrity
    - Post-survey checks ensure all forms are completed, samples logged, and equipment accounted for; data and metadata prepared for entry; site-level and plot-level data reviewed for consistency.
  - Data sharing and stakeholder engagement
    - Landowners receive a copy of the results (1971 and 2002) to facilitate transparency; underlying data should be shared appropriately, aligning with governance and data openness standards.

- Appendices and practical details
  - Appendix IV provides detailed attribute codes and definitions for site and plot forms, enabling cross-site data integration.
  - Appendix II and Appendix III illustrate example data structures for vegetation plots and tree data, with fields for species, height, DBH, and regeneration.
  - Appendix V lists required field equipment and per-site/per-plot data collection items.
  - Appendix VI outlines soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, loss on ignition), including sample preparation and measurement steps.

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - Data gaps and data quality
    - The manual acknowledges potential data gaps due to access, permissions, or site changes; explicit notes on altered land-use are encouraged to interpret results accurately.
  - Data governance and openness
    - While sharing with landowners is encouraged, the handbook emphasizes standardized data collection and clear record-keeping to support transparent data governance and reproducibility.
  - Methodological safeguards
    - Strict relocation procedures aim to minimise bias and ensure comparability across survey cycles; non-GPS relocation reduces bias relative to historic plotting.
  - Safety and realism
    - Survey teams are advised to proceed sensibly, avoid restricted areas, and prioritise safety when encountering changed landscape or permissions issues.

- Outcome and application
  - The collected data provide a rich, multi-layered dataset of woodland structure, ground flora, soils, and habitats to support environmental health monitoring, policy evaluation, and future decision-making related to woodland health and management.
