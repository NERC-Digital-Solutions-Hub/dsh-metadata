# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Provides a standardized field methodology for surveying woodlands, including permissions, site selection, data collection, and data handling to support national woodland classification and habitat description.
- Aims to produce comprehensive, comparable data across many sites (1648 plots mentioned) to enable later analysis and data-products for use by researchers and managers.

## Data collection framework and workflow

- Preparation and access
  - Develop a survey plan to minimize travel and accommodate access restrictions; obtain site permissions as required.
  - Emphasizes good public relations; inform landowners about purpose and limitations (no intention to purchase unless specified).
- Site and plot structure
  - Each site includes multiple plots; primary sampling points are mapped on a 22" site map with 16 sampling points per plot.
  - Nested plot layout begins with a 2 x 2 m plot, expanding to larger plots up to 10 x 10 m; the 14.14 m square (14.14 x 14.14 m) is a key full-plot size.
  - Location accuracy target: within a 20 m radius of true point, using predetermined control points and compass bearings; avoid bias and maintain track of procedures.
- Data collection order and organization
  - Data are collected in four major groups per sampling point, with two sets of samples per point: ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitats, and soil data.
  - An organization chart (Figure 1) describes responsibility for recording and data flow across survey teams.

## Data types and measurements

- Ground flora
  - Record presence/absence of species in five progressively larger quadrats (starting at 2 x 2 m, up to 14.14 x 14.14 m); estimate cover/abundance for the largest quadrat.
  - Comprehensive bryophyte sampling is collected from the full plot; more detailed bryophyte data are not subdivided by quadrat size.
  - Specimens for herbarium (Appendix I) collected for verification; specimens labeled with field identifications and codes.
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Trees: measure all stems > 5 cm DBH; record species and diameter, in all four quadrants; dead trees/stems are flagged (D) in the data sheet.
  - Saplings and shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); measure DBH and height for standardization; note dead or stumped individuals.
  - Height of the tallest tree in the plot is measured with a provided height instrument.
- Plot description and habitats
  - Record attributes such as slope (degrees), aspect, and a detailed ground-habitat description.
  - Complete a plot-level habitat description with a structured attribute set (Appendix IV) and a sketch/diagram of the slope profile.
- Soil data
  - Limited, standardized soil measurements chosen for scalability across many plots: pH, loss on ignition (LOI), and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay percentages).
  - Soil samples collected from the plot center (and near the pit) with a small pit opened to expose the top ~25–30 cm; composite sample of the top 10–15 cm collected.
  - Profiles are interpreted using a horizon-based framework (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C) with detailed attribute recording (texture, structure, colour, moisture, etc.) to support later numerical analysis.
  - If deeper horizons are inaccessible, recording notes are added to bracket uncertainties.
- Site description and habitats (whole site)
  - A separate Site Description and Habitats form captures site-wide attributes and inter-plot context, including marginal land use and boundary types.

## Data management, coding, and quality

- Forms and coding
  - Data are entered on standardized forms with code numbers for attributes; site and plot numbers (Site No., Plot No.) are critical for data integrity.
  - Office-use codes (e.g., Code No) facilitate later data punching and data integration.
- Herbarium and specimen handling
  - Each site/plot requires a herbarium collection to demonstrate species accuracy; specimens are attached to herbarium sheets with clear labeling and codes.
- Data completion and checks
  - After data collection, forms are checked for completeness and consistency; samples are securely packed and logged before shipment.
  - The workflow emphasizes thoroughness (data being collected “forever”) and minimizes lost data or unpacked equipment.
- Data packaging and shipping
  - Site sheets, soil samples, bryophyte samples, and herbarium specimens are organized into boxes with secure labeling; pre-paid shipping arrangements are provided.

## Practical guidance and challenges

- Location accuracy and bias avoidance
  - The locating method prioritizes accuracy and avoidance of subjective bias; use of control points and careful pacing is stressed, especially on sloped terrain.
- Permissions and owner relations
  - Use tact and common sense when seeking access; if permission is refused, alternative sites are available; owners’ concerns about fences, privacy, or game shooting are acknowledged.
- Time and data consideration
  - Acknowledges that understanding the ask and aligning with data needs can take substantial time; emphasizes the importance of clear communication and stakeholder buy-in.
- Data scope and complexity
  - The program balances a broad data scope (multiple habitats, soil types, flora and fauna indicators) with the practicalities of field-scale data collection across many plots.

## Appendices and tools of the methodology

- Appendix I–VI
  - Appendix I: Instructions for herbarium specimen collection
  - Appendix II–III: Examples of completed ground flora and tree/sapling forms
  - Appendix IV: Detailed instructions for completing plot and site description/habitat forms
  - Appendix V: Instructions for collecting soil data and completing soil forms
  - Appendix VI: Equipment checklists
- Field equipment and forms
  - Detailed lists of field tools, including plotting equipment, sample bags, labels, tapes, compasses, and plant identification aids.
  - The equipment and forms are designed to standardize data collection and support subsequent data analysis and comparison.

## Outputs, potential data products, and impact

- Rich, standardized woodland dataset
  - Enables cross-site comparability of ground flora, tree regeneration, habitat attributes, soil profiles, and site descriptions.
- Data products for end users
  - Dashboards, summary reports, and self-serve data exploration tools can be built from the coded, hierarchical data (site, plot, and point level).
- Verification and quality assurance
  - Herbarium specimens and documented protocols act as quality controls to validate species records and habitat interpretations.
- Long-term value
  - Data collected through this handbook can inform woodland management, conservation planning, and habitat classification at a regional/national level.
