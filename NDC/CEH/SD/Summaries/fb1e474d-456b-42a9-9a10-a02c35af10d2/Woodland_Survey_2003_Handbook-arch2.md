# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

## Aim and scope
- Provide a consistent, time-series style demonstration of environmental condition to enable scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.
- Deliver standardized, auditable datasets of woodland indicators for monitoring bodies with defined responsibilities.

## Who role this document serves
- Field teams and analysts conducting woodland monitoring under established contracts and responsibilities.
- Emphasizes topic familiarity and analytical use of standardised methods rather than deep, bespoke data exploration.
- Focuses on ensuring data are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## How data are collected and validated
- Data are validated from established sources, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed for outputs such as classifications of environmental health against standards.
- Emphasises use of consistent equipment and methods across survey teams; encourages complete, well-documented datasets.

## Survey design and site/plot structure
- Each site comprises 16 randomly located plots within a defined area, plus a detailed site description.
- Data collection occurs for four datasets per plot (vegetation plot, site description/habitats, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description and habitats) plus a soil sample per plot.
- A site-level description form captures broader habitat and site context.

## Field methods and relocation
- Detailed procedures for locating and relocating the 16 plots on ground using multiple maps (1:50,000 and 2½" equivalents); GPS is discouraged to avoid bias relative to historical 1971 mappings.
- Relocation relies on map-to-ground scaling, compass bearings, pacing, and distance/angle measurements; aims to minimize subjective bias.
- Observers must obtain landowner permission and document ownership details; letters of introduction are provided to facilitate negotiations.

## Data collection workflow and form structure
- Vegetation plot (ground flora): study across five nested quadrats from 2x2 m to 14.14x14.14 m; record presence/absence of species, then compute % cover for the full plot; prioritise common bryophytes on soil; document in a standardized Q-notation system.
- Trees, saplings, and shrubs: record species and DBH (>5 cm for trees; height for saplings >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; diagonally opposite plot quarters for saplings/shrubs); height measurement methods include clinometer or hypsometer; dead trees marked accordingly.
- Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined attributes to capture habitat structure and landscape features; detailed definitions in Appendix IV.
- Soil sampling: composite 0–15 cm sample per plot; label bags on-site; ensure representative sampling and proper storage for transport to CEH Merlewood.

## Data handling, quality control and consistency
- Emphasises cross-checks: ensure all four data sheets per plot, plus soil samples, are completed; verify site and plot identifiers; ensure no omissions in major fields.
- Encourages field sketches and owner-sourced notes to aid interpretation; notes potential changes in land use over 30 years (e.g., sites bisected by infrastructure).
- Documents potential logical inconsistencies between site and plot forms and requires reconciliation.

## Equipment, logistics and data management
- Appendix V lists field equipment (maps, marking tools, tapes, soil bags, labeling, PPE, etc.).
- Appendix VI outlines soil analysis protocols (pH, LOI) and sample handling.
- Emphasises timely shipment of soil samples to CEH Merlewood (ideally within a week) and practical courier/logistics planning.

## Data products and appendices
- Appendix I–II: Bryophyte checklists and vegetation plot templates; provide common species references for consistent recording.
- Appendix III: Template for trees, saplings, and shrub data.
- Appendix IV: Site description and habitat form instructions and attribute definitions.
- Appendix V: Field equipment inventory.
- Appendix VI: Laboratory protocols for soil analysis (pH, moisture loss on ignition).

## Practical considerations and safety
- Field work emphasizes safety: avoid surveying on built-up railway or motorway areas without permission; survey teams should remain safe and viable in the field.
- Acknowledges that plots may have changed substantially since 1971; recording should proceed where permission exists, with notes on land-use change.
