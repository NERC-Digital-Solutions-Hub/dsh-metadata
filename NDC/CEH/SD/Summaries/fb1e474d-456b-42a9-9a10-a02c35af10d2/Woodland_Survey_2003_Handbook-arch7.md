# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and origin
  - Field handbook for the National Woodland Survey 2002; adapted from the 1971 GB woodland survey.
  - Defines methods for surveying woodlands, recording vegetation, structure, soils, and site description to support GIS-based data products and map visualisations.

- Survey design and scope
  - Per site: 16 random sampling plots within the woodland, with 1:50,000 maps and a site sketch showing plot locations.
  - Age, structure, and habitat information collected across four data sets per plot plus a site-level description.
  - Relocation and accuracy emphasis: prioritize map-based location with minimal subjective bias; GPS discouraged due to potential bias relative to 1971 plot locations.
  - Mobility and safety: acknowledge potential land-use changes (e.g., motorways) and do not record plots on land without permission.

- Location, permissions, and logistics
  - Surveyors must obtain access permissions; a letter of introduction explains the project and proceedings.
  - Landowner contact details captured on Site Description sheet.
  - Tools and maps provided; ensure consistent methods across teams; permission often obtainable within half a day.

- Plot layout and relocation approach
  - Each site has a complete set of 16 plot locations arranged on enlarged site maps; distances scaled to ground using compass bearing and pace.
  - Plot center and corners defined with a 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m²) plot, oriented to cardinal directions.
  - No permanent markers; relocation relies on map-to-ground correspondence and pacing.

- Data collection order and forms
  - Four data sets per plot, each with its own recording form:
    - Vegetation plot: Ground flora within five nested quadrats (2 x 2 m up to 14.14 x 14.14 m); presence/absence and % cover of vascular plants; major bryophytes on soil recorded; “Other species” field for unidentified taxa.
    - Site description and habitats: site-wide attributes and habitat characteristics; presence/absence data with a comments field.
    - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, DBH (>5 cm for trees), height for saplings (>130 cm, <5 cm DBH); quadrants 1 and 3 for saplings and shrubs; dead trees marked; largest tree height measured with clinometer/hypsometer.
    - Plot description and habitats: attribute-frequency data for plot-level habitat features.
  - Soil sampling: one composite soil sample per plot from surface (0–15 cm); top 15 cm exposed, debris removed; double-labeling to avoid misidentification; samples bagged and stored for transport.

- Recording process and data quality
  - Vegetation ground flora surveyed first to minimize disturbance.
  - Use clutch pencils; waterproof recording forms; entries made on-site.
  - Data are captured on three main forms per site and plot, plus a site-level form; internal consistency checks between site and plot forms.
  - Site-level and plot-level codes are distinct but related; cross-checks ensure no omissions.

- Vegetation and habitat specifics
  - Ground flora: presence/absence across five quadrats; % cover estimates to nearest 5%; categories for abundant vs. sparse occurrence; canopy cover excluded from ground flora.
  - Trees, saplings, shrubs: DBH, height, species; multi-stemmed individuals recorded with separate stems; dead trees indicated; height measurement requires consistent method and slope correction if needed.
  - Habitat descriptions: detailed categories for rocks, water bodies, open habitats, human-made features, vegetation assemblages, marginal lands, and other features; both plot-based and site-based attributes documented.

- Site and plot documentation
  - Site Description form captures: site number, plot numbers, recorder, date, slope, aspect, and a range of habitat attributes.
  - Plant management and habitat codes include planted vs. naturally regenerated trees, coppice status, regeneration (>25 cm height and <5 cm DBH), and dead/tree vitality indicators.
  - Open, human, vegetation, aquatic, and marginal habitat categories defined with explicit criteria to support consistent GIS attribute coding.

- Soil analysis and lab procedures
  - Soil samples analyzed for pH and loss on ignition (LOI) to determine moisture and organic matter content.
  - Standard lab protocol: sieving, distillation of moisture, oven-drying, muffle-ashing; pH measured in dilute solution.
  - Protocols provide step-by-step instructions to ensure replicability and compatibility with GIS-linked metadata.

- Appendices and data standards (content overview)
  - Appendix Ia/Ib: bryophyte species lists (pilot and GB-wide) for ecological context and plant indicators.
  - Appendix II: vegetation plot data template (example entries and fields for ground flora).
  - Appendix III: tree, sapling, and shrub data templates (species, DBH, height, recorder, date).
  - Appendix IV: site and plot description forms; detailed attribute definitions and coding schemes.
  - Appendix V: field equipment list and per-site logistics (permissions, maps, letters).
  - Appendix VI: soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH, LOI) with procedural steps and calculations.

- Practical implications for GIS use
  - Data are structured around site and plot codes, enabling geospatial mapping of 16 plots per site and site-wide habitat attributes.
  - Explicit guidance on data quality, relocation bias, and changes in land use over 30 years, which affect temporal GIS analyses.
  - Rich attribute sets across multiple layers (ground flora, tree structure, habitats, soils) suitable for GIS-based analysis, visualization, and change detection.
  - Appendices provide standardized templates and coding schemes to ensure consistent data capture and interoperability with GIS datasets.

- Endnotes and data handling
  - Soil samples to be dispatched to CEH Merlewood within a week where possible; strict labeling and packaging to prevent data loss.
  - Field course guidance emphasizes comprehensive data collection and consistency to preserve long-term utility of the dataset.
