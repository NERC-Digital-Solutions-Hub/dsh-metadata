# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose: Provide standardized field procedures to survey and classify woodlands, recording detailed plot- and site-level data to enable analysis, comparisons, and modeling of woodland habitats and management needs.
- Scope: Includes methods for permission and planning, locating sampling points, recording data across multiple data forms, herbarium collection, soil sampling and interpretation, and site/habitat descriptions.

## Survey Planning and Access

- Develop an operational plan to minimize travel and accommodate site access constraints; survey multiple sites from shared bases when efficient.
- Obtain landowner permissions or use pre-arranged access; maintain good public relations to avoid resistance and to reassure owners the work is for conservation, not purchase.
- If permission is refused, use backup sites and coordinate with Merlewood for information and samples.
- Prepare and maintain a full equipment set and maps; ensure permission status and access details are documented.

## Site Access and Locating Sampling Points

- Sites are located using 1" Ordnance Survey and 22" site maps; each site contains 16 sampling points (numbered 1–16) on the 22" map.
- Process to locate points aims for accuracy within 20 m of true location and aims to avoid subjective bias.
- Use a control point, orient the map with compass, measure a bearing to the sample point, pace out distance, and physically locate the control point on the ground.
- Use predetermined paces and fixed ground-based procedures to minimize bias; avoid crossing fences or disturbing nearby landowners.

## Order of Recording Data and Plot Layout

- Data for each sampling point collected in four sets and two soil samples:
  - (a) Ground flora: presence/absence in five nested quadrats with percent cover estimates; collect bryophytes comprehensively from the full plot; herbarium specimens as needed.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: record species and diameter at breast height (DBH) for trees >5 cm; record saplings <5 cm DBH in diagonally opposite plot quarters; record height of the largest tree.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes; compile a concise plot-level habitat profile.
  - (d) Soil data: center-of-plot sampling with a small pit and auger borings; a composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm) plus horizon data.
- Plot layout: start with 2x2 m plots, expanding in 2x2 m increments out to 14.14x14.14 m, using corner pegs and distance strings; ensure full coverage of the 14.14 m plot before moving outward.

## Data Recording Details

- Ground Flora (a): search and record all ground flora species within each quadrat size; identify species with field codes or herbarium references; note bryophytes comprehensively on soil and ground flora but not on trees; collect unidentified or rare specimens for herbarium (with proper labeling).
- Trees, Saplings, Shrubs (b): record trees >5 cm DBH in all four quadrants; record saplings and shrubs only in quarters 1 and 3; include live and dead individuals; measure height of the tallest tree; note multi-stemmed individuals and coppice indicators.
- Plot Description and Habitats (c): document slope, aspect, boundary features, and other attributes using a standardized attribute system; provide a ground-profile sketch and a concise habitat description.
- Soil Data (d): collect small pit and auger samples from center; obtain 10–15 cm composite sample; interpret horizon types (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) and record horizon depths and properties using the prescribed attribute codes.
- Data quality: prioritize recording all relevant species and habitat features; verify site and plot numbers; check equipment and samples at completion; ensure data are comprehensive and ready for long-term use.

## Site Description and Habitat Forms

- Two primary forms per site: Site Description and Habitats (full) and Plot Description and Habitats (reduced).
- Each site yields one Site Description form; each plot yields a corresponding Plot Description form.
- Codes link Site and Plot forms to maintain data integrity; cross-check for logical consistency between site and plot attributes.

## Herbarium and Specimen Collection

- Collect a type specimen for all species when possible, including flowering material for accurate later identification.
- Attach clear species names or codes to specimens; ensure specimens are labeled and stored with corresponding field data.
- Handled specimens are to be filed in a standardized herbarium sheet system and delivered for verification.

## Soil Data: Rationale and Methods

- Rationale: a large survey (1648 plots) requires a practical, scalable soil data approach beyond full laboratory analyses.
- Approach: combine limited physical/chemical measurements (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) with a numerical, horizon-based soil description.
- Pedology context: classification emphasizes podzolic and calcareous soils; horizon naming follows Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C with explicit guidance on interpretation (humus types Mull, Mor, MODER; gleyed horizons; horizon transitions).
- Practical sampling: dig a shallow pit (about 30 cm if possible) or use an auger to reach horizons; describe horizons with depth to/from (cm), not just thickness; note moisture and color, structure, texture, and presence of mineral vs organic material.
- Documentation: fill horizon-specific attributes (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) and underlying material; provide notes for uncertain or disturbed profiles; attach 2 soil sample forms for reference.

## Data Handling, Packaging, and Delivery

- After completing forms and obtaining samples, perform final checks to ensure no omissions; record and label samples clearly.
- Pack soil and bryophyte samples into dedicated boxes; ensure boxes are not over-weight; label and seal for postage.
- Ship samples using prepaid, labeled packaging to Merlewood; maintain a forwarding address and ensure samples travel with proper documentation.
- Data are intended to be stored as a long-term resource; emphasize comprehensive data capture beyond immediate needs.

## Appendices, Forms, and Equipment

- Appendices provide:
  - Herbarium collection procedures and examples of completed forms.
  - Instructions for completing plot and site description/habitat forms.
  - Additional soil data collection instructions and horizon interpretation.
  - Equipment checklists and field gear arrangements.
- Field equipment list includes plotting gear, compasses, tapes, augers, mattocks, trowels, labels, specimen bags, and packaging.

## Analytical Implications for Data-Driven Decision Making

- The handbook creates a rigorous, repeatable dataset at multiple spatial scales (plot and site) suitable for correlational analyses, pattern detection, and predictive modeling related to woodland structure, habitat types, soil associations, and management impacts.
- Standardized coding and forms enable cross-site comparability and integration into larger datasets, supporting transparency, replication, and meta-analyses.
- While detailed, the methodology acknowledges practical constraints (limited lab analyses, scale considerations) and emphasizes data quality, provenance, and metadata to support robust analysis and interpretation.
