# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Field handbook for National Woodland Survey 2002; builds on 1971 GB woodland survey.
  - Provides standardized methods to locate woods, obtain permissions, record site and plot data, collect soil samples, and prepare data for analysis and dissemination.
  - Aims to produce self-serve data products (dashboards, tables, reports) while ensuring data quality and comparability over time.

- Study design and data collected
  - Per site: survey of 16 plots distributed across the site; per site, a single site description/habitat form plus 16 plot data sheets.
  - Plot layout: 14.14 m x 14.14 m (200 m2) with four corner posts; inner quadrats defined to capture ground flora across five progressively larger quadrats (including the full plot). Focus on presence/absence of species and, for the full plot, percent cover.
  - Vegetation data (ground flora)
    - Presence/absence of vascular plants in quadrats; common bryophytes recorded (major bryophytes only).
    - Abundance estimates for the full plot (% cover, nearest 5%), with categories for abundant/minor/common species.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs
    - Trees: species and DBH (>5 cm); each stem measured if multi-stemmed; dead trees marked; largest tree height recorded.
    - Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite plot quarters (1 NE, 3 SW).
    - Shrubs: recorded in same diagonally opposite quarters as saplings; data include species and DBH where applicable.
    - Height measurement methods: clinometer or hypsometer; calibration with a hygrometer if provided.
  - Plot description and habitats
    - Presence/absence of predefined habitat attributes within the 14.14 m plot; frequency data aimed at capturing common site characteristics.
    - Appendix IV defines attributes and methods; comments allow capturing additional interpretive information.
  - Soil sampling
    - Composite soil sample per plot from the center, top 15 cm; labeled and double-labeled in field; stored in cool location until return.
    - Soil bags and boxes organized per site; aim to dispatch within a week of sampling.
  - Site-level data
    - A separate site description and habitats form documents broader site characteristics and between-plot context.
  - Data capture and forms
    - Use pencil on waterproof forms; ensure page and form completeness; sample data organized per site and per plot.

- Data collection methods and quality control
  - Location and relocation
    - Ground points located using provided maps; emphasize accuracy and avoidance of subjective bias; GPS discouraged to prevent relocation bias.
    - Relocation through pacing along compass bearings using map scaling; awareness that 30-year site changes may occur.
  - Permissions and access
    - Surveyors must obtain land access permissions; a letter of introduction is provided; landowner contact information recorded with site results.
  - Data integrity and consistency
    - Four data sets per plot (vegetation, site description/habitat, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitat) plus a soil sample.
    - Cross-checks for logical consistency between site and plot forms; ensure all major items are captured and site coverage is complete.
    - Standardized attribute coding and place-related notes to facilitate later data merging and analysis.
  - Documentation and outputs
    - Field sketches and site descriptors recommended for field use; notes from landowner conversations optional but potentially helpful for interpretation.
    - Outputs designed to be shared with landowners and included in data entry for analysis.

- Data handling, storage, and delivery
  - Data organization
    - Tables and forms coded with site and plot identifiers; codes are kept separate but compatible across site and plot forms to enable integrated analysis.
  - Sample handling
    - Soil samples dispatched to CEH Merlewood; proper labeling and cool storage emphasized; shipping options coordinated with field teams.
  - Back-end data readiness
    - Appendices provide standardized templates (vegetation plot, tree data, site/habitat forms) to support uniform data entry and eventual data products.

- Appendices, templates, and protocols (data standards and reuse)
  - Appendix II: Vegetation Plot data template (ground flora) including species presence across quadrats, % cover, and miscellaneous categories.
  - Appendix III: Tree, sapling, and shrub data template (species, DBH, height, plot/quadrant placement, dead/live status).
  - Appendix IV: Site Description and Habitats forms; detailed attribute definitions and coding to standardize site-level data.
  - Appendix V: Field equipment list and per-site data collection essentials.
  - Appendix VI: Soil analysis protocols (laboratory procedures for pH and loss on ignition) used for post-field analysis.

- Outputs and data use for Data Support
  - Data products include:
    - Site-level habitat and landscape context.
    - Plot-level vegetation composition, dominance, and ground flora structure.
    - Tree and regeneration structure (DBH distributions, height, and regeneration indicators).
    - Soil properties (pH, moisture indicators) and sample metadata.
  - Designed to support broader policy analysis, trend comparison with 1971 baseline, and public-facing data sharing.
  - Emphasis on data quality, standardization, and documentation to enable reuse across sites and over time.
