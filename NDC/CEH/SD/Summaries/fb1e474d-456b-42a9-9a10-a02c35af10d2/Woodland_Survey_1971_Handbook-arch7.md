NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview
- A comprehensive field manual for surveying and classifying woodlands, focusing on map-based data products suitable for GIS viewers (policy, clients, public).
- Documents procedures for planning surveys, obtaining access, locating sampling points, recording plot/site data, and interpreting soil profiles.
- Covers ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot descriptions, habitats, soil data, site descriptions, herbarium specimens, and equipment.
- Emphasizes standardized forms, coding, data quality, and iterative feedback to improve data usability.

## GIS-focused aims and data structure
- Data products are map-oriented, enabling spatial understanding and exploration of woodland features.
- Uses standardized recording forms with codes to facilitate data punching into GIS-friendly databases.
- Data collected at two levels: site (whole-wood description) and plots within sites (16 plots per site in a fixed layout).
- Site and plot descriptions, habitat attributes, soil profiles, and vegetation data designed for integration into spatial analyses and thematic maps.

## Survey planning and permissions
- Prepare an outline plan to minimize travel, select efficient base sites, and coordinate with Regional Staff.
- Obtain permission to enter survey sites; use tact and public relations to reassure landowners about objectives (not purchase or compulsory control).
- If permission is denied, switch to backup sites and inform Merlewood with contact details for onward arrangements.
- Carry maps (Ordnance Survey), and plan access points to reduce walking distance while respecting landowners’ boundaries.

## Locating sampling points
- Each site has 16 sampling points marked on a 22" map; accuracy targeted within a 20 m radius on the ground.
- Procedure emphasizes minimizing subjective bias in point location; use a control ground point, orient the map, take a bearing, and pace out distances.
- Ground-based approach relies on predetermined, mechanical procedures rather than ad hoc choices to ensure reproducibility.

## Order of data collection
- Four data sets and two sample series per sampling point:
  - Ground flora presence/absence across five quadrat sizes with percent cover estimates.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs with species and DBH/height data (quarters recorded; dead trees noted).
  - Plot description and habitat attributes (presence/absence of defined features).
  - Soil data from a central pit and auger borings; composite surface sample from 10–15 cm.
- Data collection order prioritizes ground flora first to minimize disturbance, followed by trees/shrubs and soil data; site-level data collected after plot data.

## Plot layout and data recording
- Plot center established; a right-angle gauge randomizes orientation; corner poles mark successive plot boundaries from 2x2 m up to 10x10 m.
- Ground flora: search area within each plot for vascular plants and bryophytes; bryophytes collected comprehensively but not tallied by every quadrat size.
- Trees/saplings/shrubs: measure stems >5 cm (trees); saplings and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters; tallest tree height recorded with a measuring instrument.
- Plot description and habitats: record presence/absence of attributes; provide a ground-profile sketch and a short description of slope and aspect.

## Site Description and Habitats
- Separate Site Description and Habitats form (and a reduced Plot Description form) to capture site-wide context and between-plot variation.
- Forms use sequential attribute codes; ensure internal consistency between site and plot forms (some attributes are all-or-nothing).
- Completion involves compiling four data sheets per site, plus 16 plot records, plus site-level habitat data.

## Herbarium specimens
- Collect and submit herbarium specimens for all species observed; aim to obtain flowering material where possible.
- Label specimens with field identifications (including codes) and prepare specimens for later verification to ensure data accuracy.

## Soil data: collection, interpretation, and recording
- Acknowledge constraints of large surveys; use a limited set of physical/chemical measurements plus a coded, descriptive soil profile.
- Key measurements: pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay); retained sub-samples for potential future analyses.
- Soil profile interpreted through horizon-based method:
  - Ao (litter/organic layer) and Al (organic-mineral mix) horizons; presence/absence and moisture; horizon thickness and color.
  - A2 horizon (eluviation) and B horizon (deposition and weathering); possible subdivisions (B1, B2) with corresponding attributes.
  - Underlying material (C) for parent material; depth limits noted when auger depth is reached.
- Detailed horizon descriptions include color, texture, structure, moisture, evidence of gleying, and presence of organic/inorganic materials.
- Emphasizes documenting horizons accurately, noting transitions, and using diagrams for complex profiles when needed.

## Data quality, handling, and packaging
- After completing plots, conduct a quick quality check to ensure all forms are filled, site/plot numbers are correct, and samples are accounted for.
- Pack soil and bryophyte samples into specified boxes, label clearly, and dispatch promptly.
- Public relations and safeguarding of data quality are stressed; forethought about data completeness is considered critical as data are intended for long-term use.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Detailed field equipment list (two haversacks, compasses, tapes, plotting gear, auger, trowel, herbarium materials, labels, etc.).
- Instructions for transporting, labeling, and handling both field and soil/bryophyte samples.
- Appendices provide exemplars of completed forms, herbarium instructions, and checklists for equipment.

## Management context and interpretation
- Provides management-oriented classifications to differentiate planted and natural woodlands (e.g., planted hardwoods, conifers, coppice forms).
- Includes guidance on distinguishing plantation, coppice origins, and signs of historical management, which informs habitat and vegetation mapping in GIS.

## Key GIS implications
- Data are designed for spatial analysis: site-level habitat types, plot-level vegetation, soil types, feature boundaries, and marginal land use.
- The document outlines a repeatable data collection protocol with clear coding to support GIS data models and time-series analyses.
- Emphasizes baseline, standardized data capture, enabling map-based visualization of woodland structure, habitat diversity, soil types, and land-use context.
- Appendices and forms provide blueprints for integrating field observations into GIS-driven woodland classification and decision-support products.
