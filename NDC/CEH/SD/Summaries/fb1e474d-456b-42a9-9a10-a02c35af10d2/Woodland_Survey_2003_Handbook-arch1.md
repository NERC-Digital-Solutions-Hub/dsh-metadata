# Woodland Indicators: analysis of field survey National Woodland Survey 2002 Field Handbook Amended by K Kirby, S M Smart and H I J Black. Adapted from original text by M W Shaw and R G H Bunce for the 1971 baseline broadleaved woodland survey of GB.

## Aim and scope
- Provides a standardized, repeatable methodology to collect and record woodland indicators for the National Woodland Survey 2002.
- Combines field survey techniques with data recording forms to enable analysis, correlation identification, and predictive insights about woodland condition and change.
- Emphasizes data provenance, quality assurance, and the creation of metadata-enabled datasets for future reuse.

## Survey design and data framework
- Per site: 1 Site Description and Habitat Form plus 16 plots, each with three data datasets plus a soil sample.
- Datasets per plot:
  - Vegetation plot: Ground flora (presence/absence across five nested quadrats with percent cover estimates for the full plot).
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species, DBH for trees (>5 cm), heights, and sampling in designated plot quarters.
  - Plot description and habitat data: presence/absence of habitat attributes with frequency-oriented data.
  - Soil sampling: composite soil sample from plot center (top 15 cm).
- Per site: whole-site description and habitat form.
- Data handling: emphasis on consistent coding, cross-checks between plot and site forms, and ensuring no gaps in crucial attributes.

## Access, permissions, and logistics
- Surveyors must obtain permission to access each woodland site; letters of introduction and owner contact details provided to facilitate negotiations.
- Documentation and maps supplied (site location maps, enlarged plot maps, original maps) to locate and relocate plots with minimal bias.
- Ground truthing acknowledged: sites may have changed since 1971; note and record changes or avoid surveying areas with no permission.

## Location and relocation of sampling points
- 16 random sampling points per site, marked on provided maps; relocation relies on compass and distance/angle from site map.
- Key priorities in relocation:
  - Accuracy of ground location.
  - Absence of subjective bias (avoid selecting seemingly more “typical” spots).
- GPS use is discouraged to reduce bias and misalignment with 1971 plotting.
- Relocation method uses a scaled map-to-ground approach; large interspersed sites may require adaptation due to 30+ year changes.

## Order of data collection and data integrity
- One site description/habitat form plus four data sets (plots) to be completed per site (16 plots per site total) and one soil sample per plot.
- Recording forms are designed to minimize missing data; deliberate sequencing to survey the ground flora first to capture an undisturbed state.
- Field forms are designed with practical tools (pencils, waterproof paper) and include guidance for identifying and handling uncertain identifications.

## Vegetation plot: Ground flora (2.1)
- Plot layout: large 14.14 m x 14.14 m plot delineated by corner posts; inner 2 m, 4 m, and 6 m quadrats nested within the plot are recorded sequentially (quads 1–5).
- Data capture: presence/absence of all vascular plants in each quadrat; use Q codes for species occurrences; “Other species” field for unidentified or supplementary records.
- Bryophytes: record only common bryophytes on soil; list provided in Appendix I.
- Abundance: estimate percent cover for the full plot with 5% increments; lower-frequency species may be recorded with scale indicators (1%, +, etc.).
- Canopy not recorded at this stage; focus remains on ground layer and bryophyte presence on soil.

## Trees, saplings, and shrubs (2.2)
- Trees: stems >5 cm DBH; record species and DBH for all stems within the 14.14 m plot; multi-stemmed individuals counted per stem but bracketed on sheet.
- Saplings: height >130 cm but <5 cm DBH; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 NE, 3 SW).
- Shrubs: same criteria as saplings; recorded in diagonally opposite quarters.
- Height measurement: largest tree height measured with clinometer, Abney level, or hypsometer; horizontal distance along a consistent contour must be used to compute height; calibration notes required if alternative methods used.
- Dead trees: marked with a D in the height/DBH cell.
- Data capture: per-plot, per-quartile records; ensures consistent spatially explicit data.

## Plot description and habitats (2.3)
- Focus on presence/absence of habitat attributes within the plot for frequency-type data.
- Appendix IV provides definitions; for larger habitats, partial presence within the plot qualifies as present.
- Comments field to capture additional interpretable notes not covered by standard attributes.

## Soil sampling (2.4)
- Aim: obtain a representative composite soil sample from the plot center (top 15 cm).
- Handling: label bags with site and plot; double labeling recommended; store in corresponding site boxes.
- Method specifics: remove fresh litter, stones, and excess rock as needed; sample within 1 m of plot center; document any sampling difficulties or deviations.
- If sampling is not possible, note reasons and sample from the nearest point within 1 m distance.

## Completion of the plot and site (2.5, 3.1)
- Post-survey checks: ensure all forms are complete and correctly labeled; collect soil samples and equipment; verify site-wide and plot-specific data alignment.
- Site-level data: complete site description and habitat form for the whole site; ensure no unrecorded areas within the site boundary.
- Documentation: all sheets stapled and filed for data entry; data integrity emphasized.

## Data management, provenance, and dissemination
- Emphasizes tracking data sources, maintaining metadata, and ensuring datasets created are discoverable and usable (per the archetype’s focus on data access and quality).
- Encourages the creation of a standardized dataset structure to support cross-site analyses and long-term comparability.

## Appendices, equipment, and laboratory protocols
- Appendix I–II: lists of common bryophytes and regional bryophyte flora to aid identifications in the field.
- Appendix III–IV: detailed data forms for trees, regeneration, dead trees, epiphytes, habitats, and site descriptions.
- Appendix V: field equipment list, per-site and per-plot requirements, including permission letters, maps, poles, compasses, DBH tapes, soil bags, labeling, and protective gear.
- Appendix VI: soil analysis laboratory protocols (pH measurement, LOI, and related procedures) and sample preparation, enabling data to be linked with lab results for richer analyses.

## Data considerations and challenges for analysts
- Recognize potential data gaps due to site changes since 1971 and the need to document land-use changes.
- Consider data standardization across plots and sites to enable robust cross-site comparisons and model development.
- Be mindful of potential biases in relocation, sampling accessibility, and owner permissions; the methodology emphasizes minimizing these biases and documenting any deviations.
- Data capture is designed to support future modelling, trend analysis, and habitat/vegetation change assessments by providing structured, codified datasets with rich metadata.
