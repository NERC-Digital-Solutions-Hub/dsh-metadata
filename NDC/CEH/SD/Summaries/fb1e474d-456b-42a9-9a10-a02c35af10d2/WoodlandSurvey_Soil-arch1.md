# Woodlands Survey soil data 1971-2001

## Overview
- 103 broadleaved woodlands surveyed in 1971; 16 plots per site (200 m² each) sampled randomly within each site.
- Data collected on canopy and ground flora, soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), habitat management, and various site/plot descriptors.
- Re-surveyed across growing seasons of 2000, 2002, and 2003 using identical methods to enable long-term change analysis.
- Analyses aimed at identifying principal drivers of ecological change, using explanatory variables from survey data and external sources (e.g., atmospheric deposition of sulfur and nitrogen, climate, canopy changes, woodland management).
- Key results published in Kirby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004); the latter focuses on spatial factors controlling woodland composition and structure in the baseline year of 1971.
- Users should consult the cited publications for details on field methods and analytical results.

## Survey Design & Methods
- Stratified sampling across the survey area.
- Field methods standardized by Bunce & Shaw (1973); field handbook included in supporting documentation.
