# Woodlands Survey soil data 1971-2001

## Overview
- Long-term soil dataset from 103 broadleaved woodlands in Britain.
- Fieldwork conducted in 1971 with 16 random 200 m2 plots per site; re-surveyed in 2000, 2002, and 2003 using identical methods (referred to as '2001').
- Data collected include plant canopy and ground flora, soil pH, soil organic matter (SOM), habitat management, and a range of plot/site descriptors.
- Analyses aimed to identify ecological changes over the interval and estimate principal drivers of change (e.g., atmospheric S and N deposition, climate, canopy change, woodland management).
- Key publications for methods and results: Kirby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004).

## Data and variables
- Site-level identifiers: Site (coded 1–103) and Plot (1–16 per site).
- Soil chemistry: pH1971, pH2003; SOM1971, SOM2003; QA repeats for pH1971 and SOM1971 (2000 repeats on archived samples).
- Soil classification: Major_Soil_Group, Soil_Group, Soil_subgroup with numeric codes (MSG, SG, SSG) and textual descriptions (Major_Soil_Group, Soil_Group, Soil_subgroup).
- Additional site/plot descriptors and structured data fields as per the dataset schema.

## Survey design and methods
- Stratified sampling across the survey area.
- Field methods follow Bunce & Shaw (1973) standardized survey protocol.
- Field handbook provided as part of supporting documentation.

## Related datasets and provenance
- Related dataset: Countryside Survey (link provided).
- Foundational references and originators listed (1971: Bunce & Shaw; 2001–3: Smart, Black, Kirby, Corney, etc.).
- Comprehensive background published in several works (e.g., Corney et al. 2004; Kirby et al. 2005).

## Data usage and outputs
- Enables assessment of long-term ecological change in British woodlands and the influence of environmental drivers.
- Outputs have been used in publications assessing spatial factors and drivers of woodland vegetation change.
- Data users are advised to consult linked publications for detailed field methods and analytical results.

## Data quality, access, and stewardship
- Data are standardized across time points to ensure comparability.
- QA repeats implemented for selected measurements to support data quality.
- Datasets designed to be stored and accessible through appropriate data portals and linked to related datasets.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Increasing the value of the dataset by integrating with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use applications).
- Improving accessibility of underlying data used to generate outputs to support transparency and reuse.
