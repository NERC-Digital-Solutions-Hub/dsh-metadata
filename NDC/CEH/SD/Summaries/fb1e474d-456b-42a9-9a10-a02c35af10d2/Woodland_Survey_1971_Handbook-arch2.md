# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A field manual outlining standardized methods for survey, description, and monitoring of woodlands to support consistent environmental health data and policy evaluation.
- Intended for teams with defined woodland monitoring duties; emphasizes reproducible data, quality assurance, and data archiving.

## Purpose, scope and audience

- Establishes a consistent, repeatable workflow for surveying woods, recording plant and habitat data, and describing site conditions over time.
- Designed to generate outputs suitable for environmental health assessments, policy performance reviews, and long-term datasets.
- Focuses on broad, standardized approaches rather than deeply specialized data analysis.

## Pre-survey planning and permissions

- Prepare an outline survey plan that minimizes travel and accounts for access and ownership issues.
- Obtain permission to survey each site; follow regional guidelines and use tact to address owner concerns.
- If permission is refused, switch to backup sites; public relations are emphasized as critical.

## Site access, location and point layout

- Sites are located using road maps and site maps; identify optimal access points to minimize walking distance.
- Each site has 16 sampling points marked on a 22" map; precise ground-location within about 20 m is required.
- Locating points uses a predetermined mechanical procedure to avoid bias:
  - Choose next point, identify a nearby accurate control point, orient map and compass for bearing, pace out distance, and relocate on ground.
  - Use fixed bearings and pre-set pacing, with limited adjustments for slope.

## Order of data collection and plot layout

- Four data types are collected per sampling point, plus two samples:
  - Ground flora: presence/absence across five nested quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) and percent cover/abundance estimates for the largest quadrat.
  - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: species and diameter/heights for stems >5 cm DBH; saplings and shrubs recorded in opposite quarters; tallest tree height measured.
  - Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of habitat attributes; slope and aspect measurements; ground profile sketch.
  - Soil data: small pit and auger cores; composite topsoil sample; description of soil horizons.
- Data order can be adjusted for convenience, but ground flora is recorded first to reduce trampling bias.

## Ground flora and plot sampling details

- Ground flora surveyed within each successive quadrat size, with species identified (via field names or herbarium codes).
- Bryophytes are collected comprehensively as vascular plants are recorded; bryophyte data are not broken down by quadrat but collected from the full plot.
- Specialists samples (herbarium specimens) are collected for identification confirmation and later verification.

## Trees, saplings and shrubs

- Trees: all stems >5 cm DBH recorded with species and D, B, H measurements; dead trees indicated with "D".
- Saplings: trees with height above breast height, and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite plot quarters 1 and 3.
- Height of the tallest tree is measured with a provided instrument.
- An example completed form is provided (Appendix III).

## Plot description and habitats

- Recording focuses on a reduced form of the site description, capturing slope, aspect, and a narrative sketch of major features.
- A detailed attribute list (Appendix IV) defines: topographic, substrate, and habitat features (glades, rocky knolls, streams, ponds, marshes, etc.).
- The form is designed to yield frequency data for key habitat attributes and to permit interpretation of site conditions.

## Soil data collection and interpretation

- A limited, standardized soil data set is collected to enable numerical analysis across many plots (1648 plots total).
- Measured properties: pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay) on dried sub-samples.
- Soil profiles are interpreted using horizon-based descriptions (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) with defined attributes for color, texture, structure, moisture, and rooting materials.
- Horizons are recorded using depth-from-to ranges to minimize cumulative errors; underlying material is noted where present.
- The approach emphasizes a practical, interpretable “numerical description” of soils suitable for large-scale analysis and comparison.

## Habitat, site and marginal land data

- Site Description and Habitats form captures site-wide characteristics, management history, and major habitat types (rock, water, woodland types, and human-made features).
- Marginal land use records (e.g., orchards, arable, industrial, roads) are mapped relative to the site.
- Boundary types and site-specific features (hedges, walls, tracks) are documented.

## Site completion, data packaging and storage

- After completing all data forms (site and 16 plots), sheets are stapled, bagged, and packed into four boxes for shipment.
- Soil samples are allocated to three boxes; bryophytes and herbarium sheets to the remaining box.
- Pre-paid, pre-addressed parcels are dispatched promptly to ensure data preservation and accessibility.
- Emphasis on data being collected "forever" and the importance of accuracy and completeness.

## Herbarium collection and specimen handling

- A herbarium is collected to demonstrate accuracy of species records; obtain a type specimen where possible.
- Specimens should include flowering shoots when possible and be clearly labeled with species identity or field code.
- Collect enough material to enable later verification; if in doubt, collect and classify as herbarium material for later confirmation.

## Equipment and logistics

- Detailed equipment lists for plotting (centre pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings) and field sampling (compass, tapes, calipers, auger, mattock, trowel, herbarium supplies).
- Separate field bags and site bags for organization; includes spare maps, labels, and packing materials.

## Summary of outputs and data management

- The handbook provides a comprehensive, standardized framework for generating multi-layered woodland data (vegetation, soil, habitat, and management signatures).
- Outputs include: per-site site description and habitat data, per-plot ground flora and tree data, soil horizon descriptions, herbarium specimens, and a consistent data packaging workflow for long-term storage and accessibility.
- The methodology supports data integration, cross-site comparisons, and enhanced value through standardized, shareable datasets.
