# Woodlands Survey soil data 1971-2001

## Overview
- A long-term woodland survey across Britain starting in 1971, recording ecological information at the site level and in 16 random 200 m2 plots per site.
- Data collected on canopy and ground flora, soil pH, Soil Organic Matter (SOM), habitat management, and a range of other plot and site-level descriptors.
- Re-surveyed at the same sites/plots in 2000, 2002, and 2003 (referred to as '2001') using identical field methods.
- Analyses aimed to identify ecological changes over the interval and to estimate drivers such as atmospheric deposition (S and N), climate, canopy changes, and woodland management.
- Key publications for methods and results: Kirby et al. (2005) and Corney et al. (2004). Users should consult these for detailed field methods and analyses.

## Survey Design & Methods
- Stratified sampling across the entire study area.
- Survey conducted using Bunce & Shaw's 1973 standardized survey methods.
- Field handbook provided as supporting documentation.

## Data Structure and Content
- Data organized by Site and Plot with numeric codes:
  - Site: code (1–103), description
  - Plot: code (1–16), description
- Measured and derived variables:
  - pH1971, pH2003, pH1971_QA_repeats (repeat pH measurements from archived 1971 samples)
  - SOM1971, SOM2003, SOM1971_QArepeats (repeat SOM measurements)
  - MSG (Major Soil Group code; Avery, 1973)
  - SG (Soil Group code; Avery, 1973)
  - SSG (Soil Sub-group code; Avery, 1973)

  - Soil_Group (text)
  - Soil_subgroup (text)

## Timeframe and Data Re-surveys
- Baseline data collected in 1971 for 103 sites.
- Follow-up measurements in 2000, 2002, and 2003 (the 2000s/2001 resurvey phase).

## Data Quality and Provenance
- QA repeats exist for select measurements (pH and SOM) to ensure consistency.
- Data gathered and curated by a team led by R.G.H. Bunce, M.W. Shaw (1971) and later by Simon Smart, Helaina Black, Keith Kirby, and Phil Corney (2001–2003) at CEH and collaborating institutions.
- Original field methods and analysis contextualized in related publications; users advised to consult cited works for methodological details.
