# Data set Title: Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region.

## Overview
- Describes seed dispersal processes by invaded (Linepithema humile present) vs. non-invaded ant communities in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa.
- Data collected across three summers: 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), 2017 (Jan–Feb).

## Experimental design
- Experiment 1: Ant community structure assessed with pitfall and baiting traps for invaded and non-invaded communities.
- Experiment 2: Seeds from twelve plant species offered to ants via a cafeteria setup; rate of seed removal measured over three hours.
- Experiment 3: Seeds presented to nests of invasive L. humile and six native ant species; after 24 hours nests were cast with dental plaster and excavated to retrieve seeds and record burial depths.

## Data content
- Three independent experiments spanning ant community structure, seed removal dynamics, and seed burial outcomes.
- Twelve plant species involved; data aimed at testing dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ants under differing invasion statuses.

## Provenance and quality
- Systematic data collection across all three experiments.
- Methodological details available in supporting documentation and online via the Bristol thesis repository.

## Access, provenance, and metadata
- Funding: NERC-Case studentship (NE/K007076/1) and Varley-Gradwell Travelling Fellowship.
- Full methodologies and project context accessible online at the Bristol research information repository (https://researchinformation.bristol.ac.uk).

## Relevance to data leadership
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: study design across multiple experiments, standardized data collection, and explicit provenance.
- Highlights importance of metadata, documentation, and discoverability (repository hosting) for data reuse.
- Illustrates cross-network data considerations (invaded vs. non-invaded communities) and potential for informing data strategy on data gaps, quality, and stakeholder needs.
- Useful for setting data standards in ecology where data are scattered across studies, requiring integration, quality assurance, and clear metadata.
