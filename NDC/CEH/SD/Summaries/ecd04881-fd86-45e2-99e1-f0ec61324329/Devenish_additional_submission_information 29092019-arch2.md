# Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region.

## Overview
- Describes seed dispersal processes under invaded (Linepithema humile present) and non-invaded (L. humile absent) ant communities.
- Aimed at understanding how invasion affects ant-mediated seed dispersal, using three independent experiments conducted in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa, across 2014, 2015, and 2017.

## Study Location and Timeframe
- Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa (33°55'51"S, 18°51'16"E).
- Summer months: 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), 2017 (Jan–Feb).

## Experimental Design
- Experiment 1: Ant community structure assessed with pitfall and baiting traps in invaded vs non-invaded sites.
- Experiment 2: Seeds from twelve plant species offered in a cafeteria-style setup; seed removal rate recorded over three hours.
- Experiment 3: Seeds presented to nests of the invasive L. humile and six native ant species; after 24 hours nests were cast with dental plaster, excavated, and seed burial depths recorded.

## Data Collected
- Ant community structure data from Experiment 1.
- Seed removal rate data for Experiment 2 (across 12 plant species).
- Seed retrieval and burial depth data from Experiment 3 (invasive vs native ant nests).

## Purpose and Hypotheses
- Tests hypotheses about the dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ant species in invaded versus non-invaded ant communities.

## Provenance & Quality
- Data collected systematically through three independent experiments.
- Methodologies described in supporting documentation and accessible via the Bristol thesis repository.

## Funding
- NERC-Case studentship (NE/K007076/1) and Varley-Gradwell Travelling Fellowship.

## Data Access and Repository
- Detailed methodologies and data provenance available in supporting documentation and online through the Bristol thesis repository: https://researchinformation.bristol.ac.uk

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts
- Demonstrates standardized data collection and multi-method approaches to monitor ecosystem services (seed dispersal) affected by biological invasions.
- Provides datasets suitable for integration with other environmental data to assess ecosystem health and policy performance over time.
- Emphasizes data quality assurance, documentation, and accessibility to enable broader use and re-analysis.
