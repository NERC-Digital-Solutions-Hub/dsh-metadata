# Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region

- Overview
  - Examines seed dispersal processes under invaded (Linepithema humile present) and non-invaded ant communities in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa.
  - Data collected across three summers: 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), and 2017 (Jan–Feb).
  - Aims to understand how invasion by L. humile affects the capacity of ants to disperse seeds.

- Experimental design
  - Experiment 1: Assess ant community structure using pitfall and baiting traps for invaded vs non-invaded contexts.
  - Experiment 2: Seed removal tests using a cafeteria setup with seeds from 12 plant species; removal rate measured over three hours.
  - Experiment 3: Seeds presented to nests of L. humile and six native ant species; after 24 hours nests were plaster-cast and excavated to retrieve seeds and record burial depths.
  - Together, experiments test hypotheses about the dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ants in both invaded and non-invaded communities.
