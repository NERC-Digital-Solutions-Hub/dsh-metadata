# Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region.

## Context and aim
- Study of the impact of the invasive Linepithema humile on ant community structure and seed dispersal ability.
- Comparative analysis between invaded and non-invaded ant communities.
- Data collected in Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa, to test hypotheses about the dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ant species under different invasion statuses.

## Data collection period and location
- Summers: 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), 2017 (Jan–Feb).
- Location: Jonkershoek Nature Reserve (coordinates provided in dataset).

## Experimental design

- Experiment 1: Ant community structure
  - Methods: Pitfall traps and baiting traps used to characterize invaded (L. humile present) and non-invaded communities.

- Experiment 2: Seed removal (cafeteria setup)
  - Seeds: From twelve plant species.
  - Procedure: Cafeteria-style setup to measure the rate of seed removal over a three-hour period.

- Experiment 3: Seed retrieval and burial depth
  - Procedure: Seeds offered to nests of invasive L. humile and six native ant species.
  - After 24 hours: Nests cast with dental plaster and excavated; seeds retrieved and burial depths recorded.

## Data content and variables (as described)
- Ant community structure data from invaded vs non-invaded sites (trap-based presence/abundance data).
- Seed removal data (removal rates) across twelve plant species in the cafeteria setup.
- Seed retrieval outcomes and burial depths from nests of L. humile and native species after 24 hours.

## Purpose and analytical potential
- Test hypotheses about dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ant species in invaded versus non-invaded contexts.
- Enables comparisons of seed dispersal services between invasion statuses.
- Supports analyses of correlations between ant community structure, seed dispersal rates, and burial depth outcomes.
