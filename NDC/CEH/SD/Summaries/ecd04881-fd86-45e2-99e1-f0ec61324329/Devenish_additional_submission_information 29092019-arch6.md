# Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region.

## Overview
- Dataset examining how the presence or absence of the invasive Argentine ant Linepithema humile affects seed dispersal processes.
- Compares invaded (L. humile present) and non-invaded ant communities.
- Aims to understand dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ant species under different ant community structures.

## Study design and objectives
- Three independent experiments conducted to test hypotheses about seed dispersal ability across ant communities.
- Focus on how ant community structure influences seed removal and burial of seeds.

## Experimental details
- Experiment 1: Determine ant community structure using pitfall and baiting traps in invaded vs non-invaded areas.
- Experiment 2: Seed removal dynamics tested with a cafeteria-style setup using seeds from twelve plant species; removal rate measured over three hours.
- Experiment 3: Seeds offered to nests of the invasive L. humile and six native ant species; after 24 hours, nests were cast with dental plaster, excavated, and seeds retrieved with burial depths recorded.

## Data collection and variables
- Data collected across all three experiments to compare dispersal ability and subsequent seed fate between invaded and non-invaded communities.
- Variables include ant community composition, seed removal rates, seed retrieval, and burial depths.

## Location, timeframe, and taxa
- Location: Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa (coordinates: 33°55'51"S, 18°51'16"E).
- Timeframe: Summer months 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), and 2017 (Jan–Feb).
- Taxa: Invasive Linepithema humile and six native ant species; seeds from twelve plant species.

## Provenance and quality
- Data collected systematically via three independent experiments.
- Methodologies described in supporting documentation and accessible online through the Bristol thesis repository.

## Funding
- NERC-Case studentship (NE/K007076/1) and Varley-Gradwell Travelling Fellowship.

## Potential uses for data support
- Compare seed dispersal services under invaded vs non-invaded ant communities.
- Analyze relationships between ant community structure and seed removal rates, seed retrieval, and burial depths.
- Integrate with broader ecological studies on invasive species impacts on mutualisms and plant dispersal.
- Leverage documented methodologies for data cleaning, transformation, and replication of similar experiments.
