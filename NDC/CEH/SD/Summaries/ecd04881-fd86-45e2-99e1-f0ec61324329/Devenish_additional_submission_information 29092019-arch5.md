# Impacts of Argentine ant ( Linepithema humile ) on seed dispersal services in Jonkershoek, Cape Floristic Region.

## Overview
- Describes how seed dispersal services differ between invaded (Linepithema humile present) and non-invaded ant communities at Jonkershoek Nature Reserve, South Africa.
- Targets the influence of L. humile on seed dispersal processes across ant communities.
- Data collected across three summer periods: 2014 (Nov–Dec), 2015 (Jan–Feb), and 2017 (Jan–Feb).

## Dataset composition and experiments
- Experiment 1: Assess ant community structure in invaded vs non-invaded sites using pitfall traps and baiting traps.
- Experiment 2: Measure seed removal rates using a cafeteria-style setup with seeds from twelve plant species over a three-hour observation.
- Experiment 3: Expose seeds to nests of invasive L. humile and six native ant species; after 24 hours, cast nests with dental plaster, excavate, retrieve seeds, and record burial depths.
- Data collected to test hypotheses about the dispersal ability of dominant seed-dispersing ants under invaded vs non-invaded conditions.

## Provenance and quality
- Data focus: impacts of L. humile on ant community structure and seed dispersal ability.
- Collected systematically through three independent experiments.
- Methodological details available in supporting documentation and the Bristol thesis repository.

## Funding and documentation
- Funded by NERC-Case studentship NE/K007076/1 and Varley-Gradwell Travelling Fellowship.
- Supporting documentation contains detailed methodologies; primary methods and results are documented in the Bristol thesis repository (https://researchinformation.bristol.ac.uk).

## Data governance and reuse considerations for Data Stewards
- Metadata to capture: experiment identifiers, plant species, ant species, sampling methods, dates, locations, units, and burial depths.
- Ensure consistent taxonomy and units across experiments; harmonize data formats for interoperability.
- Reference provenance and data lineage via the Bristol thesis repository and linked supporting docs.
- Review any sharing restrictions or licensing in the supporting materials; document any embargoes or sensitivities if present.
- Plan for cataloguing the dataset with clear scope notes, data collection protocols, and quality assurance steps to aid discoverability and reuse.
