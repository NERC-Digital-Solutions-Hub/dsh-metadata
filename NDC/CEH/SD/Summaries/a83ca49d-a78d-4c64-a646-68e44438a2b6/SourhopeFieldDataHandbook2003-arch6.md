# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- A comprehensive field-data resource describing Sourhope soil biodiversity and upland grassland systems, combining vegetation surveys with depth-resolved soil chemistry to support long-term analyses and data products.

## 1. Purpose and scope

- Establishes a robust, multi-block baseline dataset for soil biodiversity and upland grassland ecology.
- Integrates vegetation data (presence/absence and abundance indicators) with soil chemistry and physical properties for self-serve analyses and longitudinal tracking.
- Situates Sourhope as a long-term site within ECN and Micronet frameworks for environmental-change monitoring and microbial–plant interaction studies.

## 2. Site context and design

- Location and context:
  - Sourhope field site in the Bowmont valley; high-humidity upland climate; underlain by Old Red Sandstone (andesitic lavas).
  - Soils base-poor, ranging from acid brown forest soils to acidic peaty podzols/gleys with stony components.
- Experimental design:
  - Five blocks (including Blocks 4 and 5 highlighted in the excerpt); each block contains main plots subdivided into subplots (A–F) and Ecotron sub-plots for controlled-environment studies.
  - Initial main-plot treatments randomly assigned: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide (one intended Fallow treatment replaced by additional controls).
  - Grazing regime with periodic cutting and stock exclusion from 1998 onward.
- Data types:
  - Soil profiles, horizon descriptions, and soil-chemistry measurements.
  - Vegetation surveys (plots and subplots) with species presence/absence and abundance indicators.
  - Longitudinal data collected across blocks, plots, and subplots, enabling cross-scale analyses.

## 3. Data types and structure

- Soil profiles and horizons:
  - Detailed horizon descriptions with depths (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and boundary characteristics.
  - Color and structure notes (e.g., matrix colors, mottling, blocky/granular structures), presence of igneous stones and subangular stones.
  - Common soil subtypes noted (e.g., Brown forest soils with gleying; variations across blocks).
- Soil chemistry (horizon-level and auger samples):
  - Parameters: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Horizon-by-horizon data for each block and, in some cases, for auger cores (multiple samples per plot or sub-plot).
  - Notable patterns include acid conditions (pH ~4.5–4.9), moderate %N and %C with C:N ~12–14, and varying exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) across horizons.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plot- and sub-plot-level vegetation data, including species totals and occurrences.
  - Classification outcomes align with upland acid grassland types; presence of indicator species and edge/moister-zone associations.
- Data management and availability:
  - Appendix A provides block-specific soil and vegetation data with horizon-by-horizon measurements, chemical analyses, and vegetation plots.
  - Raw data tables available for species occurrences, plot compositions, and soil chemistry to facilitate deeper analyses and longitudinal comparisons.
- ECN and Micronet integration:
  - Sourhope designated as a main ECN site; SERAD Micronet projects examine relationships between soil microbial communities and plant communities across grassland types.

## 4. Block 4 and Block 5 highlights (data-focused)

- Block 4:
  - Comprehensive soil-profile descriptions from 0–95 cm across multiple horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bsg, Cgx), with detailed mineral content and textural notes.
  - Corresponding soil-chemistry data per horizon (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH) and pH measurements in water and CaCl2.
  - Vegetation data captured at subplots (A–F) with species totals and presence/absence information; diverse plant associations observed by horizon and subplot.
- Block 5:
  - Site details (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) and a sequence of horizons (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with detailed soil descriptions.
  - Horizon-by-horizon chemical data (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH) and auger-sample chemistry for multiple cores.
  - Vegetation surveys across plots with species totals and per-subplot counts, enabling cross-plot comparisons and trend analyses.
- ECOTRON and ECOTRON PLOTS:
  - ECOTRON soil analyses and vegetation surveys provided to support environment-controlled studies and cross-site comparisons.

## 5. Analytical framework and outputs

- Data integration:
  - Combines presence/absence and abundance indicators from vegetation surveys with depth-resolved soil chemistry and physical properties.
  - Supports multi-scale analyses from blocks to plots to subplots, including horizon-specific soil dynamics.
- Analytical approaches:
  - Multivariate analyses (e.g., PCA, Twinspan) and plant–soil association analyses to identify dominant patterns and relationships.
  - Vegetation classification (e.g., NVC mappings for upland grasslands) and indicator species analyses.
- Outputs and use cases:
  - Self-serve data products such as dashboards or pivot-style summaries to explore relationships between soil properties and vegetation composition.
  - Longitudinal trend tracking across treatments (liming, nitrogen, biocides) and across ECN/Micronet sites for environmental-change monitoring.

## 6. Key takeaways for data support

- The Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003 provides a richly structured, multi-block dataset that links detailed soil profiles and chemistry with vegetation data, enabling integrated analyses and self-serve exploration.
- The dataset supports evaluating treatment effects on plant communities and soil properties, while also serving as a baseline for long-term ecological monitoring within ECN and Micronet frameworks.
- Appendix A and the ECOTRON sections ensure access to horizon-level data and comparable, controlled-environment datasets, facilitating cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses.
