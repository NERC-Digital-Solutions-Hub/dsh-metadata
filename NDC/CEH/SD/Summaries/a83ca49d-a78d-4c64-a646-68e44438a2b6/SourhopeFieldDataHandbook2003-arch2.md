# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Purpose and scope
- Provides standardized methods for collecting, analysing, and archiving soil and vegetation data at Sourhope.
- Supports cross-project data sharing, long-term environmental monitoring, and integration with monitoring networks (ECN, Micronet).
- Emphasises quality assurance, data transformation, and storage to appropriate data portals.

## Site, context, and experimental design
- Location: Sourhope Experimental Farm, Bowmont valley; Sourhope site comprising multiple blocks (notably blocks 4 and 5 discussed here) with long-term hill farming and grassland focus.
- Site characteristics: upland pasture with acidic soils, varied topography, and historical livestock management; climate and soil conditions described to support repeatable monitoring.
- Experimental layout (Sourhope Soil Biodiversity site):
  - 5 blocks, each with 6 main plots (A–F) and 30 plots total; each main plot subdivided into 15 subplots (A–Q).
  - Treatments on main plots: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide, Fallow (later omitted).
  - Ecotron plot included for controlled-environment studies.
  - Post-1997 management: exclusion of stock to assess grazing and biodiversity impacts.

## Data types and sampling methods

### Vegetation surveys
- Plot structure: 50 cm x 50 cm point quadrats within randomly selected subplots per main plot; 25 points per quadrat.
- Data captured: species presence/absence and relative abundance inferred from occurrence frequency.
- Outputs and analyses: species lists (dominant species frequently include Festuca rubra, Agrostis capillaris, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Poa pratensis, etc.); classification against vegetation types (NVC) and community patterns; Twinspan analysis used to identify communities; edge, slope, and central patterns observed.

### Soil sampling and analysis
- Sampling scheme (block-scale): 30 soil cores per plot from 0–30 cm in a W-pattern; horizon-based profiling with 1 m pits above each block; sub-samples archived at -80°C.
- Analyses per sample: pH (H2O and CaCl2), moisture loss, LOI, %N, %C, C:N ratio, and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, Na, K) expressed as meq/100 g; horizon-level descriptions and horizon differentiation recorded.
- General soil characteristics: acidic surface horizons (pH ~4.5–4.6), humic surface with high LOI, C:N ~13–14 in many horizons, Ca often high in top horizons, notable block-to-block variability.
- Data handling: detailed tabular datasets by block, plot, and horizon; archived samples linked to laboratory analyses for verification and re-use.

## Key findings and data interpretation (Blocks 4 and 5; ECOTRON)

### Block 4 – Auger soil samples
- Nutrient and chemical trends: %N around 0.5–0.6; %C ~6–8% in several samples; C:N ratios generally in the low to mid-teens (approx. 12–14 in many samples); Ca, Mg, K, and Na values show variability across subplots and horizons.
- Moisture and organic content: %Moisture loss values in the vicinity of 4–5% for many samples; LOI values range with depth, reflecting organic matter distribution and horizon development.
- pH indicators: H2O pH values commonly around 4.4–4.8; CaCl2 pH values also in the acidic range (~3.6–4.1).
- Implication: shows spatial heterogeneity in soil chemistry linked to horizon development and management history; provides a basis for correlating soil conditions with vegetation responses.

### Block 4 – Vegetation data (plots 4A–4F)
- Species occurrence and totals vary by subplot and block position (edge vs interior; slope effects).
- Indicator species and community patterns align with NVC classifications indicating damper conditions in moister plots.
- Data support analysis of how soil chemistry and moisture regime influence plant community composition and structure.

### Block 5 – Soil and vegetation data
- Site details: Block 5 characterized by brown forest soil with gleying; profile described from surface to deeper horizons with distinct layers (Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
- Soil profile analyses: block-wide variability in N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, and pH; pH ~4.4–5.2 in different horizons; LOI values particularly high in surface horizons indicating organic matter content.
- Auger samples (5A–5F): nutrient contents show moderate %N (~0.5–0.6) and %C (~7–9%), with C:N ratios ~10–14; Ca and Mg variability across horizons; moisture loss and LOI reflect horizon differentiation.
- Vegetation data (plots 5A–5F): species totals and distributions across subplots reveal community responses to soil gradients and microhabitat variation; indicator species reflect slope position and moisture availability.
- ECOTRON site data: provides a controlled-environment comparison; soil analysis includes %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; pH ~4.79; Ca ~2.76 meq/100 g; Mg ~1.7 meq/100 g; etc.

### ECOTRON soil site
- Single plot data (ECOTRON PLOT 1): Wt ~6.089 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76 meq/100 g; Na ~0.15; K ~0.62; Mg ~1.7 meq/100 g; pH(H2O) ~4.79; pHCaCl2 ~3.82.
- Vegetation: ECOTRON plots tracked by species presence/absence to compare with field plots under controlled conditions.

## Data management, appendices, and data use

- Appendices and data structures:
  - Appendix A with site- and block-level metadata, grid references, altitudes, soil series, horizon descriptions.
  - Tables and figures document community composition, species occurrences, and soil chemistry across blocks, plots, and horizons.
  - Ecotron plots included for controlled studies; data linked to ECN/Micronet networks for cross-site comparisons.
- Archiving and accessibility:
  - Samples archived under standardized protocols; long-term storage facilitates reuse and cross-site analyses.
  - Data prepared for portal-style uploads to enable integration with broader environmental monitoring efforts.
- Implications for monitoring:
  - The dataset supports longitudinal analyses of vegetation and soil responses to nutrient management, liming, moisture regimes, and grazing exclusion.
  - Enables cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant assessment of environmental health, habitat quality, and grazing-management impacts.

## Relevance for the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype
- Demonstrates how standardized, site-wide sampling and robust data archiving yield comparable datasets across time and space.
- Provides clear methodologies to verify, clean, and transform data from soil cores, horizons, and vegetation surveys into outputs usable for environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
- Highlights challenges and opportunities for increasing data value by integrating soil and vegetation datasets with other environmental datasets and by improving access to underlying data for broad use.
