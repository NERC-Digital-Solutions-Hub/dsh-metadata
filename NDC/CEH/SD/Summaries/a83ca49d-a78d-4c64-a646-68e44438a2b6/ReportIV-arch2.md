# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, the site has been monitored for above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and diversity to understand how management actions shape botanical communities and ecosystem function.

- Three management processes dominate botanical change:
  - Mowing: annual cuts to ~6 cm since 1999, fencing to exclude grazing; promotes Festuca spp. over Agrostis spp., and may increase bryophyte abundance by maintaining sward height.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime increases productivity, with the strongest responses when both are applied; lime raises soil pH toward 7.0, influencing community structure and potentially reducing soil moisture.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 treatment shows the highest plant diversity in some years; possible link to reduced herbivory is discussed but not conclusively established.

- Additional factor: trampling in the C2 plots (associated with 13CO2 pulse experiments) likely reduced productivity there.

- Site design and data collection
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site consists of 5 replicate blocks, each with 6 main plots randomly assigned treatments, subdivided into sub-plots.
  - Data collected annually since 1999, including:
    - Automatic Weather Station measurements (temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture).
    - Above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots.
    - Baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual point analysis (2000–2002) using 100-hole frame over a 0.5 m2 cell to record species hits.
    - Soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture measurements; bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; PCA and diversity metrics (Shannon index).

- Key observed patterns (2002)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - Overall biomass production remained higher than the 1999 baseline but fell in 2002 relative to 2001 across many treatments.
    - Nitrogen and lime together produced the highest productivity; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in several years.
    - A slope-related effect: blocks higher on the slope showed greater declines in biomass.
  - Fertilisation and soil chemistry
    - Lime and nitrogen substantially increased soil pH; lime-treated plots reached ~pH 7.0 in many cases.
    - A negative correlation between soil moisture and pH was observed; higher pH often coincided with drier conditions.
    - Positive overall relationship between soil pH and biomass across all plots, but treatment-by-treatment nuances exist (e.g., pH–biomass link weak or negative in N+L plots).
  - Plant community composition and functional groups
    - Dominant grasses shifted: Festuca rubra expanded notably in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. declined markedly (over 40% reduction since 2000) across most treatments, suggesting mowing and/or site-level factors.
    - Bryophytes increased across the site, especially under unimproved conditions; moss prevalence rose from 6.5–11% to ~20% of total hits over 2000–2002.
    - Point analyses showed contrasting responses: Festuca spp. and Poa pratensis more abundant in fertilised plots; unimproved plots retained higher frequencies of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Diversity and functional types
    - Shannon diversity indices declined in nitrogen + lime plots (about 15% below baseline in 2002) but increased in other treatments (up to ~29% in insecticide plots).
    - Point-analysis data indicate three main functional groups (stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CSR, and SR/CSR) dominated in most plots (69–95% of hits), with clear treatment-driven shifts by 2002:
      - C-S-R species expanded in N+L plots.
      - Stress-tolerant (S) species benefited in unimproved plots.
      - SR/CSR species decreased in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Insecticide effects
    - While direct causality to diversity is not proven, patterns align with literature suggesting herbivore pressure can modify plant diversity; insecticide plots show relatively higher diversity in some years.
  - Trampling (C2 plots)
    - Dramatic productivity drops in C2 plots in 2002 likely reflect trampling during intense CO2 pulse sampling activities.

- Data quality, access, and integration
  - Regular weather, soil, and vegetation data collected with standardised methods and stored in project appendices and project datasets.
  - A substantial, multi-year dataset (1998–2002) including biomass, chemistry, and detailed species hits enables cross-treatment comparisons and temporal trend analysis.
  - Appendices provide: site map and treatment allocations, full species lists (vascular and bryophyte), detailed biomass data, 2002 point-analysis results, and 2002 PCA outputs.

- Implications for monitoring and policy
  - Long-term monitoring demonstrates how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use interact to shape productivity and biodiversity, with potential trade-offs between biomass production and species diversity.
  - Data suggest that managed reductions in disturbance (grazing exclusion) and chemical amendments can shift community composition toward stress-tolerant and competitive species, while potentially reducing bryophyte dominance and overall diversity in some plots.
  - The observed relationships between pH, moisture, and productivity highlight the importance of soil chemistry management for sustaining ecosystem function.
  - The study illustrates the value and challenges of integrating multiple data streams (biomass, species composition, soil chemistry, moisture, and microtopography) for understanding environmental health and informing land-use policies.

- Key methodological notes for analysts
  - Use of split-plot ANOVA to assess treatment, year, and interaction effects on biomass.
  - PCA on ranked species hits to differentiate treatment groups, with an emphasis on early-year baselines and post-treatment shifts.
  - Functional-group analysis (CSR framework) to interpret plant community responses beyond mere species counts.
  - Ongoing data quality assurance, standardised data collection protocols, and transparent documentation in appendices for reproducibility and utility in cross-site comparisons.
