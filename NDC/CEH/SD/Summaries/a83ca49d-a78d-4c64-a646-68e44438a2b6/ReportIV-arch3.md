# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, the project monitors how above-ground plant productivity and diversity respond to management practices (mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide) within a long-term field experiment at the Rigg Foot Experimental Site.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Site: Rigg Foot, Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute).
  - Structure: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
  - Management tasks: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) across the whole site; insecticide applied after mowing to insecticide plots; spring additions of Nitrogen and/or Lime to designated plots.
  - Data collection and activity: continuous weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station; above-ground productivity via random 0.5 m2 cell harvests; baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual and multi-year point analyses (2000–2002); soil pH and moisture measurements; extensive ancillary botanical surveys and biomass sampling; 11621 soil samples collected since start; results include field campaigns such as labelled 13CO2 pulses.

- Key findings on productivity and biodiversity
  - Productivity trends
    - Long-term increase in above-ground biomass across all treatments from 1999 onward.
    - In 2002, biomass production fell in many treatments compared with 2001, though fertilised plots (especially Nitrogen + Lime) remain the most productive.
    - A notable slope-position effect: Block 1 at the bottom of the slope showed larger relative changes than Block 5 up-slope.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Nitrogen and/or Lime increase productivity; plots receiving both nitrogen and lime show the strongest biomass gains.
    - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; high pH linked with high productivity, though very high lime use may risk moisture stress and chlorosis in some years.
    - Higher pH and lower moisture in fertilised plots may contribute to stress under dry periods.
  - Mowing effects
    - Regular mowing reduces Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis; Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertilised plots.
    - Bryophytes (mosses) expand across the site, particularly under mowing and reduced grazing, contributing to ~20% of total hits in 2002.
    - Stress-tolerant species increase across most treatments (except where nitrogen and lime are applied).
  - Insecticide effects
    - Insecticide plots show higher diversity in some years, consistent with theoretical links between herbivore pressure and plant diversity, but direct causation is not established due to limited information on actual herbivory control.
  - Trampling effects
    - First-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 coincides with intense activity around 13CO2 pulses, likely dampening vegetation growth and contributing to lower biomass in those plots.
  - Community composition and functional traits
    - Point Analysis (2002) shows improved plots dominated by grasses associated with fertile conditions (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) and unimproved plots dominated by species like Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
    - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) are more abundant in unimproved plots.
    - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 shows declines in the N&L (Nitrogen & Lime) plots relative to baseline; other treatments show increases (up to ~29% in some insecticide plots) compared with earlier years.
    - Functional group shifts (CSR framework)
      - Stress-tolerators (S) increase in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and stress-ruderal (SR) groups rise in fertilised plots, with C-S-R and SR/C-S-R becoming more dominant over time.
      - By 2002, significant differences between treatments emerge for CSR, S, and SR/CSR groups, with C-S-R species expanding in N+L plots and S species benefiting in unimproved plots; SR/CSR declines in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

- Data and methods
  - Site design: 5 blocks; 6 main plots per block; 10 sub-plots per main plot; treatments allocated in a randomized design.
  - Data collection methods:
    - Regular weather data from on-site station.
    - Above-ground biomass: harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots before each mowing; samples dried and weighed.
    - Point analysis surveys: baseline in 1998; extensive surveys in 2000–2002 using 100-hole frames with 25-point sub-samples; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
    - Soil sampling: pH measured at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture measured with theta probe in 2002.
    - Vegetation surveys: additional small-scale plots and biomass sorting by species.
  - Data scope: 11621 soil samples; multiple appendices with species lists, biomass data, weather data, and survey results.
  - Analyses: repeated measures over years; split-plot ANOVA (Genstat) for biomass; PCA on point analysis data to assess species groupings; various diversity indices (Shannon).

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy
  - Demonstrates how long-term, replicated field experiments can elucidate how management interventions affect both productivity and biodiversity.
  - Shows the value of integrating functional trait frameworks (CSR) with species- and bryophyte-level data to interpret ecological responses.
  - Highlights data governance considerations relevant to environmental monitoring programs:
    - Need for robust metadata, data provenance, and open sharing of underlying data.
    - Potential barriers include data access, data ownership, and the effort required to transform and harmonise datasets from diverse projects.
  - Provides a model for linking above-ground monitoring with below-ground biodiversity research, informing policy on land-use management, nutrient management, habitat restoration, and long-term environmental health monitoring.

- Limitations and caveats
  - 2002 weather station malfunction led to missing data periods; some 2002 measurements were substituted from alternative sources.
  - C2 plots experienced trampling-related effects during intensive field activities, complicating interpretation of productivity changes in 2002.
  - While correlations between soil chemistry (pH) and productivity are evident, causality can be confounded by moisture and nutrient status across treatments.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are supported by trends but require more explicit data on herbivory and its ecological consequences to establish direct causation.
