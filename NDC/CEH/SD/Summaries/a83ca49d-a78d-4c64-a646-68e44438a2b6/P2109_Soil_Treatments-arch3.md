# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- Background and aims
  - Initiated in 1999 to understand both soil biota biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes.
  - 24 separate research projects funded to study soil structure, processes (e.g., carbon and nitrogen cycles), and roles of micro- to macro-fauna (bacteria, nematodes, protozoa, fungi, microarthropods, invertebrate root feeders, meso- and macro-fauna).

- Study site and data context
  - Sourhope field site, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute (now James Hutton Institute) in the Scottish Borders.
  - Intensive monitoring of aboveground biomass, species composition, and relative abundance to link to soil biodiversity and function.

- Data set and structure
  - Dataset: P2109_VIEW_SOIL_TREATMENTS.csv, detailing treatments applied to experimental soil plots at Sourhope (1999–2001; additional data 2001–2004).
  - Use: can be combined with other experimental datasets from the site as explanatory variables.
  - Key columns:
    - TREATMENT_DATE
    - BLOCK
    - MAIN_PLOT
    - SUB_PLOT
    - CELL_X
    - CELL_Y
    - TREATMENT_TYPE
    - DOSAGE
  - Reference material: SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003 (Scott et al., 2003). Available via the EIDC catalogue.

- Treatments (site- and plot-level)
  - Site-level treatments: vegetation cutting across multiple years (1999–2002) with specific date ranges; includes occasional note when mowing machinery was unavailable.
  - Plot-level treatments (six treatments):
    1) Control 1 – No treatment
    2) Control 2 – No treatment
    3) Nitrogen – NH4NO3 fertilizer; total N 34%; annual rate 24 g m-2; split applications across years
    4) Lime – CaCO3; annual rate 600 g m-2; one dose per year
    5) Nitrogen and Lime – combination of 3 and 4
    6) Insecticide – Dursban 4 OPA; applied after mowing in specified schedules
  - Specific timing and dosages vary by year (1999–2002), with detailed dates listed for each treatment.

- Data quality, governance, and usage notes
  - Data quality: subject to QA procedures; not warranting accuracy by NERC; no liability for use or interpretation.
  - Data sharing: underlying data intended to be publicly shared; potential barriers due to openness requirements and metadata availability.
  - Metadata and format: some metadata gaps noted; data may require transformation to be readily usable; references to broader documentation (Scott et al., 2003) for context.
  - Data management: emphasis on data provenance, quality assurance, and compliance with standards at the data source.
