# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- Background and aims
  - Established in 1999, centered on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to study changes in aboveground biomass, species composition, and soil biodiversity.
  - Aims to understand the diversity of soil biota and the functional roles of soil organisms in key ecological processes.
  - Funded 24 projects covering soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, micro- and macro-fauna (bacteria, nematodes, protozoa, fungi, microarthropods, invertebrates, and macro-fauna).

- Data set overview
  - P2109_VIEW_SOIL_TREATMENTS.csv documents treatments applied to Sourhope soil plots from 1999–2001, with additional data 2001–2004.
  - Can be used with other experimental site datasets as explanatory variables.

- Dataset structure
  - Key columns: TREATMENT_DATE, BLOCK, MAIN_PLOT, SUB_PLOT, CELL_X, CELL_Y, TREATMENT_TYPE, DOSAGE.
  - Referenced source: Scott et al., 2003, SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK (Support Information via EIDC catalogue).

- Site- and plot-level treatments
  - Site-level treatment: vegetation cutting (five cuts across years) with specific dates per year.
  - Plot-level treatments (six types):
    1) Control 1 – No treatment
    2) Control 2 – No treatment
    3) Nitrogen – NH4NO3 fertilizer; total N 34%; annual rate 24 g m-2; two doses per year; dates vary by year
    4) Lime – CaCO3; annual 600 g m-2; single yearly dose; spring dates
    5) Nitrogen and Lime – combination of above
    6) Insecticide – Dursban; 0.15 ml m-2 per application (annual ~7.5 L ha-1); applied after mowing on multiple dates per year
  - Insecticide schedule and mowing-dependent timing vary by year.

- Data quality and usage notes
  - Data subjected to quality assurance, but NERC cannot warrant accuracy or fitness for a specific use.
  - No liability for data accuracy or outcomes from its use.
  - Data can be cross-referenced with the SOURHOPE Field Data Handbook (2003) and EIDC catalogue records.
