Notes:
- LOI and LOI-related values indicate high surface organic matter in the upper horizons (especially FH) with pronounced decline with depth.
- pH values indicate acidic to slightly acidic conditions across horizons; CaCl2 readings consistently lower than H2O readings as expected.
- Weathering and horizon development reflect a profile with substantial organic-rich surface layers transitioning to mineral depths with notable stone content.

  - pH H2O: 4.45–4.95
  - pH CaCl2: 3.53–4.14
- Pattern: modest N and C content in auger samples with lower pH readings, moderate base cation values, and relatively uniform organic/inorganic mix across sub-samples.

## Ecotron and vegetation data (Block 4)

- Ecotron plot
  - Soil: Wt ~6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76
  - pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82
- Vegetation survey (ECOTRON PLOT)
  - Subplots A, B, C, D, E, F recorded with species presence and counts; plant community composition noted, consistent with field plot sampling and Horizon context.
  - Data capture supports cross-analysis of vegetation with horizon-level soil chemistry and moisture indicators.

## Data management and accessibility (Block 4)

- Data are organized with MLURI Barcodes for each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx; 4A–4F auger samples; ECOTRON plot data).
- Includes horizon-level chemistry, LOI, moisture loss, pH, and mineralogy notes, plus vegetation inventories for associated plots.
- Structured to integrate with the Sourhope field data framework, enabling cross-year comparisons and multi-disciplinary analyses (soil-vegetation interactions, long-term change).

## Particular data stewardship considerations

- Data completeness: Some Na values are missing in certain horizons; cross-plot and cross-horizon comparisons should account for data gaps.
- Heterogeneity: Block 4 exhibits strong horizon- and plot-to-plot variability; metadata should capture sampling depths, plot locations, and any management history affecting soil properties.
- Interoperability: Horizon naming (LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bg, Bs, Cg, etc.) should be consistently linked to a metadata dictionary for reuse across projects.
- Long-term reuse: Data formats include detailed tabular outputs with multiple measured parameters and sample IDs; ensure metadata clarifies methods, units, and QA steps to support meta-analyses.

## Appendices and access (summary relevance)

- Block 4 data are part of appended soil and vegetation datasets, with horizon-level profiles and auger sample analyses, all tied to Block 4 plots and an Ecotron subplot.
- Data are designed for reuse in soil-vegetation interaction studies and long-term environmental monitoring within the Sourhope site context.
