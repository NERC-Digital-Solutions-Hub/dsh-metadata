# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Objectives: understand soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms; link below-ground processes with above-ground plant communities.

- Programme context and site setup
  - 24 Phase I projects (below-ground processes, soil biota, and their links to plants) plus 8 Phase II projects.
  - Site previously grazed by sheep; since 1998 fencing blocked all grazing.
  - Management regime (since 1999) includes five summer cuts to 6 cm and five plot-level treatments, with plots split into fertilised (nitrogen and/or lime) and unfertilised groups.

- Treatments and data collection
  - Treatments (within five main plots, replicated across five blocks): Control 1 (untreated), Control 2 (untreated for comparison), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
  - Site management: monthly mowing May–September; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA chlorpyrifos) applied to insecticide plots after mowing; fertilisers applied in spring per treatment.
  - Data collection methods:
    - Automatic Weather Station for climate data.
    - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 samples collected prior to each mow, dried and weighed (1999–2002).
    - Baseline vegetation survey (July 1998) and annual point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grid.
    - Soil pH (at 5 cm) and soil moisture measurements.
    - Additional small-scale vegetation surveys, biomass sorting, and bryophyte identification.
  - Research activity: progress of Phase I completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork included lab-based campaigns (e.g., 13CO2 pulses) with mobile CEH laboratories.

- Key findings: productivity and community composition (1999–2002)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - Long-term trend: biomass productivity increased from 1999 across most treatments; 2002 shows lower productivity than 2001 in several plots.
    - Highest productivity in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 consistently less productive than Control 1; slope position affected productivity (lower on steeper blocks).
    - 2002: biomass reductions ranged from ~14% (N&L) to ~31% (Control 2) relative to 2001.
  - Plant community responses
    - Mowing effects: dominant grasses shift toward Festuca rubra in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. (A. capillaris, A. vinealis) decline across treatments, suggesting mowing selects against these species; bryophytes expand under regular mowing and reduced grazing.
    - Fertilisation effects: nitrogen and/or lime increase vegetation productivity; lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0; higher pH and altered moisture regimes influence species composition and functional groups.
    - Insecticide effects: evidence suggests insecticide plots may support higher plant diversity, possibly via reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist; exact causal links require caution.
    - Trampling effect: first-year sampling in C2 plots coincided with substantial trampling during labelled 13CO2 pulse application, contributing to reduced productivity in those plots.
  - Functional group shifts (CSR framework)
    - Functional groups analyzed: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and SR/C-S-R (stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals).
    - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant species benefit most due to lower disturbance and nutrient loss; fertilised plots shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal types.
    - Nitrogen & Lime plots: dominance of C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species increases, reflecting improved growth conditions and higher pH.
    - Across treatments, CSR-related dynamics become more pronounced by 2002.
  - Bryophytes and non-vascular components
    - Bryophyte hits increased across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus particularly prominent; bryophytes contribute notably to total hits and biomass in unimproved plots.
  - Diversity and community structure
    - Shannon diversity indices show treatment differences emerging from 2000 and increasing through 2002; diversity declines in N&L plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while other treatments show positive or neutral changes.
    - Principal Components Analysis separates improved (fertilised) from unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster together, with some nitrogen-treated plots resembling limed plots.
  - Species and functional group trends (highlights)
    - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis become more abundant in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina remains common but with shifting relative dominance.
    - Agrostis spp. decline; bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase, especially in unimproved plots.
    - Monocots vs. dicots shifts reflect changes in nutrient availability and disturbance regime.
  - Site-level context
    - The observed changes reflect a combination of reduced grazing disturbance, nutrient additions, mowing, and potential insect herbivore dynamics, with site-level factors (e.g., mowing regime) driving broad patterns across treatments.

- Implications and interpretation
  - Disturbance and nutrient management interact to shape plant productivity and community structure.
  - Regular mowing combined with grazing exclusion promotes bryophyte proliferation and a shift toward stress-tolerant functional types in unimproved plots.
  - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) enhances productivity but can reduce diversity in high-nutrient plots and promote competitive-stress-ruderal assemblages, especially at higher pH.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require careful interpretation due to complex plant–insect interactions and varying treatment specifics.
  - Trampling during intensive sampling activities can confound short-term productivity measurements in certain plots.
