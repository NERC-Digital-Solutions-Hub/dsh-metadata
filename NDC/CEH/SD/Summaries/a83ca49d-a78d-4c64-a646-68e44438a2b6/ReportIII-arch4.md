# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Scientific field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed at providing a broad context for detailed studies and enabling cross-year comparisons across treatments.
- Site management and data collection were affected by external events in 2001 (foot-and-mouth restrictions and staff changes).

## Data Collected and Schedule
- Measurements and data types documented to support cross-group comparisons (Table 1 reference).
- Core data domains:
  - Automatic Weather Station data (headlines for 2001; site rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass (seasonal cuts May–September; five mowing occasions per year; plots with sub-plots S, T, U, V).
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm depth; Lime and Nitrogen treatments affecting pH).
  - Botanical composition (Point Analysis survey using a 100× grid; 25 touches per quadrat; July surveys in 2001 and 2000 for comparison).
- Data captured across multiple years (1999–2001) with standardized protocols to enable year-to-year comparisons.

## Data Management, Access, and Quality
- Data workflows managed within MLURI and CEH Data Managers; Automatic Weather Station data transmitted to CEH Merlewood.
- Consistency checks across surveyors showed no significant difference in 2001 Point Analysis results between surveyors, supporting data reliability.
- Some 2001 data disruption due to external events (FMD restrictions) and internal changes (Officer in Charge), affecting visits, timing, and one biocide application.
- Data normalization applied to biomass to compare treatment effects despite methodological changes in cutting (mechanical vs. manual) during 2001.
- Detailed data and analyses are presented via tables, figures, and appendices (e.g., Table 1; Tables 4–6; Figures 1–9; Appendix 1).

## Measurements and Methods
- Above-ground biomass: dry weight of 0.5 m2 quadrats from subplots S, T, U, V; five harvesting occasions per summer; biomass summed and ln-transformed for ANOVA.
- Soil pH: measurements at 0–5 cm, comparing limed, nitrogen, nitrogen+lime, biocide, and control plots.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat method with 100 cells per quadrat; 25 hits recorded; species coded and tracked across treatments.
- Statistical analyses:
  - Split-plot ANOVA to assess treatment effects across years (1999–2001) and intra-year variation.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to explore associations among plots and dominant species.
  - Correlation analyses between biomass and species abundances; litter weight as turnover indicator.

## Key Findings by Data Domain
- 2001 Above-ground Biomass
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass by treatment; peak biomass in July/August across treatments.
  - 2001 biomass higher than previous years, likely due to personnel changes and switch to mechanical cutting; nitrogen and lime additions consistently boosted biomass; N+L often most effective.
  - Normalized biomass (against C1) reveals sustained positive impact of nitrogen and/or lime on productivity.
- Soil pH
  - Lime additions continued to raise pH (approx. 6.19 in limed plots; 6.38 in N&L plots) by October 2001.
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, though to a lesser extent; control plots remained largely unchanged since baseline (1998).
- Botanical Composition
  - 2001 surveyed species in various treatments showed shifts in relative abundance.
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments in 2001; Festuca species increased (notably F. ovina and F. rubra depending on treatment).
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more evident in fertilized plots, especially N and/or Lime; unimproved plots retained a more bryophyte- and Nardus-dominated assembly.
  - Diversity appeared to decrease in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 in nitrogen+lime plots).
  - PCA generally separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots, with biomass correlating positively with F. rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Increased litter frequency in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site Heterogeneity
  - Spatial variability across columns noted (e.g., columns E and F more acidic; correlations between pH and biomass).
  - Biomass distribution showed central plots tending to have higher productivity; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.

## Data Challenges and External Impacts
- 2001 Field Restrictions (FMD outbreak):
  - No site visitors Feb–May 2001; sampling proceeded under an approved protocol with limited access.
  - Minor disruption to field activities (e.g., first biocide application in May missed).
- Personnel and Site Management Changes:
  - Change of Officer in Charge in May 2001; potential impact on sampling cadence and protocol adherence.
- These factors necessitated careful interpretation of 2001 data and normalization steps to maintain comparability with prior years.

## Implications for Data Strategy
- Demonstrates the importance of robust, standardized data collection protocols across years and treatments to enable valid cross-year analyses.
- Highlights the need for clear metadata and documentation of site events (access restrictions, staff changes) that affect data continuity.
- Underlines value of centralized data management and quality checks (e.g., cross-surveyor consistency, normalization of biomass data) to preserve data integrity.
- Suggests that data assets (e.g., soil pH, biomass, species abundances, weather data) can support broader analyses of how management actions (N, lime, biocides) influence productivity, soil chemistry, and biodiversity over time.
