# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Data collected 1998–2001 to contextualize detailed studies; includes weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition.
- Documentation emphasizes comparability across years and links between treatments and outcomes; period includes management disruptions (FMD restrictions) and a change in site leadership.

## Key Datasets and Variables
- Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001)
  - Headline measures: rainfall, radiation, average temperatures, soil moisture content.
  - Data downloaded regularly and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH, Merlewood.
- Above-ground biomass (1999–2001)
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
  - Five mowing periods per summer; biomass weights from 0.5 m2 cells per sub-plot; data summed annually and ln-transformed for analysis.
  - Findings: biomass hierarchy by treatment; peak production in July/August; 2001 biomass higher overall, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Statistical analyses: split-plot ANOVA; significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; year-by-year interaction; no significant block effects.
- Soil pH (top 5 cm)
  - Lime increased pH to ~6.19 (limed) and ~6.38 (N&L) by Oct 2001; nitrogen also raised pH but less, control unchanged since baseline (Aug 1998).
- Botanical composition (Point Quadrat surveys)
  - July 2001 survey replicated July 2000 methodology; independent surveyors showed no significant scoring differences.
  - Increased total hits in 2001 (58% higher than 2000) across treatments, suggesting denser sward after grazing removal in 1998.
  - Species-level shifts by treatment: decline of Agrostis capillaris across most treatments; Festuca spp. increased; fertilised plots favored Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; unimproved plots showed greater diversity (24 species) than improved plots (18 species).
  - Multivariate analysis: PCA shows separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; biomass positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, negatively with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis.
  - Biomass versus species abundance: higher biomass associated with increased frequency of litter and certain grasses; litter incorporation linked to higher turnover with increased soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed across site columns with differing surface pH; central plots (e.g., N&L plots) tended to have higher biomass.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences between blocks in biomass.

## Data Collection and Management Details
- Schedule and scope
  - Table 1 documents data collection dates and types (soil sampling, measurements, and measurements across multiple years).
  - Extensive field activities from 1998–2001, including regular soil sampling, mowing, and botanical surveys.
- Protocols and quality checks
  - Standardized mowing protocol (Kubota mower, ~6 cm sward height) with random quadrats for biomass and point quadrats for species.
  - Point Quadrat survey used two surveyors per year to assess reproducibility; differences not statistically significant.
  - Weather data and measurements centrally managed; data managers coordinate data transfer and storage.

## Data Processing, Quality, and Analysis
- Biomass data handling
  - Annual biomass totals computed from five summer cuts per plot; natural log transformation applied for ANOVA.
  - Normalisation against the C1 (reference) treatment to compare relative treatment effects across years.
- Analytical methods
  - ANOVA (split-plot) to assess treatment, year, and interaction effects on biomass.
  - PCA used to explore shifts in species composition by treatment.
  - Correlation analyses between species abundance (hits) and above-ground biomass to infer ecological responses.
- Documentation and reproducibility
  - Species codes and abbreviations standardized (e.g., Ac for Agrostis capillaris, Fr for Festuca rubra, etc.).
  - Appendix includes annual biomass data and a comprehensive data appendix for 2001.

## Governance, Storage, and Sharing Considerations for Data Stewards
- Centralized data management
  - Weather data and site measurements transmitted to CEH data manager; implies need for a robust metadata framework and data lineage tracking.
- Metadata and data dictionaries
  - Clear definitions for plot/treatment codes, species codes, measurement protocols, and data transformation steps (e.g., ln-transformations, normalization against C1) are essential.
- Documentation and provenance
  - Maintain records of management disruptions (FMD restrictions), staffing changes, and measurement-method changes (manual vs mechanical cutting) to contextualize data trends.
- Data accessibility
  - Current documentation indicates data stewardship through a site data manager but does not specify public access; ensure clear data access pathways, data sharing agreements, and versioning for future reuse.
- Data quality and interoperability
  - Consistent data collection schedules and methods across years; standardized plant identification and abundance measures; cross-year comparability is vital.
- Recommendations for future datasets
  - Preserve complete data dictionaries, measurement protocols, and processing steps.
  - Archive all raw and processed data with clear relinkable identifiers (plot, sub-plot, treatment, year).
  - Capture context for any methodological changes and site management events that affect data.

## Notable Challenges and Lessons for Data Stewards
- Management disruptions
  - FMD-related access restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change in site officer affected sampling and potentially data continuity.
- Methodological changes
  - Switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001 likely inflated biomass estimates; necessitates explicit documentation and appropriate normalization/adjustment.
- Spatial heterogeneity
  - Observed heterogeneity across site columns requires careful spatial metadata and potential consideration in downstream analyses or meta-analyses.

## Endnotes
- The report documents comprehensive, multi-year datasets on weather, biomass, soil pH, and vegetation composition with explicit treatment contrasts and robust analytical approaches, underscoring the importance of detailed metadata, standardized protocols, and careful documentation of site management events for long-term data stewardship.
