# Background

- Context: The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focused on intensive study of a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, to understand soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms. The programme funded 24 projects examining soil structure, processes (carbon and nitrogen cycles), micro- and macro-fauna, and their ecological roles.
- Data set overview: The dataset P2109_VIEW_SOIL_TREATMENTS.csv documents the range of soil plot treatments at Sourhope from 1999–2001, with additional data for 2001–2004. This dataset can be used with other experimental datasets from the site as explanatory variables.
- Source and references: Data described in the SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003 (Scott et al., 2003). Available via the EIDC catalogue. Columns include treatment date, block, main plot, sub-plot, cell coordinates, treatment type, and dosage.

## Dataset details

- File: P2109_VIEW_SOIL_TREATMENTS.csv
- Timeframe: 1999–2001 (primary), with 2001–2004 additional data
- Key columns:
  - TREATMENT_DATE, Description
  - BLOCK, Description
  - MAIN_PLOT, Description
  - SUB_PLOT, Description
  - CELL_X, CELL_Y, Description
  - TREATMENT_TYPE, Description
  - DOSAGE, Description
- Context: Data intended to support analysis of how different plot treatments affect soil biota and processes; designed for use alongside other experimental data.

## Treatments

- Site-level treatment: Vegetation cutting
  - Five cuts documented across years 1999–2002 (Cuts 1–5)
  - Dates vary by year; note a period (*) in 2001 where mowing was unavailable due to mechanical breakdown
- Plot-level treatments (six types)
  1) Control 1 — No treatment
  2) Control 2 — No treatment
  3) Nitrogen — NH4NO3 fertilizer
     - Annual rate: 24 g m-2 (5.76 kg plot-1; 240 kg ha-1)
     - Applied in two doses per year; yearly timing specified (e.g., 1999 Spring and Late Summer; etc.)
     - Nitrogen content: Total N 34%, Ammonical N 17.2%, Nitrate N 17.3%
  4) Lime — CaCO3 (powdered lime)
     - Annual rate: 600 g m-2 (144 kg plot-1; 6000 kg ha-1)
     - One application per year, in Spring
     - Calcium oxide ash ~0.5% (insoluble)
  5) Nitrogen and Lime — combination of the above
  6) Insecticide — Dursban 4 OPA
     - Rate: 0.15 ml m-2 (equates to 36 ml in 10 L plot-1; 1.5 L ha-1)
     - Annual rate: 7.5 L ha-1
     - Timing: after mowing as weather permitted; multiple applications per year in 1999–2002 with varying schedules
- Note: All treatment year schedules and exact dates are provided in the dataset and accompanying handbook.

## Data access, provenance and notes

- Handbook and data source: Scott et al., 2003; Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003
- Availability: Supporting Information via the EIDC catalogue
- Data quality and liability: NERC states that, despite quality assurance processes, it cannot warrant accuracy or fitness for a specific use and disclaims liability for outcomes arising from use of the data.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis

- The dataset provides standardized, plot-level treatment data that can be used as explanatory variables in analyses of soil biodiversity, structure, and biogeochemical processes.
- It supports cross-dataset comparisons within the Sourhope site and can be integrated with other experimental data to assess treatment effects over time.
- For analysts monitoring environmental health and policy performance, this dataset demonstrates a rigorous, documented approach to data collection, coding, and storage, with explicit treatment protocols and temporal coverage.
