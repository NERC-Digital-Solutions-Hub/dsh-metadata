REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide context for diverse studies via broad-scale monitoring across multiple years (1999–2001).
- Treatments included controls and nutrient/manipulation regimes: Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen+Lime (N&L), and Biocide; with two control plots.
- Focus on linking above-ground production, soil chemistry, and botanical community to spatial and temporal patterns.

## Data collection and site context
- Measurements and data types documented in detail, including:
  - Above-ground biomass production from multiple mowing events per year.
  - Soil surface pH (0–5 cm depth) and changes over time.
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2000 and July 2001) with species-level hits.
  - Weather data from a nearby Automatic Weather Station (1999–2001).
  - Ongoing site management activities and protocol adherence, including sampling schedules.
- Spatial framework involves a grid of plots/columns with multiple blocks and subplots to assess treatment effects and heterogeneity.
- Notable 2001 events: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site visits (Feb–May 2001); change of officer in charge; overall management continued with adjusted protocols.

## Key results by measurement

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data: rainfall near long-term average after very wet preceding year; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across sampling periods; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than 1999–2000, likely due to a change in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalising biomass to the Control1 (C1) year-by-year shows:
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime additions generally increased biomass relative to unimproved plots.
  - Nitrogen+Lime most effectively boosted productivity.
- Statistical findings: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots; significant year×treatment interaction; no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise surface pH (0–5 cm):
  - Limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen+Lime plots ~6.38 (October 2001).
  - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 survey replicated by two surveyors with no significant inter-surveyor difference; 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting denser sward (likely due to reduced grazing since 1998).
- Treatment-driven shifts in species composition (relative abundance, not species identity):
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001, remaining dominant only in Control1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; more frequent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N&L (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more evident in fertilised plots, especially N+L.
  - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated controls.
- Diversity: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; improved (N/L and/or N&L) plots had 18–19 species, suggesting diversity change with fertility enhancement.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) indicated:
  - Clear separation of improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots.
  - Increased frequency of Festuca rubra in limed plots; associations with Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Biomass correlations: higher biomass linked with increased presence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with rising biomass.
- Litter presence increased in N and/or Lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- Spatial variation observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F exhibited more acidic conditions, with underrepresented improved plots; underlying spatial heterogeneity suspected across columns.
  - Biomass distribution tended to be higher in centrally located plots and correlated with higher soil pH.
- No significant differences in biomass among blocks, reinforcing the influence of local heterogeneity and treatment effects within plots.

## GIS-relevant insights and data products
- The dataset supports map-based visualization of:
  - Spatial distribution of above-ground biomass by plot and treatment over time.
  - Surface soil pH maps and pH change trajectories under lime and N+L treatments.
  - Species abundance patterns by plot, with PCA-derived ordination to show treatment-driven community shifts.
  - Seasonal biomass dynamics across the mowing seasons (1999–2001).
- Potential GIS applications:
  - Spatial modeling of fertility-driven productivity and its relation to soil chemistry.
  - Overlay of weather variables with biomass and pH to assess interactions.
  - Visualization of site heterogeneity and treatment gradients to guide sampling designs and extrapolation to larger landscapes.

## End notes
- The 2001 operational changes (FMD restrictions, personnel shift) are acknowledged as influencing data (notably biomass measurements) and were accounted for in analyses (e.g., normalisation against C1 year).
- The report provides a comprehensive, year-by-year context, linking management actions, environmental conditions, and biological responses across spatially defined treatments.
