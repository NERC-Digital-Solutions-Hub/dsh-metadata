  - Cg 70–100 cm: Light reddish brown; clay loam; massive; very abundant igneous stones.
- Auger samples (Block 4 species of horizon-by-horizon analysis):
  - FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx horizons show increasing depletion of N with depth; C contents high at surface (Ah) and decreasing with depth; C:N ratios typically in the 12–20 range depending on horizon.
  - Exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K) and bases vary with horizon and block; Ca tends to be higher near surface in Block 4 Ah and FH horizons; pH H2O generally acidic (roughly 4.5–5.0 range); CaCl2 pH typically slightly lower.
  - %Moisture loss and LOI high in upper horizons (LoI around 60–75% in some surface horizons for LOI estimates; moisture loss generally in single digits to around 10% in deeper horizons).
- Auger samples (Block 5):
  - Similar vertical pattern: surface horizons rich in organic content (higher %C and %N early on), decreasing with depth; C:N ratios around 10–15 in several horizons; Ca, Mg, K, Na values vary with horizon, often higher Ca near transitional horizons; pH values generally acidic (H2O ~4.5–5.0; CaCl2 ~3.8–4.1).
  - Depth sequence shows distinct horizon transitions (Ah, AB, Bg/BCg, Cg) with mottling and clayeous textures increasing with depth.
- ECOTRON site:
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT):
    - Weight: 6.089 mg
    - %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N Ratio: 13.83
    - Exchangeable bases: Ca 2.76, Na 0.15, K 0.62, Mg 1.7
    - %Moisture loss: 4.79; %LOI: 17.42
    - pH(H2O): 4.79; pH(CaCl2): 3.82
  - Vegetation survey data for ECOTRON plot show species counts by subplots with a mix of grasses and forbs, indicating ongoing vegetation structure within the controlled environment.

## Soil analyses and results (summary highlights)

- Block 4 and Block 5 profiles show:
  - Predominantly acidic soils with pH approximately 4.5–5.0 in water; somewhat lower in CaCl2 extracts.
  - High organic matter in Ah/A horizon regions, decreasing with depth.
  - Carbon content highest near surface horizons (Ah/FH) and decreasing into subsoil horizons (AB, Bg/BCg, Cg).
  - C:N ratios generally moderate (roughly 12–20 across horizons), reflecting organic matter decomposition status.
  - Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, and trace Na vary by horizon and block, with surface horizons often richer in Ca and base cations, diminishing with depth.
- Auger and horizon-specific data show detailed, horizon-by-horizon chemistry and mineralogy, including mottling and stone content, consistent with gleying and varying drainage conditions.

## Vegetation surveys (summary)

- Vegetation data accompany soil profiles to document plant community structure in relation to soil horizons and depth and to track changes under long-term monitoring.
- Block 4 and Block 5 plots contain a mix of grasses and forbs, with dominant grasses such as Agrostis capillaris and Festuca species appearing repeatedly; species totals per plot and subplots indicate diverse, multi-species assemblages across horizons.
- ECOTRON plots show vegetation counts across subplots, illustrating responses to controlled environmental conditions and enabling linkage between soil chemistry and plant communities.

## Data management and governance

- Data are organized by block, horizon, and subplot; multiple Appendices provide comprehensive, horizon-level data tables.
- Metadata considerations are evident across the dataset:
  - Detailed horizon descriptions, sample IDs, and laboratory measurements accompany the profiles.
  - Data archiving and traceability are central, with unique MLURI barcodes and precise depth and horizon delineations.
- Noted data challenges:
  - Complex field data with numerous horizons and sub-samples; complete metadata and cross-block comparability are essential for robust cross-site analyses.
  - Some horizon and sub-sample data may be fragmented or incomplete in the publicly shared formats, underscoring the need for thorough metadata governance and standardized data sharing practices.

## Practical implications for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates a systematic, multi-block soil monitoring approach with standardized horizon coding, depth intervals, and comprehensive chemical and physical analyses.
- Integrates soil profiles with vegetation surveys to enable analysis of soil-vegetation interdependencies and ecosystem responses over time.
- Highlights the value of:
  - Detailed horizon-level data (composition, structure, moisture, LOI, pH, exchangeable bases) for soil health assessment.
  - Cross-site comparability via consistent subsoil and apical horizon sampling and classification (e.g., Ah, AB, Bg/BCg, Cg; ECOTRON plots).
  - Robust data governance: complete metadata, archiving (e.g., MLURI barcodes), and transparent data sharing to support long-term monitoring and re-use.
- For monitoring framework authors, the document underscores:
  - The importance of linking physical soil profiles to chemical properties and vegetation data to infer ecological processes.
  - Designing experiments that capture depth-dependent variability and drainage-related horizon differences.
  - Building governance around data standardization, metadata completeness, and accessible, well-documented archives to facilitate future reuse and cross-site comparisons.
