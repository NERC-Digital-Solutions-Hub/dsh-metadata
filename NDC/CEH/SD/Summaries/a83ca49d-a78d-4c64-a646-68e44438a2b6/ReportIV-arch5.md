# SUMMARY

- The report covers four years of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site, focusing on how above-ground biomass production, species composition, and diversity respond to different management treatments.
- The Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) implements a controlled, replicated field experiment to understand links between soil biodiversity and plant communities under varied management. A wide range of projects (Phase I and II) contributed data, with botanical, soil, and environmental measurements.

## Data Assets and Experimental Design

- Site layout and treatments
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site with 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; several sub-plots are allocated to different research groups using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
  - Plot-level treatments (five in total): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime; Insecticide (formerly Biocide) is applied to a separate set of plots.
  - Site-level management includes monthly mowing (to ~6 cm) across the whole site.
- Data types and collection
  - Above-ground biomass: regular harvests in May–Sept each year, with 0.5 m2 sampling cells per plot; dried at 80°C and weighed.
  - Botany surveys: baseline (July 1998) using a 0.5 m2 quadrat, followed by annual point analyses (2000–2002) using a 100-hole grid per cell, recording species touched by a pin.
  - Soil and microhabitat: soil pH (0–5 cm depth, on-site measurements), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), and other environmental variables.
  - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station records (temperature, rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, etc.) since February 1999.
  - Biodiversity data: species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes) with bryophyte species identified more precisely in 2002; Appendix 3 contains a full species list.
- Data scope and volume
  - Data spans 1998–2002 with ongoing monitoring and multiple surveys per year; soil samples total around 11,621 collected since the start of the experiment (as of 2002).
  - Appendix 5 provides weather summaries; Appendix 6–8 provide biomass, species abundance, and survey results by plot and year.
- Data processing and analyses
  - Biomass data are summarized annually per plot; annual biomass is analyzed with split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 6) to assess treatment, year, and their interaction.
  - Point analysis data are analyzed via PCA with treatment-level ranking; functional groups (stress-tolerators, competitive-stress-ruderals, and stress-ruderal-competitive types) assessed over time.
  - Relationships among soil pH, moisture, and productivity explored (Figures 3–4); correlations examined across treatments and years.

## Key Findings (from the study)

- Mowing effects
  - Regular mowing (6 cm sward height) and the absence of grazing led to a general expansion of stress-tolerant species and bryophytes, with a decline in certain grasses (e.g., Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis) that declined by over 40% since 2000.
  - Unfertilised plots show potential nutrient loss from clipping and disturbance dynamics that may favor less nutrient-demanding, stress-tolerant species.
- Fertilisation effects
  - Nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently increase above-ground biomass productivity, with the largest gains in plots fertilised with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Very high lime application raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in 2002, which may reduce productivity if pH increases beyond the optimum and/or reduces soil moisture; potential chlorosis observed in lime-treated plots in 2002.
  - A shift in functional groups occurs: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) expand in nitrogen-and-lime plots, while stress-tolerant species dominate unimproved plots; the response patterns indicate soil pH and moisture interplay with nutrient status.
- Insecticide effects
  - The insecticide treatment (Dursban) corresponds with higher plant diversity in some analyses, but establishing a direct causal link to diversity is cautioned due to limited information on the exact nature of insect control and broader ecological interactions.
  - Patterns suggest reduced herbivory may allow more palatable species to persist, maintaining higher diversity where fertility remains relatively low.
- Trampling and plot-level dynamics
  - In 2002, newly established C2 plots (receiving increased trampling from 13CO2 pulse experiments) show notably lower productivity, highlighting how recent disturbances can suppress growth in certain plots.
- Community composition and functional groups
  - Point analyses show shifts in dominance among grasses associated with improved pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses) expand across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, aided by consistent mowing and lack of grazing.
  - Shannon diversity indices reveal increasing treatment-related differences from 2000 onward, with nitrogen-and-lime plots often showing the strongest changes in species composition.
  - The majority of live vascular plant hits across years can be categorized into three functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR), with notable treatment-driven differences by 2002.

## Data Accessibility, Documentation, and Appendices

- Documentation and site maps
  - Appendix 1 provides a map of site and plot treatments; Appendix 2 details site-level and plot-level treatments (including application dates and rates for Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide).
- Data and metadata
  - Appendix 3 lists the full flora and bryophyte species observed in 2002; Appendix 4 summarizes site activity (sampling, measurement, and other activities by year).
  - Appendix 5 contains headline weather data since the project start; Appendix 6–8 present annual biomass, rank analyses, and species-hits data by plot and year.
  - The Soil Biodiversity website and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) contact points are provided for data access and project details.
- Data quality and limitations
  - Data collection followed consistent protocols (e.g., 80°C drying of biomass; standardized 0.5 m2 sampling units; baseline and annual point surveys).
  - 2002 weather data include gaps due to a station malfunction (July–November); data from Konza were substituted for missing periods; 2001 site access was affected by foot-and-mouth disease restrictions.

## Considerations for Data Stewards

- Data governance and provenance
  - Multi-project integration: Data originate from Phase I and Phase II projects; cross-project data curation and consistent metadata are essential for interoperability and reuse.
  - Maintain a comprehensive data dictionary linking plot-level treatments, year, sampling method, and units of measure (e.g., biomass in grams per m2, pH, moisture percentages).
- Metadata and cataloging
  - Ensure mapping of treatments to plots (Appendix 1 and 2) and the spatial layout per block; capture versioning of plot treatments across years where applicable.
  - Document measurement protocols (e.g., clipping method, drying temperature, point-analysis procedures) to enable reproducibility.
- Data quality and QA
  - Preserve QA notes for anomalies (e.g., 2002 weather data gaps, trampling effects in C2 plots, chlorosis in lime-treated plots).
  - Record data origin (field notebooks, lab measurements, automated weather data) and any data cleaning steps.
- Data accessibility and sharing
  - Align data sharing with project governance; provide datasets and metadata to central repository; reference the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contacts for access.
  - Consider publishing select datasets (biomass time series, species-hits matrices, soil pH/moisture data) with clear lineage and documentation to support reuse by other researchers.
- Long-term stewardship and interoperability
  - Preserve Appendix-level data (species lists, treatment schedules, and site activity) for future meta-analyses and cross-site comparisons.
  - Use controlled vocabularies for species names, functional group classifications (S, CSR, SR/CSR), and treatment labels to facilitate cross-study integration.

- Overall, the document exemplifies a rich, multi-layered dataset environment (biomass, flora, bryophytes, soils, weather, and site activity) with robust documentation and a clear path for data reuse by Data Stewards aiming to ensure governance, discoverability, and interoperability across long-term biodiversity and ecosystem studies.
