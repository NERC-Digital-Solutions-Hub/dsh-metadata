# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders; designed to provide broad contextual data for groups and year-to-year comparisons.
- Baseline data survey conducted Nov 1998; monitoring across years to link with detailed studies.
- 2001 site management changes: government restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (Feb–May) with a formal protocol for visits; an officer-in-charge changed in May 2001.

## Data collected and methods
- Field site: 1998–2001 data collection with repeated measurements to support cross-year comparisons (as described in Baseline Data Survey 1998).
- Main measurements and timing:
  - Above-ground biomass: harvested at five summer cuts per year (1999–2001); 0.5 m^2 sample areas within sub-plots; dried at 80°C; totals summed per plot and log-transformed for analysis.
  - Soil sampling: upper 0–5 cm soil pH measured; 40 ml of de-ionized water mixed with ~0.25 g soil per sample; samples collected from plots at multiple times.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat method in July (2001 mirrored 2000); 100-cell frame with 25 pins per cell; species hits recorded to estimate relative abundances.
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station on site; daily downloads; headline data include rainfall, radiation, and temperatures (air at 2 m and soil at various depths).
- Data processing and analysis:
  - Biomass analyses involve ln-transformations; ANOVA used to test treatment and year effects; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to plot-level species data.
  - Species names coded (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; Poa pratensis = Pp; etc.).
- Management observations and notes:
  - A shift in mowing from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001; this is linked to a substantial rise in biomass estimates in 2001.
  - Surveyors validated consistency between observers in 2001 (no significant difference).

## Key results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable after a very wet year prior.
- Rainfall in 2001 near long-term average; total radiation similar to prior years; average air and soil temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production across the sampling period; peak biomass consistently in July–August.
- 2001 biomass substantially higher than previous years, likely due to the change to mechanical cutting and possible staff effects.
- Normalising against the control (C1) showed nitrogen and lime (N and/or L) additions consistently boost productivity; N plus lime (N&L) often the most effective.
- Statistical findings: biomass data (ln-transformed) show significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year × treatment interaction; no significant differences between blocks.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continues to raise top-soil pH (0–5 cm):
  - Limed plots: average pH ~6.19.
  - Nitrogen plus Lime (N&L) plots: average pH ~6.38.
- Nitrogen-alone also increases pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots show little change since baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- 2001 Point Quadrat results:
  - Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density, possibly related to the removal of grazing since 1998.
  - Species composition shifts with treatments:
    - Agrostis capillaris (Ac) declined across all treatments, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
    - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; F. rubra especially prominent in N and N&L plots.
    - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Poa pratensis (Pp) and Festuca rubra–related associations; unimproved plots remained more dominated by species linked to poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Species diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in the Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots, suggesting a trend toward reduced diversity with improved fertility.
  - PCA (2001 survey) generally separates nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots cluster together with bryophytes and species associated with lower fertility, while improved plots show more taxa linked to fertile pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
  - Biomass correlations: higher above-ground biomass correlates positively with the relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis decline as biomass increases.
  - Litter production increases in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with greater soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed across the site:
  - Columns E and F (slope-facing) tended to be more acidic; underlying spatial heterogeneity linked to plot treatments and column position.
  - Biomass variation showed that centrally located plots often had higher cumulative biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - A strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant difference in biomass between blocks (statistical test results indicate no block effect).

## Data notes and quality
- Data consistency and observer reliability: no significant inter-observer differences in 2001 Point Quadrat surveys.
- Data interpretation considerations:
  - A notable biomass increase in 2001 is likely influenced by methodological changes (switch to mechanical cutting) in addition to treatment effects.
  - FMD-related access restrictions affected sample collection timing and site visitation early in 2001 but management activities continued under the Site Management Plan.
- Data breadth:
  - Multiyear time series (1998–2001) across treatments (Control 1 & 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide) with repeated biomass measures, soil pH, botanical surveys, and continuous weather data.
  - Tables and figures (not reproduced here) document annual biomass, pH changes, species hits, PCA results, and biomass–pH relationships.
