# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment on soil biodiversity at Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Baseline and broad monitoring described in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998); aims to contextualise more detailed studies and allow cross-year comparisons.
- Two notable 2001 events affected management: (1) UK Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions limited site visits Feb–May; (2) change of the Officer in Charge.
- Measurements span automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, enabling cross-treatment and cross-year comparisons.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near the long-term average; total annual radiation similar to prior years.
- Average temperatures slightly lower; average soil moisture content somewhat higher than in previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Treatments show a consistent hierarchy in biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of personnel change and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Biomass analyses: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
- Nitrogen and Lime (especially N+L) most effectively boosted biomass; results shown after normalising against the C1 baseline.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raises surface soil pH (top 5 cm): average pH ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
- Nitrogen alone also increases soil pH, though less strongly than lime.
- Control plots show little change from baseline (Aug 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis (replicates ~50% each by surveyor) showed no significant assessor bias; 58% more hits in 2001 vs 2000, suggesting denser sward (potentially due to grazing stock removal in 1998).
- Clear treatment differences in the most common species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and in N+L (Festuca rubra).
  - Species associated with improved grassland (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were most apparent in fertilised plots (especially N+L).
  - Species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more prevalent in untreated Control plots.
- Diversity changes: unimproved plots harboured 24 species; improved N+L plots contained 18 species, suggesting a potential early decline in diversity in more fertile plots.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicates:
  - Clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Improved plots tend to cluster with higher presence of Festuca rubra and related species (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis).
- Biomass vs species abundance: higher biomass correlates positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; opposite trend for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis.
- Litter: increased frequency in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3. Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: Columns E and F displayed more acidic plots, potentially exaggerated by a higher proportion of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
- Evidence supports underlying spatial variability across the site, with lower pH associated with certain columns (notably nitrogen- and/or lime-improved plots in these areas).

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Biomass distribution shows outliers with particularly low biomass in several plots, while central-site plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., N+L 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks (statistical tests reported as NS in the appendix).

## Key Insights for Data-driven decision-making
- Fertiliser treatments (nitrogen and lime, especially combined) consistently boost above-ground biomass and shift plant communities toward species associated with improved pastures.
- Soil chemistry (pH) responds to lime and nitrogen application, with liming markedly increasing pH and correlating with higher biomass.
- Biodiversity metrics indicate a potential early decline in species richness in more fertilised plots, with a shift toward a dominance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
- Spatial heterogeneity within the site interacts with treatment effects; pH and centrality on the farm influence biomass outcomes.
- 2001 field conditions (staff changes and mechanical cutting) influenced biomass measurements, underscoring the importance of accounting for operational factors when interpreting year-to-year data.
