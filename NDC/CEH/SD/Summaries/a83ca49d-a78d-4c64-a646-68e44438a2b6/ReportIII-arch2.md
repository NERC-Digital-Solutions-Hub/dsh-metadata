# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and scope
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies.
  - Aimed to present data in a consistent format to enable year-to-year health and policy performance comparisons.
  - Monitoring covered weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with data shared to enable cross-study links.

- Monitoring approach and data types
  - Automatic Weather Station data: rainfall, solar radiation, temperatures, soil moisture (regularly transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager).
  - Above-ground biomass: multi-year mowing and biomass collection; analyses normalized to a control plot (C1) to compare treatment effects.
  - Soil pH: measurements from surface 0–5 cm soil, tracking effects of lime and nitrogen additions.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) to assess species relative abundance; cross-checked by two surveyors for consistency.
  - Site management and protocol: standardized measurement timings; 2001 activity affected by external events (Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions) and a change in site officer.

- Management context and challenges in 2001
  - Government restrictions during February–May 2001 limited site visits; operations continued under an agreed timetable with veterinary oversight.
  - Change of site officer in May 2001.
  - Biocide application schedule partly disrupted (one application missed in May 2001) but remaining management activities continued as planned.

- Key findings (2001 results)

  - Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near the long-term average after a very wet previous year.
    - Radiation similar to historical levels; average temperatures slightly lower than prior years.
    - Soil moisture content modestly higher in 2001.

  - Above-ground biomass
    - Biomass shows a consistent treatment hierarchy; peak production typically in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to change in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - When normalized to C1, nitrogen and/or lime treatments show stronger biomass responses.
    - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L) versus unimproved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

  - Soil pH
    - Lime addition raises surface soil pH; October 2001 means: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen plus lime plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent; control plots show little change since 1998 baseline.

  - Botanical composition (July 2001 survey)
    - No significant difference between the two surveyors in 2001; total hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting increased sward density after grazing removals in 1998.
    - Species shifts by treatment:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments; most abundant in control plots.
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in nitrogen and/or lime plots.
      - Fertilised plots (especially N and/or N+L) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots retained species associated with poorer pasture (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity: unimproved plots hosted 24 species; improved plots (N and/or L) had 18 species, suggesting possible early diversity reduction in the most improved plots.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) shows clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from unimproved plots; biomass increases correlate with higher abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while certain other species decline with higher biomass.
    - Indicators of vegetation turnover: increased litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, consistent with faster turnover at higher soil fertility.
  
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Spatial variation observed: columns E and F tended to be more acidic; underlying heterogeneity across the site influences pH and plant community composition in certain columns.
  - Biomass distribution shows outliers with particularly low biomass in several plots, while central site plots tend to have higher biomass.
  - Positive relationship between surface soil pH and biomass observed; no strong block effect detected, indicating site-wide heterogeneity rather than uniform block differences driving results.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data use
  - Treatments that increase soil fertility (nitrogen and lime) consistently boost biomass and shift plant communities toward more productive, improved pastures.
  - Soil chemistry (pH) responds predictably to liming and nitrogen, influencing vegetation structure and turnover.
  - Heterogeneity across field plots must be accounted for when interpreting treatment effects; spatial patterns can modulate observed responses.
  - Changes in management and survey workload (e.g., staffing, cutting methods) can affect biomass measurements and should be considered in longitudinal analyses.

- Acknowledgements and data considerations
  - Data collection and analyses underscored by collaborations among MLURI staff, field technicians, and surveyors; weather data actively integrated into ongoing Soil Biodiversity monitoring.
  - The report demonstrates how standardized monitoring permits cross-year comparisons and links to broader ecological investigations within the field programme.
