# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

## Overview
- Detailed physical, chemical, and biological profiling of Block 4 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope, integrated with nearby ECOTRON and Block 5 data.
- Data include soil profile descriptions, horizon-by-horizon lab measurements (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH), auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- Aimed at understanding soil biodiversity, nutrient distributions, and their relationships with vegetation and management treatments within the Sourhope gradient.

## Block 4: Auger Samples
- 4A–4F horizons: %N 0.56–0.58; %C 7.00–8.02; C:N 12.62–14.26; Ca 1.11–5.07 meq/100g; Na generally low; K 0.58–0.83; Mg 0.67–3.50; %Moisture loss 4.46–5.15; LOI 15.33–17.96; pH H2O 4.45–4.93; pH CaCl2 3.64–4.14.

## Block 4: Vegetation Survey
- Subplots 4A–4F show species totals per plot with varying counts and compositions.
- Indicators include presence of grasses and forbs; counts reflect a mix of common upland grassland taxa and some dicots, consistent with upland acid grasslands and stony soils.
- Overall pattern aligns with a mosaic of upland bryophyte- and grass-dominated communities typical of Sourhope's hilly pasture context.

## Data Management and Long-Term Context
- Samples archived (e.g., CEH Merlewood) with metadata and horizon nomenclature documented.
- Randomised design and block-averaging used to mitigate plot-level noise; integrated across blocks to inform ECN/Micronet objectives.
- Data contribute to baseline understanding of soil biodiversity, soil-plant relationships, and the influence of soil depth and mineralogy on vegetation in Sourhope’s experimental gradients.

## Endnotes (Appendices)
- Appendices provide block-level detail for soil and vegetation (Block 4 and Block 5 datasets), horizon descriptions, and site grid references.
- ECOTRON data interlink soil context with controlled-environment experiments to study soil–biota–environment interactions in Sourhope.
