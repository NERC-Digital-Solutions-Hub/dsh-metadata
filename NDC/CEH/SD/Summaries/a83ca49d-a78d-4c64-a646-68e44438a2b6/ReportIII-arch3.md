# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed studies.
  - Aimed to identify measures providing useful insight for evaluating policies and guiding future decisions, with data intended to be shared and used across research groups.
  - 2001 management events affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions (restricted site access) and a change of officer in charge, with some impacts on sampling timetables and procedures.

- Monitoring design and methods
  - Site: Sourhope Field Experiment, established baseline in 1998; monitoring prescribed to contextualise detailed studies.
  - Measurements and timing:
    - Automatic Weather Station data collected on site (1999–2001).
    - Above-ground biomass: multi-year, summer harvests (May–September) with five cuts per year; biomass per plot calculated and analyzed.
    - Soil pH: measurements in the upper 5 cm of soil (baseline 1998; follow-ups in 2001).
    - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July (2000 and 2001) to assess species presence and abundance; 100-cell quadrats with 25 pin insertions per cell.
  - Experimental design: plots with treatments including nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, biocide, plus controls; subplots within blocks; data analysed with split-plot ANOVA and PCA.
  - Data handling and governance: results prepared to enable cross-year comparisons and data sharing; metadata quality and standardisation emphasized, with transparency about surveyor consistency and measurement protocols.

- Key results by measure
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Headline measures largely unremarkable; rainfall near long-term annual average; slight cooling compared to prior years; soil moisture modestly higher.
  - Above-ground biomass (1999–2001)
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy across years; peak biomass in July–August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, noted to be influenced by changes in personnel and shift from manual to mechanical cutting.
    - After normalising to control (C1), nitrogen and/or lime treatments showed the strongest positive effects on productivity.
    - ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.
    - Biomass increases positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance; declines observed for Agrostis capillaris in nitrogen and/or lime treatments; increased litter in N and/or lime plots indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime additions raised surface soil pH; October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen+lime plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; control plots remained near baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001 survey: 58% more hits than 2000; density likely increased due to reduced grazing since 1998.
    - Clear treatment effects: reduced dominance of Agrostis capillaris across treatments; Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) became more prevalent, particularly in fertilised plots (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra).
    - Species richness: unimproved plots harboured 24 species vs 18 in nitrogen+lime plots, suggesting potential early declines in diversity with greater management intensity.
    - Multivariate analysis (PCA) showed clear separation of plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime from control/biocide plots; dominant species shifts linked to fertility status; biomass correlation with species composition observed.
    - Biomass and species data together indicated faster turnover and litter accumulation in higher-fertility plots.
  
- Site heterogeneity and spatial variation
  - Spatial patterns in soil pH and plant communities observed across columns; some columns (E and F) tended to be more acidic, associated with unimproved or biocide treatments.
  - Biomass distribution showed central plots tend to have higher values; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant differences between blocks in biomass, suggesting within-site spatial heterogeneity is a key factor to account for in analyses.

- Data governance, quality, and dissemination notes
  - Data collection spanned multiple years with explicit documentation to support cross-year comparisons and integration with other studies.
  - Consistency checks showed no significant difference between surveyors in 2001 for botanical data.
  - The study underscores the importance of metadata completeness (e.g., recording treatment, plot, and survey details) and data management practices to enable transparency, replication, and sharing.
  - Public sharing of underlying data is a consideration, but data richness and transformation requirements can be barriers; standardised, well-documented datasets aid governance.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy decisions
  - Demonstrates the value of integrating multiple indicators (biomass productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community composition) to assess ecological responses to management interventions (N and lime).
  - Highlights the need to account for site heterogeneity and management changes (staff turnover, protocol shifts) when interpreting long-term monitoring data.
  - Indicates the importance of robust data governance: metadata quality, consistent sampling protocols, and accessible, well-documented datasets to support policy appraisal and decision-making.
  - The combination of univariate (ANOVA) and multivariate (PCA) analyses provides a framework for detecting treatment effects and community-level changes, aiding monitoring of environmental health and the effectiveness of nutrient management strategies.
