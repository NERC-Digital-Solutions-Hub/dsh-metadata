## Locations of sampled worker bumblebees across an agricultural landscape centred on the Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, UK

- Objective: Document locations of worker bumblebees from five species, using non-lethal DNA sampling to confirm species and assign individuals to full-sib groups (colonies) for spatial and genetic analyses.
- Study area: Agricultural landscape covering 1,950 hectares centered on the Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, Southern England, UK.
- Species sampled: Bombus terrestris (Bter), B. lapidarius (Blap), B. pascuorum (Bpas), B. hortorum (Bhor), B. ruderatus (Brud).
- Sampling design:
  - Landscape divided into 250 x 250 m grid cells; samples collected across all habitat patches within each cell.
  - Sampling intensity proportional to relative habitat cover of nesting/foraging habitats.
  - Sampling period: 20 June – 5 August 2011, 4–5 days per week.
  - Scope linked to agri-environment mitigation options established in 2005.
- Collection and genetic analysis:
  - Individuals captured with entomological nets.
  - DNA sampled non-lethally; genotyped and species/colony assigned using COLONY v2.0.
  - Geographic coordinates recorded with a Garmin Etrex 10 GPS (accuracy ~3 m); data read into ArcGIS and exported as an ESRI Shapefile.
  - Data checked for errors by the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) and the Institute of Zoology.
- Data products and structure:
  - ArcGIS shapefile containing 2,826 point records (one point per worker).
  - Underlying table (.dbf) readable by Excel or similar.
  - Shapefile attributes include:
    - FID: unique feature ID
    - Shape: point geometry
    - Sample_Cod: field-assigned sample code
    - Date: collection date
    - Time: collection time
    - GridRef: Ordnance Survey grid reference
    - Genetic_Sp: species confirmed by genetics (codes: Bter, Blap, Bpas, Bhor, Brud)
    - Colony: colony code from sibship assignment
    - Colony_Cod: unique colony code (species + sibship)
- Data quality and provenance:
  - Data generation followed standard genetic analysis protocols (Dreier et al.; Wang 2004).
  - Geographic data georeferenced to British National Grid; accuracy suitable for fine-scale spatial analyses.
  - Dataset curated and quality-checked at multiple stages by CEH and Institute of Zoology; stored as GIS-ready formats.
- Analytical potential:
  - Enables investigation of spatial genetic structure, colony distribution, and habitat associations at fine scales.
  - Facilitates cross-dataset integration with habitat maps and agri-environment management layers for correlational or predictive analyses.
