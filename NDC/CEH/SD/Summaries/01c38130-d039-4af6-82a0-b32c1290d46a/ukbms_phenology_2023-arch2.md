# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - A long-running, site-based monitoring program (since 1976) providing annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and monitoring.
  - Involves over 3,000 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across the flight season.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, single-species surveys, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species or life stages.
  - Regional coordination: each site is overseen by a transect coordinator who validates and quality-checks records.

- Nature of data collected (phenology)
  - Focus on timing of adult butterfly flight periods (phenology) derived from standard transect data.
  - Phenology metrics include FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, and FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
  - Limitations: because some sites are not surveyed weekly or within the full April 1–September 30 window, some metrics may be biased; alternative metrics (mean flight date and SD) are used to improve comparability.

- Quality control
  - Data entry via field forms, online UKBMS data site, or Transect Walker; automatic checks flag unusual values.
  - Regional transect coordinators review data and perform ongoing checks.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range records, records outside known flight periods, new site records, and anomalous abundances; corrections are applied as needed.

- Data download details
  - This download provides phenology data for all species across all standard transect sites and years with sufficient data.
  - Format: CSV with columns including SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
