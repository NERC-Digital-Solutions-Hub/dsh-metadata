# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A long-running, multi-organisational initiative funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Relies on volunteer data to monitor butterfly population status annually across the UK.
- Since 1976, with over 3,000 active sites each year, integrating data from multiple sampling methods to provide a national view for biodiversity policy questions.

## Data collection methods (sampling framework)
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September; weather conditions suitable for butterfly activity.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (including July/August), sampling common habitats like farmland.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts; egg and larval web counts) for specific species or life stages.
- Data from all methods are analyzed together to form the UKBMS dataset.

## Nature of the data collected
- Phenology focus: timing of adult butterfly flight periods recorded on standard transects.
- Phenology metrics include first/last observation dates, peak day and count, mean flight date, flight period standard deviation, and flight period range.
- Because WCBS and reduced effort surveys have fewer weekly counts, phenology metrics are primarily derived from standard transects to ensure comparability across sites and years.
- Metadata includes species names (binomial and common names), site identifiers, grid references, and year.

## Quality control
- Field data captured on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a centralized database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Additional automated/manual validation queries screen for out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, and first-time site records; edits are made to the main UKBMS dataset where needed.

## Details of this data download
