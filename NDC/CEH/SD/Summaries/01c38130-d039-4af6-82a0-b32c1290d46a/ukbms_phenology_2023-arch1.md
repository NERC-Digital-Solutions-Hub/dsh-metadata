# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A collaborative, funded program by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Relies on volunteers; provides annual population status data for UK butterflies.
  - Since 1976, data come from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring system with over 3,000 actively recorded sites each year.
  - Data types are analyzed together to understand population changes and inform biodiversity policy.

- Data collection methods
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) from April to September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August), sampling common habitats like farmland (about 800 squares/year).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods such as timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.

- Phenology data and metrics
  - Phenology focuses on timing of adult butterfly flight periods recorded on UKBMS transects.
  - Simple metrics: first and last observation dates, peak date, peak count, flight period length (first to last day).
  - Limitations: incomplete weekly coverage means some metrics may be biased; season runs April 1–Sept 30.
  - Alternative metrics used in other studies: mean flight date (weighted mean across season) and flight period standard deviation (synchronisation of flight period).

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators review data; further automated and manual validation checks for distribution, flight period, atypical abundances, and data entry errors.
  - Edits and corrections made through queries and coordination with recorders.
