# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; relies on volunteers and ongoing contributions.

- Purpose: provide annual population status data for butterflies to inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.

- Sampling framework:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (April–Sept), typically 26 visits per year, 2000+ sites (2022).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (with July/August emphasis); ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.

- Data relevance for policy: dataset supports understanding changes in insect populations and answering policy questions on status and trends; combines data from all sampling methods for analyses.

- Nature of the data (phenology-focused):
  - Phenology metrics refer to timing of adult butterfly flight periods (imago stage) on UKBMS transects.
  - Phenology calculations rely on standard transects with weekly counts; WCBS and reduced-effort data are less suitable for phenology.
  - Metrics include first day, last day, peak day, peak count, mean flight date, flight period standard deviation, and flight period range.

- Quality control and data management:
  - Field recording on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS site or Transect Walker; automated validation checks.
  - Regional transect coordinators review records for questionable entries; ongoing validation throughout the season.
  - Automated and manual validation checks for out-of-range records, atypical abundances, or records outside known distributions; data edits made as needed.

- Details of this data download:
  - Provides phenology data for all species across all standard transect sites and years with sufficient data.
  - Data delivered as a CSV file with columns: SITENO, SITENAME, GRIDREF, SPECIES_NAME, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, FIRSTDAY, LASTDAY, PEAKDAY, PEAKCOUNT, MEAN_FLIGHT_DATE, FLIGHTPERIOD_SD, FLIGHTPERIOD_RANGE.
