# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers and a large network of sites to monitor butterfly population status annually.
- The scheme combines data from multiple sampling frameworks to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding butterfly population trends and informing biodiversity policy.
- Since 1976, UKBMS has monitored changes across the UK with over 3,000 actively recorded sites per year.

## Data collection methods
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, 2–4 km, weekly counts (April to September), ~26 visits per year, across >2,000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (July/August plus encouraged spring visits), ~800 squares annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and other methods, including timed counts and egg/larval web counts, focused on specific species.

## Nature of data collected
- Focus on phenology: timing of adult butterfly flight periods across standard transects.
- Phenology metrics include: first/last recording dates, peak date and count, mean flight date, flight period standard deviation (SD), and flight period range (duration).
- Due to variable weekly coverage and season limits (April 1–Sept 30), some metrics may be less accurate for certain species; alternative phenology metrics are used when appropriate.
- Phenology data are derived from weekly counts on standard transects only.

## Quality control
- Field data are recorded on standard forms, then entered online or via Transect Walker, and uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic checks flag data entry errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate records and perform ongoing checks throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation includes cross-checks against known distributions and abnormal abundances; errors are corrected through queries and coordination with data providers.

## Particular Challenges
- Incomplete picture of user needs and priorities.
- Timely receipt of data from contributors.
- Ensuring data creators meet standards, including metadata.
- Interoperability across many systems and formats, including difficult ones.
- Handling large datasets and transferring large volumes of data.
- Dealing with outdated databases that require bespoke, non-interoperable solutions.
