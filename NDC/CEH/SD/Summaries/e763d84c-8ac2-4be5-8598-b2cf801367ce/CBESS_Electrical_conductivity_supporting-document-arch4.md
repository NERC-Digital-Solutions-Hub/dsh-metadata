# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil electrical conductivity on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Dataset overview
- Purpose: Electrical conductivity of topsoil as a proxy for salinity across saltmarsh sites to support understanding of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.
- Scope: Data from six saltmarsh sites (three in Essex, three in Morecambe Bay) representing contrasting soil types (clay vs sandy) and different grazing/inundation regimes.
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter sampling (2–6 March 2013).
- Principal contact: Hilary Ford.
- Format: Excel workbook; conductivity values provided in millisiemens per centimeter (mS cm^-1), corrected for a 1:2.5 dilution.

## Sampling design and locations
- Sites in Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Sites in Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates: Essex (AH, FW, TM) around 51.7–51.8°N, 0.8–0.98°E; Morecambe Bay (CS, WS, WP) around 54.1–54.2°N, 2.8–3.0°W.
- Habitat types: Saltmarsh and mudflat; grazing regimes differ by site (e.g., hare grazing in Essex; heavy sheep grazing in Morecambe Bay).
- Sampling units: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; fields include up to 22 quadrats per row/site row.

## Variables and measurement methods
- Primary variable: Electrical conductivity (proxy for salinity) of soil.
- Sample method: 10 g fresh soil mixed with 25 ml deionised water (1:2.5 dilution); shaken ~30 minutes.
- Instrument: Jenway 4320 conductivity meter, measured at 20°C.
- Data correction: Corrected conductivity values obtained by multiplying measured conductivity by 2.5.
- Additional descriptors: Season (Winter W, Summer S); Location (Morecambe M, Essex E); Site code (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex); Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM); Quadrat Number (1–22); Scale codes (A-D) indicating spatial extent.
- Data fields described: Row Number (sorting key); Scale (A: 1 m, B: 1–10 m, C: 10–100 m, D: 100 m and up); Expressed as text or numeric as specified.

## Data structure and formats
- File format: Excel workbook containing conductivity data and field descriptions.
- Field descriptions include: Quadrat Number, Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Scale, Electrical (proxy for salinity).
- Location and site coding allows cross-site comparisons and aggregation by habitat, season, and scale.

## Data quality and procedures
- Calibration: No explicit calibration procedures documented.
- Quality checks: Data checking procedures mentioned but not specified in detail.
- Metadata: Detailed field-level descriptions provided (row numbering, coding schemes, and dilution correction).

## Context, usage notes, and governance
- Context: Data collected as part of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service studies, enabling analysis of salinity-related soil properties across contrasting saltmarsh environments.
- Usage considerations: Electrical conductivity is a proxy for salinity; interpretations should consider the dilution correction, sampling times, and site-specific grazing/inundation context described.
- Stewardship: Dataset attributed to CBESS with attribution to staff responsible (Hilary Ford); data structure supports discoverability and reuse in wider datasets and analyses.
