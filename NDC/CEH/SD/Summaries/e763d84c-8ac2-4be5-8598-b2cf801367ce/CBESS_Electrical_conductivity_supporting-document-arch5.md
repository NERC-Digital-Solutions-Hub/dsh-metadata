# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil electrical conductivity on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose and proxy
  - Measures electrical conductivity (EC) of soil as a proxy for salinity to support studies of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.
  - Based on 10 g soil samples from the top 5 cm, using a 1:2.5 dilution method, to represent salinity conditions at saltmarsh sites.

- Sampling and timeframe
  - Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
  - Essex winter samples collected in an extended sampling window (2–6 March 2013) in addition to the main winter/Summer 2013 campaigns.
  - Sites span two contrasting marsh types and grazing regimes.

- Location and site details
  - Essex (E)
    - Abbotts Hall (AH)
    - Fingringhoe Wick (FW)
    - Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay (M)
    - Cartmel Sands (CS)
    - Warton Sands (WS)
    - West Plain (WP)

- Habitat context
  - Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF) habitats represented.
  - Essex sites characterized by heavy hare grazing and Brent geese grazing; Morecambe Bay sites characterized by intensive sheep grazing with winter grazing by pink-footed geese.

- Site coordinates and descriptions
  - Essex coordinates: AH, FW, TM with precise latitude/longitude provided.
  - Morecambe Bay coordinates: CS, WS, WP with precise latitude/longitude provided.
  - Location descriptions note broad differences in inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation between regions.

- Sampling and procedures
  - Sample preparation: 10 g fresh soil + 25 ml deionised water; 1:2.5 dilution; samples shaken ~30 minutes.
  - Measurement: EC measured with a Jenway 4320 conductivity meter at 20°C; EC used as a proxy for salinity.
  - Post-processing: Measured EC values multiplied by 2.5 to account for the dilution factor.

- Data and field descriptions
  - File format: Excel workbook containing conductivity data (mS cm^-1).
  - Key dataset fields include:
    - Row Number: numeric sort order
    - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S)
    - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E)
    - Site: CS, WS, WP (Morecambe) or AH, FW, TM (Essex)
    - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM)
    - Quadrat Number: 1–22
    - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m and above)
    - Electrical: EC value (mS cm^-1) after dilution correction

- Data quality and governance
  - Observational procedures and measurement method documented; no calibration procedures reported (None applicable).
  - Quality control processes are referenced but not detailed in the provided description.
  - Responsibility and stewardship: staff responsible listed as Hilary Ford.
  - Metadata includes detailed location, habitat, site codes, and sampling context to support data discovery, reuse, and integration with other CBESS datasets.

- Practical considerations for data stewards and users
  - Ensure consistent interpretation of scale codes and site abbreviations across collections.
  - Maintain the dilution correction convention (multiplication by 2.5) when reusing EC values.
  - Be aware of regional grazing regimes and habitat differences that may influence salinity proxies and comparison across sites.
  - Consider updating governance information if calibration procedures or data quality checks are expanded in future releases.
