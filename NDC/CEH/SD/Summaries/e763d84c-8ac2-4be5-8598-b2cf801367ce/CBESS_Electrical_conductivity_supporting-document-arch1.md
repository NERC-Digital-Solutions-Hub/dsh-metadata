# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil electrical conductivity on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring soil electrical conductivity as a proxy for salinity on saltmarsh sites in Morecambe Bay and Essex, UK.
- Part of the CBESS program; field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter sampling in March 2013.
- Staff: Hilary Ford.

## Locations and sites
- Essex (E): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay (M): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Sites selected to represent contrasting soil types: clay soils in Essex and sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
- Broad regional differences noted in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Sampling design and timing
- Observations collected during Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples included in an additional sampling window (2–6 March 2013).
- Habitat contexts include mudflats and saltmarshes, with grazing regimes varying by site.

## Observed variables
- Primary variable: Electrical conductivity (mS cm^-1) as a proxy for salinity.
- Also mentioned: pH measurements are taken alongside conductivity (at 20°C) as part of the observation protocol.

## Methods and procedures
- Sample collection: 10 g soil (fresh mass) per measurement, mixed with 25 ml deionised water.
- Dilution: 1:2.5 dilution; samples shaken for ~30 minutes.
- Measurements: Conductivity meter (Jenway 4320) at 20°C; results corrected for dilution by multiplying by 2.5.
- Calibration: None specified.

## Data structure and fields
- File format: Excel workbook (conductivity in mS cm^-1).
- Core fields:
  - Row Number: sort order of input data.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: CS, WS, WP (Morecambe) or AH, FW, TM (Essex).
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A = 1 m; B = 1–10 m; C = 10–100 m; D = 100 m to upper limit.
  - Electrical: Conductivity value (proxy for salinity).

## Data quality and notes
- Calibration procedures not applicable/not described.
- The dataset emphasizes documentation of sampling context (site characteristics, grazing, inundation) to support interpretation of conductivity data across sites and scales.
