# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil electrical conductivity on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex.

## Overview
- Dataset measures electrical conductivity (EC) of soil as a proxy for salinity.
- Sample: 10 g soil from the top 5 cm, with a 1:2.5 dilution (25 ml deionised water) per 1 m x 1 m quadrat.
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013 (with additional Essex winter sampling window intra-March 2013).
- Measurement: EC read with a Jenway 4320 conductivity meter at 20°C; EC value multiplied by 2.5 to correct for the dilution.

## Study design and sites
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
- Locations:
  - Essex (E): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay (M): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS).
- Site characteristics:
  - Essex: clay soils; hare grazing; heavy grazing by Brent geese (over-wintering) at AH and FW.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils; intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 ha^-1); pink-footed geese grazing in winter; West Plain (WP) lightly grazed.
- Habitat types observed: Saltmarsh and Mudflat.
- Coordinates (selected sites) provided for Essex and Morecambe Bay.

## Field sampling and laboratory methods
- Sampling window: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013 (additional sampling window).
- Procedure: 10 g fresh soil + 25 ml deionised water; shake ~30 minutes; measure EC (proxy for salinity) using Jenway 4320 meter.
- Data processing: Multiply measured EC by 2.5 to obtain quoted values (correction for dilution).
- Calibration: No specific calibration procedures noted.

## Data structure and content

## Data quality and metadata
- Calibration procedures: None applicable.
- Data quality checks: Not specified in the provided description.
- Underlying goal: Provide standardized, comparable EC data across contrasting saltmarsh environments to support environmental monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.

## Context and potential uses
- Purpose aligns with monitoring environmental condition and ecosystem service sustainability, enabling comparisons across sites with different soil types, inundation regimes, and grazing pressures.
- EC data can be used alongside other environmental or ecological datasets to assess salinity-related impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services in saltmarsh habitats.
