# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil electrical conductivity on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Purpose and scope
  - measures soil electrical conductivity as a proxy for salinity on salt marsh sites to support coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service research.
  - collected during Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples were collected in an extended window (2–6 March 2013).
  - dataset supports comparisons of salinity-related conditions across contrasting soil types and grazing regimes.

- Staff and provenance
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
  - Field and laboratory procedures described to reproduce observations and ensure quality.

- Locations and sites
  - Essex (south-eastern Atlantic UK): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay (west UK): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Site descriptions reflect two contrasting soil types (Essex: clays; Morecambe Bay: sands) and differing inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
  - Grazing context: Essex sites heavily grazed; Morecambe Bay sites variably grazed by sheep and geese.

- Sampling design and scale
  - sampling unit: 1 m x 1 m quadrats within sites.
  - soil depth: top 5 cm; sampling within 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
  - quantity: 10 g fresh soil per observation with 25 ml deionised water.

- Measurement and data processing
  - primary variable: Electrical conductivity (mS cm-1) as a proxy for salinity.
  - measurement method: 1:2.5 dilution (10 g soil + 25 ml water); shaken ~30 minutes; conductivity measured with Jenway 4320 at 20°C.
  - correction factor: measured conductivity multiplied by 2.5 to account for dilution.
  - additional measurements: pH and electrical conductivity recorded as part of the protocol (for salinity context).
  - data format: Excel workbook "conductivity (mS cm-1)" with corrected and uncorrected values.

- Dataset structure and field descriptions
  - Row Number: unique sort key for original input order.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: CS, WS, WP (Morecambe) or AH, FW, TM (Essex).
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A=1m; B=1–10m; C=10–100m; D=100–upper limit.
  - Electrical: conductivity value as a proxy for salinity (unadjusted) and corrected value after applying the 2.5 dilution factor.

- Data quality and context notes
  - Calibration procedures: none applicable.
  - Data checking procedures: indicated but not detailed in the summary; dataset includes QA notes and field/lab protocols.
  - Observational scope includes both winter and summer seasons, with Essex winter sampling on a broader window to supplement the dataset.

- Potential data use and applications (Data Support perspective)
  - compare salinity proxies across sites with different soil types, grazing regimes, and inundation patterns.
  - support studies of coastal habitat health, biodiversity risk, and ecosystem services linked to salinity.
  - enable self-serve analysis via dashboards or pivot tables by site, habitat, season, and location.
  - inform management decisions for saltmarsh conservation and marsh boundary assessments.

- Key takeaways for data users
  - robust field-to-lab protocol enables salinity interpretation via conductivity measurements corrected for dilution.
  - dataset captures spatial (site-level) and temporal (seasonal) variability across two UK saltmarsh regions with contrasting soil types and grazing pressures.
