# Supporting documentation

- This dataset contains hemispherical photographs of canopy structure in 0.5 ha permanent sample plots, used to determine leaf area index (LAI) estimation at plot level.

## Context and rationale

- Nordeste project in the northeast region of Brazil (Caatinga) addresses dry climates, irregular rainfall, and prior research neglect.
- LAI is linked to key ecological processes (biomass, phenology, growth, water and nutrient use, carbon stocks) and to modeling efforts (soil-vegetation-atmosphere interactions, ecological and remote sensing studies).
- Hemispherical photographs provide an indirect method to estimate LAI at the plot level, reflecting canopy transmittance.

## Study design and scope

- Two site groups:
  - 12 plots (sites) with approximately 36 photos per site.
  - 14 plots (sites) with approximately 50 photos per site.
- Total dataset characteristics:
  - 1132 photos
  - 2607.8 MB total size
- Photographs collected between March 2017 and August 2019.
- For some plots, a total of 36 or 50 samples per plot; the exact counts per site are summarized in the accompanying table.

## Data collection methods

- Equipment: Nikon D100 camera with a Sigma 4.5 mm F2.8 fisheye lens.
- Sampling protocol:
  - Under overcast conditions.
  - For the 12 plots: one photo at each intersection of four subplots (resulting in 36 photos per plot).
  - For other sites: one photo at the centre of each subplot.
  - Camera orientation: top facing North; height ~1 meter.
- Coverage: photos provide a representative LAI for the whole plot, though canopy distance effects (up to ~20 m) can influence the captured signal depending on vegetation height.

## Metadata and dataset composition

- Table-like dataset entries include:
  - Plot identifiers (e.g., BTI_01, CGR_01, etc.)
  - Location data (state, country, latitude, longitude)
  - Number of photos per plot
  - File size per plot (MB)
  - Date of data collection
- Totals per group and for all plots are provided (e.g., total photos and total size).

## Data quality and caveats

- MOR plots have photos taken on two different dates (2017 and 2018).
- Some JPG files have incorrect dates in the metadata; reported dates may not reflect actual capture dates.
- Data entries show inconsistencies in formatting and naming for a few plots (e.g., typographical variations, mixed language entries).
- Metadata completeness and accuracy vary; some entries may require verification or cleaning prior to integration with other datasets.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy evaluation

- LAI is a key indicator of canopy structure and ecosystem functioning, informing assessments of biodiversity support, drought resilience, and carbon dynamics.
- The dataset supports plot-level LAI estimation across a dry, heterogeneous biome (Caatinga), contributing to long-term monitoring of vegetation responses to climate variability.
- The data can feed ecological models and help evaluate conservation strategies and climate adaptation measures in the Caatinga region.

## Data governance and accessibility considerations

- The underlying imagery requires careful data governance regarding sharing, provenance, and metadata accuracy.
- Public sharing of datasets can pose barriers if metadata quality or provenance is unclear; addressing metadata gaps and standardizing formats would facilitate broader use and comparability with monitoring frameworks.
