- Purpose and scope
  - This dataset contains hemispherical photographs of canopy structure in 0.5 ha permanent sample plots, collected to estimate leaf area index (LAI) at the plot level.
  - Linked to the NORDESTE project in northeast Brazil, focusing on Caatinga vegetation and its role under climate variability and change.
  - LAI derived from canopy transmittance analysis of hemispherical photos; the dataset supports understanding relationships among plant, soil, and climate, and contributes to biomass, phenology, carbon stocks, biodiversity, and ecosystem-function studies.

- Study context and significance
  - The Caatinga is a seasonally dry woodland with irregular rainfall and droughts; understanding LAI helps assess ecosystem function and conservation needs in a region vulnerable to warming and drying climates.
  - NORDESTE aimed to rectify historical neglect of fundamental biodiversity and ecosystem-function research in this biome.

- Data collection and equipment
  - Photographs collected between March 2017 and August 2019.
  - Equipment: Nikon D100 camera with a Sigma 4.5 mm F2.8 fisheye lens.
  - Optical setup: images captured with the top of the camera facing north at approximately 1 m above ground.

- Sampling design and photo protocol
  - For plots with overcast skies, one photo was taken at each intersection of four subplots, yielding 36 photos per plot for 12 plots.
  - For other sites, photos were taken at the center of subplots, resulting in a higher total per site (approx. 50 photos).
  - Each hemispherical photo represents a single plot’s canopy, providing a plot-level LAI estimate rather than subplot-level values.
  - Some photos were omitted due to camera trigger failures or rapid changes in sky conditions; some photos were later rejected.

- Data content and metadata
  - Two groups of plots:
    - 12 plots (sites) with approximately 36 files per site (Fig. 1A).
    - 14 plots (sites) with approximately 50 files per site (Fig. 1B).
  - Table 1 (plot-level metadata) includes:
    - Plot IDs (e.g., BTI_01, CGR_01, CJU_01, etc.)
    - Location details (state, country, coordinates)
    - Number of photos per plot
    - File size per plot (MB)
    - Date of photography
  - Total dataset compilation:
    - 1132 photos across all plots
    - Total size: 2607.8 MB
    - Date range for included photos centered around 2017–2019, with some notes on dates being incorrect in the original JPG metadata (e.g., MOR plots had two dates; MOR_01 and MOR_02 show 2017 dates marked as 2017** in metadata).

- Quality and data issues to note
  - Some MOR plots have photos taken in two different years (2017 and 2018); the 2017 dates are flagged with asterisks.
  - Several JPG files have incorrect dates in metadata; actual capture dates are in 2017.
  - Occasional camera trigger failures or unsuitable sky conditions led to missing images or rejected files.
  - The field method may capture canopy up to about 20 m from the camera, which can influence LAI representation in edge areas.

- LAI estimation and interpretation
  - LAI values are estimated indirectly via canopy transmittance analysis from the hemispherical photos.
  - The processing yields a representative LAI value for the whole plot, not for individual subplots, due to vegetation height and image coverage.

- Data management and applicability
  - The dataset is designed to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with standard monitoring practices.
  - Outputs (LAI estimates and related analyses) can be used to compare environmental health and ecosystem function across Caatinga plots and over time, supporting monitoring of policy-relevant environmental indicators.

- Practical uses for analysts
  - Standardized LAI estimation across multiple Caatinga plots to monitor canopy structure and vegetation dynamics.
  - Cross-plot comparisons and trend analysis in the context of dry-season climate variability and potential future climate scenarios.
  - Integration with soil, climate, and biomass data to support ecosystem-function research and conservation planning.
