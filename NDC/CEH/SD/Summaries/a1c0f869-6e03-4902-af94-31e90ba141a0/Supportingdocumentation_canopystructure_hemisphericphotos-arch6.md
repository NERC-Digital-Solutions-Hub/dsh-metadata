# Supporting documentation

- Overview
  - This dataset contains hemispherical photographs of canopy structure in 0.5 ha permanent sample plots, used to estimate leaf area index (LAI) at plot level.
- Context and purpose
  - Part of the NORDESTE project in northeast Brazil (Caatinga biome) to address neglected biodiversity and ecosystem-function research.
  - LAI relates to biomass, phenology, growth, water and nutrient use, carbon allocation and stocks, biodiversity, and ecosystem functioning; LAI is estimated via canopy transmittance analysis from hemispherical photos.
- Data content and structure
  - Two plot configurations:
    - 12 plots (sites) with approximately 36 photos per site.
    - 14 plots (sites) with approximately 50 photos per site.
  - A detailed table lists each plot with:
    - Plot ID, name, location (state, country), coordinates (latitude/longitude),
    - Number of photos, file size (MB), and capture date.
  - Total across all plots: 1132 photos totaling 2607.8 MB.
  - Notes on metadata:
    - MOR plots have photos taken on two different dates (2017 and 2018).
    - Some JPEG dates are incorrect (photographs dated 2017 were actually taken in 2017; MOR data spans two years).
- Data collection methods
  - Equipment: Nikon D100 camera with Sigma 4.5 mm F2.8 fisheye lens.
  - Procedure: in overcast conditions, one photo at each intersection of four subplots (for some plots) or at the center of plots; top of camera facing north; height ~1 m.
  - Coverage: photos provide a representative LAI value for the entire 0.5 ha plot, not for individual subplots (vegetation height can allow canopy capture up to about 20 m from the camera).
  - Quantity variability: photo counts per plot can vary due to camera trigger issues or sky condition changes; some images may be rejected after processing.
- Data quality and caveats
  - Some dates in the metadata are incorrect; MOR data include two dates (2017 and 2018).
  - Processing yields plot-level LAI estimates rather than subplot-level values.
  - The dataset may require careful alignment of metadata with image files during analysis.
- Potential uses
  - Estimating plot-level LAI for Caatinga forests to inform biomass, carbon stocks, and ecosystem-function research.
  - Supporting calibration/validation of remote-sensing LAI products at plot scales.
  - Integrating with soil and climate data to study plant, soil, and climate relationships across Caatinga vegetation types.
- Metadata and access details
  - Per-plot metadata includes plot name, location, coordinates, number of photos, file sizes, and capture dates.
  - Total dataset size: 2607.8 MB across 1132 photos.
