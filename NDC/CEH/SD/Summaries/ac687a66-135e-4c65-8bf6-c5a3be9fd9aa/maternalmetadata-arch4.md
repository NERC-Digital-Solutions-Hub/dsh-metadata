# Metadata for 'Long-term multisite Scots pine trial, Scotland: mother tree, cone and seed phenotypes, 2007'

## Purpose and scope
- Records phenotypes for Scots pine mother trees and their cones/seed from 21 populations across Scotland.
- Seed from these populations was used to establish a long-term multisite common garden trial at three nurseries/field sites.
- Data support understanding of maternal effects and progeny variation across the native range.

## Study design and sampling
- Collected in March 2007: cones from ten trees per population, total 21 populations.
- Central sampling strategy: a circle of ~1 km diameter around a central tree; nine sampling points in predetermined random directions.
- Distance stratification in a 1:3:5 ratio to avoid oversampling near the center; for smaller woodlands, directions preserved with minimum inter-tree distance of 50 m.
- For each mother tree, measured height and diameter at breast height (DBH); collected ten cones for detailed assessment.

## Data collected and structure
- Two data files included:
  - ConeSeedTraits.txt
  - MotherTraits.txt
- Key identifiers:
  - PopulationCode (and Population name)
  - SeedZone (EC, N, NC, NE, NW, SC, SW)
- Geographic and site attributes (per population):
  - Latitude, Longitude (decimal degrees)
  - Aspect, Slope, Altitude
  - Regeneration, SoilDepth, SoilMoisture
  - Competition (mean distance to nearest three trees)
  - HA (Height of mother tree), DA (Diameter at breast height)
- MotherTraits data (per mother tree): Height (HA), DBH (DA), plus family and population metadata.
- ConeSeedTraits data (per cone/seed sample):
  - Cone, Width (Wi), Length (Le), Weight (We)
  - Seeds per cone (SN), Viable seeds per cone (SV), Viable seeds weight (SW)
  - Total seeds in cone (SN), Viability percentage (SV), Weight of all viable seeds (SW)
- Units and descriptions provided for each field (e.g., decimal degrees for coordinates, cm/mm for measurements, % for viability).

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Rich, explicit metadata facilitates discoverability, quality assessment, and reuse across forestry and genetics projects.
- Clear definitions of populations, seed zones, and trait measurements enable cross-dataset interoperability.
- Structured sampling protocol enhances representativeness and enables robust comparisons among populations.

## Potential uses and organizational value
- Supports long-term comparative analyses of maternal and progeny phenotypes across Scottish populations.
- Useful for forest genetics, seed sourcing decisions, and restoration planning within seed zones.
- Enables collaboration across networks by providing standardized, well-documented trait and location data that can be integrated with broader data assets.
