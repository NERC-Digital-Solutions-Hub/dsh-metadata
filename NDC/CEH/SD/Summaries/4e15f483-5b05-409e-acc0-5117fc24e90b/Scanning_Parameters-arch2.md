# Scan and Segmentation Details

- A comprehensive record of scanning and segmentation work on endocranial casts from a broad range of avian specimens, conducted to support standardized, archivable environmental and morphological data analyses.
- All image stacks were down-sampled from 16-bit to 8-bit depth and cropped to a region of interest to reduce processing requirements; voxel sizes were reduced as needed to manage large datasets.
- Data are prepared for storage and sharing via appropriate data portals, aligning with goals of data accessibility and reusability for environmental monitoring.

## Processing workflow and data formats

- Down-sampling and cropping applied to each image stack to streamline processing.
- Original 16-bit VGStudio Max VOL files converted to 8-bit stacks (BMP) or 8-bit MCS stacks; some data also output as 16-bit DCM stacks before downsampling.
- Final image stack resolutions vary (e.g., 10 µm to 88 µm original voxel spacing; final stacks around 30 µm, 36–75 µm, etc.), with a typical range of hundreds to thousands of slices per specimen.
- Stacks are axially scanned and cropped to region of interest; processing steps are documented per specimen.

## Data provenance and institutions

- Specimens scanned at The Natural History Museum, UK (NHMUK) and The National Museums Scotland (NMS), with unregistered collections noted for some entries.
- Institutional abbreviations used: NHMUK, NMS.
- Scanning performed using a Nikon Metrology HMX ST CT system.
- Project funding linked to NERC Small Grant NE/H012176/1 (to Walsh) and Intra-European Marie Curie Fellowships (for certain specimens).

## Taxa and scope

- Large and diverse set of bird species (examples include Acanthorhynchus superciliosus, Alca torda, Alcedo atthis, Amazona aestiva, Apteryx haastii, Aquila chrysaetos, Ardea cineria, Circaetus sp., Cygnus olor, Diomedea spp., Dromaius novaehollandiae, Eudyptula spp., Falco spp., Gavia immer, Gallus gallus, Puffinus spp., Strigops habroptila, Struthio camelus, Tyto alba, Vultur gryphus, etc.).
- For each specimen, details include specimen number, collection source, axial-axis scanning, region-of-interest cropping, final file formats, resolution, slice count, field of view, and segmentation notes.
- Coverage indicates a broad survey of avian endocranial anatomy across multiple orders and taxa.

## Endocranial segmentation and annotations

- Endocranial casts segmented; flocculus cast removal performed by Stig Walsh for multiple entries.
- Segmentation provenance is explicitly tracked, supporting reproducibility and data traceability.

## Data quality, metadata, and accessibility

- Metadata-rich documentation accompanies each specimen (taxonomy, collection, imaging parameters, file formats, dimensions, and segmentation actions).
- Emphasis on quality assurance, data cleaning, and storing outputs in suitable portals to enable access to underlying data and outputs.
- Acknowledges ongoing challenges around maximizing dataset value and facilitating broad access to underlying data for downstream analyses.

## Relevance to the Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- Demonstrates a standardized, auditable workflow for producing high-quality, reusable digital anatomical datasets, enabling cross-study comparisons and integration with environmental datasets.
- The meticulous provenance and metadata support transparency and policy scrutiny, aligning with aims to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Highlights practical challenges and solutions for expanding the utility of large, multi-site datasets and ensuring broad access to underlying data for environmental analysis and decision-making.
