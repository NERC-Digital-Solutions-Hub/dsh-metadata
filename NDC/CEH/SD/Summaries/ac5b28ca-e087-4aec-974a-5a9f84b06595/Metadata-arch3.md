# Sediment fluxes, discharge and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) calibrations for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam between 2005 and 2015 Darby, S.E., Hackney, C.R., Parsons, D.R., Tri, P.D.V (2020)

## Summary
- Long-term routine flood and water level monitoring on the Mekong Delta collects Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data at four sites using Teledyne RDI Workhorse 600 kHz units and one RiverRay unit.
- Four monitoring sites: Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, and My Thaun; sites’ coordinates are provided.
- Historical ADCP data (2005–2015) were processed to back out sediment fluxes by calibrating acoustic backscatter to suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) using field-collected samples from Chau Doc and Can Tho (calibration in 2017).
- The workflow follows established procedures (acoustic inversion, processing software, robust data collection protocols) and produces daily sediment fluxes by applying calibrated relationships to daily discharge data.
- Data products include site-specific flux files, ratings files, and instrument-specific calibration data, enabling transparency and reuse.
- Quality assurance references peer-reviewed methods and cross-checks with upstream sediment estimates; data processing uses standard software (WinRiver II and Velocity Mapping Toolbox) and Matlab-based workflows.
- Metadata and data governance considerations are evident in instrument-level calibration (serial numbers), explicit data structure, and openness of underlying data where feasible.

## Study sites and data collection
- Four ADCP units deployed at targeted sites along the Mekong Delta: Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, and My Thaun.
- Instrument types: Teledyne RDI Workhorse 600 kHz ADCPs; one RiverRay ADCP unit.
- Regular transects along the river continuum used to derive cross-sectional sediment fluxes.

## Analytical methods
- Calibration of acoustic backscatter (ABS in dB) to observed SSCs using field samples:
  - SSCs collected with a 3 L Van Dorn sampler at multiple depths.
  - Samples filtered, dried, and weighed to derive concentrations.
  - SSC values matched to corresponding ABS values to generate instrument-specific calibration curves (power-law form).
- Data processing workflow:
  - Raw ADCP data processed in WinRiver II and exported as ASCII.
  - Processed outputs fed into Velocity Mapping Toolbox (VMT) in Matlab for visualization and processing.
  - Acoustic-to-SSC conversions applied using instrument-specific calibration curves.
  - Daily sediment fluxes generated by creating sediment rating curves (flux vs. discharge) in Matlab and applying these to daily discharge records from the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
- Data products generated:
  - Daily sediment fluxes per site (kg/s) via the rating curves and daily discharge.
  - Separate rating files (linking monthly/daily sampling to flux estimates) and calibration data.
- Data period:
  - ADCP-based calibrations supporting 2005–2015 integration; calibration events conducted in May 2017 (Chau Doc) and September 2017 (Can Tho) to anchor back-calibration.

## Quality assurance
- Methods are well documented in peer-reviewed literature and broadly adopted:
  - Acoustic inversion techniques robust and established (cited works from 2016 and 2018).
  - Industry-standard processing software (WinRiver II; VMT) used consistently.
  - Field data collection protocols are robust and routinely monitored by the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
  - Flux estimates shown to be consistent with existing upstream estimates (comparisons to Darby et al., 2016).
- Documentation emphasizes reproducibility and traceability through instrument-specific calibrations and standardized data processing.

## Data structure and files
- For each site, three primary CSV files are provided:
  - Fluxes file: contains daily sediment flux values with a Date column (day and month; year ignored) and columns for sediment flux across years 2005–2012.
  - Ratings file: contains monthly/daily sampling metadata and measurements, including:
    - Month, Day, Year of sample
    - Discharge (m3/s) from ADCP transects
    - Section-averaged SSC (mg/L)
    - Sediment Flux (kg/s)
  - ADCPcalibrations.csv: instrument-specific calibration data enabling back-calculation from ABS to SSC.
    - Columns include ABS (dB) and SSC (mg/L) values for each instrument’s calibration, identified by serial numbers (e.g., INST1258, INSTSoton).
- Instrument metadata:
  - Each instrument identified by a serial number; notes on ownership (e.g., some units owned by the Vietnamese hydrological agency; one by the University of Southampton) to support provenance.
- Data quality notes:
  - Missing discharge values are represented as NaN in flux files (e.g., for non-leap-day gaps).
