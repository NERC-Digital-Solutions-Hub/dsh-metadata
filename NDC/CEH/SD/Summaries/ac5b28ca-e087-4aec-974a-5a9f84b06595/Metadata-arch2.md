# Sediment fluxes, discharge and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) calibrations for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam between 2005 and 2015

## Summary
- Routine flood and water level monitoring on the Mekong Delta uses four ADCP sites (Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, My Thaun) with Teledyne RDI 600 kHz units and one RiverRay unit.
- Historical ADCP data (2005–2015) were processed to back out sediment fluxes by calibrating acoustic backscatter to suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) using field samples from Chau Doc and Can Tho.
- Outputs include daily sediment flux estimates across the delta, generated by applying site-specific calibrations to daily discharge records.
- The workflow uses established data collection protocols and standard software, supporting consistent environmental monitoring and policy-relevant assessments of sediment transport.

## Analytical Methods
- Acoustic backscatter (ABS, dB) from each ADCP was calibrated to observed SSCs using field samples collected at multiple depths with a 3 L Van Dorn sampler.
- SSCs were determined from filtered samples and matched to corresponding ABS values to derive power-law calibration curves.
- Raw ADCP data were processed in WinRiver II, exported as ASCII, then analyzed in Matlab via the Velocity Mapping Toolbox (VMT) to convert to suspended sediment fluxes.
- Daily sediment fluxes were produced by creating sediment-rating curves between flux (kg/s) and river discharge (m3/s) and applying these to daily discharge data from the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
  
## Quality Assurance
- The methodology follows well-documented, peer-reviewed acoustic inversion techniques with robust, industry-standard software.
- Data collection protocols were robust and consistently monitored by the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
- Flux estimates are cross-validated against upstream estimates from relevant literature (e.g., Darby et al., 2016), showing consistency.

## Details of Data Structure
- Data are provided as CSV files per site, with separate flux and ratings files for each site, plus an ADCPcalibrations.csv containing calibration data.
- ADCPcalibrations.csv includes:
  - ABS (dB): acoustic backscatter values
  - SSC (mg/L): corresponding suspended sediment concentrations
  - Instrument identifiers identified by serial numbers (e.g., INST1258); some units are university-owned versus agency-owned.
- Fluxes files:
  - Columns include Date (day-month; year ignored) and data rows for 2005–2012; missing discharge data are marked as NaN.
- Ratings files:
  - Columns include Month, Day, Year; Discharge (m3/s); Section Averaged SSC (mg/L); Sediment Flux (kg/s).
- The dataset structure supports site-specific monitoring and comparative analyses across the delta.
