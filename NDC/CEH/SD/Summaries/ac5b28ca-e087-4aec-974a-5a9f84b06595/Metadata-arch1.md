# Sediment fluxes, discharge and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) calibrations for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam between 2005 and 2015 Darby, S.E., Hackney, C.R., Parsons, D.R., Tri, P.D.V (2020)

## Overview
- Routine flood/water level monitoring on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam using four ADCP sites and one RiverRay ADCP unit.
- Sites: Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, and My Thaun with specified coordinates.
- Historical data (2005–2015) processed to estimate sediment fluxes by calibrating acoustic backscatter to suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) obtained in Chau Doc and Can Tho (2017).

## Analytical Methods
- Calibration: acoustic backscatter signal (ABS in dB) calibrated to observed SSCs using field samples collected with a 3 L Van Dorn sampler at multiple depths.
- Sample processing: filter samples to determine dried mass and convert to SSC values; match SSCs to ABS at corresponding depths to derive instrument-specific power-law calibration curves.
- Data processing: raw ADCP files processed in WinRiver II, exported as ASCII, then imported into the Velocity Mapping Toolbox (MATLAB) for processing along transects.
- Flux conversion: VMT outputs transformed acoustically to suspended sediment fluxes using calibration curves; daily fluxes generated by linking ADCP-derived fluxes to daily discharge data from the Vietnamese hydrological agency via sediment rating curves (flux vs discharge) and applying them to the recorded discharge series.

## Processing workflow
- Generate daily sediment fluxes by applying site-specific flux-rating relationships to recorded daily discharges.
- Use instrument-specific calibration curves to convert backscatter to SSCs and compute fluxes.
- Ensure consistency with upstream flux estimates through cross-validation with published work.

## Quality Assurance
- Uses established acoustic inversion techniques documented in peer-reviewed literature.
- Employs industry-standard, robust software for ADCP processing.
- Adheres to robust and time-consistent data collection protocols monitored by the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
- Flux estimates are cross-validated against existing upstream estimates (e.g., Darby et al., 2016).

## Data files and structure
- Four site-specific flux files and four site-specific ratings files, plus a single ADCPcalibrations.csv file with raw calibration data.
- ADCPcalibrations.csv contains:
  - ABS (dB): acoustic backscatter values for instrument-identified data.
  - SSC (mg/L): field-measured suspended sediment concentrations corresponding to ABS values.
  - Instrument identifiers (serial numbers, e.g., INST1258; INSTSoton for the Southampton unit).
- Flux files:
  - Columns include Date (day-month; year ignored) and multiple year columns (2005–2012) with sediment fluxes (kg/s); NaN used for missing discharge (e.g., Feb 29 in non-leap years).
- Ratings files:
  - Columns include Month, Day, Year; Discharge (m3/s) from ADCP transects; Section Averaged SSC (mg/L); Sediment Flux (kg/s) for the cross-section.
- Data structure emphasizes separate CSVs per site for fluxes and ratings, plus calibration data.

## Data coverage and instruments
- Time period: 2005–2015 for the Mekong Delta study.
- Instruments include Teledyne RDI Workhorse 600 kHz ADCPs and a RiverRay ADCP unit; instrument serials identified in headers.
- Power-law calibrations and flux calculations tailored to each instrument.

## Notes on data use
- Daily fluxes rely on calibrated relationships between discharge and sediment flux; missing data handled with NaN.
- Calibration relies on site-specific SSC measurements and instrument-backscatter relationships to ensure robust flux estimation.
