# Sediment fluxes, discharge and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) calibrations for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam between 2005 and 2015 Darby, S.E., Hackney, C.R., Parsons, D.R., Tri, P.D.V (2020)

## Overview
- Routine flood and water level monitoring on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam using Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP) data at four sites.
- Four ADCP units (Teledyne RDI Workhorse 600 kHz at most sites and one RiverRay unit) collect data at Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, and My Thaun.
- Historical ADCP data from 2005–2015 were processed to back out sediment fluxes by calibrating acoustic backscatter to suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs).
- Calibration performed with field SSC samples collected in Chau Doc (May 2017) and Can Tho (September 2017).
- Daily sediment fluxes are generated by deriving fluxes from ADCP data and applying site-specific calibration curves, then using recorded daily discharge to extend flux estimates over the full record.

## Data collection and sites
- Sites with coordinates:
  - Tan Chau (10.822642, 105.227879)
  - Chau Doc (10.708268, 105.134606)
  - Can Tho (10.088109, 105.736458)
  - My Thaun (10.272038, 105.900920)
- Instruments include serial-numbered ADCP units; INST1258 referenced as an example, with other units owned by the Vietnamese hydrological agency or a collaborating institution (INSTSoton for a 600 kHz unit).

## Analytical workflow
- Calibrate acoustic backscatter (ABS, dB) to observed SSCs using field samples collected at various depths.
- SSCs derived from filtered and dried sediment mass (3 L Van Dorn sampler) to compute concentrations.
- Establish instrument-specific power-law calibration curves relating backscatter to SSC.
- Process raw ADCP files in WinRiver II, export as ASCII, then import into Velocity Mapping Toolbox (VMT) in MATLAB for processing and visualization.
- Use VMT outputs to compute acoustically derived suspended sediment fluxes; apply calibration to convert backscatter to SSCs and fluxes.
- Generate daily sediment fluxes by creating sediment rating curves (flux vs discharge) in MATLAB and applying them to recorded daily discharge values to produce daily flux estimates over the study period.

## Data products and file structure
- Data provided as CSV files for each site:
  - Flux files (per site)
  - Ratings files (per site)
- An ADCPcalibrations.csv file provides the raw data used for ADCP backscatter calibrations.
- ADCPcalibration file structure:
  - ABS (dB): Acoustic backscatter corresponding to SSC
  - SSC (mg/L): Measured suspended sediment concentration at the ABS reference depth
  - Instrument identified by serial number (e.g., INST1258); some units owned by the Vietnamese hydrological agency; INSTSoton for a Southampton unit
- Flux files:
  - Columns include Date (month-day; year ignored) and yearly sediment flux values (2005–2012)
  - NaN used where discharge data are missing (e.g., Feb 29 on non-leap years)
- Ratings files:
  - Columns include Month, Day, Year, Discharge (m3/s), Section-averaged SSC (mg/L), Sediment Flux (kg/s)

## Quality assurance and validation
- Acoustic inversion methods are well-documented and supported by peer-reviewed studies (e.g., Darby et al., 2016; Hackney et al., 2018).
- Industry-standard software (WinRiver II, MATLAB-based VMT) used for data processing; procedures are robust and consistently applied.
- Data collection protocols are robust and regularly monitored by the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
- Flux estimates show consistency with upstream estimates (e.g., Darby et al., 2016) to validate approaches.
