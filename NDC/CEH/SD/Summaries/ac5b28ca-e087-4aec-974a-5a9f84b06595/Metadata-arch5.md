# Supporting document Sediment fluxes, discharge and acoustic Doppler current profiler (aDcp) calibrations for the Mekong Delta, Vietnam between 2005 and 2015 Darby, S.E., Hackney, C.R., Parsons, D.R., Tri, P.D.V (2020)

## Overview
- Routine flood and water level monitoring on the Mekong Delta in Vietnam using four sites with Teledyne RDI Workhorse 600 kHz ADCPs and one RiverRay ADCP.
- Historical data (2005–2015) processed to back out sediment fluxes by calibrating acoustic backscatter to suspended sediment concentrations (SSCs) using field-collected samples (Chau Doc and Can Tho in 2017).
- Data products include daily sediment flux estimates derived from ADCP measurements and discharge data.

## Data Collection and Processing Methods
- ADS/AP instrument setup:
  - Four sites: Tan Chau, Chau Doc, Can Tho, My Thaun (with precise GPS coordinates).
  - ADCP backscatter signals calibrated to observed SSCs via concurrent field sampling.
- Field sampling and calibration:
  - SSCs collected with a 3 L Van Dorn sampler at multiple depths.
  - Samples filtered, dried, and weighed to obtain concentrations.
  - SSC values matched to corresponding acoustic backscatter (dB) to create calibration curves (power-law).
- Data processing workflow:
  - Raw ADCP data processed in WinRiver II; exported as ASCII.
  - Imported into Velocity Mapping Toolbox (MATLAB) for processing along transects.
  - VMT outputs acoustically converted to suspended sediment fluxes using instrument-specific calibration curves.
  - Daily sediment fluxes generated by relating flux to discharge via sediment rating curves in MATLAB.
  - Daily fluxes propagated over daily discharge values supplied by the Vietnamese hydrological agency to produce a continuous daily record (2005–2015).

## Calibration and Data Details
- Instrument calibration:
  - Each ADCP’s backscatter calibrated to SSCs using instrument-specific calibration curves (e.g., per serial number such as INST1258; some units owned by different institutions).
- Data products and structure:
  - Per-site CSV files containing flux and ratings data.
  - An ADCPcalibrations.csv file supplying the raw backscatter (ABS dB) and corresponding SSC (mg/L) values used for calibrations.
- Flux and ratings file schemas:
  - Flux files: Date column (dd-mm; year ignored), columns for each year (2005–2012) with sediment fluxes (kg/s); missing discharge values yield NaN in flux.
  - Ratings files: Month, Day, Year of sample collection; Discharge (m3/s) from ADCP transects; Section-averaged SSC (mg/L); Sediment flux (kg/s) for the cross-section.
- Temporal coverage:
  - Flux calculations cover 2005–2012 within the flux/ratings files; calibration samples for SSC relation were collected in 2017 to support calibration of older ADCP data.

## Data Quality and Validation
- Quality assurance practices:
  - Acoustic inversion methods are well documented and published; shown to provide robust estimates.
  - Use of industry-standard software for ADCP processing; robust data processing workflow.
  - Robust and consistent data collection protocols, regularly monitored by the Vietnamese hydrological agency.
  - Flux estimates are consistent with existing upstream estimates (cross-validation with prior studies, e.g., Darby et al. 2016).
- Data integrity considerations:
  - NaN values indicate missing data in discharge or flux records (e.g., February 29 handling in non-leap years).
  - Calibration relies on field SSC measurements from 2017 to back-calculate SSCs from ADCP backscatter for the 2005–2015 period.

## Data Provenance, Access, and Reusability
- Provenance:
  - Instrument specifications, site locations, and serial-number-based calibration mapping are explicitly documented.
  - Calibration relationships and processing steps are traceable through cited software tools (WinRiver II, VMT) and published literature (Darby et al., 2016; Hackney et al., 2018).
- Data reuse considerations:
  - Clear data tables and per-site organization facilitate discovery and reuse.
  - Calibration and metadata enable reproducibility of flux estimates, including handling of missing data and units.
- References for context and validation:

## Implications for Data Stewardship
- The dataset demonstrates a thorough data management approach: defined instrument-level calibrations, explicit metadata on sensors and sites, standardized processing pipelines, and QA/validation against prior estimates.
- For data stewards, key considerations include ensuring continued accessibility to calibration data, preserving instrument identifiers, maintaining versioning of processing tools, and documenting any updates to calibration curves or discharge datasets.
- The structure supports discoverability across sites with consistent file naming and schema, facilitating cross-site comparisons and long-term monitoring studies.
