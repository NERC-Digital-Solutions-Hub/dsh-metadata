# The Climate hydrology and ecology research support system meteorology dataset (1961-2012) [CHESS-met]

- CHESS-met provides daily meteorological variables on a 1 km grid over Great Britain for use with the JULES model, covering 1961–2012 and enabling daily disaggregation.
- Variables included (daily means 09:00 GMT to 09:00 GMT next day, except DTR): air temperature (tas), specific humidity (huss), wind speed (sfcWind), downward longwave radiation (rlds), downward shortwave radiation (rsds), precipitation (precip), air pressure (psurf), and daily temperature range (dtr).
- Precipitation data come from CEH-GEAR and are scaled to model units; other variables are derived from coarser-resolution inputs.

- Outputs are designed for self-serve analysis and integration into modelling workflows, including netCDF CF-compliant files and clearly named variables.

- The dataset supports a range of applications, including data integration, transformation, and preparation of model-ready inputs for policy, environmental, and climatological analyses.
