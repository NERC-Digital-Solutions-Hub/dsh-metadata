# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

## Aim
- User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022 (LCM2022), detailing seven datasets (three for Great Britain and three for Northern Ireland), plus a 1 km summary raster.
- Provides data production, validation, and accuracy information to help users apply LCM2022 outputs effectively and interpret results.

## What’s included (data products)
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets for:
  - Great Britain
  - Northern Ireland
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets for:
  - Great Britain
  - Northern Ireland
- Land Parcel Vector datasets (parcels with attributes)
- 1 km Summary Raster products for GB and NI (dominant class and percentage cover)
- UKCEH Land Cover Classes (21 classes) linked to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats
- Seasonal Composite Images ( Sentinel-2 based)
- Context Rasters (auxiliary data to reduce spectral confusion)
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework (0.5 ha minimum parcel size; framework updates and ID changes)
- Classification Scenes (GB: 32 tiles; NI: single 49-band scene; optional overlap between tiles)

## How the data are produced
- Seasonal Composite Images: Sentinel-2 reflectance data re-sampled to 10 m; four seasonal periods; 10 spectral bands used.
- Context Rasters: 10 m layers providing terrain, proximity to buildings/roads/water, foreshore, vegetation masks, etc., to reduce spectral confusion.
- Classification Scenes: GB classified in ~100 x 100 km tiles (32 scenes); NI classified in a single scene; Scenes combine Seasonal Images with Context Rasters.
- Bootstrap Training: Automatic training dataset built from historical LCM maps (LCM2019–LCM2021) with >80% probability and consistent class across years.
- Random Forest (RF) classification: Balanced training (10,000 samples per bag) to yield the 10 m Classified Pixel product; model is trained with bespoke software integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL.
- Land Parcel Datasets: Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to form parcel attributes and summaries; 25 m rasters are rasterised representations of parcels.
- 1 km rasters: Created by summarising the 25 m raster data to 1 km cells, reporting dominant class and percentage cover per class/aggregate class.
- Validation: Formal validation against a 33,107-point reference set spanning all 21 classes; overall accuracy ~86.1%.

## Data structure and formats
- 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI): two-band raster per region
  - Band 1: most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class
  - Band 2: classification confidence/probability for the selected class
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI): 3-band rasters
  - Band 1: dominant land cover class (_mode)
  - Band 2: mean confidence (_conf)
  - Band 3: parcel purity (_purity)
- 1 km Summary Rasters (GB and NI): dominant class per 1 km pixel; 21-class and 10-class percentage rasters
- Coordinate systems:
  - Great Britain: British National Grid, EPSG 27700
  - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid TM75, EPSG 29903

## Key concepts and terminology
- Seasonal Composite Images: four-season, 10-band Sentinel-2 mosaics used to derive spectral signatures for classification.
- Context Rasters: 10 m layers (GB and NI) providing terrain and proximity information to disambiguate similar surfaces.
- Classification Scene: multi-band input (Seasonal + Context) used to classify a region’s land cover.
- Bootstrap Training: leveraging historic maps to automatically generate training data for the RF classifier without fresh field data.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: a fixed structure of land parcels (MMU ~0.5 ha) used to aggregate pixel data into parcels.
- UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes aligned with BAP Broad Habitats (with careful distinctions and occasional spectral confusion explained in appendices).

## The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP linkage
- Classes are tied to Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats, with notes on where mappings align or diverge.
- Appendices explain detailed definitions and the relationship between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats, including notable cross-walks and cases of spectral confusion (e.g., classes like Arable, Improved Grassland, Heather, Bog, Saltmarsh, Urban/Suburban).

## Validation and accuracy
- Validation dataset: 33,107 reference points across all 21 classes.
- Overall accuracy: 86.1%.
- Class-level notes: accuracies vary by class (e.g., high for some arable and urban classes; lower for others with spectral ambiguity like Heather grassland and some grassland subtypes). Full matrices and producer’s/user’s accuracies are provided in the documentation.

## Known issues
- A small number of polygons are missing from the vector land parcel products, creating nodata gaps in the 25 m rasterised land parcels; minimal impact on 1 km products; 10 m classified pixels datasets are unaffected.
- Differences between LCM2022 methods and earlier maps mean some changes may reflect methodological updates as well as real land-cover changes.

## Using and citing LCM2022 data
- Each LCM2022 dataset has a DOI; references and usage guidelines are provided in Table 5 of the document.
- Key citations include Marston et al. (2023, 2024) and related methodological papers; users should cite the DOIs corresponding to the specific data product used.

## Practical takeaways for data users
- LCM2022 provides multi-resolution outputs (10 m pixels, 25 m parcels, 1 km summaries) suitable for self-service analyses and change detection when used with the Land Parcel Framework.
- The 10 m pixel data preserve fine landscape detail (not generalised by parcel framework) but validation is performed against the 25 m parcel dataset.
- Seasonal composites and context rasters help improve classification accuracy in spectrally ambiguous areas.
- Annual production supports monitoring state and change over time, enabling differentiation between real change and method-driven variation.
- For broad-scale analyses, the 1 km rasters offer quickly comparable summaries across GB and NI.
