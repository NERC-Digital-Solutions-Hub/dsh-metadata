# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

- The LCM2022 is the UKCEH land cover mapping product for 2022, the tenth UK Land Cover Map. It maps 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats) and introduces annual production using automated methods to improve temporal consistency and change detection.
- Seven datasets are released: three for Great Britain and Northern Ireland each (10 m classified pixels, land parcels, and 25 m rasterised land parcels) plus a 1 km summary raster product covering both GB and NI.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 86.1% at full thematic detail.

## Datasets and products (data structure)

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by classification of Classification Scenes; each pixel gets a most-likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and a class confidence.
  - Preserves full 10 m detail (not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework) to retain fine landscape features.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Created by rasterising the Land Parcel dataset and carrying per-parcel attributes (mode class, confidence, purity).
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Vector land parcels derived by intersecting 10 m pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Parcel attributes include hist, mode, purity, conf, etc.
- 1 km Summary Raster data (GB and NI)
  - Summary rasters: dominant class and percentage cover per 1 km pixel (both class and aggregate classes; 21 and 10 bands respectively).
  - Percentage values are integers; some coastal pixels sum to less than 100 due to coastal partial coverage.
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2-based seasonal composites (four seasons) used to create Classification Scenes; bands cover visible to shortwave infrared with multi-band context.
  - Some gaps due to cloud cover; classification method tolerates partial spectral information to cover all UK.
- Context Rasters
  - 10 m context rasters to resolve spectral confusion (e.g., Terrain, distance to buildings/roads/coast, foreshore/woodland masks).
  - GB: height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/road/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask.
  - NI: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast, freshwater, road, foreshore, tidal water.
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes (tile-based 100 x 100 km grid) classified independently.
  - NI: single 49-band Classification Scene (40-band Sentinel-2 seasonal composite plus NI context rasters).
- The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - A fixed framework with minimum parcel area around 0.5 ha (MMU); parcels represent discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.) to improve change detection and reduce noise.
  - Gids/identifiers (gid) and storage structure have changed since LCM2015; some parcel identifiers no longer match older datasets.
- Bootstrap Training
  - An automatic training approach that leverages historical LCM data to train a Random Forest classifier without fresh field data.
  - Bootstrap Training data come from LCM2019–LCM2021 pixels; pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across years are used.
  - Training data for some classes (e.g., arable, improved grassland) may rely on alternative sources (e.g., UKCEH Land Cover plus: Crops data for 2022).
- Random Forest classification
  - RF classifier trained with balanced bootstrap samples (10,000 per bag) to ensure rare classes are learned adequately.
  - Software combines Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL; uses open-source tools.
- Validation approach
  - 33,107 validation points across all 21 classes, using GB countryside survey data, National Forest Inventory data, Rural Payments data, and bespoke validation points.
  - Validation intersects with 25 m rasterised land parcel datasets to determine class correspondence.
- Data accessibility and citations
  - Each dataset has a DOI; citations provided for LCM2022 datasets and related production methods (e.g., Marston et al., 2023/2024).

## How LCM2022 was created (methods and workflow)

- Seasonal signal and context integration
  - Classification Scenes are built from Seasonal Composite Images (Sentinel-2) plus Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion and differentiate vegetation types.
- Automated training and classification
  - Bootstrap Training data drawn from historic maps provides a large training set for the RF classifier; the majority signal drives class membership.
- Tile-based processing and regional considerations
  - GB is divided into 32 tiles to manage phenological variation and computational load; NI uses a single classification scene due to smaller area.
- Land parcel framework
  - 0.5 ha MMU ensures parcels are reasonably sized and dominated by a single land cover type, aiding change detection and comparability over time.
- Validation and accuracy checks
  - A comprehensive validation dataset spanning GB and NI informs overall accuracy and per-class accuracies.

## Validation, accuracy, and known issues

- Overall accuracy
  - 86.1% overall accuracy at full thematic detail (LCM2022).
- Per-class validation notes (examples)
  - Arable: high producer’s accuracy (around 92.7%).
  - Urban: high accuracy (producer’s accuracy around 87.5%).
  - Some classes show more variability (e.g., Heather grassland, Neutral grassland, Saltwater) due to spectral similarity and training data limitations.
- Known issues
  - Some polygons missing in vector Land Parcel products, causing nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised land parcels; negligible effect on 1 km products.
  - 10 m classified pixels are unaffected by missing parcels.
  - Method changes between years can cause differences; the annual approach mixes real change with classifier updates.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats

- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes derived from Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; not always identical to BAP boundaries.
- Appendices note mapping nuances
  - Some BAP Broad Habitats are split or aggregated to maintain spectral mappability and historical continuity.
  - General relationships and notes provided for interpreting class names versus BAP Broad Habitats (e.g., Deciduous woodland vs. Broadleaved woodland; Urban vs. Suburban).

## Data access, references, and usage guidance

- Datasets and DOIs
  - Each LCM2022 dataset has a DOI; tables and references provided for access and citation (e.g., 10 m classified pixels GB/NI, 25 m rasterised land parcels GB/NI, land parcels GB/NI, 1 km summary rasters GB/NI).
- Key references
  - Marston et al. (2023/2024) for LCM2021/LCM2022 production and data products; foundational methodological papers on LCM history.
- Labeling and display
  - Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide recommended color schemes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes and color-blind friendly options, with accompanying QGIS symbology files.

## Practical considerations for analysts

- Temporal analysis and change detection
  - Annual LCM enables clearer separation of real land-cover change from random classification noise; time-series analysis can exploit flicker of errors versus persistence of real changes.
- Local-scale data considerations
  - LCM2022 provides high-resolution (10 m) detail useful for local planning and habitat assessment; however, users should be aware of MMU-based parcel generalisation and potential misalignment with older datasets.
- Data integration
  - Context rasters and seasonal composites improve classification accuracy where spectral signals are ambiguous; cross-reference with the Land Parcel Spatial Framework improves comparability over time.
- Limitations and caveats
  - Some spectral confusions among grassland types, wetlands, and peat/tpeaty soils remain; training data limitations for certain classes may influence results in some regions.
