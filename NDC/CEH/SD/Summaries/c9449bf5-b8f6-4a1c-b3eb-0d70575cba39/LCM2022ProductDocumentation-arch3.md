# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

- A user guide describing the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022 (LCM2022), its data production, validation, accuracy, and guidance for use in monitoring environmental health and informing policy decisions.
- Produces annual land cover maps to support change detection, temporal consistency, and decision-making, with formal validation and clear data provenance.

## Product scope and structure

- LCM2022 comprises seven geospatial datasets:
  - Three region-specific datasets for Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI): 10 m Classified Pixels (pixel-level), 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (per parcel attributes).
  - A parallel 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
- Core thematic output: 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats, BAP) with a mapping framework to BAP Broad Habitats (appendices detail nuances and crosswalks).
- GB and NI differ in data structure:
  - GB: Classification Scenes created from 32 tiles; context rasters and a 49-band single Classification Scene for NI.
- Purpose of the datasets: to support monitoring, evaluation of environmental policies, and robust change detection over time.

## Data content and classification approach

- Land Cover Classes: 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned to BAP Broad Habitats, with detailed crosswalks and notes on where classes diverge from BAP definitions.
- Seasonal and contextual inputs:
  - Seasonal Composite Images: four-season Sentinel-2 reflectance composites used to capture phenology.
  - Context Rasters: 10 GB context rasters (terrain, proximity to buildings/roads/water, foreshore and vegetation masks) and 9 NI context rasters (terrain, urban mask, distances to coast/roads, etc.) to reduce spectral confusion.
- Classification workflow:
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic generation of training data from historical LCM maps (2019–2021), selecting high-probability pixels consistently classified across years to bootstrap new classifications.
  - Random Forest classifier: balanced sampling (10,000 samples per class) to prevent dominance by common classes.
  - Output: 10 m Classified Pixels dataset (class code + confidence) preserved at full 10 m resolution; 25 m Land Parcel datasets link pixels to fixed land parcel units via the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
- Parcel framework:
  - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework defines ~0.5 ha minimum parcels, generalised from national cartography to provide stable units for change detection and analysis.

## Data production workflow and products

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets:
  - Derived from mosaicked Classification Scenes; outputs include class identifier and class membership probability.
  - Not generalised by Land Parcel Framework to preserve small features (e.g., narrow patches) but formal validation is against the 25 m rasterised land parcels.
- Land Parcel datasets (25 m rasterised):
  - Created by rasterising Land Parcel data to 25 m pixels; three attributes are carried per parcel: dominant land cover (mode), confidence, and purity.
- 1 km summary rasters:
  - Generated by aggregating 25 m rasters to 1 km pixels: dominant class, dominant aggregate class, and percentage cover per class (with rounding that may slightly sum to more or less than 100% across layers).
- Data formats, coordinate systems, and extents:
  - GB: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700); NI: Irish Grid (TM75, EPSG: 29903); extents and parcel counts provided for GB and NI datasets.
- Data accessibility and curation:
  - Each dataset has a DOI and formal citation; data products maintain open data practices, with clear provenance and versioning.

## Validation, accuracy, and known issues

- Validation:
  - 33,107 validation points across the 21 classes; overall accuracy of 86.1% for LCM2022 at full thematic detail.
  - Validation data drawn from GB countryside survey, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payments Agency, plus bespoke validation points.
- Known issues and limitations:
  - A small number of land parcel polygons are missing in vector land parcel products (affects 25 m rasters more than the 10 m classified pixels).
  - Saltmarsh and coastal classifications can show inter-class confusion with nearby vegetation or non-vegetated coastal surfaces.
  - Some regional and class-specific confusion persists (e.g., among various grassland and wetland classes); performance metrics (producer’s/user’s accuracy) provided in the appendix.
  - Changes in method between years may yield real change as well as methodological variation; users should treat differences with caution.
- Temporal and methodological considerations:
  - LCM2022 uses an annual production approach; future improvements may be re-applied across the catalogue to maximise temporal consistency and change detection capability.

## Data use, governance, and citation

- Guidance on usage:
  - The annual series helps separate genuine land cover change from random classification errors.
  - Both pixel-level and parcel-based products should be used in concert for robust monitoring and change detection.
- Data governance and transparency:
  - All datasets come with DOIs and formal references; methodological details and validation procedures are documented.
  - The production methods are subject to evolution; users should reference the latest methodology and data version when conducting analyses.
- How to cite:
  - Each LCM2022 dataset includes a DOI and recommended citation; users should cite the relevant Marston et al. (2024) papers and the dataset DOIs listed in the table of DOIs.

- Appendix 1–3 and Appendix 4 contain nuanced guidance on class definitions, training data sources, and cross-walks essential for rigorous interpretation and methodological transparency.

## Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks

- When integrating LCM2022 into policy monitoring:
  - Use the 10 m classified pixels for fine-scale habitat detail and change detection, complemented by 25 m parcel-based products for stable, comparable units over time.
  - Leverage the 1 km summary rasters for broad-scale assessments and harmonized reporting across regions.
  - Use context rasters to interpret spectral confusion and improve classification reliability in key areas (coastal zones, wetlands, urban interfaces).
  - Rely on Bootstrap Training and RF outputs with explicit confidence metrics to quantify uncertainty in reported land cover, especially when informing policy decisions.
- Data stewardship:
  - Note changes in land parcel identifiers between LCM2015 and LCM2022 when performing longitudinal comparisons at the parcel level.
  - Acknowledge the known issues and update frequencies to ensure interpretations stay aligned with method changes and data releases.
- Application to environmental objectives:
  - The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes map to BAP Broad Habitats, enabling compatibility with historical habitat classifications while preserving contemporary remote-sensing clarity.
  - The annual series supports robust change detection, differentiation of random classification errors from real land cover dynamics, and informed decision-making across environmental, biodiversity, and land-use policy domains.
