# Soil Core and Property Measurements Dataset Variable Descriptions

## Overview
- Describes individual soil core samples with identifiers and measured properties.
- Includes treatment information and key soil chemical, physical, and moisture-related metrics.

## Key Variables
- soilcorenumber: Unique identifier for each soil sample/core.
- soilcorename: Name corresponding to the soil sample.
- treatmentfullname: Full name of the soil treatment (e.g., biochar and wetted).
- pH.water: Soil pH measured in water at a 1:2.5 ratio.
- total.C.percent: Total carbon content as a percentage.
- total.N.percent: Total nitrogen content as a percentage.
- CN ratio: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
- extract.nh4-n.mgkg: Extractable ammonium (NH4-N) in mg/kg.
- extract.no3-n.mgkg: Extractable nitrate (NO3-N) in mg/kg after incubation start.
- bulkdensitygcm3: Bulk density in g/cm³.
- wfpsproportion: Water-filled pore space proportion (gravimetric water content × (bulk density / total porosity)).
- whcproportion: Proportion of maximum water holding capacity at the time of gas sampling.
- , Description = . , Description = . , Description = .: Placeholder fields with missing descriptions that need clarification.

## How this supports monitoring and decision-making
- Provides baseline and treatment-response indicators for soil health under specified management practices.
- Enables integration into monitoring dashboards and policy reviews regarding soil amendments (e.g., biochar).
- Facilitates transparent reporting by documenting sample identifiers, treatments, and measured properties.

## Data quality, sharing, and governance considerations
- Highlights the need for complete metadata and clear variable definitions to support reuse.
- Emphasizes transparency in data provenance, measurement methods, units, and data transformations.
- Underlines potential barriers to data sharing (open data requirements) and the importance of data governance to ensure datasets are usable, up-to-date, and. appropriately stored and shared.

## Challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Data gaps and limited metadata can impede verification and cross-study comparisons.
- Access to data and data silos between organisations can hinder timely monitoring.
- Complex data formats and the need for transformation demand clear documentation and standardized workflows.
- Ensuring data quality through cleaning, transformation, and governance is essential for reliable decision-making.
