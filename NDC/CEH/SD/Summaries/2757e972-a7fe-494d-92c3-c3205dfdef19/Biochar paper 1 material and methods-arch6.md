# The effect of biochar addition on N2O and CO2 emissions from a sandy loam soil - the role of soil aeration

## Overview
- Examines how biochar addition influences N2O and CO2 emissions from a sandy loam soil, with a focus on soil aeration as a controlling factor.
- Utilizes two experimental approaches: a fully-factorial soil core experiment with wetting/drying cycles and a separate set of incubations at uniform water holding capacity to assess biochar dose effects.

## Materials

- Soil source and properties
  - Bare soil from a Miscanthus field in Lincolnshire, UK (53.315580 N, -0.596335 W), planted in 2007.
  - Dense, compacted sandy loam: 53% sand, 32% silt, 15% clay; bulk density 1.68 ± 0.03 g cm-3; low total C (14.7 ± 0.2 g kg-1) and total N (2.70 ± 0.10 g kg-1); low extractable inorganic-N (NH4+-N 0.6 ± 0.10 mg kg-1, NO3--N 1.8 ± 0.35 mg kg-1).
  - Previous fertiliser: 500 kg ha-1 PK applied March 2010.

- Biochar properties
  - Produced from hardwood thinnings (oak, cherry, ash >50 mm); Bodfari Charcoal, UK.
  - Production: ring kiln, first to 180 °C (volatiles release), then to ~400 °C for 24 h.
  - Fresh biochar: <2 mm, GMC <5%, bulk density 0.24 g cm-3; total C 723 g kg-1 ± 15.1; total N 7.12 g kg-1 ± 0.10; pH 9.25 ± 0.04; CEC 145 cmol+ kg-1.
  - Extractable NH4+-N and NO3--N below detection (<1 mg kg-1 and <1.3 mg kg-1, respectively); supplementary information includes other properties (exchangeable cations, heavy metals, PAHs, BETX).

## Experimental design

- Experiment 1: Soil cores undergoing wetting/drying cycles
  - Fully-factorial design (n = 4) across three incubation temperatures (4, 10, 16 °C) and two moisture conditions (field moist 23% GMC and wetted 28% GMC).
  - Biochar added to half of the cores at 2% dry soil weight (~22 t ha-1); control cores without biochar.
  - Cores prepared from PVC cylinders, mixed into top 7 cm, density measured (1.00 ± 0.01 g cm-3).
  - Wetting events: after 51, 72, and 86 days; ~120 mL water added per core to reach 28% GMC; headspace gas samples collected at 6, 26, 51, 64, and 127 days.
  - Initial CO2 pulse from mixing allowed to equilibrate; cores maintained at field-moist gravimetrically with deionised water.

- Experiment 2: Soil incubations at uniform water holding capacity
  - Soil from 0–10 cm (Oct 2010); stored at 4 °C for 8 weeks; sieved (<2 mm).
  - Biochar added at 0, 1, 2, 5, and 10% of total dry soil weight (n = 4 per level).
  - Incubated at 16 °C in the dark; 3 days equilibration after mixing.
  - WHC determined; biochar-amended soils wetted to 87% WHC (WFPS ~78 ± 1%); headspace gas sampled over 0, 12, 24, 36, 48, 60, and 168 hours post-wetting.

## Analytical methods

- Headspace gas analysis
  - CO2 measured with PerkinElmer Autosystem GC using two FID detectors; N2O measured with GC-ECD.
  - Columns: Porapak Q 50–80 mesh; detectors at 130 °C (CO2) and 360 °C (N2O).
  - Calibration with certified gas standards; detection limits as per standard protocols.
  - Gas production: Experiment 1 - cumulative flux from linear gas concentration increase; 0–48 h after wetting modeled hourly fluxes; Experiment 2 - cumulative production from headspace concentration differences.

- Chemical analyses
  - Soil pH measured in deionised water (1:2.5 soil:water or soil/biochar).
  - Extractable NH4+ and NO3- by 2 M KCl; analyzed colorimetrically.
  - Total C and N by dry combustion (CN analyzer) on oven-dried, ground samples.

## Data processing and statistics

- Data transformation
  - Gas flux data log10-transformed (log10(flux + 1) or similar) to improve normality.

- Statistical analyses
  - Experiment 1: Linear mixed-effects models for gas fluxes; three-way ANOVA for cumulative flux within 48 h of wetting and for chemical properties (pH, total C, total N, extractable NH4+, extractable NO3-).
  - Experiment 2: One-way ANOVA with biochar level as factor; Tukey HSD for multiple comparisons.

## Notes on data handling and context

- The experiments are designed to capture temporal dynamics of gas emissions in response to moisture and temperature as well as varying biochar load, with careful control of moisture levels and equilibration periods.
- Supplementary information provides additional biochar properties (e.g., PAHs, BETX) and metal contents.
