# soilcoreno, Description = Individual number given to the soil sample/core. timepoint, Description = Timepoint of measurements. biochartreatment, Description = Is the sample un-amended or amended with biochar?.

- Overview
  - Provides a structured schema for soil gas flux measurements (CO2, CH4, N2O) from soil cores under different treatments, including biochar and wetting conditions.
  - Includes static chamber headspace measurements, soil properties, treatment details, and precise timing to support policy-relevant environmental health monitoring and evaluation.

- Key fields and their meaning
  - Sample and time
    - soilcoreno: individual soil core/sample identifier
    - timepoint / dayfromstart / dayfromstartstring: when measurements occurred
    - datetime: exact date and time of measurement
    - midpointday / timeinterval / timeintervalstring: temporal context between measurements
  - Treatments and treatment metadata
    - biochartreatment: whether biochar is applied
    - fulltreatname: full descriptive name of the soil treatment (biochar and wetted)
    - temperaturetreatment: soil temperature condition of the sample
    - nitrogentreatment: 15N-labelled nitrogen (NH4+ or NO3−)
    - wettingtreatment: periodic high water content vs not
  - Gas flux measurements
    - mgCO2-Cfluxm2h1: CO2 flux (mg CO2-C per m2 per hour)
    - ugCH4-Cfluxm2h1: CH4 flux (unit indicated; described as mg CH4-C flux in notes)
    - ugN2O-Nfluxm2h1: N2O flux (unit indicated; described as mg N2O-N flux)
    - log10co2 / log10ch4 / log10n2o: log10(flux + 1) transformations with handling for negative flux by adjusting with negative flux magnitude
  - Chamber and headspace context
    - CO2ppmt0 / CH4ppmt0 / N2Oppmt0: gas concentrations in the static chamber headspace at t0
    - headvolm3: volume of the static chamber headspace
    - chambaream2: chamber area
  - Soil and physical properties
    - tempair: air temperature at measurement
    - gravwatercontentproportion: gravimetric water content
    - bulkdensitygcm3, postmixbulkdensity: soil bulk density before and after mixing
    - particledensitygcm3: particle density
    - totalporosity: total porosity = 1 - (bulk density / particle density)
    - drysoilweightg: dry soil mass in grams
    - biocharweight: dry biochar added
    - biocharfraction: biochar as a proportion of dry soil weight
    - soil temperature and nitrogen treatment context
    - wfpsproportion: water-filled pore space
  - Site information
    - site: site identifier
    - midden of data collection context and other metadata are captured via the above fields

- Data processing and derivations
  - Log transformations
    - log10co2, log10ch4, log10n2o computed as log10(flux + 1)
    - If a negative flux occurs in the base flux column, the magnitude of that negative flux is added to all flux values before logging
  - Temporal context
    - midpoints and time intervals enable interpretation of flux dynamics between successive timepoints
  - Derived porosity and density relationships
    - totalporosity computed from bulk and particle densities

- How this supports monitoring and governance
  - Rich metadata and descriptive field definitions enable transparent data governance, quality assurance, and reuse by analysts and policymakers
  - Captures treatment effects (biochar, wetted), temporal dynamics, and site-level variation to inform environmental health monitoring frameworks
  - Facilitates data sharing and reproducibility through explicit unit definitions, measurement context, and data transformations
  - Highlights data considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks, such as:
    - potential data gaps or access issues
    - need for consistent metadata to verify dataset suitability for decision-making
    - data transformation steps that must be documented for interpretation and policy use
