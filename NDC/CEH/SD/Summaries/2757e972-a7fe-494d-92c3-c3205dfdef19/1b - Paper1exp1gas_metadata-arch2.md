# Soil Gas Flux Measurements with Biochar Amendment Dataset

- Objective and context
  - An environment monitoring data resource that captures soil gas fluxes under biochar amendment and related treatments.

  - Sample and time identifiers
    - soilcoreno: unique soil core/sample number
    - timepoint: measurement timepoint
    - dayfromstart, dayfromstartstring: days from start of measurements (numeric and string)
    - datetime: date and time of measurement
  - Treatments and site metadata
    - biochartreatment: whether biochar was added (and if amended)
    - fulltreatname: full name of soil treatment (e.g., biochar and wetted)
    - wettingtreatment: whether samples were periodically wetted to high water content
    - nitrogentreatment: 15N-labeled nitrogen species (NH4 or NO3)
    - site: site identifier
    - biocharweight: weight of dry biochar added
    - biocharfraction: biochar as a proportion of dry soil weight
  - Physical and soil properties
    - bulkdensitygcm3: soil bulk density
    - postmixbulkdensity: bulk density after soil mixing
    - particledensitygcm3: soil particle density
    - totalporosity: porosity, computed as 1 - (bulk density / particle density)
    - gravwatercontentproportion: gravimetric water content (as a proportion)
    - temperaturetreatment: soil temperature for the treatment
    - tempair: soil air temperature at measurement
    - chambaream2: soil area within the static chamber
    - headvolm3: headspace volume of the static chamber
    - drysoilweightg: dry soil weight in the core (g)
    - site and other contextual fields as above
  - Gas flux measurements and derived metrics
    - mgCO2-Cfluxm2h1: CO2 flux (mg CO2-C per m2 per hour)
    - log10co2: log10(flux CO2 + 1) from the previous column; special handling described below
    - ugCH4-Cfluxm2h1: CH4 flux (μg CH4-C per m2 per hour)
    - log10ch4: log10(CH4 flux + 1) with the same special handling
    - ugN2O-Nfluxm2h1: N2O flux (μg N2O-N per m2 per hour)
    - log10n2o: log10(N2O flux + 1) with the same special handling
    - CO2ppmt0, CH4ppmt0, N2Oppmt0: static chamber headspace concentrations at time t0 (ppm)
  - Additional context and timing
    - midpoints and intervals
      - midpointday: time in the middle of this and the previous timepoint
      - timeinterval: duration between successive timepoints
      - timeintervalstring: duration as a string
  - Other environmental and measurement details
    - wettingtreatment, site, tempair, temperaturetreatment, gravwatercontentproportion, wfpsproportion (water-filled pore space)
    - wfpsproportion: water-filled pore space as a derived proportion
    - bulkdensitygcm3, postmixbulkdensity, particledensitygcm3, totalporosity as above
    - nitrogentreatment and biochartreatment as above

- Data processing, quality and transformation
  - Data are understood, verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed according to standardised methods.
  - Derived log-transformations
    - log10co2, log10ch4, log10n2o are log10(value + 1) of their respective flux columns.
    - If the previous flux value is negative, the positive magnitude of that negative value is added to every flux value before logging, to enable a valid log transformation.

- Data storage and accessibility
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to support reuse and integration.
  - Designed to enable cross-study comparisons and combination with other relevant datasets for enhanced value.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
  - Enables tracking of greenhouse gas flux responses to biochar amendments and moisture treatments over time.
  - Facilitates standardized reporting of soil gas dynamics, aiding assessment of environmental health and monitoring policy outcomes.
  - Supports comparative analyses across sites and treatments, contributing to evidence-based soil ecosystem management.
