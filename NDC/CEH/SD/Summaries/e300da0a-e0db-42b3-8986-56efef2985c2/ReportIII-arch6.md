# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive long-term field study at Sourhope, Macaulay Institute, Scotland.
  - A baseline context was established to help various research groups compare data and relate their datasets (baseline data survey from Nov 1998).
  - The report presents broad monitoring results (intro/Methods/Results) to help cross-year comparisons and linkages across studies.
  - 2001 management disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) in the UK and a change of site officer affected sampling and activities.

- Data streams and measurement scope
  - Automatic Weather Station: daily/annual weather metrics (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture) at the Sourhope site.
  - Above-ground biomass: multi-year biomass estimates collected during five summer mowing events per year (1999–2001); data normalized to a common reference plot (C1) to compare treatment effects across years.
  - Soil pH: surface soil pH measured in the upper 5 cm; lime and nitrogen treatments tracked pH changes over time.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat survey (July 2001; aligned with 2000 survey) to assess species abundance and diversity across treatments; species coded for detailed analysis (e.g., Agrostis capillaris, Festuca spp., Poa pratensis, etc.).
  - Additional data collection: site activity schedule (Table 2), detailed mowing/plot protocols, and supplementary survey work across subplots and years.

- Data quality, processing, and analysis approaches
  - Data normalization: biomass results were ln-transformed and analyzed with split-plot ANOVA; biomass totals were summed across mowing events for each plot.
  - Cross-year comparisons: results framed relative to the C1 control; inter-year (1999–2000, 1999–2001) effects tested; significant year-by-treatment interactions reported.
  - Survey reliability: assessment of inter-surveyor consistency in 2001; no significant differences found between surveyors.
  - Multivariate analysis: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) used on point-quadrat data to explore shifts in species composition by treatment; correlations between species abundance and biomass examined.
  - Data limitations: 2001 sampling affected by FMD restrictions and staffing changes; some applications (biocide) timing impacted; first biocide application missed in May 2001.

- Results by data stream

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather metrics generally unremarkable relative to long-term patterns.
    - Rainfall in 2001 close to annual average (lower than 1999’s wetter year and 2000’s high rainfall); total radiation similar across years.
    - Average temperatures slightly reduced in 2001; soil moisture content modestly higher than prior years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - There is a consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak production in July or August each year.
    - 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to a change in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - After normalization to C1, nitrogen and/or lime treatments continued to show stronger biomass responses than unimproved plots.
    - ANOVA results: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant Year × Treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition raised surface pH over time; October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen plus lime plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 survey ( vs July 2000) showed 58% more total hits, suggesting denser swards, possibly linked to reduced grazing since 1998.
    - Treatment differences: Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased and were most frequent in nitrogen and/or lime plots.
    - Fertilised plots (notably N and/or L) showed abundance of species typical of improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis); unimproved plots retained species associated with poorer pastures (Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
    - Species richness: 24 species identified in unimproved treatments vs 18 in the Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting reduced diversity with increased fertility.
    - PCA indicated clear separation between nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots and control/biocide plots; improved plots showed shifts toward Festuca rubra and related species.
    - Biomass correlations: higher biomass associated with increased relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; higher biomass correlated with reduced relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
    - Litter: increased litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, consistent with faster vegetation turnover at higher fertility.

- Site heterogeneity and implications for data interpretation

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slope-facing right) tended to contain more acidic plots; potential underlying spatial patterns with more acidic conditions in certain columns, particularly among nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots.
    - Recognition of spatial structure is important for interpreting treatment effects and for planning further analyses.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values show outliers (low biomass) in several plots; central plots tended to have higher biomass, suggesting a spatially structured response.
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, reinforcing fertility as a driver of productivity.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, indicating blocks did not systematically bias results.

- Overall interpretation for data use
  - Fertility treatments (nitrogen and lime) markedly influence biomass production, soil chemistry (pH), and plant community composition, with a trend toward grasses typical of improved pastures when fertility is increased.
  - Biodiversity metrics show potential declines in species richness in the most fertilised plots, although total biomass and productivity increase.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the field site must be accounted for in analyses and when integrating this dataset with other studies.
  - The 2001 disruptions (FMD restrictions, staff change) affected sampling and data collection, but management activities such as liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, and vegetation cutting largely proceeded according to the 2001 Site Management Plan, ensuring continuity of key data streams.
  - Data products stemming from this report (e.g., annualized biomass by plot, species abundance lists, and PCA-driven community shifts) can support cross-site comparisons and integration with related projects in the Soil Biodiversity programme.

- Final takeaway for data support
  - The Sourhope field experiment demonstrates comprehensive, multi-factor data collection (climate, soil chemistry, productivity, and plant community) across multiple years, with robust analysis to compare treatments and track year-to-year changes.
  - The study highlights the importance of accounting for spatial heterogeneity, data normalization across years, and method consistency when deriving insights for policy, ecological theory, or management decisions.
