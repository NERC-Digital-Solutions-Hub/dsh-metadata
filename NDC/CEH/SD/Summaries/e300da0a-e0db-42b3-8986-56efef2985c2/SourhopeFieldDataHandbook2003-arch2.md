## ECOTRON Soil Site (Rigg Foot, Sourhope)

- Additional soil analysis and vegetation data for ECOTRON soil site plots, including horizon-level soil analyses and vegetation inventories.
- Data are aligned with the ECN framework to enable cross-site comparisons and long-term monitoring of soil-vegetation interactions under controlled experimentals.

## Data Handling, Access, and Long-Term Monitoring

- Data are barcoded and stored within MLURI data systems; samples archived for long-term use.
- Data are structured to facilitate cross-block and cross-site comparisons, supporting longitudinal analyses of soil fertility, carbon/nutrient cycling, and vegetation responses.
- Outputs are designed to support policy-relevant environmental health assessments and the evaluation of management interventions across the ECN network.

## Key Takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment

- The dataset provides a robust, standardized basis for tracking soil-plant interactions under natural and experimental perturbations (e.g., variations in moisture regime, soil chemistry, and horizon properties) across multiple blocks at Sourhope.
- Multivariate interpretation is supported by detailed chemical and physical soil measurements (N, C, C:N, LOI, pH, exchangeable cations) alongside vegetation inventories, enabling insights into how soil health relates to plant community structure.
- Long-term archiving and integration with ECN/SERAD Micronet frameworks enhances data reuse, cross-site synthesis, and evidence-based policy assessment of environmental health and land-management interventions.
