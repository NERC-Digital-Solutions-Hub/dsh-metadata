# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Field experiment located at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to monitor broad context data to support site-specific studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change in the Officer in Charge; most management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) continued under a revised protocol.

## Key findings

### 2. Results
- **2.1 Automatic Weather Station**
  - 2001 headline weather data broadly unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after a very wet previous year.
  - Total radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly reduced; soil moisture content modestly higher than in earlier years.

- **2.2 Above-ground biomass**
  - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak biomass in July/August each year.
  - 2001 biomass generally higher than 2000, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - When normalised to a control (C1), nitrogen and/or lime treatments showed continued positive effects on productivity, especially the combination of nitrogen and lime (N&L).
  - ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) and unimproved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block differences.
  
- **2.3 Soil pH**
  - Lime and/or nitrogen applications raised soil pH in the top 5 cm.
  - October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone raised pH but less so.
  - Control plots remained close to baseline pH since August 1998.

- **2.4 Botanical composition**
  - July 2001 Point Analysis: 58% more total hits than July 2000; no significant difference between surveyors.
  - Treatment differences in dominant species emerged in 2001. Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments except Control plots; Festuca spp. increased in most treatments, especially in fertilised plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus spp.; unimproved plots retained species typical of less fertile pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity decline in the most improved plots.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum; improved plots associated with Festuca rubra and related species.
  - Biomass correlated with species composition: higher biomass plots showed higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; lower biomass plots showed higher relative abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
  - Increased litter in N- and/or Lime-treated plots indicated faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

### 3. Site heterogeneity
- **3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition**
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slope-right side) tended to be more acidic; the effect is amplified by higher proportions of Control/Biocide plots in those columns.
  - Lower pH in columns with nitrogen and/or lime treatments noted, suggesting underlying spatial pattern interacting with treatment.

- **3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass**
  - Biomass values showed outliers with low biomass on several plots, while central site plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., Nitrogen & Lime plots 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (higher pH associated with higher biomass).
  - No significant differences in biomass among blocks (statistical result: F near non-significant).

## Methods and data collection (highlights)
- Main measurements and timing: as listed in Table 1; cover included automatic weather data, above-ground biomass at multiple mowing events (May–Sep), soil pH at 0–5 cm, and botanical composition via Point Quadrat methods.
- Field sampling included a mowing regime using a Kubota mower, with biomass harvested from sub-plots S, T, U, V, and a 0.5 m2 sampling framework; botanical surveys used a 100-cell point quadrat with 25 pin drops.
- Data analysis included split-plot ANOVA on biomass by year and treatment, and PCA on the July 2001 botanical survey to identify associations between treatments and plant communities.
- Species codes are defined (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; N = Nitrogen; L = Lime; N&L = Nitrogen and Lime; B = Biocide), with a comprehensive appendix of species observed.

## Implications
- Fertilisation (nitrogen) and liming (lime) consistently promote higher above-ground biomass and shift plant communities toward more productive, fertiliser-associated species.
- Soil pH is a key mediator: higher pH in limed or lime-plus-nitrogen plots correlates with greater biomass and turnover (litter increases).
- The observed spatial heterogeneity within the site influences treatment effects, highlighting the importance of local site conditions (pH, soil depth, slope position) in interpreting treatment responses.
- Biodiversity may decline slightly in plots with strongest fertility enhancement, as indicated by reduced species richness in N&L plots, despite overall productivity gains.
- The 2001 FMD restrictions and personnel changes influenced management and measurement conditions, but core trends in biomass response and pH shifts remained detectable.
