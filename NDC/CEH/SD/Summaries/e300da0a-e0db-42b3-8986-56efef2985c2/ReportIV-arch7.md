# Summary

- The report documents four years of work under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on how above-ground biomass, plant species composition, and diversity respond to management treatments and environmental factors.
- Three main management processes drive botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime), and insecticide application (Dursban 4 OPA). A trampling/experimental activity (13CO2 pulses) affected plots with C2 treatments.
- The experimental design comprises the Rigg Foot Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient. Each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system used for data collection and group assignments to research projects.

- Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Insecticide (formerly Biocide). Vegetation cutting is a site-wide management task. Treatments were applied yearly from 1999 onward.

- Data collection and monitoring cover:
  - Weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station (Feb 1999 onward).
  - Above-ground biomass estimates from 0.5 m^2 cells within sub-plots, measured each mowing season (May–Sept) since 1999.
  - Baseline and follow-up vegetation surveys using 0.5 m^2 point quadrats and a 100-hole grid (with 25-point pin drops) conducted in 1998, 2000, 2001, and 2002; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil measurements: pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) across plots/cells; additional soil data collected as part of various projects.
  - Ongoing site activity and samples collected by Phase I/Phase II projects, including label-based CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements.

Key findings by topic

- Mowing effect
  - After fencing and regular mowing to ~6 cm, Festuca spp. increased relative to Agrostis spp., which declined.
  - Stress-tolerant species expanded, particularly in unfertilised plots, likely due to reduced disturbance and nutrient losses with cuttings.
  - Bryophytes expanded across the site, possibly aided by consistent mowing height and lack of grazing.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increased above-ground productivity; plots with both N and lime showed the strongest biomass production.
  - Mean soil pH in lime-treated plots rose toward ~7.0; productivity in lime- or nitrogen-only plots varied with moisture and pH.
  - A positive soil pH–biomass relationship overall; however, in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the correlation was weaker or nonlinear (possibly due to higher pH and drier conditions).

- Insecticide effect
  - Plant diversity (Shannon index) and composition show complex responses; the relationship between reduced herbivory and diversity is not straightforward.
  - Some evidence suggests that insecticide-treated plots may favour palatable, more diverse plant assemblages, but causality is not definitively established.

- Trampling effect
  - The C2 plots (insecticide plots during high-activity sampling) showed marked productivity reductions, likely due to trampling during intense sampling and 13CO2 pulse activities.

- Biodiversity and functional groups (Point Analysis and CSR framework)
  - Dominant vascular species: Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis; Festuca rubra increased in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; bryophytes accounted for about 20% of total hits in 2002.
  - Point analyses show distinct separation of improved (fertilised) vs unimproved plots; PCA highlights relationships among species groups and treatment effects.
  - Functional-group dynamics (stress-tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CSR and SR/CSR) shifted with treatments:
    - Nitrogen + Lime plots show greater dominance by C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species.
    - Unimproved plots show greater prevalence of stress-tolerant species.
    - SR/CSR species are reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

- Biodiversity indices
  - Shannon diversity indices rose post-2000 in several treatments but fell by about 15% in the nitrogen & lime plots by 2002.
  - Across years 2000–2002, diversity differences among treatments became statistically significant, with the most pronounced increases in some insecticide-treated plots.

- Productivity and slope effects
  - Biomass production generally increased from 1999 to 2002, but 2002 showed a broad decline relative to 2001 across most treatments.
  - A clear spatial pattern existed along the downslope gradient: lower blocks (bottom of slope) tended to show larger productivity changes than upper blocks.

Implications and data considerations for GIS

- Spatial design and layers
  - The grid includes five blocks along a downslope gradient, with each block containing multiple plots and sub-plots, and 0.5 m^2 sample cells for precise vegetation sampling.
  - Data types suitable for GIS mapping include: biomass per plot and per cell, treatment assignment, soil pH (5 cm depth) per plot, soil moisture (2002 measurements by cell corners), bryophyte presence/abundance, and species-level hits from point analyses.

- Temporal scope
  - Longitudinal data from 1998 baseline through 2002, with yearly biomass harvests and recurring point analyses, enabling time-series mapping and trend analysis.

- Functional and species data
  - Species abundance and functional-group classifications (CSR categories) can be mapped to identify ecological shifts by treatment and by spatial location (block/plot).
  - Bryophyte distribution and shifts over time can be visualized alongside vascular plant changes.

- Potential GIS products
  - Multi-layer maps showing: biomass productivity by plot/cell over time; soil pH and moisture distribution across treatments; species composition heatmaps; bryophyte versus vascular plant cover maps; CSR functional-group distribution by treatment and block; and slope-related productivity trends.
  - Spatial models examining relationships among management treatments, soil chemistry (pH), moisture, and biomass production across the downslope gradient.

Appendices and data sources (highlights)

- Appendix 5: On-site weather data (1999–2002) including rainfall, radiation, and temperature trends.
- Appendix 6–8: Detailed biomass data by plot and block; rank analyses of species; and bryophyte/bold species abundance by treatment.
- Appendix 3: Comprehensive species lists for vascular plants and bryophytes (2002), including many important grasses and mosses.

Overall takeaway

- The Sourhope site demonstrates clear, treatment-driven changes in productivity and community composition over time, with fertilisation driving the strongest biomass gains, mowing shaping species composition and bryophyte expansion, and insecticide effects interacting with plant diversity in nuanced ways. The data are well-suited for GIS-based visualization and spatial analysis to explore how down-slope position, treatment, and soil chemistry interact to shape vegetation structure and function.
