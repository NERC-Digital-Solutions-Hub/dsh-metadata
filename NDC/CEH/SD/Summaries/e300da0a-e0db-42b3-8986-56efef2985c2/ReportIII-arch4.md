# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large field experiment on soil biodiversity at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, conducted 1999–2001 as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Document provides context, data collection protocols, and year-to-year results to aid cross-study comparisons and data linking.

## Data Collected and Measurements
- Automatic Weather Station data (2001 headline weather; previous years referenced for context).
- Above-ground biomass measurements across treatments and years.
- Soil pH measurements (upper 5 cm; lime and nitrogen effects tracked).
- Botanical composition via Point Analysis (July 2001 survey; species hits per quadrat).
- Additional observations: detailed mowing schedules, subsample surveys (minirhizotron area, disturbance/nutrient plots), and annual data tables (e.g., Table 1 data collection events).
- Data collection years explicitly 1999, 2000, 2001 with standardised measurement dates and protocols (e.g., 5 mowing occasions per summer; 0.5 m2 quadrats for biomass and species surveys).

## Experimental Design and Data Structure
- Site: Sourhope field experiment within MLURI.
- Treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide.
- Experimental layout: 5 blocks; plots subdivided into sub-plots S, T, U, V; multiple treatments per block.
- Data types tied to plots, sub-plots, and yearly measurements; data normalization performed to compare across years (e.g., biomass normalized to C1).
- Data processing includes statistical analyses (ANOVA on biomass; PCA on botanical data) and correlation analyses between biomass and species abundance.

## Data Processing and Analysis
- Biomass: ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass data; significant effects linked to nitrogen and/or lime; inter-year interaction significant; blocks not significant.
- Plant composition: Point Analysis across treatments; PCA used to identify shifts in species assemblages; finer-scale correlations between major species abundance and biomass.
- Diversity: number of species per treatment; unimproved plots (Control/Biocide) show higher species counts than the most improved plots (N&L), suggesting diversity changes with fertility enhancements.
- Temporal and spatial variation: analysis indicates treatment-driven shifts in vegetation and biomass across the site; biomass correlates positively with certain grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and negatively with others (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) as biomass increases.

## Data Management and Access Context
- Weather data continuously collected via on-site Automatic Weather Station and regularly downloaded; transmitted to the CEH Soil Biodiversity Data Manager (Merlewood).
- Site disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions; access limited Feb–May 2001 with protocols thereafter.
- Administrative changes: Officer in Charge changed in 2001; management plan maintained to ensure continuity of data collection.
- Documentation: Baseline and method descriptions referenced (Baseline Data Survey, Nov 1998); comprehensive data tables and appendices (e.g., Appendix 1, annual biomass figures) accompany the report.
- Species data and measurement protocols documented (e.g., Table 1 schedules; Figure legends detailing sampling events and survey methods).

## Key Findings Relevant to Data Leaders
- Biomass response: Treatments with nitrogen and/or lime consistently yield higher biomass; 2001 biomass higher than prior years, partly due to methodological changes (from manual cutting to mechanical shears) and personnel changes.
- Soil pH response: Lime increases soil pH markedly; nitrogen also raises pH modestly; control plots show little change since baseline.
- Community composition: Fertilised plots show a shift toward Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and grasses typical of improved pastures; Agrostis capillaris declines across most treatments in 2001; higher litter input observed in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with fertility.
- Diversity and evenness: Increased dominance of certain species in improved plots; overall species richness higher in unimproved plots (24 species in Control/Biocide vs 18 in Nitrogen + Lime), suggesting fertility-driven changes in biodiversity.
- Spatial heterogeneity: Site shows inherent variation (columns on slope; central plots tend to have higher biomass; a positive pH–biomass relationship observed).
- Data integrity: Inter-observer reliability for botanical surveys found no significant differences between surveyors, supporting data consistency.

## Challenges and Data Gaps
- External disruption: FMD-related access limitations affected sampling windows and visitor presence in 2001.
- Site heterogeneity: Spatial differences across columns and slope influence baseline conditions and treatment effects, complicating cross-plot comparisons.
- Method changes: Switch from manual to mechanical cutting in 2001 likely inflated biomass measurements; normalisation to C1 used to mitigate but remains a consideration for longitudinal analyses.
- Data richness vs. gaps: Extensive data collected (weather, biomass, pH, botanical checks) with complex multi-year analyses; ensuring complete metadata and provenance is essential for future reuse.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Strategy (Data Leaders)
- Establish and maintain rich metadata: document treatment codes, plot layouts, mowing methods, observer identities, and any protocol changes to support cross-study reuse.
- Ensure data provenance and lineage: track changes in management, personnel, and instrumentation (e.g., switch to mechanical sowing/cutting) that affect measurements.
- Promote data quality and consistency: include inter-observer reliability checks for observational data; standardize sampling dates and methods across years.
- Facilitate cross-year comparability: normalisation strategies (e.g., to C1) should be clearly documented and consistently applied; consider baseline and year-over-year controls in analyses.
- Integrate multi-source data: weather, soil chemistry, and botanical data should be linked via a common schema to enable integrated analyses and reproducibility.
- Governance and access: ensure data are stored with clear access pathways (e.g., CEH data manager for weather data) and maintain audit trails for dataset updates and corrections.
