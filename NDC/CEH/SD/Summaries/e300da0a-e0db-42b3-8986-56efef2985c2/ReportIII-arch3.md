# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Purpose: provide a broad monitoring context for more detailed studies, enable year-to-year comparisons, and link site context with group-specific data.
- Monitoring aims emphasize data usefulness, stakeholder learning, data verification, and clear presentation of findings to inform policy and future decisions.

## Monitoring framework and data types

- Table 1 outlines the types and dates of measurements collected across 1998–2001, designed for cross-year comparability and context for detailed studies.
- Management and access context:
  - Field activity affected by 2001 Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions (visitor access halted Feb–May 2001). Operations resumed under a defined protocol.
  - Officer in charge changed in 2001; site management plan continued with minor disruptions (one biocide application missed).
- Data management:
  - Automatic Weather Station data collected on-site and transmitted to the CEH data manager.
  - Protocols for botanical surveys and other assessments consistently followed, with checks for inter-observer consistency.

### 2. Results

#### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather data generally near long-term averages; rainfall similar to prior years, modestly lower temperatures, and slightly higher soil moisture compared with earlier years.
- Weather data provide context for interpreting biomass and vegetation responses.

#### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass higher than 2000, attributed to personnel changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalization against a control (C1) used to identify treatment effects, revealing:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime additions significantly increase biomass compared with unimproved plots.
  - Significant year-by-treatment interactions; no significant block effects.
- Quantitative results indicate nitrogen and lime together yield strong biomass increases, with nitrogen and/or lime effects persisting after normalisation.

#### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition raises surface soil pH (to ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots by Oct 2001).
- Nitrogen addition alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots show no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

#### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis surveyed about 50% of plots; inter-surveyor differences were not statistically significant, indicating consistent surveying.
- 2001 results show a 58% increase in total hits (plant incidences) compared with 2000, suggesting denser sward possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Treatment effects on species composition:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments, particularly in nitrogen and biocide or nitrogen+lime plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) increased in fertilized plots, especially where both nitrogen and lime were applied.
  - Less fertile pasture-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more prevalent in unimproved plots.
- Diversity: unimproved plots showed 24 species; nitrogen+lime plots showed 18 species, suggesting potential diversity reduction with stronger fertility treatment.
- Multivariate analysis (PCA) separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots aligned with Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass correlations: higher Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundances correlated with greater biomass, while grasses like Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis declined as biomass increased.
- Litter incidence increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed; columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic conditions, especially among Control or Biocide plots.
  - This spatial pattern interacts with treatment placement, affecting pH readings across the site.
- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Total and cumulative biomass show outlying plots with lower biomass across treatments, with central plots frequently exhibiting higher biomass (e.g., certain N+L or lime plots).
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant difference in biomass between blocks, indicating broader site heterogeneity beyond block design.

## Data integrity, governance and implications for monitoring

- Measurement consistency:
  - Botanical surveys (July 2001) followed the 2000 protocol; two surveyors contributed roughly equally, with no significant inter-surveyor differences.
- Data stewardship:
  - Regular weather data collection and transmission facilitated longitudinal context.
  - Documentation and reporting structure (including baseline data and year-to-year comparisons) support cross-study integration.
- Key implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - Fertility management (nitrogen and lime) measurably alters biomass productivity and shifts plant communities toward species associated with improved pastures.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within field experiments must be accounted for in design and analysis to avoid confounding treatment effects.
  - Standardized measurement schedules and metadata are essential for long-term comparability and integration with other datasets.
  - The shift in measurement methodology (manual to mechanical cutting) can inflate biomass readings; normalization against a common reference (C1) is an effective approach to preserve comparability.
  - Barriers to data sharing are mitigated by clear protocols, consistent data collection, and open presentation of metadata, aiding governance and policy-responsive monitoring.
