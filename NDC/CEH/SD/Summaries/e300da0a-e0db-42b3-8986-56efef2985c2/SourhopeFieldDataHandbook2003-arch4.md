# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview of the included material
- Detailed soil and vegetation data from Sourhope Field Site, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus ECOTRON PLOT data.
- Describes soil profiles across multiple horizons, depth ranges, and horizon-specific properties.
- Includes soil chemical analyses (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture, LOI, pH) and auger-sample results, plus vegetation survey data by subplot.
- Documents site context (grid references, altitude, slope, soil series) and cross-site connections (Ecotron, ECN, Micronet).

## Data assets and site design (Blocks 4–5 and ECOTRON)
- Block-by-block soil profiles with depth-specific horizons (examples: LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and descriptive notes on color, texture, structure, roots, stones.
- Extensive chemical and physical soil analyses by horizon (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O and CaCl2).
- Auger samples analyzed for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH, etc.
- Vegetation surveys by plot/subplot, including presence/absence and abundance proxies for key species.
- Ecotron plot data included for integrated soil-vegetation assessment.

## Data collection methods (block-level detail)
- Soil profiling:
  - Depths documented per horizon with descriptive labels and boundary characteristics.
  - Horizon naming and color/mottling patterns recorded; thick horizon sequences described (e.g., LF to Cg in various blocks).
- Auger sampling:
  - 0–30 cm cores collected in a W-pattern per plot; horizons described and samples prepared for chemical analysis.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Sampling within subplots, recording species codes, occurrence, and abundance proxies; data structured to support plot- and block-level summaries.
- Data provenance:
  - Samples barcoded and linked to horizon and plot records; data tied to site maps, plot layouts, and treatment allocations.

## Data processing, analytics, and findings (summary of methods)
- Laboratory analyses:
  - %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH measurements across horizons and auger samples.
- Statistical and classification approaches (from broader document context):
  - Vegetation data linked to National Vegetation Classification (NVC) and multivariate analyses; association patterns between indicator species and plots/habitats noted.
- Observed patterns (site-wide notes):
  - Depth- and block-related variation in soil chemistry; surface horizons acidic to humic, with pH trends changing with depth.
  - Dominant vegetation patterns align with upland grassland communities; edge effects and microhabitat variation identified in associations.

## Data storage, access, and provenance
- Storage:
  - Primary data and metadata stored on MLURI server; soil samples archived at CEH Merlewood (-80°C).
- Provenance and documentation:
  - Baseline and methodological context provided in Sourhope Field Site reports; cross-referenced with ECN and Micronet program records.
- Linkages:
  - Data tied to block geometry, treatment allocations, sampling year, and plot-level records for longitudinal analyses.

## Data quality, gaps, and limitations
- Coverage:
  - Vegetation sampling in blocks 4–5 covers multiple plots/subplots but is not exhaustive; some subplots remain unsampled, limiting full-site extrapolation.
- Anomalies:
  - Occurrence of anomalous soil chemistry values in certain blocks; requires cautious interpretation and cross-checking with horizon context.
- Temporal and spatial constraints:
  - Longitudinal insights depend on consistent re-sampling and standardized metadata across years and blocks.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates a scalable, multi-layer data framework:
  - Clear hierarchical site design (blocks → plots → subplots) supporting diverse data streams (vegetation and soil).
  - Integration of qualitative (presence/absence) and quantitative (chemical/physical) data enabling cross-domain analyses.
- Emphasizes robust data lifecycle management:
  - Systematic sample barcoding, centralized storage, and long-term archiving to support reproducibility and future re-analysis.
  - Comprehensive provenance tying methodology, sample IDs, and results to spatial layouts and treatments.
- Underlines data governance and collaboration needs:
  - Need for standardized metadata, horizon nomenclature, and data capture protocols to enable cross-site comparisons within networks (ECN, Micronet, Ecotron).
  - Documentation of year, plot/treatment context, and data quality notes crucial for reliable longitudinal analyses.
- Methodological templates for Data Leaders:
  - Block-randomized design, subplot subdivision, and integration of vegetation and soil data as a model for cross-site ecological monitoring.
  - Use of classification and multivariate analyses to identify patterns and indicators across networks.
- Strategic relevance:
  - Aligns long-term ecological data collection with networked monitoring goals, supporting cross-site learning, synthesis, and policy-relevant insights.
