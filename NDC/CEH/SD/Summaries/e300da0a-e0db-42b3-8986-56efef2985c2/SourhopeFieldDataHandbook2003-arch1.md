  - Top horizons are acidic; pH H2O ~4.76 (FH) to ~5.02 (Cx); pH CaCl2 ~3.88–4.01.
  - %N ranges from ~0.42 (Ah) to ~2.14 (H); %C from ~6.41 (Ah) to ~38.12 (FH); C:N ratios ~12–20 across horizons.
  - Loss on ignition (LOI) very high in surface horizons (e.g., ~73% in FH; ~64–64% in H), decreasing with depth.
  - Exchangeable Ca, Mg, K, Na show block-to-block variation; Mg sometimes higher in surface horizons (e.g., Mg ~4–5 meq/100 g in FH/H), with Ca and K persisting in deeper horizons.
  - Depth progression shows high organic content in surface horizons transitioning to more mineral-dominated layers with increasing horizon depth.

  - Surface horizons retain high organic content with modest mineral signals until deeper horizons.
  - Deeper horizons show reduced organic matter but still acidic and weathered with low Na and variable Ca/Mg.

- Vegetation survey links (Block 4, Plot 4A–4F):
  - Dominant grasses and community indicators align with the soil's pH, moisture, and organic matter status.
  - Indicator species include core grasses and moisture-tensitive taxa; community composition varies by micro-habitat within blocks.

## Key analytical implications and potential uses

- Study design enables analysis of lime and nitrogen amendments, biocide effects, and grazing proxies across a gradient of altitude and soil types.
- High-resolution horizon data support spatially explicit models of soil–vegetation interactions, nutrient dynamics, and organic-matter turnover.
- Integration opportunities:
  - Combine vegetation community data (Twinspan/NVC) with horizon chemistry (pH, C, N, LOI, Ca/Mg/K) and physical properties to explain patterns in plant communities.
  - Compare Block 4 vs Block 5 responses and assess within-site heterogeneity and micro-habitat effects.
- Analytical considerations:
  - Partial establishment-year sampling and micro-habitat variability.
  - Horizon-level data harmonization across blocks for robust cross-block comparisons.
  - Linking soil chemistry with vegetation indicators to evaluate potential drivers of community change under differing management scenarios.
