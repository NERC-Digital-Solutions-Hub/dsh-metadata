# SUMMARY It is now four years since the establishment of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, centred upon the intensive study of a large field experiment located at the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute's farm at Sourhope in the Scottish Borders.

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years of site monitoring focusing on above-ground biomass production (productivity), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
  - Investigation of three main management processes driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatment; with consideration of trampling effects.
  - Aims to understand how management alters functional plant groups and overall ecosystem function.

- Site and design
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for data collection.
  - Five annual treatments separating fertilised (nitrogen and/or lime added) from unfertilised plots; plus a mowing regime and an insecticide treatment (Dursban 4) applied after mowing.
  - Long-running baseline botanical survey (1998) and ongoing annual/periodic surveys, including:
    - Above-ground biomass sampling (1999–2002)
    - Point analysis surveys (2000–2002) with a 100-hole frame within a 0.5 m2 cell
    - Soil pH monitoring (since 1998, ~5 cm depth)
    - Soil moisture measurements (2002, 0–5/10/20 cm)
    - Weather data from an on-site Automatic Weather Station

- Major results and interpretations
  - Mowing effect
    - Repeated mowing (to ~6 cm) and the absence of grazing favored Festuca spp. over Agrostis spp.; promoted bryophyte expansion; overall reductions in some graminoids across treatments.
    - Stress-tolerant species expanded under most conditions, with greater expansions in unimproved plots (unfertilised).
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increased above-ground biomass; plots receiving both N and lime were the most productive, though signs of potential productivity peaking in these plots (soil pH near 7.0; possible moisture limitations).
    - Lime strongly increased soil pH; higher pH generally associated with greater productivity, but relationships varied by treatment (positive overall, but complex within individual plots).
  - Insecticide effect
    - Insecticide plots showed higher plant diversity in some years; possible link to reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist, though direct causation is tentative without herbivory data.
  - Trampling effect
    - 2002 C2 plots exhibited reduced productivity, likely due to trampling during peak fieldwork (e.g., 13CO2 pulse measurements).
  - Functional and community structure shifts
    - CSR-type functional groups (stress tolerators, competitors, ruderals) shifted by treatment; unfertilised plots favored stress-tolerators, fertilised plots favored competitive/ruderal types.
    - Bryophytes (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) became more abundant across the site, especially in unimproved plots; moss expansion linked to mowing height and lack of grazing.
  - Community composition and diversity
    - Point analyses revealed shifts in the relative abundance of Leytaceae grasses (Festuca rubra, Festuca ovina, Poa pratensis) and a decline in Agrostis spp. in 2002.
    - Shannon diversity index declined in the nitrogen-and-lime plots by 2002, while other treatments showed increases or smaller changes.
    - PCA and treatment-category analyses distinguished lime-treated plots from others; some nitrogen plots aligned with limed plots, indicating converging community traits under certain nutrient amendments.
  - Size and pattern of productivity
    - Across years, biomass generally increased relative to the 1999 baseline, with the strongest gains in N+L plots; however, 2002 saw overall reductions in biomass across several treatments and a block-position effect along the slope (lower blocks more productive than upper blocks in some years).

- Data and methods highlights (data products and analyses)
  - Biomass data
    - Annual above-ground biomass per plot derived from five summer harvests; treatment effects and year interactions tested via split-plot ANOVA.
  - Change metrics
    - Biomass expressed relative to Control 1; year-by-year comparisons show the relative performance of each treatment.
  - Community and diversity metrics
    - Point analysis hits by species, functional grouping (monocots/dicots/bryophytes), and within-treatment comparisons.
    - Shannon diversity indices over time by treatment.
  - Species and functional group analyses
    - Proportions of stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR groups tracked; significant treatment effects emerged by 2000–2002.
  - Multivariate analyses
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of 2002 point analysis data to separate improved vs unimproved plots and to assess grouping by liming and nitrogen treatments.
  - Appendices and data availability
    - Appendix 1–8: site maps, treatment summaries, species lists (vascular plants and bryophytes), weather data, biomass per plot, rank abundances, and 2000–2002 species-hit tables.
    - Detailed procedures for mowing dates, treatment applications, and data collection timelines.

- Data quality and gaps to note for data support
  - 2002 weather data had missing periods due to station malfunction; interpolations/ substitutions used (Konza station data) for some dates.
  - The C2 plots experienced trampling during intensive sampling/activity in 2002, affecting productivity readings.
  - Some plots (Control 2) had limited survey coverage in 2000–2001, potentially impacting cross-year comparability.
  - Bryophyte data and bryophyte-vegetation dynamics were increasingly emphasized; identification levels improved over time (2002 bryophyte resolution).
  - The dataset comprises multiple interconnected datasets (biomass, point analysis, species lists, soil chemistry, moisture, weather), requiring careful integration for cross-dataset analyses.

- Implications for data users and recommended data products
  - Build dashboards to compare productivity vs. soil pH and moisture across treatments and years.
  - Create self-service exploration tools for: 
    - biomass trajectories by plot treatment
    - shifts in functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) over time
    - species-level and bryophyte contributions by treatment
    - PCA-based clustering of plots to support treatment classification
  - Provide data provenance and metadata linking Appendix datasets (Appendices 5–8) with core analyses (Figure 1–4, Table 1) to facilitate reproducibility.
  - Use the documented anomalies (2002 weather gaps, trampling in C2 plots) to annotate any time-series analyses and interpret results with appropriate caveats.

- Bottom line for data support
  - The Sourhope Soil Biodiversity site yields a rich, multi-dimensional dataset linking management (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) to above-ground productivity, plant community composition, and functional-group dynamics, with extensive temporal coverage (1999–2002) and complementary soil and weather data. Data products enable cross-cutting insights into how nutrient amendments, disturbance regimes, and herbivore pressures shape grassland biodiversity and productivity, while highlighting data quality considerations and the value of integrated, longitudinal data presentation for end users.
