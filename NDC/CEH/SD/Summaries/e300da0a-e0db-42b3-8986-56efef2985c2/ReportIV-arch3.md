# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years of intensive monitoring at the Sourhope field site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to understand soil biota diversity and ecosystem processes, and to link below-ground activity with above-ground plant communities.
- Monitoring focused on above-ground biomass productivity, plant species composition and diversity, and their functional characteristics, in relation to a set of managed treatments.

## Site design and management (methods overview)

- Location: Sourhope, Rigg Foot Experimental Site with five replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
- Experimental design: Each block contains 6 main plots with randomised treatments; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; outputs allocated to research groups on a 0.5 m x 0.5 m grid.
- Treatments (plot-level, plus site-wide mowing):
  - Control 1 and Control 2 (no nutrient or disturbance inputs)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4, applied after mowing; previously "Biocide")
- Site management since 1999:
  - Monthly mowing (May–Sept) to ~6 cm.
  - Insecticide applications following each mowing on designated plots.
  - Nutrient amendments (N and/or lime) applied in spring (varied by year).
- Data collection cadence:
  - Regular weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002).
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 sampling within sub-plots prior to each mowing, dried and weighed.
  - Baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual/periodic point-analysis surveys (1998 baseline; 2000–2002 repeated surveys) using 0.5 m2 cells and 100-hole point quadrats.
  - Soil sampling for pH (since 1998) and, in 2002, soil moisture at 5 cm and theta-probe measurements; additional site surveys and small-scale botanical biomass assessments.
- Research activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with several groups in 2002, including labelled CO2 pulse experiments.

## Key monitoring measures and data types

- Above-ground productivity:
  - Annual biomass estimates per plot (May–Sept harvests; data log transformed for analyses).
- Plant community composition and diversity:
  - Species presence and abundance from point analyses; bryophyte (mosses/liverworts) assessment; species lists; dominance shifts among Festuca and Agrostis species.
  - Shannon diversity index derived from point analyses; tracked across years and treatments.
- Functional classification of plants:
  - CSR framework (Competitiveness C, Stress-tolerance S, Ruderality R) and SR/CSR groupings to describe how communities respond to nutrient status and disturbance.
  - Analysis of shifts in functional groups with fertilisation and disturbance regime.
- Soil and micro-environmental factors:
  - Soil pH (5 cm depth) measured repeatedly; effect of lime and nitrogen on pH.
  - Soil moisture content (theta probe) and relationship with pH and productivity.
- Weather and broader context:
  - On-site weather data (rainfall, radiation, temperature) to contextualise productivity and stress.

## Findings and trends (2002 highlights)

- Biomass productivity:
  - Long-term trend of increasing biomass across treatments since 1999.
  - 2002 showed overall reductions in biomass across many treatments compared with 2001; the most productive plots remained those receiving both nitrogen and lime.
  - A clear slope-related pattern: blocks higher on the slope (e.g., Block 5) showed greater declines than lower blocks (e.g., Block 1).
- Fertilisation effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime positively affect productivity; plots with both N and lime highest in productivity, though signs of saturation/peaking in highly fertilised plots (possibly linked to higher soil pH and reduced moisture).
  - Lime raised soil pH toward ~7 in upper soil horizons; higher pH correlated with changes in productivity and moisture, with a nuanced relationship when considered per treatment (positive overall but variable within treatments).
  - Interaction: increasing pH (via lime) supports more competitive, less stress-tolerant species in fertilised plots; combined N+L shows strong C-S-R expansion.
- Insecticide (insect herbivory) effects:
  - Evidence suggests insecticide treatment may influence plant diversity indirectly via herbivory pressure; broader interpretation aligns with literature showing complex plant–insect interactions affecting diversity, though direct causation remains cautious without explicit herbivory data.
- Trampling effect:
  - In plots where trampling occurred (notably C2 plots during 13CO2 pulse activities), productivity reductions were observed, indicating disturbance intensity can suppress growth.
- Community composition and diversity:
  - Species typically associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) increased in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. declined, indicating a shift away from species typical of unimproved pasture.
  - Bryophytes expanded across the site, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, contributing to higher bryophyte representation in unimproved plots.
  - Point-analysis and PCA show clear separation between improved (nitrogen and/or lime) vs unimproved plots; bryophytes increasingly represented in 2001–2002 surveys.
  - Shannon diversity declined in the N&L plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while other treatments showed increases (notably insecticide plots). Functional-group analyses show:
    - Increase in C-S-R and SR/C-S-R species in fertilised plots (N and/or L), driven by more favorable growth conditions.
    - Stress-tolerators gained most in unimproved plots, reflecting low disturbance and nutrient limitations.
- Overall indicate:
  - Management choices (nutrients, lime, disturbance via mowing, insecticide use) drive predictable shifts in plant functional composition, diversity, and bryophyte prevalence, with potential implications for ecosystem function such as productivity, nutrient cycling, and habitat structure.

## Data, interpretation, and policy relevance

- The study demonstrates the value of multi-faceted monitoring (productivity, species composition, functional traits, soil chemistry, moisture, and weather) to understand how management practices influence ecosystem structure and function.
- The CSR framework provides a structured lens to interpret how plant communities reassemble under different nutrient and disturbance regimes, informing policy on sustainable land management and biodiversity outcomes.
- The observed trade-offs (higher productivity with N/L vs increased bryophyte expansion and potential reductions in some vascular diversity) highlight the need to balance agricultural productivity with biodiversity and habitat quality goals.

## Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks

- Data quality and accessibility:
  - Comprehensive, multi-layer data require robust metadata, consistent data governance, and transparent sharing practices to be usable for policy evaluation.
- Long-term continuity:
  - Longitudinal monitoring captures lagged responses (e.g., species turnover, bryophyte expansion) and helps identify regime shifts beyond yearly variability.
- Site-specific factors:
  - Slope position, disturbance history (e.g., past grazing cessation, mowing regime), and microclimate can strongly influence outcomes and should be incorporated into monitoring design and interpretation.
- Data limitations and contingencies:
  - Equipment failures (e.g., 2002 weather station issues) and external constraints (e.g., disease-related access restrictions) underscore the need for redundancy and clear data-gap handling in monitoring plans.

## Implications for monitoring policy and future decisions

- Management strategies:
  - Fertilisation increases productivity but can alter species composition toward competitive, less diverse communities; careful nutrient and disturbance management is important to maintain biodiversity alongside productivity.
- Biodiversity indicators:
  - Bryophyte expansion and shifts in functional groups (CSR) can serve as sensitive indicators of disturbance and nutrient status, complementing traditional vascular plant metrics.
- Data governance needs:
  - Public sharing of underlying data should be considered alongside data quality and privacy; establishing clear provenance, metadata standards, and data management at source supports reuse for policy analysis.

- Overall, the Sourhope site demonstrates how a structured, multi-metric monitoring framework can inform policy by linking management actions (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide use) to ecological responses in productivity, community composition, and functional trait dynamics.
