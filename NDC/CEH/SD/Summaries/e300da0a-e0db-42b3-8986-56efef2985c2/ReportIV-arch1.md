Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Introduction
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders).
- Aims: understand soil biodiversity and its feedbacks with above-ground plant communities; monitor above-ground productivity, composition, and diversity.
- Site management: previously grazed by sheep; since April 1998 fenced off from all grazing; 1999 established five summer cuts to 6 cm; five plot-level treatments (nitrogen and/or lime, insecticide) plus a site-level mowing regime.
- Baseline vegetation mapped as Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland; focus on how above-ground plant communities respond to treatments and mowing.

## Methods (incorporating site activity)
- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; randomised treatments across plots.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatments); Nitrogen; Lime; Nitrogen & Lime; Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA). Site-level management: monthly mowing May–September to ~6 cm.
- Data collection:
  - Automatic Weather Station for climate data.
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 random clippings per sub-plot, dried and weighed, collected annually 1999–2002.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; annual July/August point analyses (0.5 m2 cell per sub-plot, 100-point frame, 25-point pin-downs); bryophyte identification enhanced in 2002.
  - Soil: pH monitoring (5 cm depth); soil moisture via theta probe in 2002; regular soil sampling since 1998.
  - Additional small surveys: vegetation cover, biomass sorting, and species lists (including bryophytes).
- Research activity: phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with 13CO2 pulses and gases measurements conducted on site in 2002.

## Results
### 3.1 Automatic weather station
- 2002 saw lower rainfall in April and September, with wetter periods in February, July, and late year; winter 2001/02 was unusually mild.

### 3.2 Above-ground biomass estimates
- Biomass showed a consistent treatment hierarchy; however, 2002 production fell relative to 2001 across several treatments.
- Nitrogen and Lime (N+L) plots remained the most productive, with the strongest biomass gains in these plots; Control 2 plots showed the largest declines.
- A clear slope-related pattern: lower blocks (bottom of slope) showed larger declines than upper blocks.
- Overall long-term trend since 1999: biomass increased across treatments, despite 2002 dip; significant treatment-year interaction (statistically significant through ANOVA).

### 3.3 Interaction between soil pH, moisture and productivity
- Lime raised soil pH significantly (toward ~7.0 in limed plots); Nitrogen had a smaller positive effect; controls and insecticide plots largely unchanged from 1998.
- Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68).
- Across all treatments, higher pH correlated with higher above-ground productivity (strong positive relationship); within N or Lime only plots, the positive relationship persisted but was weaker; in plots with both N and Lime, the relationship weakened or reversed, suggesting non-linear dynamics at higher pH and moisture constraints.

### 3.4 Point Analysis survey
- In 2002, improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominated hits in N+L and Lime plots; unimproved plots remained dominated by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
- Bryophytes (mosses/liverworts) increased across the site, particularly in unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide), contributing to higher bryophyte hits over 2000–2002.
- Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined by >40% since 2000 across treatments, whereas Festuca rubra increased (notably in lime/limed+N plots).
- Diversity (Shannon index) differences emerged from 2000 and intensified through 2002, with nitrogen and lime treatments showing reduced diversity relative to other treatments.
- Functional groups (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderal CSR; SR/C-S-R) accounted for a majority of species hits; by 2002, clear treatment effects appeared in all functional groups:
  - C-S-R species expanded in N+L plots.
  - Stress-tolerant species benefited most in unimproved plots.
  - SR/C-S-R species reduced in lime-treated and insecticide plots.
- Trends by 2002: significant contrasts among treatments for the distribution of functional groups and bryophyte dominance; PCA and other analyses separated improved from unimproved plots, with lime-treated samples often clustering together.

## Discussion
### 4.1 Mowing effect
- Notable decline in Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis (>40% overall since 2000) across all treatments, suggesting a site-level effect rather than a single treatment cause.
- Festuca rubra expanded, especially in fertilised plots, linking to improved soil fertility and regrowth after mowing.
- Widespread expansion of bryophytes, possibly due to a consistent sward height (~6 cm) and reduced grazing disturbance; moss growth moderated by higher vascular plant productivity in fertilised plots.

### 4.2 Fertilisation effect
- Long-term productivity boost from N and/or lime; greatest gains when both applied together (N+L).
- Signs of productivity peak in the most fertilised plots, potentially related to very high soil pH (~7) and reduced soil moisture, which may induce plant stress during dry periods.
- Lime had a stronger influence on shifting communities toward competitive-stress-ruderal types; high pH beneficial for C-S-R species, while nitrogen alone was less effective for these shifts.
- Chlorosis observed in some lime-treated plots; higher pH and moisture dynamics may influence plant stress responses.

### 4.3 Insecticide effect
- Complex plant–insect interactions; soil insecticide could increase diversity in some contexts but may depress it later depending on life-history groups and subsequent herbivory pressure.
- Cautious interpretation: cannot conclusively attribute diversity changes to insecticide alone; observed patterns align with potential reduction in herbivory allowing more palatable, competitive species to persist.

### 4.4 Trampling effect
- First-year C2 trampling coincided with intensive labeling activities (13CO2 pulses); productivity declined in these plots relative to C1, suggesting trampling disturbance as a contributing factor.

## Implications and takeaways for data-driven decision making
- Long-term fertilisation (N and Lime) reliably increases above-ground productivity but can reduce plant diversity and shift functional composition toward competitive-stress-ruderal types; management should balance productivity with biodiversity goals.
- Regular mowing with grazing exclusion promotes stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities; mowing height and disturbance regime strongly influence species balance and moss proliferation.
- Soil chemistry, especially pH management, strongly modulates productivity and community structure; excessively high pH may exceed optimal ranges for some species and affect moisture-competition dynamics.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are complex and context-dependent; any decision to rely on insecticidal management should consider potential indirect effects on plant–herbivore interactions and subsequent plant community shifts.
- Disturbance during experimental procedures (e.g., trampling from sampling or pulse-labeling campaigns) can materially affect short-term productivity and should be accounted for in interpreting results.
