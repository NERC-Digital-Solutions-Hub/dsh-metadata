# SUMMARY

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, the Sourhope site (Scottish Borders) has been intensively monitored to link soil biodiversity with above-ground plant productivity, diversity, and community structure.
- The project integrates 16 Phase I projects (below-ground focus) with ongoing above-ground botanical monitoring to understand how management actions affect both systems and their feedbacks.

## Context and Scope of Data

- Location and design: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, 5 replicate blocks, each with 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for per-plot data collection.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
- Site-level management: monthly mowing May–September to ~6 cm; post-mowing application of Dursban 4 OPA insecticide; spring application of nitrogen and/or lime as designated.
- Data collected (since 1998–2002): weather data (on-site Automatic Weather Station); above-ground biomass (per 0.5 m2 cell across five summer cuts); baseline vegetation survey (1998) and repeated 0.5 m2 point analyses in 2000–2002; soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in 2002); bryophyte and vascular plant species data; extensive appendices detailing species lists, treatments, and biomass time series.
- Analysis approaches: split-plot ANOVA for biomass (1999–2002), PCA for point-analysis communities, and various diversity metrics (Shannon index) across years and treatments.

## Key Findings by Theme

- Mowing effect
  - Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most treatments.
  - Festuca rubra expanded, especially in more fertile plots (lime and/or nitrogen).
  - Bryophytes expanded broadly, aided by a consistent sward height (~6 cm) and reduced disturbance from grazing.
  - Overall shift toward stress-tolerant species in unfertilised plots; moss dominance increased with mowing and grazing exclusion.

- Fertilisation effect
  - Productivity increased with nitrogen and/or lime; the N+L combination gave the strongest biomass gains.
  - Mean soil pH rose toward ~7.0 in limed plots; high lime input linked to lower soil moisture stress but potential chlorosis in some conditions.
  - In plots with both N and lime, C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) species expanded, suggesting increased nutrient availability and growth pace; C-S-R response less pronounced in N-only plots.

- Insecticide effect
  - Diversity (Shannon index) tends to be higher in insecticide-treated plots, consistent with reduced herbivory allowing a broader future of palatable species.
  - The observed patterns align with prior work on herbivory–diversity links, though direct causal attribution remains cautious without more mechanistic data.

- Trampling effect
  - 2002 C2 plots showed sharp productivity declines likely due to trampling during intense 13CO2 pulse experiments, indicating disturbance can depress biomass locally despite broader fertilisation/mowing trends.

- Community composition and functional groups
  - Point-analysis data show clearer separation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly in multivariate space (PCA).
  - Bryophyte hits increased across years, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to overall shifts in biomass composition.
  - Functional-group dynamics (S: stress-tolerators; CSR: competitive-stress-ruderals; SR/CSR): by 2002, significant differences among treatments emerged in all three groups, with unfertilised plots favoring S, and N&L plots supporting CSR/SR combinations.

- Biomass trends and environmental context
  - Although 2002 biomass was lower than 2001, the long-term trend (1999–2002) shows increased productivity relative to the 1999 baseline, with the strongest gains in N and especially N+L plots.
  - There is a strong slope-related gradient in productivity: lower on the upper slope blocks, higher toward the bottom.
  - Soil moisture, interacting with pH, modulates biomass; higher pH generally associates with higher productivity, but relationships vary by treatment.

- 2002 Data specifics and notable patterns
  - Control plots showed relatively stable or increasing bryophyte contributions; N&L plots showed reduced bryophyte hits relative to others.
  - The proportion of Festuca spp. versus Agrostis spp. shifted toward Festuca rubra in several treatments.
  - Shannon diversity declined in N&L relative to other treatments, while diversity increased in several other plots (e.g., insecticide-treated).

## Data Management, Quality, and Analytical Observations

- Experimental design robustness: randomized plot-level treatments within 5 blocks along downslope environmental gradients; significance of treatment effects and treatment-by-year interactions confirmed for biomass.
- Data breadth and longevity: long-running dataset (1998–2002) with multi-modal measurements (biomass, species hits, soil chemistry, moisture, weather); large appendices provide detailed treatment maps, species lists, and biomass time series.
- Gaps and data issues: 2002 weather data gaps due to a station fault; some missing survey years for certain plots (noted in Appendices); occasional interruptions due to foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001.
- Data discoverability and reuse potential: rich, multi-project context (Phase I/II) with explicit appendices on site activity, treatments, species lists, and biomass rankings; high potential for cross-project synthesis and meta-analyses if harmonized metadata and data dictionaries are created.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Strengthen data architecture for long-running multi-factor experiments:
  - Ensure consistent, machine-readable metadata across years (treatment codes, plot geometry, measurement protocols, units, and timing).
  - Maintain a central data repository with standardized variable names to enable cross-project integration (soil, vegetation, and weather data streams).
- Enhance data quality and continuity:
  - Implement redundancy and alerting for on-site sensors to minimize data gaps (e.g., weather station uptime).
  - Document and track treatment changes and plot-level disturbances (e.g., trampling events, mowing schedules) for proper confounding control.
- Promote data discoverability and reuse:
  - Provide clear data dictionaries, versioning, and data provenance (Appendices and methods already offer depth; extend with machine-actionable schemas).
  - Facilitate cross-project data linking (e.g., link plant community metrics with soil biodiversity datasets and meteorological histories).
- Leverage the value of multi-temporal, multi-factor data:
  - Use the 1998–2002 time series to model long-term responses to mowing, fertilisation, and insect herbivory pressure across functional groups.
  - Consider CSR/SR functional-group dynamics as a framework for integrating above- and below-ground responses in community-level data products.
- Recommend governance and collaboration:
  - Establish a data governance plan that aligns with the wider Soil Biodiversity Programme, ensuring discoverability, proper metadata standards, and data sharing among Phase I/II researchers.
  - Encourage cross-disciplinary datasets (botany, soil biology, and ecosystem processes) to support system-wide data strategy and co-ownership of data products.
