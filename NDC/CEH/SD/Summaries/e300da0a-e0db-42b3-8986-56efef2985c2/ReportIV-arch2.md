# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) monitoring above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and diversity.
- Three major management influences on plant communities:
  - Mowing: post-1998 fencing and 6 cm mowing height; shifts toward Festuca spp. and away from Agrostis spp.; potential bryophyte expansion due to consistent sward height.
  - Fertilisation: nitrogen and/or lime markedly boost productivity; lime drives soil pH toward 7.0 in some plots; potential long-term nutrient retention differences due to clipping removal.
  - Insecticide: possible promotion of diversity in some plots; associations with reduced herbivory are discussed, but evidence is circumstantial.
- Additional consideration: trampling in C2 plots (first-time surveys in 2002) likely reduced productivity due to intense activity around 13CO2 pulse experiments.

- Site and experimental design
  - Rigg Foot/Sourhope site with 5 replicated blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots randomly assigned treatments and subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide).
  - Managed vegetation: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; periodic nitrogen and/or lime applications; insecticide applied after mowing on designated plots.
  - Data collection since 1999 includes automatic weather data, above-ground biomass per 0.5 m2 cell, baseline vegetation survey (1998), annual point analyses (2000–2002), soil pH monitoring, soil moisture, and targeted small surveys.

- Key data and trends (2002)
  - Biomass production: overall biomass remained higher in fertilised plots, with nitrogen + lime plots most productive; 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 across many treatments; Block- and slope-position effects observed (Block 1 shows larger increases in 2001, while Block 5 shows larger declines in 2002).
  - Fertilisation effects: strong positive impact of nitrogen and lime on productivity; potential plateau or decline in highly fertilised plots, possibly linked to very high pH and drier conditions.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity: lime raises soil pH substantially (near 7 in upper soil); nitrogen also raises pH modestly; higher pH correlates with higher biomass when considering all plots, but the relationship varies by treatment, sometimes turning negative in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Soil moisture: negative correlation between moisture and pH; drier conditions in high-pH plots may influence productivity.
  - Point Analysis and species composition: improvements associated with lime and/or nitrogen include higher hits of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; improved plots show more fertile-condition species, while unimproved plots maintain dominance by Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Bryophytes: bryophyte hits increased across the site, rising to 19.92% of total hits in 2002 (up from 6.48% in 2000); unimproved plots show the strongest bryophyte increases and concurrent declines in monocots.
  - Functional composition (CSR framework): three main functional groups (stress tolerators S, competitive-stress ruderal CSR, and SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of hits; by 2002, treatment differences were significant across all groups.
    - Nitrogen & Lime plots: C-S-R species tend to dominate, aided by higher pH and growth rates.
    - Unfertilised plots: S (stress-tolerators) are favored under lower nutrient conditions and disturbance regimes.
    - Lime- and/or nitrogen-treated plots show reduced SR/CSR groups, particularly with lime and/or insecticide.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon index differences emerged from 2000 onward; by 2002, the Shannon index fell by about 15% in nitrogen & lime plots, while other treatments showed increases (2–29%), indicating shifts in species composition and evenness.
  - Community structure (PCA): 2002 PCA differentiates improved (fertilised/limed) vs unimproved plots; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots, illustrating converging vegetation characteristics under certain nutrient amendments.
  - Species dynamics: notable declines in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis since 2000; Festuca rubra expands particularly in fertilised plots; bryophytes increase in dominance in unimproved plots.
  - Litter and dead vegetation: 2001–2002 show significant treatment differences in litter hits, with the highest means in N&L plots and the lowest in Control 1.
  - C2 (trampling) plots: marked productivity drop in 2002 attributed to trampling during intensive sampling/activity.

- Implications for management and data value
  - Management signals:
    - Fertilisation boosts productivity but may reduce diversity in highly fertilised plots; careful balance of N and lime is needed to maintain both productivity and diversity.
    - Regular mowing without grazing appears to favor stress-tolerant and bryophytic expansion, particularly where fertility remains low.
    - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require more evidence to confirm causation; potential indirect benefits via moderated herbivory on certain taxa.
    - Trampling on C2 plots highlights sensitivity of productivity measurements to disturbance regimes; data interpretation should account for such site activities.
  - Data value and sharing:
    - The study emphasises increasing the usefulness of datasets by integrating with other data sources and enabling access to underlying data used to generate outputs.

- Documentation and resources
  - Extensive appendices provide site maps, treatment summaries, species lists (including bryophytes), weather data, biomass records, point-analysis results, and PCA loadings.
  - References anchor interpretations in CSR plant functional typing, grazing studies, and soil-plant interactions.

- Endnote
  - The Sourhope site demonstrates clear, treatment-related shifts in productivity and plant community structure, with fertilisation driving productivity and pH-mediated shifts in species composition, while mowing and trampling produce distinct ecological responses including bryophyte expansion and changes in functional group dominance.
