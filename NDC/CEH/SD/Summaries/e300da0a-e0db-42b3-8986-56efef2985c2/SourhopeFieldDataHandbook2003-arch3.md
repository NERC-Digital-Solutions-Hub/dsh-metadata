# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview

- Documents soil and vegetation data collection at Sourhope's Rigg Foot site, focusing on long-term monitoring of soil-vegetation interactions as part of environmental change research.
- Part of a broader monitoring framework linking soil chemistry, physical properties, and plant communities to support policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decisions.

## Data Collected and Site Details (Block 4 and Block 5)

- Site context
  - Rigg Foot, Sourhope; Block 4 and Block 5 profiling with detailed horizon descriptions.
  - Soils described as Brown Forest soils with varying gleying and peat influence (Block 5 explicitly noted as Brown forest soil with gleying); Block 4 profiles show multiple horizons with igneous stones and distinctive boundary descriptions.
  - Landforms include north/slope aspects with stone content and fine roots; bedrock/parent material dominated by igneous/andesite components.
- Soil profile descriptions (selected horizon sets)
  - Block 4: LF (0–1 cm) fibrous, FH (1–4 cm) fibrous, H (4–8 cm) black with amorphous structure, Ah (8–29 cm) dark brown sandy silt loam with roots, Abg (29–40 cm) pinkish grey with mottling, B sg (40–61 cm) brown sandy silt loam, C gx (61–95 cm) reddish brown sandy clay loam with abundant stones.
  - Block 5: LF (0–1 cm) fibrous, FH (1–5 cm) semi-fibrous, H (5–7 cm) black with weak blocky structure, Ah (7–25 cm) very dark brown sandy silt loam with roots and stones, AB (25–35 cm) grey coarse sandy loam, Bg/BCg (35–70 cm) reddish/brown horizons with mottles and clay loam, Cg (70–100 cm) light reddish brown clay loam with massive structure.
- Soil analyses (profiles)
  - Data per horizon include: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), pH in water, pH in CaCl2.
  - Example patterns (Block 4 and Block 5)
    - Surface horizons show higher LOI and %C (organic-rich), with elevated %N in Ah horizons and substantial plant-root activity.
    - pH values indicate acidic conditions, typically pH 4.5–5.0 in H2O and around pH 3.8–4.2 in CaCl2 for upper horizons, gradually acidifying with depth.
    - Calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) contents are relatively higher in near-surface horizons and tend to decrease with depth; potassium (K) and other cations show block-to-block variability.
  - Depth-wise patterns: Surface horizons (FH/H/Ah) display highest organic content and LOI; deeper horizons (BCg/Cg) show reduced organic content and different mineral compositions.
- Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Multiple auger samples per horizon/subsample with measured %N, %C, C:N ratios, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, and pH CaCl2.
  - General trends mirror profile data: higher %C and %N in surface samples; wide C:N ratios (roughly 12–14 in many samples); acidic pH values; variable cation contents by sample.
- Vegetation surveys (Block 4 and Block 5)
  - Plot- and subplot-level vegetation surveys recorded presence/absence and totals of species, enabling pattern analyses across microtopography and horizon layers.
  - Data include counts of species totals per subplot and plot, with repeated observations across A–F subplots, reflecting community composition and potential edge effects.
  - Results indicate diverse grass–forb assemblages with varying indicator species and community patterns across plots (data structured to support association analyses and classification) 

- Ecotron soil site
  - Separate soil analysis for the Ecotron plot showing %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH values (H2O and CaCl2), providing a controlled-environment reference within the broader monitoring framework.
  - Vegetation survey data for Ecotron plot recorded presence/absence and totals across subplots, supporting integrated analyses of controlled conditions versus field plots.

## Experimental Design and Monitoring Framework

- Block-based replicated design
  - Multiple blocks with detailed soil profiling and vegetation sampling to capture spatial variability and permit robust statistical analysis.
  - Contains emphasis on horizon-specific measurements to relate soil processes to vegetation patterns.
- Data integration
  - Combines soil chemical/physical properties with vegetation data to understand soil-plant interactions, enabling evaluation of management or policy scenarios over time.
- Long-term data objectives
  - Establish baselines, track changes, and inform policy evaluation related to soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem responses under environmental change.

## Data Management, Challenges, and Governance

- Metadata and provenance
  - Comprehensive documentation of sampling, horizon coding, and laboratory analyses; archival storage of samples and data for long-term monitoring.
- Data sharing and openness
  - Public sharing of underlying data is noted as a potential barrier; governance is required to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored consistently, and remain accessible for reuse.
- Silo and collaboration considerations
  - Acknowledges possible organizational silos; emphasizes stakeholder engagement to avoid duplication and to maximise data utility across blocks, plots, and networks.
- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates how a multi-faceted, long-term monitoring setup can inform policy evaluation, sustainability assessments, and land-use decisions through integrated soil and vegetation indicators.

## Beginning, Middle, and End: Overall Narrative

- Beginning
  - Establishes Sourhope as a secure, established site with long-term monitoring potential for soil biodiversity within environmental change research.
- Middle
  - Details a rigorous, replicated design across blocks with extensive soil profiling, auger sampling, and vegetation surveys, establishing baseline community structure and soil properties.
- End
  - Delivers a comprehensive baseline data framework and analytical approaches (per horizon analyses, auger data, and vegetation totals) while highlighting data management and governance considerations essential for informing monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation.
