# Microbial biomass measurements from an upland grassland liming experiment [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, aimed to understand soil biota diversity and their functional roles in key ecological processes; 24 projects studied soil structure, processes (carbon and nitrogen cycles), and biota from micro- to macro-scale.
- This dataset focuses on soil microbial biomass carbon (Cmic), basal respiration, and metabolic quotient (qCO2) from an upland grassland liming experiment using soil from Sourhope.

## Study site and experimental design

- Location: Sourhope field site, Kelso, Scotland; upland grassland with soils developed on Old Red Sandstone-derived drift; pH 4.5–5.0; mean 40% clay in the 2 mm fraction.
- Plant community: mixture of 24 higher-plant species, 21 form AM mycorrhizas.
- Experimental design: 5-block x 4-treatment completely randomized; 20 turfs (40 cm x 25 cm x 20 cm) removed from plots (20 m x 12 m total).
- Treatments: Control, Lime (CaCO3, 39% Ca; 0.6 kg m-2), N (NH4NO3; 12 g m-2), Lime + N.
- Management: mown six times per summer with clippings removed; site fenced and ungrazed since 1999.

## Measurements and methods

- Sample processing: intact soil cores (FH and Ah horizons) separated and sieved (2 mm); 10 g subsamples used for microbial analyses.
- Basal respiration: measured with a sealed Respicond respirometer; samples incubated at 22°C; CO2 evolution logged over 8 hours.
- Microbial biomass carbon (Cmic): determined by substrate-induced respiration; 10 g soil incubated with glucose (10 mg g dry weight) and respiration measured; Cmic calculated from the maximum rate within 4 hours (Anderson & Domsch method).
- Metabolic quotient (qCO2): calculated as basal respiration divided by Cmic.
- Microbial community perturbation: seeds of Agrostis capillaris used and roots inserted into turfs to study AMF-related responses.

- Key fields:
  - SAMPID (sample identifier)
  - SAMPLE_DATE (sampling date)
  - BLOCK (block number)
  - MAIN_PLOT (plot designation)
  - HORIZON (FH or Ah)

## Quality control and data use

- Quality assurance: numeric range checks, formatting conformity, and logical integrity checks.
- Limitations: NERC explicitly does not warrant the accuracy or fitness for purpose of the data; no liability for use or reliance on the data.
- Data stewardship: datasets are prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals, consistent with standard monitoring data practices.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring

- Demonstrates standardized, multi-treatment soil microbial measurements suitable for temporal monitoring and cross-site comparisons.
- Emphasizes data quality control, documentation, and interoperability (clear metadata and field definitions) to support broader environmental health assessments.
- Highlights the value of linking microbial indicators (Cmic, basal respiration, qCO2) with soil management practices (liming, nitrogen) and horizons to inform carbon and nutrient cycling understanding.
