# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Scope and context
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders, under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad context for diverse studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; baseline site description available in Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- Data types span weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with monitoring designed to support cross-group analyses and data discovery.

## Datasets and data collection
- Automatic Weather Station data collected on-site (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture); regularly downloaded and shared with the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- Above-ground biomass measured via five mowing occasions per summer (May–Sept); clippings dried and weighed; biomass estimates for each plot summed and ln-transformed for analysis.
- Soil pH measured in surface soil (0–5 cm) to track lime and nitrogen effects; lime application raised pH notably; nitrogen also raised pH modestly.
- Botanical composition assessed with Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 mirroring July 2000 protocol); species hits tallied per plot; data used for PCA and correlation with biomass.
- Data management and storage:
  - Site data managed by MLURI Sourhope; weather data managed by CEH Merlewood (Data Manager).
  - Measurements and protocols detailed in Table 1 (data collection schedule) and accompanying figures/appendices.
  - Data normalization and cross-year comparability implemented (e.g., biomass values normalized to C1 in year analyses).

## Experimental design and treatments
- Treatments (per plot) include:
  - Control 1 (C1) and Control 2 (C2)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L)
  - Biocide (B)
- Management events affecting data:
  - 2001 FMD outbreak restricted site access; observers followed a vet-approved protocol; one biocide application initially missed.
  - Change of officer in charge (May 2001) with ongoing site management plan adjustments.
- Protocols and data quality:
  - Inter-survey consistency tested; no significant difference between two surveyors in 2001 (p = 0.18).
  - Data collected across multiple sub-plots and blocks to assess treatment effects and spatial variability.

## Key results by data type

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 weather close to long-term averages; rainfall similar to 2000; minor reductions in average temperatures; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - Clear hierarchical treatment effect: N and/or L additions increased biomass; Nitrogen + Lime most effective.
  - 2001 biomass higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to staff changes and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass analyses show significant treatment effects and a year-by-treatment interaction; blocks not significant.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime raised surface pH consistently; 2001 values: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone raised pH modestly; controls stable since 1998 baseline.

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - 2001 total hits in point surveys 58% higher than 2000; increases observed across treatments.
  - Species shifts by treatment:
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments (except lingering in some controls).
    - Festuca rubra and Festuca ovina increased across treatments, especially in fertilized plots.
    - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) enriched in N and/or L plots.
    - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in untreated plots.
  - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in improved plots, suggesting developing diversity changes with fertility.
  - PCA shows clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; biomass positively linked with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Correlations between individual species abundances and biomass indicate grasses associated with higher biomass increase with fertilization; litter and bryophyte presence increases with higher soil fertility.

## Site heterogeneity
- Spatial variation in pH and vegetation:
  - Columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic plots, suggesting underlying spatial heterogeneity (partly influenced by plot composition and slope).
  - Biomass distribution shows outliers with lower biomass on some edge plots; central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., N&L 2E, Lime 2C, Biocide 2D, Control 1 2B).
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, though no overall block effect detected.

## Data governance, quality, and provenance considerations
- Provenance and documentation:
  - Detailed measurement schedules and data handling outlined; cross-year comparability maintained via normalization (e.g., using C1 as reference).
  Data stored and managed by MLURI Sourhope with data management support from CEH Merlewood.
- Quality considerations and biases:
  - Change in mowing method (manual to mechanical) correlated with apparent biomass increases in 2001; normalization helps mitigate comparative bias.
  - FMD-related disruptions in 2001 limited site access and data collection windows.
  - Inter-surveyor consistency is acceptable; any minor differences documented and tested.
- Metadata needs for ongoing stewardship:
  - Link plots to treatments, blocks, and species codes (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Fr = Festuca rubra, etc.).
  - Document management events (FMD restrictions, personnel changes) and their potential impact on data continuity.
  - Maintain raw and transformed data (e.g., ln-transformed biomass) and transformation steps for reproducibility.

## End notes and access
- The Report outlines a comprehensive, multi-year dataset integrating meteorological, soil, biomass, and botanical data, with explicit attention to data quality, standardization, and cross-year comparability.
- For Data Stewards: ensure metadata completeness, preserve linkage between treatments and outcomes, maintain provenance records, and plan for continued data updates and long-term accessibility.
