# SUMMARY

- Purpose and scope
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope to study soil biodiversity and its links to above-ground plant communities.
  - Primary monitoring targets: above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and relative abundance (diversity); aims to relate management practices to botanical changes and ecological function.

- Site design and treatments (data-relevant context)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots, with 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells allocated to different research groups.
  - Annual management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide application following mowing on designated plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime on fertilised plots.
  - Plot-level treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).

- Data collection and data types
  - Weather data collected on-site via Automatic Weather Station since 1999 (rainfall, radiation, temperature, moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: regular 0.5 m^2 sampling within sub-plots; vegetation clipped, dried, and weighed.
  - Baseline and longitudinal botanical surveys: 0.5 m^2 point analyses (1998 baseline; 2000–2002 surveys), bryophyte identification (2002 refined to species level).
  - Soil data: soil pH measured at ~5 cm; soil moisture measured in 2002 with theta probe (across point-analysis cells); additional soil and vegetation surveys (small-scale plots, minirhizotron-related observations) documented.
  - Data documentation: extensive appendices accompany the report, including species lists, ATI/plot treatment maps, weather data, biomass time series, and PCA results.

- Key analytical findings (highlights relevant for data stewardship)
  - Biomass productivity: consistent treatment hierarchy with fertilised plots (especially Nitrogen + Lime) most productive; overall 2002 biomass lower than 2001, with declines across most treatments; block position on slope influenced productivity (lower on steeper blocks).
  - Fertilisation effects: Nitrogen and/or Lime improve productivity; lime raises soil pH toward ~7.0 in treated plots; potential moisture constraints in high-pH, high-N plots; possible chlorosis and plant stress observed in some lime-treated plots.
  - Functional-group shifts: fertilisation and mowing influence plant functional types (CSR framework): stress-tolerators increase in unfertilised plots; competitive-stress-ruderal groups expand in N & Lime plots; SR/CSR groups decline with certain treatments.
  - Insecticide effects: increases in diversity in some contexts; potential links to reduced herbivory are discussed, but direct causality remains cautious due to lack of full insect-control data.
  - Trampling effect: 2002 biomass reductions in some C2 plots linked to trampling during 13CO2 pulse activities.
  - Bryophytes and mosses: bryophyte abundance rising across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; moss expansion associated with regular mowing and absence of grazing.
  - Community composition: point analyses show shifts in dominance among Festuca and Agrostis species, with Festuca rubra expanding in fertile plots and Agrostis spp. declining; PCA separates improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering distinctly.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon diversity indices show treatment- and year-dependent changes, with notable declines in N&L plots by 2002 relative to baseline; overall bryophyte contribution to total hits increases over time.

- Data governance, provenance, and documentation considerations
  - Longitudinal, multi-layered datasets require robust metadata, including plot IDs, block/plot/sub-plot mappings, treatment histories, and sequencing of mowing, fertilisation, lime, and insecticide events.
  - Data sources span physical measurements (biomass, pH, moisture), botanical identifications (vascular plants and bryophytes), and survey methods (baseline and annual point analyses); consistency in taxonomic naming and functional-type classification is essential.
  - Appendices provide structured data outputs: annualised biomass by plot, rank/coverage data, species lists, and detailed treatment maps; data are connected to the Soil Biodiversity website for accessibility and future sharing.
  - Documented data gaps and caveats: 2002 weather data period affected by a station malfunction; Control 2 plots were not surveyed in 2000–2001; several 2002 data points were affected by missing dates due to weather station issues.

- Implications for data stewardship
  - Ensure consistent, versioned metadata for all years and treatments, including plot-to-treatment links, survey methodologies, and data processing steps (e.g., biomass weights, log transformations for analyses).
  - Preserve multi-year time series with clear provenance to enable longitudinal analyses (e.g., treatment-by-year interactions shown in ANOVA results).
  - Maintain comprehensive data dictionaries and taxonomic references to support re-analysis and cross-study comparisons (including CSR functional-group classifications and bryophyte species lists).
  - Facilitate data access through the Soil Biodiversity website and provide guidance on data reuse, including any limitations due to missing data periods or measurement gaps.
  - Plan for documenting updates beyond 2002 (ongoing site activity and potential future publications), ensuring that data management practices capture new measurements, new plots, and any reclassifications of treatments or plot design.

- Notable challenges and considerations for governance
  - Incomplete capture of user needs and the complexity of cross-project data integration across 16 Phase I and Phase II projects.
  - Heterogeneous data formats and potential non-interoperability across datasets (e.g., biomass, point analysis, bryophyte identifications, soil chemistry).
  - Ensuring timely data availability from multiple research groups and maintaining consistent data quality controls across years.
  - Handling data gaps due to external disruptions (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease restrictions, weather station outages) and transparently documenting these gaps in metadata.
