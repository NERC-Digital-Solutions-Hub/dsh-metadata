# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope Farm in the Scottish Borders. It provides a broad monitoring context for integrating diverse research data over time.
- The study followed baseline data from November 1998 and includes measurements across Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with a focus on links between treatments, soil chemistry, and vegetation.
- 2001 management and data collection were affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change in the site officer in charge, but key management activities (liming, N application, pH measurement, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) continued according to the 2001 Site Management Plan.

## 1) Introduction (context and aims)

- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope to provide a broad monitoring context for groups using the site.
- Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) described site rationale, design, methods, and management.
- Aimed to enable cross-year comparisons and link to other research data with standardised measurement protocols.
- Table 1 summarises types and dates of measurements; site activities in 1999–2001 included periodic sampling and mowing regimes, with primary measurements focused on weather, biomass, soil pH, and vegetation composition.
- Notable 2001 events:
  - FMD restrictions limited site access Feb–May; operations continued under strict protocols.
  - Change of officer in charge after May 2001.

## 2) Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data were broadly unremarkable.
- Rainfall around the long-term average (1999: 845 mm; 2000: 1209 mm; 2001: 839 mm).
- Radiation showed little year-to-year change; average temperatures slightly lower in 2001.
- Average soil moisture content higher in 2001 than in preceding years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- There was a consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments; peak biomass typically in July–August.
- 2001 biomass estimates were substantially higher than in previous years, likely due to a combination of staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Normalising by the C1 (control) treatment in each year suggested nitrogen input (and to a lesser extent lime) had the strongest positive effect on productivity.
- ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass showed:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant treatment-by-year interaction.
  - No significant differences among blocks.
- Biomass and species composition showed positive associations with N and lime treatments, with nitrogen and lime most strongly increasing biomass.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Soil pH measurements (top 5 cm) show liming continues to raise pH.
- October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen-plus-lime plots ~6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, though to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey mirrored the 2000 protocol; surveyors’ results were not significantly different.
- Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000, suggesting greater sward density (possibly from the prior removal of grazing stock in 1998).
- Clear treatment differences in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide plots (Festuca ovina) and N & Lime plots (Festuca rubra).
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were most apparent in fertilised plots (especially N+L).
  - Species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more common in untreated Control plots.
- Diversity: 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control, Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible initial decline in diversity with higher fertility.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separates plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime from control and biocide plots.
- Improved plots show more frequent presence of Festuca rubra and related species (Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis); unimproved plots cluster with bryophytes and less fertile species.
- Biomass vs species abundance correlations:
  - Positive correlations between biomass and abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
  - Negative correlations between biomass and abundances of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, Bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis.
- Litter frequency increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with increased soil fertility.

## 3) Site heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic plots, an effect likely amplified by higher proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
- Suggests underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site influencing pH in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots (as seen in Fig 7).

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Total biomass per plot in 2001 showed outlier plots at low biomass across all treatments, with higher biomass generally in plots located more centrally on the site.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass (Fig 9); no significant block differences in biomass (ANOVA).

## Acknowledgements and Appendix highlights

- Acknowledges contributions of field staff, especially Sarah Buckland, and MLURI farm staff.
- Appendix and tables provide detailed data, including annualised biomass figures, weather statistics, and comprehensive species-by-treatment hit counts (e.g., species codes like Ac, Ao, Fr, Gs, etc., and their relationships to treatments and biomass).

## Implications for environmental monitoring and data use

- The study demonstrates how standardized, cross-year monitoring enables linking abiotic (soil pH, weather, biomass) and biotic (plant species composition) responses to management treatments (nitrogen, lime, biocide).
- Findings indicate clear, treatment-driven shifts in productivity and vegetation structure, with nitrogen and lime boosting biomass and altering species composition toward more productive grasses, while higher fertility may reduce plant diversity.
- Spatial heterogeneity within the site affects outcomes, underscoring the need to account for location effects in monitoring analyses.
- The 2001 disruption (FMD restrictions and staff transition) highlights the importance of documenting site-management changes when interpreting long-term monitoring data.
- The Monitoring framework supports data verification, quality assurance, and standardized reporting formats to facilitate cross-group comparisons and time-series analyses.
