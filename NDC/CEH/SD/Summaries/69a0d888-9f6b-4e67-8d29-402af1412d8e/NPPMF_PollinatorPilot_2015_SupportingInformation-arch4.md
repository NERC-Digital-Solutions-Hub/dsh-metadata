# NPPMF_PollinatorPilot_2015_SiteVisitConditions.csv

## Overview
- Data from a 2015 pollinator monitoring pilot across 14 UK sites, collected in four rounds (April–August 2015) to test sampling methods, recorder capabilities, and implementation logistics.
- Half the sites were agriculturally dominated, half semi-natural, to explore habitat effects on data collection and pollinator communities.
- Aimed to compare sampling methods, assess the capacity of different recorder groups, gather system-wide feedback, and document implementation costs and support needs.

## Study Design and Scope
- Four sampling rounds with some rounds extended due to poor weather.
- Sites mapped to 1 km^2 Ordnance Survey grid squares; five pan-trap stations and 5 transects per square were used for standardization.
- Data collected covered pollinators, floral resources, and environmental conditions to enable method comparisons and cost assessments.

## Recorder Types and Taxonomic Approach
- Researcher protocol: paid staff with training; species-level IDs for bees and hoverflies.
- Consultant protocol: professional insect taxonomic expertise; species-level data for bees/hoverflies where applicable.
- Volunteer protocol: citizen scientists; taxa classified into broad groups (not species-level for all taxa).
- Across protocols, insects were grouped into broad taxonomic categories, with species-level IDs primarily for bees and hoverflies in the researcher and consultant streams.

## Methods and Protocols
- Pan trapping: five stations per site; researchers conducted pan traps; volunteers could assist alongside researchers.
- Fixed transects: five 200 m transects per site; all recorder types conducted transects.
- Timed focal flower observations (FFOs): standardized 10-minute focal plant observations, replicated per site visit.
- Floral surveys of transects: floral abundance estimated via quadrats and broader transect assessments.
- Standardised free searches: time-bounded (e.g., 30 minutes) insect searches in good habitats; more limited use by researchers; consultants and volunteers contributed under protocol guidance.
- Transects and floral surveys conducted within the 1 km^2 grid square framework, with floral resources quantified along transects.

## Data Files and Key Content
- SiteVisitConditions.csv: date, recorder, environmental conditions (temperature, wind, cloud, sun), transect details, habitat codes, notes.
- FreeSearchConditions.csv: environmental context for consultant free searches, activity breakdowns (sweep netting, spot recording, targeting flowers), habitat codes, expertise levels, and notes.
- FFOBConditions.csv: timings and conditions for focal floral observations, focal flowers and counts, associated floral resource data.
- AllInsects.csv: insect records across methods, including methodological context, taxonomy (group, genus, species), counts, and identification details.
- FloralTranssects.csv: floral abundance estimates along transects by plant species and unit type, with abundance scores.
- FloralQuadrats.csv: quadrat-level flower counts around transects/pan traps, by plant species and unit.
- Qualitative Feedback (recorder questions): responses to protocol-related questions (Strongly Agree to Strongly Disagree) with comments; no formal quality control applied across datasets.

## Data Quality and Governance
- No explicit quality control applied in these datasets.
- Metadata includes site type (Agriculture vs Semi-Natural), rounds, protocol type, and environmental conditions, enabling context-aware analysis.
- Standardization around 1 km^2 grid squares supports cross-site comparability, though method differences and recorder expertise introduce variability.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates multi-source data integration (researchers, consultants, volunteers) and the importance of clear, standardized protocols.
- Highlights trade-offs between data richness (species-level detail) and practicality (volunteer-derived broad groupings).
- Underlines need for comprehensive metadata and a governance framework to enable cross-partner data comparison, transparency, and reuse.
- Emphasizes incorporating recorder feedback to inform future data strategy, training, and resource allocation.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Strategy
- Implement standardized data schemas across recorder types to improve comparability.
- Maintain consistent transect routes and site grid references to support trend detection over rounds.
- Capture rich contextual metadata (environmental conditions, habitat codes) to support data interpretation.
- Plan for basic quality control and validation steps to enhance data reliability.
- Include user/recorder feedback as a formal input in program design to optimize future monitoring efforts.
