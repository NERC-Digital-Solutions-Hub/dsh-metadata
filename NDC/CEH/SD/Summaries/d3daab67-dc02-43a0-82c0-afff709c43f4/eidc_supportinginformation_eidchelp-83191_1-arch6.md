# Overview

- This dataset captures key operational parameters of a point-of-use drinking water treatment system (POU DWTS), PAqua 1000D-2, in long-term operation to provide biologically safe drinking water.
- Location: University of the West of England, Frenchay Campus (coordinates: N51.498888, W2.544166).
- Timeframe: 1 November 2019 to 29 September 2022 (34 months).
- System principles: Ultrafiltration combined with in-situ electrochemically generated hypochlorous acid dosing for disinfection.
- Data collection and delivery: In-line sensors and probes feed into the Grundfos Remote Manager interface; researchers at UWE Bristol download and interpret data.
- Frequency: Data recorded and aggregated to 5-minute rolling averages.
- Project context: Part of the NERC project “The development and implementation of sensors and treatment technologies for freshwater systems in India” (NE/R003106/1); additional dataset referenced (Fox et al., 2022).
- Industry and partners: Portsmouth Aqua Ltd (system setup and maintenance) and Grundfos (remote monitoring);  sensor suppliers include s::can and Messtechnik GmbH (Austria).
- Data availability and file: Core dataset is in the CSV pou-dwts_operationaltelemetrydata_uk_nov2019-sep2022.csv, containing eight columns as described in Table 2.
- Data quality and gaps:
  - Missing values are marked as NA; a value of 0 indicates the POU DWTS did not operate as expected.
  - There is sporadic data availability between April and August 2020 due to a faulty SIM card; a new SIM card fixed the issue.
- Data columns (eight in total) and units:
  - Date and Time: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm
  - Flow_Rate: m3/h
  - Discharge_Pressure: bar
  - TMP (Transmembrane Pressure): bar
  - ORP: mV
  - FAC (Free Available Chlorine): ppm
  - Filtration_Flux: m3 m-2 h-1 (calculated in Excel; see Table 2)
  - UF_MP (UF Module Permeability): m3 m-2 bar-1 h-1 (calculated in Excel; see Table 2)
- Data processing:
  - Filtration Flux and UF Module Permeability were calculated in Microsoft Excel from the raw data (with formulas described in the dataset documentation).
- Data structure: The dataset is part of the NE/R003106/1 project; detailed data structure and column descriptions are provided in Table 2 of the documentation.
