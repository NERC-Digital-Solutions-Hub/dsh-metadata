# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteer data; ongoing since 1976 with over 2500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Data support understanding changes in insect populations and informing biodiversity and policy questions.

## Data collection framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weekly from April to September; record all butterflies in a ~5 m wide band; nearly 2000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects divided into 10 sections; 2–3 visits per year (with July/August emphasis); ~8050 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods; includes Timed Counts and egg/larval web counts for specific species.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Outputs abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site index represents a constant proportion of the population; some species are more detectable than others.
- Global indices for species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-specific weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed; uses all counts to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data given greater influence.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online (ukbms.org/mydata) or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-flight-period records); site coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Additional automated/manual validation screens for records outside known range, first-time site records, and unusual abundances; edits made after consultation with coordinators/recorders.

## Data download details
- Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2020.
- File format: CSV with columns:
  - SITE CODE
  - COUNTRY
  - SPECIES CODE
  - SPECIES (scientific name)
  - COMMON NAME
  - YEAR
  - SITE INDEX (note: -2 indicates insufficient data for accurate index)
