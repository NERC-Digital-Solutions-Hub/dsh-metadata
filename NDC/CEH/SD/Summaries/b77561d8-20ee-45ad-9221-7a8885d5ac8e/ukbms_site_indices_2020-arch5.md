# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Governance and purpose
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Acknowledges volunteers contributing data.
  - Provides annual site-based data on butterfly population status to support biodiversity status and trend policy questions.
  - Long-running program since 1976 with data from over 2,500 active sites yearly.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m observation band, weekly counts (up to 26 per year), across ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year, sampling ~8,050 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and other methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.
  - Data are processed together for analysis to derive population trends.

- Data type and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies at a site; species detectability varies.
  - Indices combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
  - All season counts (Pollard walks, WCBS, targeted surveys) inform seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data and handle questionable records throughout the season.
  - Further automated and manual validation checks for distribution range, flight period alignment, site appearance, and comparison to typical site baselines.
  - Corrections implemented through queries and coordinator/recorder follow-up as needed.

- Data download specifics
  - Provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, from 1976 to 2020, in CSV format.
  - Key columns: SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
  - Notes: if a site was not monitored enough to calculate an accurate site index, the value is -2.
