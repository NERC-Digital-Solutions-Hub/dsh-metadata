# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and collaboration
  - UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers; data contribute to understanding butterfly population trends and informing biodiversity policy.
  - Over 2,500 sites actively recorded each year; data used across monitoring methods and time (since 1976).

- Data collection methods (sampling framework)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) across habitat units; ~2,000 sites annually.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1-km transects; 2–3 visits per year; ~8,050 squares sampled annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.

- Data integration and analysis
  - All sampling methods contribute to abundance indices (relative measures of population size).
  - Collated indices for species using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed 2016) with site-level weighting by the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed that year.
  - Uses all counts in a season to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate data to account for recording gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data.

- Data quality and validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Further validation includes range checks (against BNM and UKBMS data), flight period alignment, first-time site records, and unusual abundances.
  - Edits to the main UKBMS dataset are made after validation.

- Data download and metadata
  - Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each site for 1976–2020 as CSV.
  - Key columns: SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
  - SITE INDEX is -2 if insufficient data to compute an accurate index for that site/year.
  - Data are intended for use in biodiversity policy questions and trend analysis.

- Licensing, attribution, and use
  - Data available under Open Government Licence (OGL); allows free use with minimal conditions.
  - Required: proper citation (including DOI as specified in metadata) in publications; attribution statement: "Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC."
  - Collaboration and interpretation support offered by UKBMS partners; potential for co-authorship.

- Collaboration and contact information
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset details and interpretation of outputs.
