# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and purpose
  - National, long-running program of site-based butterfly monitoring organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Acknowledges volunteers; aims to track population status and trends to inform biodiversity policy questions.
  - Operational since 1976; currently includes over 2,500 active sites per year.

- Monitoring design and data sources
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 5 m wide, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) during suitable weather; ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km square sampling; two parallel 1 km transects with 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Combines data from all sampling methods using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a 2016 modification that weights site data by the proportion of the species flight period surveyed.
  - The seasonal pattern is estimated from all counts to extrapolate missing data, with greater weight given to observed data.

- Quality control and data governance
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; online entry via UKBMS or Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; additional automated/manual validation checks for distribution, flight period, first at-site records, and unusual changes.
  - Edits are made through targeted queries and discussions with coordinators when needed.

- Data availability and structure
  - Provides annual site- and species-specific abundance indices for 1976–2020 in CSV format.
  - Key columns: SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
  - A value of -2 indicates insufficient monitoring to compute a site index.

- Licensing and attribution
  - Data are available under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
  - Requires full citation (including DOI) in any publications using the data.
  - Attribution statement: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, JNCC.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer advice and interpretation support; potential co-authorship and input for publications arising from the data.
  - Contacts: UK CEH – Marc Botham (ukbms@ceh.ac.uk); Butterfly Conservation – Transect co-ordinator (transect@butterfly-conservation.org).

- Relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates a multi-method monitoring framework with standardized data collection, robust QA/QC pipelines, and transparent indexing (GAI) to derive policy-relevant trends.
  - Highlights open data practices, attribution requirements, and collaborative governance as core components of a monitoring program.
