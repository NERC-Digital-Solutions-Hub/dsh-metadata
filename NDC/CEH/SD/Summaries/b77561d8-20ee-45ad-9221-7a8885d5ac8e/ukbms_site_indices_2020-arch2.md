# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data and are essential to the scheme.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status through site-based monitoring; supports understanding of insect population changes and policy questions on biodiversity status and trends.
- Operational footprint: monitoring since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.

## Sampling framework

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (typically 2–4 km), recording all butterflies in a fixed-width band (about 5 m) weekly from April to September, aiming for ~26 counts per year; ~2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August); ~8,050 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are used to create abundance indices, which are relative measures of population size (not absolute counts); some species are more detectable than others.
- Indices are combined across sites using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting so that data from each site in a given year are proportionally weighted by the portion of the species’ flight period surveyed.
- All sampling methods contribute to the seasonal count pattern estimation, enabling extrapolation to account for gaps; observed data are given more influence in the final indices.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, and uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag data entry errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review records; data undergo further automated and manual validation, including checks for out-of-range distributions, atypical flight periods, new site records, and anomal abundances.
- Corrections are made through queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders as needed.

## Details of this data download

- Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data from 1976–2020, in CSV format.
- Key columns include:
  - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
  - COUNTRY: region for the regional collated index
  - SPECIES CODE / SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea standard)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (with -2 indicating insufficient data to calculate an index)
