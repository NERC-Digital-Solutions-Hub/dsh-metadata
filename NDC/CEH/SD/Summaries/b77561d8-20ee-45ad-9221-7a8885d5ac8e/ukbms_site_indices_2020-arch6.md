# 1. About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee; volunteers contribute data.
- It has monitored butterfly population changes in the UK since 1976, currently involving over 2,500 actively recorded sites per year.
- Data are used to understand biodiversity trends and inform policy questions.

## What it is and who runs it

- UKBMS creates annual abundance indices for butterfly species across the UK, using a standardized sampling framework.
- Data are collected from multiple sampling methods and analyzed together to produce regional and national trend information.

## Sampling framework and data collection

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide, recorded weekly (typically 26 counts/year) from April to September; ~2,000 sites sampled yearly.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km square locations with two parallel 1-km transects; 2–3 visits per year, focusing on common habitats; ~8,050 squares sampled yearly.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, single-species methods (timed counts), and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- All data from these methods are combined to produce overall species indices.

## Data processing and trend analysis

- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices are combined into collated species indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site each year.
- The GAI uses all seasonal counts to estimate patterns and extrapolate gaps, with greater weight given to observed data than extrapolated data.

## Data quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automatic validation checks flag improbable values; regional transect coordinators verify records; data undergo additional automated and manual validation (e.g., distribution range, flight period alignment, first-time records, outliers).
- Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders as needed.

## Data download details

- This data download provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2020, in CSV format.
- Key columns include:
  - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX
- If a site-year lacks adequate data for a reliable index, the SITE INDEX value is -2.
