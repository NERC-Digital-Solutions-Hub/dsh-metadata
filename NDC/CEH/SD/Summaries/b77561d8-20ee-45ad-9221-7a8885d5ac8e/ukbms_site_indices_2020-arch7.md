# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and leadership
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee
  - Indebted to volunteers contributing data
  - Provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and understanding of trends

- Sampling framework and scale
  - Since 1976, using site-based, wide-scale monitoring
  - More than 2,500 actively recorded sites per year
  - Data from all sampling methods combined for analysis

- Data collection components
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks)
    - Fixed-route transects (2–4 km) with 5 m wide survey band
    - Weekly counts from April to September (ideally 26 counts/year)
    - ~2,000 sites sampled annually
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS)
    - Stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects
    - 2–3 visits/year (minimum 2 visits in July/August)
    - ~8,050 squares sampled per year
  - Targeted surveys
    - Single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts)
    - Focus on specific species or life stages and conditions

- Data nature and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts
  - Site indices reflect a consistent proportion of butterflies observed, varying by species
  - Collated indices produced using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with 2016 methodology
  - Data from all methods (Pollard walks, WCBS, reduced surveys) used to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate counts to account for recording gaps
  - Weighting applied so observed data influence final indices more than extrapolated data

- Quality control and data management
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker
  - Automatic checks for data entry errors (e.g., unusually high counts, flights outside known periods)
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks throughout the season
  - Further automated/manual validation to flag out-of-range distributions, first-time site records, and anomalous abundances
  - Edits and queries resolved with coordinators or recorders; data updated accordingly

- Details of this data download
  - Contains annual abundance indices for each species at each site with sufficient data (1976–2020)
  - Data format: CSV
  - Columns include:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: country used for the regional collated index
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
    - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year; -2 indicates insufficient monitoring during flight period
