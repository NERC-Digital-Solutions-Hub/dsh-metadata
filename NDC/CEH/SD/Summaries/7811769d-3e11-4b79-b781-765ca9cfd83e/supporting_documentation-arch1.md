# Sampling scheme

- Location and context
  - Fieldwork conducted at Kielder Forest, Northumberland, England (55.24N, 2.61W)
  - Winter 2021–2022 storms impacted the area, notably Storm Arwen (Nov 2021) and later Storms Dudley, Eunice, Franklin (Feb 2022)
  - Post-storm surveys identified areas with windthrow damage; aim to quantify impacts on soil and roots

- Study design and plot selection
  - 10 sites identified within Kielder Forest, each site with homogeneous stand composition and topography, but spatially varying storm impacts
  - Within each site, a transect (minimum 100 m, maximum 400 m) was laid; observation points every 20 m along the transect
  - A categorical windthrow damage index at each observation point:
    - Undisturbed: no fallen/snapped trees
    - Moderately disturbed: ≥50% trees snapped/fallen, no soil disturbance
    - Severely disturbed: ≥50% trees snapped/fallen, soil pits/mounds formed due to uprooting
  - Random selection of observation points from each disturbance class to center 50 m² sampling plots
  - Plot distribution: 22 plots total across 10 sites
    - 10 undisturbed plots
    - 3 moderately disturbed plots
    - 9 severely disturbed plots
  - Additional note on plot coverage: All sites included at least an undisturbed plot; some sites included multiple disturbance classes

- Field collection and measurements
  - Within each plot:
    - Count and identify all trees; record number fallen/snapped and depth of soil pits if present
    - Two perpendicular 10 m transects placed diagonally across the plot
    - At the intersection and every 2.5 m along these transects, collect samples
  - Soil and root sampling
    - Bulk soil samples collected to 20 cm depth via soil corer
    - 10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm root blocks extracted; roots separated and soil gently shaken from roots
    - Rhizosphere soil brushed off roots into a fresh container
  - Sample counts and handling
    - 22 plots × 9 soil cores = 198 soil cores
    - 22 plots × 9 root blocks = 198 root blocks
    - Total: 396 samples
    - Samples stored on ice in coolers for lab transport
    - Some subsamples stored at -80°C; remainder air-dried for chemical analysis
  - Root and soil processing
    - Roots split into two portions: air-dried weighed; wet-weight portion stored in 80% ethanol for DNA extraction
    - Gravimetric moisture content measured on a small root subsample to convert wet ethanol-preserved root weight to dry weight
    - Dry masses summed to obtain total root mass in each 2000 cm³ root block
  - Storage and labeling
    - Rhizosphere soil and selected subsamples stored at -80°C; additional soil sub-samples air-dried for chemical analysis

- Laboratory methods and instrumentation
  - Soil moisture
    - Determined by mass loss after drying samples at 65°C for 72 hours
  - Soil carbon and nitrogen
    - Samples ground to fine powder
    - Carbonates removed by acidifying with 6% H2SO3
    - Dried at 65°C and analysed for total organic carbon and nitrogen with ThermoFlash EA 1112 Elemental Analyser

- Variables and units
  - Soil nitrogen content: percent (%)
  - Soil carbon content: percent (%)
  - Gravimetric soil moisture: percent (%)
  - Dry root mass: milligrams per cubic centimeter (mg cm⁻³) in a 2000 cm³ root block

- Quality control and data handling
  - Manual inspection of carbon and nitrogen peaks to ensure data quality
  - At least two standards included in every instrument run
  - To yield conservative effect sizes, plot-level transect data treated with cores as analytical replicates rather than true statistical replicates; averaged within transect
  - No outliers removed

- Data structure and reporting
  - Data represent arithmetic means of values obtained from soil cores along each within-plot transect
  - Within-transect cores (4–5 per transect) treated as analytical replicates for averaging

- Key practical notes
  - Sampling captured spatial variation in disturbance across sites and disturbance classes
  - Integration of soil chemistry and root biomass data enables analysis of how windthrow disturbance relates to soil carbon/nitrogen dynamics, soil moisture, and root traits at the plot level
