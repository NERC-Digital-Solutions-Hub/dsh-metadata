# Sampling scheme

- Location and context
  - Conducted at Kielder Forest, Northumberland, England (55.24 N, 2.61 W)
  - Storm events in 2021–2022 (notably Storm Arwen); initial surveys identified windthrow impacts
  - 10 sites identified within the forest; each site defined by homogeneous stand composition and topography

- Study design and plots
  - Within each site, a transect (minimum 100 m, maximum 400 m) was laid
  - Observation points along each transect every 20 m
  - For each observation point, a 50 m² plot was centered
  - Disturbance classification near each observation point based on nearest 10 trees:
    - Undisturbed (no fallen/snapped trees)
    - Moderately disturbed (≥50% snapped/fallen, no soil disturbance)
    - Severely disturbed (≥50% snapped/fallen with soil pits/mounds)
  - Plot distribution by disturbance class across 10 sites:
    - 10 undisturbed plots
    - 3 moderately disturbed plots
    - 9 severely disturbed plots
  - Total plots surveyed: 22 (across 10 sites)

- Within-plot data collection
  - Trees: counts and species, recording fallen/snapped individuals
  - Soil pits: depth recorded
  - Transects: two perpendicular 10 m transects diagonally across each plot
  - Sampling points: at the intersection and every 2.5 m along the transects
  - Sample types per plot:
    - Bulk soil cores to 20 cm depth (9 cores per plot)
    - Root blocks: 10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm (9 per plot)
    - Rhizosphere soil brushed from roots into containers (subsamples stored)
    - Roots: divided into two portions (air-dried and weighed; wet weight measured and stored in 80% ethanol for DNA extraction)
  - Total samples: 396 (22 plots × 9 soil cores + 9 root blocks per plot)

- Sample processing and storage
  - Soil: small subsamples for -80°C storage; remainder air-dried for chemical analysis
  - Rhizosphere soil: stored at -80°C; remainder air-dried for chemical analysis
  - Roots: one portion air-dried and weighed; other portion weighed wet and stored in ethanol for DNA
  - Moisture assessment: gravimetric moisture content measured to convert wet root weight to dry weight
  - Root mass: total dry mass calculated from root blocks (sum of dry masses of both portions)

- Laboratory methods
  - Soil moisture: mass loss after 72 h at 65°C
  - Soil carbon and nitrogen: samples ground, acidified with 6% H2SO3, dried; analyzed with ThermoFlash EA 1112
  - Quality control:
    - Visual inspection of carbon and nitrogen peaks
    - At least two standards per instrument run
    - Averaging data within each plot transect to obtain conservative effect sizes
    - No outliers removed

- Data, variables, and units
  - Recorded variables (examples):
    - Soil nitrogen content (%)
    - Soil carbon content (%)
    - Gravimetric soil moisture (%)
    - Dry root mass in a 10 × 10 × 20 cm root block (mg cm⁻³)
  - Data structure: arithmetic means of values from soil cores along each within-plot transect

- Data structure note
  - The reported data are means across the within-plot transect cores; cores along a transect treated as analytical replicates for averaging rather than true independent replicates

- GIS relevance
  - Spatial layout of 10 sites, 22 plots, and transect lines enables mapping of disturbance patterns, soil biogeochemistry, and root characteristics
  - Disturbance classes provide categorical layers for spatial analysis
  - Fine-scale plot and transect data support integration with other GIS layers (stand composition, soil properties, and biomass estimates) for visualization and policy/management applications
