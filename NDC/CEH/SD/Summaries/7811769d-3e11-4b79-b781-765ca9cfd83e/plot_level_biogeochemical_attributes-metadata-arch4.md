# Definition of sites and plots in this experiment

- Purpose of the dataset
  - Document a forest disturbance and soil property sampling framework in Kielder Forest, spanning windthrow-disturbed and intact stands.
- Study design and scope
  - Each unique site is defined by common stand type and topography (Fig 1 reference).
  - Within each site, plots are defined, with each plot occupying 50 m² (Fig 1 reference).
  - Transects
    - Each plot has two 10 m transects spanning the plot and located perpendicular to each other (Fig 1 reference).
    - Transects are used for collecting soil cores and for assessing disturbance.
- Variables and measurements
  - disturbance_score
    - Categorical windthrow disturbance score (as per Fig 2 decision tree).
    - Assessed every 20 m along transects, along ~200–400 m spans spanning known intact and windthrown stands.
  - soil properties (measured on transects/cores)
    - nitrogen: soil nitrogen content, units: %
    - carbon: soil carbon content, units: %
    - Soil.Moisture: gravimetric soil moisture, units: %
    - root_mg_per_cm3: dry root mass per volume, units: mg
  - location data
    - Latitude: sample latitude
    - Longitude: sample longitude
- Data collection specifics
  - Each plot is surveyed along transects for sampling and disturbance scoring.
  - Transects are used to obtain soil cores and to apply the disturbance decision tree across the transect length.

- Data management implications for data leaders
  - The dataset combines spatial design (sites, plots, perpendicular transects) with multiple measured variables (soil chemistry, moisture, root mass) and a structured disturbance score, highlighting the need for:
    - clear metadata and variable definitions (including the disturbance_score schema and its categories)
    - consistent units and data types (percentages for nitrogen, carbon, moisture; mg for root mass; geocoordinates for location)
    - documentation of sampling scheme (two transects per plot, 10 m length, 20 m interval, transect span)
    - traceability to the figures that describe the sampling framework (Fig 1 and Fig 2) to aid discoverability and reuse
- Potential considerations for data quality and reuse
  - Ensure standardized metadata to support cross-site comparability and gradient analyses (intact vs windthrow stands).
  - Maintain provenance for disturbance scoring (per Fig 2) and sampling along the transects.
