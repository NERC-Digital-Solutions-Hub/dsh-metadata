# Sampling scheme

- Location and context: Fieldwork at Kielder Forest, Northumberland, England (55.24N, -2.61W). Winter 2021-2022 storms (Storm Arwen, Dudley, Eunice, Franklin) caused widespread windthrow and breakage; initial post-storm surveys guided site selection and sampling.

- Study design:  
  - Ten sites identified within Kielder Forest, each with homogeneous stand composition and topography but varying storm impact.  
  - A transect (minimum 100 m, maximum 400 m) established within each site; observations every 20 m along the transect to assess windthrow disturbance.

- Disturbance classification and plot allocation:  
  - A categorical windthrow index for nearby trees at each observation point: undisturbed, moderately disturbed, severely disturbed.  
  - Random selection of observation points for each disturbance class to center 50 m x 50 m plots.  
  - Plot distribution: all ten sites contained an undisturbed plot; seven sites had a severely disturbed plot; one site had an additional moderately disturbed plot; two sites had three plots (one per disturbance class). Result: 22 plots total (10 undisturbed, 3 moderately disturbed, 9 severely disturbed).

- Field measurements:  
  - Within each plot, recorded tree number and species, and counted fallen/snapped trees; noted soil pit depth if present.  
  - Two perpendicular 10 m transects laid across each plot; assessments at intersections and at 2.5 m increments along transects.

- Soil and root sampling:  
  - Bulk soil sampling to 20 cm depth using soil cores; arranged along transects (9 cores per plot).  
  - Excavation of a 10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm root block per location to recover roots with adhering soil; root blocks shaken gently to retain roots and soil.  
  - Total samples: 22 plots × 9 soil cores and 9 root blocks = 396 samples. Samples stored on ice for transport.

- Sample processing (subsamples):  
  - Subset of soil cores: small subsamples stored at -80°C; remaining soil air-dried for chemical analysis.  
  - Rhizosphere soil obtained from root blocks by brushing soil off roots; subsamples stored at -80°C; remainder air-dried for chemical analysis.  
  - Roots split into two portions: one air-dried and weighed; the other weighed wet and stored in 80% ethanol for DNA extraction.  
  - Gravimetric moisture content measured on a subsample of roots to convert ethanol-preserved root weight to dry weight.  
  - Total root mass calculated from the combined dry masses of both root portions in each 2000 cm3 root block.

- Laboratory methods and instrumentation:  
  - Soil moisture determined by mass loss after drying at 65°C for 72 hours.  
  - Soil samples ground, acidified with 6% H2SO3 to remove carbonates, oven-dried at 65°C, and analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen using a ThermoFlash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer.

- Variables and units recorded:  
  - Soil nitrogen content (%).  
  - Soil carbon content (%).  
  - Gravimetric soil moisture (%).  
  - Dry root mass in a 10 x 10 x 20 cm soil core (mg cm-3).

- Quality control:  
  - Carbon and nitrogen peaks manually inspected; at least two standards run per instrument.  
  - To avoid inflating statistical power, biogeochemical data within a plot-level transect were averaged, treating 4–5 cores along the transect as analytical replicates rather than true replicates. No outliers removed.

- Data structure and reporting:  
  - Data represent arithmetic means of values obtained from soil cores along each within-plot transect.  
  - Subsamples and bulk cores processed to support subsequent analyses; multiple sample types (bulk soil, rhizosphere soil, roots) linked to each plot for integrated assessment.
