# Definition of sites and plots in this experiment

- Study context
  - Unique site in Kielder Forest, defined by common stand type and topography (see Fig 1).

- Sampling hierarchy and scope
  - site → plot → transect
  - Each plot measured 50 m2 (plot.Description = disturbance score).
  - Transect: 10 m transect spanning a plot (N = 2 transects per plot, located perpendicular to each other) (see Fig 1).
  - Disturbance assessment along transects: categorical windthrow disturbance score (disturbance_score).

- Variables and measurements
  - nitrogen: Soil nitrogen content (units: %).
  - carbon: Soil carbon content (units: %).
  - Soil.Moisture: Gravimetric soil moisture (units: %).
  - root_mg_per_cm3: Dry root mass in a 10 x 10 x 20 soil core (units: mg).
  - Latitude: Latitude of sample collection (units: degrees, implied).
  - Longitude: Longitude of sample collection (units: degrees, implied).

- Additional notes
  - plot.Description and disturbance_score are linked to the disturbance assessment framework.
  - The dataset captures spatially explicit soil and disturbance indicators across windthrow gradients in Kielder Forest.
