# Sampling scheme

- Study area and context:
  - Fieldwork conducted at Kielder Forest, Northumberland, England (55.24N, 2.61W).
  - Storm impacts (Winter 2021–2022), including Storm Arwen and subsequent storms, prompted post-storm surveys.

- Sampling design and sites:
  - 10 sites identified within Kielder Forest, each with homogeneous stand composition and topography but varying storm impact.
  - Within each site, a transect (minimum 100 m, maximum 400 m) was laid; observation points every 20 m along the transect.
  - Windthrow damage index categories based on the 10 nearest trees at each point: undisturbed, moderately disturbed, severely disturbed.
  - Plot definition: 50 m x 20 m (50 m2) sampling plots centered on selected observation points.
  - Plot distribution: all sites contain an undisturbed plot; 7 sites have a severely disturbed plot; 1 site has an additional moderately disturbed plot; 2 sites have three plots (one per disturbance class).
  - Total plots surveyed: 22 (10 undisturbed, 3 moderately disturbed, 9 severely disturbed).

- Data collected per plot:
  - Trees: number and species identity; count of fallen/snapped trees; presence and depth of soil pits.
  - Soil and root sampling: two perpendicular 10 m transects across the plot; soil cores collected at intersections and every 2.5 m along transects (to 20 cm depth); root blocks (10 cm x 10 cm x 20 cm) excavated at the same locations.
  - Sample count: 22 plots × 9 soil cores + 9 root blocks per plot = 396 samples total.
  - Sample handling: samples stored on ice; subsamples for -80°C storage; rhizosphere soil separated from root blocks; roots split for dry weight and DNA extraction (ethanol-preserved).
  - moisture and mass measurements: gravimetric moisture content measured on subsamples; root masses weighed in dry and wet states; dry masses summed to total root mass per root block.

- Laboratory analyses:
  - Soil moisture: determined by drying at 65°C for 72 hours.
  - Soil carbon and nitrogen: soils ground, de-carbonated with 6% H2SO3, dried, and analyzed with ThermoFlash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer.
  - Subsamples: some soils stored at -80°C; rhizosphere soils also stored at -80°C with remaining air-dried for chemical analysis.

- Variables and units recorded:
  - Soil nitrogen content: %
  - Soil carbon content: %
  - Gravimetric soil moisture: %
  - Dry root mass in a 10 x 10 x 20 cm soil core: mg cm-3

- Quality control and data handling:
  - Carbon and nitrogen peaks manually inspected; at least two standards included per instrument run.
  - To avoid inflating degrees of freedom, values from all soil cores along a transect are averaged within a plot; cores are treated as analytical replicates, not true statistical replicates.
  - No outliers removed from the dataset.
  
- Data structure and summary notes:
  - Data provided as arithmetic means of values from soil cores along each within-plot transect.
  - Each plot’s data reflect the 4–5 cores along the transect treated as replicates for analysis.
