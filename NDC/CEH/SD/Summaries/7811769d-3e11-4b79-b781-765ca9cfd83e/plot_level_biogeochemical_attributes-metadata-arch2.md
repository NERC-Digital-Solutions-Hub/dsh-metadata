# Definition of sites and plots in this experiment

- Purpose and scope
  - Outline the hierarchical sampling design used to monitor windthrow disturbance in Kielder Forest, including site, plot, and transect definitions, and the measured soil properties and location data.
- Hierarchy and definitions
  - Site: Unique site in Kielder Forest defined by common stand type and topography (refer to Fig 1).
  - Plot: Each plot is 50 m2 within a site; includes a disturbance score (categorical windthrow disturbance).
  - Transect: A 10 m transect spanning a plot; two transects per plot located perpendicular to each other; transects are used for collecting soil cores.
  - Disturbance_score: Categorical measure of windthrow disturbance (as described and used in Fig 2).
- Measured variables and metadata
  - nitrogen: Soil nitrogen content (%).
  - carbon: Soil carbon content (%).
  - Soil.Moisture: Gravimetric soil moisture (%).
  - root_mg_per_cm3: Dry root mass in a 10 x 10 x 20 cm soil core (mg).
  - Latitude / Longitude: Geographic coordinates of sample collection.
  - disturbance_score: Categorical disturbance classification aligned with the decision tree (Fig 2).
- Field methods and data structure
  - Each plot contains two perpendicular 10 m transects, from which soil cores are taken.
  - Disturbance is assessed every 20 m along a ~200–400 m transect spanning known intact and windthrown stands (guided by Fig 2).

- Data management and analytic context
  - The schema provides standardized variables and units to enable consistent analysis and cross-site comparison.
  - Structured data supports quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation, and enables production of outputs like maps and charts.
- Relevance to environmental monitoring goals (analyst perspective)
  - Creates a consistent framework to monitor environmental health and how windthrow impacts soil properties over space and time.
- Data-use challenges (aligned with monitoring aims)
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources.
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
