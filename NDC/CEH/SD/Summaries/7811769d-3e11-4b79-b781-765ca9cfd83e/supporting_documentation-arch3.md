# Sampling scheme

## Purpose and study area
- Fieldwork conducted at Kielder Forest, Northumberland, England (55.24N, 2.61W)
- Context: winter 2021–2022 storms (notably Storm Arwen) with subsequent storms Dudley, Eunice, and Franklin; large areas of windthrow observed
- Objective: assess storm impact through a structured sampling scheme and quantify associated soil and root biogeochemical properties

## Study design and site selection
- 10 sites identified within Kielder Forest, chosen to represent homogeneous stand composition/topography and spatially varying storm impacts
- Within each site, a transect (100–400 m) established; observation points along transect at 20 m intervals
- Windthrow damage index developed from the 10 nearest trees at each point: undisturbed, moderately disturbed, severely disturbed
- Plot allocation: 50 m × 50 m plots centered on selected points; all sites include an undisturbed plot; seven sites include a severely disturbed plot; one site includes a moderately disturbed plot; two sites include plots for all disturbance classes
- Total surveyed plots: 22 (10 undisturbed, 3 moderately disturbed, 9 severely disturbed)

## Field measurements and sampling layout
- Within each plot, record tree counts and species, and note fallen/snapped trees and soil pits
- Two perpendicular 10 m transects across each plot
- Observations at the intersection and every 2.5 m along transects
- Bulk soil samples collected with a soil corer to 20 cm depth
- Root blocks: 10 cm × 10 cm × 20 cm excavated at each location; roots retained with adhering soil
- Sampling across all plots: 22 plots × 9 soil cores and 9 root blocks per plot = 396 samples

## Sample processing and storage
- Soil cores and root blocks stored on ice for transport
- Subsamples: small portions of soil stored at -80°C; rhizosphere soil brushed from roots into fresh containers and also stored at -80°C; remaining subsamples air-dried for chemical analysis
- Roots divided into two portions: air-dried (for weighing) and fresh weighed then preserved in 80% ethanol for DNA extraction
- Gravimetric moisture content measured on a subsample of roots to convert ethanol-preserved root mass to dry mass

## Laboratory methods and instrumentation
- Soil moisture: determined by mass loss after drying at 65°C for 72 hours
- Soil carbon and nitrogen: soil ground, acidified with 6% H2SO3 to remove carbonates, oven-dried at 65°C, and analyzed for total organic carbon and nitrogen using a ThermoFlash EA 1112 Elemental Analyzer
- Quality control: carbon and nitrogen peaks manually inspected; at least two standards included per instrument run

## Variables and units
- Soil nitrogen content: %
- Soil carbon content: %
- Gravimetric soil moisture: %
- Dry root mass in a 10 × 10 × 20 cm root block: mg cm^-3

## Quality assurance and data handling
- To avoid inflated statistical power, biogeochemical data within each plot-level transect were averaged; the 4–5 soil cores along a transect were treated as analytical replicates rather than true replicates
- No outliers removed
- Data provided as arithmetic means per within-transect plot

## Data structure and reporting
- Values represent arithmetic means across soil cores along each within-plot transect
- The dataset comprises 22 plots across 10 sites, with 9 soil cores and 9 root blocks per plot, totaling 396 samples
