# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- Qualitative case study examining narratives on trypanosomiasis within the Zambian policy context.
- Aims to explore human–animal–environment relationships (One Health) and to identify biases across sectors that may influence policymaking.
- Uses stakeholder narratives to inform policy and future monitoring decisions.

## Methodology
- Approach: series of key informant interviews conducted from July to October 2013.
- Sampling: stakeholders representing diverse perspectives were selected based on a literature review, donor/international bodies’ websites, broader actor search, and expert consultation.
- Data collection: face-to-face or telephone interviews; verbal consent obtained; transcripts captured in Microsoft Word and coded manually.
- Literature integration: policy and historical context reviewed to complement interview data.
- Data handling: anonymisation of interviewees by sector category to allow open discussion; results coded from transcripts and integrated with literature.

## Stakeholder groups interviewed
- International Organisations: 4
- Private Sector: 2
- Charities: 3
- Government: 4
- Unions: 1
- Academia: 6
- Total respondents: 20

## Interview themes and questions
- Personal context and history of trypanosomiasis
- Current debate, labeling/prioritisation, and whether it is neglected
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment
- Significant drivers of disease and preferred control options
- Policy processes: actor networks, leadership, priorities, land use changes, and influential actors
- Collaboration across land use and disease control sectors; One Health usefulness
- Ecosystem change and its significance; transmission dynamics and vulnerable groups
- Prioritisation under limited funding and changes in policy agenda
- Poverty impacts and broader societal implications

## Data handling, ethics, and transparency
- Interviews anonymised by category to facilitate candid responses.
- Transcripts manually coded to extract narratives and insights.
- Evidence triangulated with literature to contextualize findings and questions.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a stakeholder-centered approach to identifying policy-relevant indicators and data needs.
- Highlights the importance of mapping actor networks, governance structures, and data gaps when designing environmental health monitoring.
- Emphasises integration of cross-sector perspectives (One Health) to inform measurement, reporting, and decision-making.
- Note on limitations: qualitative sample (20 interviews) may not yield a definitive picture but exposes sectoral biases and informs interpretive context for policy monitoring.
