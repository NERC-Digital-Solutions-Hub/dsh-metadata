# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- A qualitative case study to explore narratives on trypanosomiasis within the Zambian policy context, with a One Health perspective (human, animal, environment).
- Based on key informant interviews conducted July–October 2013.
- Aims to capture a broad range of perspectives from multiple sectors and organisations to inform policy discussion and understand biases that may influence policymaking.

## Methodology
- Qualitative case study using semi-structured key informant interviews.
- Stakeholders identified from literature, donor/international bodies, and expert input, then categorized for anonymisation.
- Interviews conducted face-to-face or by phone; transcripts anonymised and stored as Microsoft Word documents for coding.
- Literature review conducted in parallel and integrated with interview results to contextualise findings.

## Stakeholder Groups and Sampling
- Interviewees represented a broad cross-section of actors:
  - International Organizations
  - Private Sector
  - Charities
  - Government
  - Unions
  - Academia
- Total respondents: 20
- Anonymised categorisation used (as shown in the referenced Table 1) to enable candid discussion across areas such as veterinary/tsetse control, wildlife, health, agriculture, tourism, and related ministries.

## Interview Topics and Themes
- Personal context and background
- History of trypanosomiasis
- Current debate and how the disease is understood, labelled, and prioritized
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment
- Drivers of disease and preferred control options
- Policy processes, networks, and leadership
- Collaboration across land-use and disease-control sectors (One Health)
- Effects of ecosystem change and land-use shifts
- Funding priorities and whether trypanosomiasis should remain a priority
- Trends in policy agenda and drivers
- Patterns of collaboration and knowledge sharing
- Transmission dynamics and vulnerable/poverty-impacted groups

## Data Handling and Analysis
- Transcripts were collected and coded manually to extract narratives and themes.
- Results were synthesised with findings from the literature review.
- Interview questions were shaped by prior literature and stakeholder input.

## Findings and Implications
- The study aims to reveal biases and networks across sectors that shape policy regarding trypanosomiasis.
- By triangulating interview narratives with the literature, the research contextualises policy priorities, actor influence, and the potential for cross-sector collaboration (One Health) in addressing the disease.

## Data Considerations for Data Support
- Data comprised qualitative interviews across diverse stakeholder groups, with careful anonymisation to protect respondents.
- Analysis relied on manual coding of interview transcripts and integration with existing literature to produce a narrative, policy-focused synthesis.
- Limitations acknowledged include the sample size not aiming to produce a definitive picture, but to illuminate sectoral biases and inform policy discussions.
