# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

- Overview
  - Qualitative case study investigating narratives on trypanosomiasis in the Zambian policy context and their effect on policy, within a One Health framing.
  - Conducted through a series of key informant interviews from July to October 2013.
  - Aimed to capture a broad range of perspectives across human, animal, and environmental sectors to understand policy dynamics and biases.

- Methods and Data Collection
  - Stakeholders selected to represent diverse viewpoints; interviews conducted face-to-face or by phone.
  - Purposive sampling across categories:
    - Wildlife departments
    - Conservation NGOs
    - Veterinary and tsetse control
    - Ministries of agriculture and health
    - Cotton companies and unions
    - Tourism operators and private wildlife operators
    - Local government
    - International bodies and donor programs (e.g., IAEA projects on sterile male tsetse, EU/DFID/FAO programs)
    - GALVMED/ILRI vaccine nexus
    - WHO and HAT mapping
    - Media
  - Anonymisation: categories anonymised (Table 1) to allow frank discussion.
  - Data collection details:
    - 20 respondents in total; distribution: International Organisations 4, Private Sector 2, Charities 3, Government 4, Unions 1, Academia 6.
    - Interviews explored topics such as personal context, history of trypanosomiasis, current debate and labeling, drivers, control options, policy processes and networks, cross-sector collaboration (One Health), ecosystem changes, funding priorities, policy agenda dynamics, spillover/transmission, vulnerable groups, and poverty impacts.
    - Verbal consent obtained; transcripts stored in Microsoft Word; manual coding for analysis.
  - Data synthesis:
    - Literature review conducted to contextualize interview findings.
    - Results integrated from interview transcripts and literature; transcripts coded to identify narratives and biases.
  - Limitations:
    - Sample size may not yield a definitive picture; acknowledges potential biases within sectors.

- Topic Themes and Questions
  - Personal context and history of the disease.
  - How trypanosomiasis is understood, labeled, prioritized or neglected within policy.
  - Impacts on people, animals, and environment; significant drivers of disease.
  - Favored control options and the rationale.
  - Policy processes and networks: key actors, leadership, priorities, land-use changes, collaboration across sectors, and influence on policy.
  - Interaction between land-use actors and disease control efforts; role of ecosystem changes.
  - Prioritization given limited funding; changes in policy agenda and drivers.
  - Collaboration and One Health dynamics; identification of spillover and transmission drivers.
  - Vulnerable groups and poverty impacts.

- Findings and Implications
  - Purpose of the study: reveal sectoral biases and how they may shape policymaking in trypanosomiasis.
  - Demonstrates value of triangulating stakeholder narratives with existing literature to inform policy discussions.
  - Highlights the importance of documenting policy networks, governance processes, and cross-sector collaboration for One Health initiatives.
  - Underlines data governance considerations for policy-relevant data: consent, anonymisation, provenance, and transparent methodology.
  - Points to data gaps and fragmentation across sectors as a barrier to cohesive policymaking, reinforcing the need for integrated data collection and standardized metadata in similar policy-relevant research.
