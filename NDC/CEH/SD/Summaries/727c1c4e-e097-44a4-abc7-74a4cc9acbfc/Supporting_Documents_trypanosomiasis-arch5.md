# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- A qualitative case study examining narratives around trypanosomiasis within the Zambian policy context.
- Based on key informant interviews conducted July–October 2013 to explore human–animal–environment policy dynamics and divergent sector perspectives.

## Methodology
- Stakeholders selected to represent a broad spectrum of views across sectors.
- Anonymised interviewees (Table 1 anonymised) to encourage openness.
- Data collection: face-to-face or telephone interviews.
- Verbal consent obtained; transcripts stored as Microsoft Word documents.
- Transcripts coded manually to identify narratives; results integrated with a literature review.
- Literature review informed interview questions and informed identification of interviewees.

## Stakeholder Groups (Table 1)
- International Organisations: 4 respondents
- Private Sector: 2 respondents
- Charities: 3 respondents
- Government: 4 respondents
- Unions: 1 respondent
- Academia: 6 respondents
- Total respondents: 20

## Interview Themes and Topics
- Personal context and history of trypanosomiasis
- Current debate: how the disease is understood, labeled, prioritized or neglected
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment
- Significant drivers of disease; preferred control options
- Policy processes and networks: who leads, priority formation, land-use changes, influential actors
- Collaboration across sectors; One Health considerations
- Ecosystem changes and their significance
- Funding constraints: should trypanosomiasis be prioritized given limited resources
- Trends in policy attention: drivers of changes in focus
- Collaboration usefulness and transmission dynamics (spillover)
- Identification of vulnerable groups and poverty impacts

## Data Quality, Biases, and Limitations
- Sample size may not yield a definitive picture; aims to surface sectoral biases and perspectives.
- Anonymisation may limit attribution but supports candid discussion.
- Interviews span diverse backgrounds (veterinary, tsetse control, wildlife, public health, medical), enriching the dataset.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Data types include interview transcripts and integrated literature review outputs.
- Verbal consent and anonymisation practices align with privacy considerations; transcripts stored digitally (Word) and manually coded.
- Recommendations for stewardship (derived from the document) include:
  - Maintain structured metadata to aid discoverability (date, stakeholder category, interview mode, anonymised ID).
  - Preserve coding schemes and methodological notes to support reproducibility.
  - Ensure appropriate access controls given sensitive policy views; document data provenance and limitations.
  - Plan for integration of qualitative findings with supporting literature to enable transparent re-use.

## Relevance to One Health Policy Research
- Illuminates how actor networks and cross-sector collaboration shape policy priorities.
- Demonstrates the value of combining qualitative narratives with a literature base to understand policy dynamics.
