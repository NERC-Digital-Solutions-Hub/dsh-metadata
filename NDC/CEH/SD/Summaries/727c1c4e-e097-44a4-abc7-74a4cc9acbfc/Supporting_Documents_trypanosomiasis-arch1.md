# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- Qualitative case study examining narratives on trypanosomiasis within the Zambian policy context.
- Conducted through key informant interviews (July–October 2013) with a broad range of stakeholders.
- Aims to understand interactions between human, animal, and environmental sectors and to reveal biases that may influence policymaking.
- Literature review complemented interview data to contextualize findings and identify interviewees.

## Methods
- Stakeholders selected to represent diverse perspectives (governance, research, NGOs, industry, communities) to capture potential biases.
- Anonymisation implemented to allow frank discussion; interviewees could speak freely without identification.

## Participants
- Total respondents: 20
  - International Organisations: 4
  - Private Sector: 2
  - Charities: 3
  - Government: 4
  - Unions: 1
  - Academia: 6
- Stakeholder categories covered included: wildlife departments, conservation NGOs, veterinary and tsetse control, ministries of agriculture and health, cotton sectors, tourism operators, private wildlife operators and hunting, local government, international projects (IAEA sterile male tsetse, Pan-African trypanosomiasis control), EU/DFID/FAO programs, vaccine development nexus, WHO and HAT mapping, and media.

## Data collection and ethics
- Interviews conducted face-to-face or by phone.
- Verbal informed consent obtained prior to interviews.
- Transcripts stored in Microsoft Word and coded manually.

## Data analysis
- Qualitative coding of transcripts to extract narratives and identify themes.
- Literature review analyzed alongside interview data to support findings.
- Results and insights extracted from coded interviews and integrated with literature.

## Interview themes and questions
- Personal context and history of trypanosomiasis.
- Current debate on trypanosomiasis: identity, labeling, prioritisation, and whether it is neglected within disease clusters.
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment.
- Significant drivers of disease; preferred control options and rationale.
- Policy processes and networks: key actors, collaborations, leadership, and how priorities are set.
- Relationship between land use changes and disease control, and who influences these dynamics.
- Collaboration across land-use and disease-control sectors; One Health perspectives.
- Ecosystem changes: which are significant or overlooked.
- Prioritisation under limited funding; trajectory of the policy agenda.
- Transmission dynamics, vulnerable groups, and poverty impacts.
- Practical implications for policy and governance, and potential biases shaping decisions.

## Findings focus
- Aims to identify how sector-specific biases and networks influence policy responses.
- Seeks to understand the practical policymaking landscape by mapping actor roles, collaborations, and influences.
- Intended to supplement policy discussions with narrative and contextual insights rather than solely quantitative data.

## Limitations
- Acknowledges that the sample size may not provide a definitive picture of trypanosomiasis policy in Zambia.
- Recognizes potential biases inherent in stakeholder narratives and the qualitative approach.

## Data handling and transparency
- Anonymisation of interviewees to protect identity and encourage openness.
- Transcripts and coding intended to be reproducible through documented methodology and referenced themes.
