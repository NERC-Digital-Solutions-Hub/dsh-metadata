# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- Qualitative case study examining narratives on trypanosomiasis within Zambia's policy context.
- Aims to understand how stakeholder perspectives influence policy and the scope for One Health approaches.

## Methodology
- Series of key informant interviews conducted July–October 2013.
- Stakeholders selected to represent a broad range of views across human, animal, and environmental sectors.
- Stakeholders anonymised to allow free discussion.
- Literature review conducted to contextualise interviews; transcripts coded manually in Microsoft Word.
- Results integrated from both interviews and literature review.

## Stakeholder groups interviewed
- Total respondents: 20
  - International organisations: 4
  - Private sector: 2
  - Charities: 3
  - Government: 4
  - Unions: 1
  - Academia: 6
- Coverage included:
  - Wildlife departments, conservation NGOs
  - Veterinary and tsetse control, agriculture ministries
  - Health ministries, cotton companies/unions
  - Tourism operators, private wildlife operators and hunting concessions
  - Local government, international bodies (IAEA projects on sterile male tsetse control; pan-African trypanosomiasis control system; IBAR)
  - EU, DFID, FAO tsetse control programmes
  - GALVMED/ILRI nexus (vaccine development), WHO and HAT mapping
  - Media coverage of human trypanosomiasis outbreaks and seasonal patterns

## Interview themes and topics
- Personal context and history of trypanosomiasis
- Current debates: how the disease is understood, labelled, prioritised or neglected
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment
- Significant drivers of disease
- Preferred control options and rationale
- Policy processes and networks: actors, leadership, priorities, land use changes, influences, and drivers
- Collaboration between land-use actors and disease control
- Ecosystem changes and their significance to disease
- Resource constraints and prioritisation of trypanosomiasis
- Dynamics of policy agenda and collaboration (One Health)
- Spillover and transmission dynamics
- Identification of vulnerable groups and poverty impacts

## Data handling and ethics
- Verbal consent obtained prior to interviews.
- Transcripts coded manually; data entered into anonymised formats (Table 1 anonymised) to protect participants’ identities.
- Literature review used to contextualise and augment interview findings.

## Key findings (summary)
- Stakeholder perceptions across sectors reveal diverse narratives influencing trypanosomiasis policy.
- Policy priorities are shaped by actor networks, funding, and changing land-use and ecosystem dynamics.
- Collaboration and One Health approaches vary by sector; some integration exists, with room for stronger cross-sector coordination.
- Data on trypanosomiasis drivers and impacts are fragmented, with notable gaps in data at appropriate resolutions and inconsistent standards.

## GIS Specialists: Relevance and opportunities
- Map stakeholder networks and influence to visualise policy dynamics and collaboration (One Health networks, key actor ties, leadership roles).
- Overlay disease distribution with land-use change, environmental variables, and ecosystem alterations to explore drivers of transmission.
- Integrate multi-source data (government, NGOs, international bodies, private sector) to produce composite risk and priority maps.
- Develop data products that track funding streams, intervention efforts (tsetse control), and policy shifts over time.
- Create anonymised, policy-relevant maps showing vulnerable populations and areas with data gaps to guide targeted data collection.
- Assess data readiness and integration needs: harmonise data standards, address data held across multiple locations, and plan for scalable, modular datasets suitable for GIS analysis.

## Data challenges and considerations for GIS work
- Data dispersed across many organizations and formats; require data harmonisation.
- Gaps in data availability and resolution limit mapping precision.
- Need for cleaning and transforming datasets before integration.
- Anonymization constraints must be respected when mapping stakeholder information.
- Potential biases in stakeholder perspectives must be considered when interpreting spatial policy patterns.
