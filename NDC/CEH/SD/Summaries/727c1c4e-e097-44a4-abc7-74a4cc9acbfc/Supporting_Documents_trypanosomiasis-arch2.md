# Policy interviews on Trypanosomiasis in Zambia

## Overview
- A qualitative case study examining narratives on trypanosomiasis within the Zambian policy context.
- Based on key informant interviews conducted July–October 2013.
- Intends to explore human–animal–environment sector relationships and how narratives influence policy and One Health approaches.
- Aims to reveal individual biases across sectors and analyze how these biases may shape policymaking.

## Methodology
- Stakeholder identification through literature review and internet/search of donors and international bodies active in trypanosomiasis.
- Selection aimed to cover a broad range of perspectives across sectors.
- Data collection via face-to-face interviews or telephone interviews.
- Verbal consent obtained; interviews transcribed into Microsoft Word and manually coded for narrative analysis.
- Literature review used to contextualize findings and inform interview questions.

## Stakeholder groups interviewed
- International Organisations
- Private Sector
- Charities
- Government
- Unions
- Academia
- Total respondents: 20

## Interview topics and question themes
- Personal context
- History of trypanosomiasis
- Current debate on trypanosomiasis: prioritisation, labelling, and classification within disease clusters
- Impacts on people, animals, and the environment
- Significant drivers of disease
- Preferred control options and rationale
- Policy processes and narratives: actor networks, leadership, priority formation, land use changes, influences
- Collaboration between land-use and disease-control actors
- Ecosystem changes: significance and visibility
- Priority given limited funding
- Status of trypanosomiasis on the policy agenda and drivers
- Collaboration and One Health usefulness
- Spillover and transmission dynamics
- Vulnerable groups and poverty impacts

## Data handling and analysis
- Anonymised categories used to allow interviewees to speak freely (see Table 1 in the original for group details).
- Transcripts coded manually to extract narratives and themes.
- Results integrated with literature review to form a comprehensive account.

## Key considerations for environment monitoring and policy interpretation
- Demonstrates how policy narratives around an environmentally linked disease are constructed across sectors.
- Highlights the role of land use, ecosystem change, and poverty in shaping policy priorities and disease control strategies.
- Emphasizes the importance of cross-sector collaboration (One Health) and how interagency networks influence decision-making.
- Provides a framework for capturing stakeholder perspectives to monitor policy performance and shifts over time.

## Limitations and biases
- Sample may not be large enough to provide a definitive picture.
- Aims to expose sector biases rather than deliver conclusive policy judgments.
- Anonymisation, while protecting respondents, may limit reproducibility of the sample details.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring practice
- Illustrates a structured approach to collecting and analyzing policy-relevant environmental health narratives.
- Supports standardised data collection and documentation of stakeholder viewpoints to assess policy alignment with environmental health indicators.
- Points to the need for accessible underlying data (beyond anonymised outputs) to enable broader scrutiny and reuse.
