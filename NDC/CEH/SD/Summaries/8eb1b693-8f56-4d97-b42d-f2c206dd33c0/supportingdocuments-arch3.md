# Data structure

- Data are numerical continuous variables organized in columns aligned with experimental treatments.

- Design details:
  - 7 ECM fungal isolates studied.
  - 9 nutrient treatments created by varying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources while keeping other components constant.
  - Table-like data structure with columns labeled: Isolate, B (Agar composition), C (N source), D (P source), E (Growth rate), F (Biomass).
  - The reference names encode the specific agar composition and nutrient treatments.

- Fungal species and isolation:
  - Laccaria bicolor (lb101B)
  - Laccaria amethystina (la56)
  - Paxillus involutus (Pi47)
  - Piloderma byssinum (PbUP185)
  - Suillus bovinus (O96)
  - Suillus viscidus (Sv171)
  - Suillus viscidus (SvAFST1)

- Control MMN preparation and culturing:
  - ECM fungi cultured at 18°C on 1 L control MMN nutrient agar (pH 5.5) with glucose as carbon source (10 g/L).
  - Trace elements added: MgSO4·7H2O (300 mg/L), CaCl2 (50 mg/L), FeCl3·6H2O (12 mg/L as 1% solution), NaCl (25 mg/L).
  - Medium: 15 g agar per L of distilled water.
  - Nine MMN solutions prepared with fixed components; only N and P sources varied.

- Nitrogen (N) sources:
  - Inorganic N: ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, 175 mg/L)
  - Organic N: glycine (82 mg/L), glutamines (78 mg/L), glutamic acid (161 mg/L), phenylalanine (181 mg/L)

- Phosphorus (P) sources:
  - Inorganic P: monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 1.6 g/L)
  - Organic P: phytic acid dipotassium salt (1.44 g/L)

- Measurements:
  - Colony diameter recorded daily for 57 days.
  - Biomass determined by harvesting, freeze-drying, and weighing the fungal mycelia (g dry weight per cm2).

- Data interpretation and outputs:
  - Growth rate (mm per day) and biomass (g dwt per cm2) serve as key response variables across treatments.
  - Data structure supports cross-treatment comparisons to assess the effects of N and P forms on ECM fungal growth.

- Relevance to environmental health monitoring (from a monitoring-framework perspective):
  - Standardized data structure and explicit measurement units support comparability and integration into broader dashboards or reports.
  - Clear metadata implications (isolates, nutrient forms, culture conditions, measurement protocols) enhance transparency and reproducibility.
  - Potential data governance considerations include documenting dataset provenance, sharing underlying data, and ensuring data quality and transformation processes are well-managed to avoid barriers to accessibility or interpretation.
