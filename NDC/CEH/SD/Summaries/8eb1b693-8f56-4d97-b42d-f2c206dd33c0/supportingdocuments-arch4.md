# Data structure

- Purpose: Document data collection and organization for an experiment on ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi growth under varying nitrogen and phosphorus sources.
- Experimental design:
  - 7 ECM fungal isolates tested.
  - 9 MMN nutrient agar treatments, varying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources while keeping other components constant.
  - N sources: inorganic (ammonium nitrate NH4NO3) and organic (glycine, glutamines, glutamic acid, phenylalanine); also a NoN (no nitrogen) condition.
  - P sources: inorganic (monopotassium phosphate KH2PO4) and organic (phytic acid dipotassium salt); also a NoP (no phosphorus) condition.
  - Columns focus on isolates and treatment composition to capture how N and P choices affect growth.
- Data structure and variable codes:
  - B: Agar composition corresponding to the N and P treatment.
  - C: Nitrogen type (InN, OrgN, NoN).
  - D: Phosphorus type (InP, OrgP, NoP).
  - E: Measured growth rate (mm per day).
  - F: Biomass (g dry weight per cm2).
- Isolates used (reference names):
  - Laccaria bicolor (lb101B)
  - Laccaria amethystina (la56)
  - Paxillus involutus (Pi47)
  - Piloderma byssinum (PbUP185)
  - Suillus bovinus (O96)
  - Suillus viscidus (Sv171)
  - Suillus viscidus (SvAFST1)
- Culture and preparation details:
  - Fungi cultured at 18°C on 1 L of control MMN nutrient agar (pH 5.5) with 10 g/L glucose as carbon source.
  - Trace elements added (MgSO4·7H2O, CaCl2·2H2O, FeCl3·6H2O, NaCl) to MMN mix.
  - Each plate contained 90 mm diameter and used 1 L MMN solution; nine different MMN solutions prepared varying only N and P sources.
- Measurements and data collection:
  - Colony diameter measured daily with a ruler over a 57-day period.
  - Biomass determined by harvesting mycelia, freeze-drying, and weighing (g dry weight per cm2).
- Data organization and interpretation notes:
  - Data are organized to reflect the relationship between fungal isolate, nutrient treatment (N and P types), and growth outcomes (growth rate and biomass).
  - A table (not shown) maps the codes B, C, D to their specific nutrient configurations, with E and F providing growth metrics.
- Key considerations for data management:
  - Clear metadata linking isolate IDs, treatment codes, and measurement timelines to ensure traceability.
  - Documentation of measurement methods (daily ruler measurements, biomass drying protocol) for reproducibility.
  - Potential inconsistencies in the text (growth rate referenced as 52 days in the table vs. 57 days of diameter measurements) to be resolved in data curation for consistency.
