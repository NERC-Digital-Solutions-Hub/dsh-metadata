# Experiment on Ectomycorrhizal Fungi Growth Under Varied Nitrogen and Phosphorus in MMN Medium

- Purpose
  - Assess growth response (growth rate and biomass) of seven ECM fungal isolates across nine nutrient treatment combinations that vary nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources.

- Experimental Design
  - Fungi: seven ECM isolates
    - Laccaria bicolor (lb101B), L. amethystina (la56), Paxillus involutus (Pi47), Piloderma byssinum (PbUP185), Suillus bovinus O96, Suillus viscidus (Sv171), Suillus viscidus (SvAFST1)
  - Treatments: nine MMN nutrient solutions, with other MMN components held constant
  - Data organization: data are numerical continuous variables arranged in columns by treatment, with columns representing Isolate, Agar composition (B), Nitrogen source (C), Phosphorus source (D), Growth rate (E), and Biomass (F)

- Media and Culture Conditions
  - Medium: Modified Melin-Norkrans (MMN) agar, 1 L per preparation, pH 5.5, glucose 10 g/L
  - Temperature: 18°C
  - Volume: 1 L MMN per preparation, plated in 90-mm dishes
  - Trace elements added: MgSO4·7H2O, CaCl2·2H2O, FeCl3·6H2O, NaCl
  - Nine N/P variations: only nitrogen and phosphorus sources varied
    - Nitrogen sources: NH4NO3 (inorganic, 175 mg/L); glycine (82 mg/L); glutamines (78 mg/L); glutamic acid (161 mg/L); phenylalanine (181 mg/L)
    - Phosphorus sources: KH2PO4 (inorganic, 1.6 g/L); phytic acid dipotassium salt (organic, 1.44 g/L)

- Measurements and Outputs
  - Colony growth: diameter measured daily with a ruler over 57 days
  - Biomass: fungal mycelia harvested, freeze-dried, weighed (g dry weight per cm²)

- Data Structure Details
  - Data are numerical continuous variables organized by treatment
  - Column labels (example mapping): B = Agar composition; C = Nitrogen source; D = Phosphorus source; E = Growth rate (mm per day); F = Biomass (g dry weight per cm²)
  - Isolate references correspond to the specific fungal species/strains listed above

- Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts
  - Demonstrates standardized data collection and organization across multiple biological isolates and nutrient treatments
  - Provides outputs (growth rate, biomass) that can be compared across treatments and time
  - The structured dataset supports verification, quality assurance, and potential integration with other environmental datasets
  - Highlights considerations for data value enhancement and broader accessibility by aligning with standardized reporting formats and data portals

- Key Considerations and Opportunities
  - Standardised approach facilitates cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses
  - Potential to combine these data with environmental metadata (e.g., soil conditions, host species) to enhance dataset value
  - Emphasis on clear documentation of treatment conditions aids data reuse and accessibility
