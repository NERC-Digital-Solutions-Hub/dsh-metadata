# Data structure

- Data are numerical continuous variables arranged in columns according to the experimental treatments.

## Design

- The experiment used 7 ECM fungal isolates cultured on agar plates containing known nutrient types, split into 9 treatments.
- Data are organized as per a table with columns: Isolate (B = Agar), N (C), P (D), Rate (E), Biomass (F). The reference name of the ECM fungal isolate (B), the composition of the agar by N and P treatment (C and D), the growth rate over 52 days (E), and the mass of fungal hyphae per unit area (F).
- The table’s abbreviations map to the experimental details: isolate names, and whether N and P sources are inorganic, organic, or absent.

## Fungal species and isolation

- Laccaria bicolor (lb101B)
- Laccaria amethystina (la56)
- Paxillus involutus (Pi47)
- Piloderma byssinium (PbUP185)
- Suillus bovinus (O96)
- Suillus viscidus (Sv171)
- Suillus viscidus (SvAFST1)

## Control MMN preparation and culturing

- Culturing conditions: 18°C on 1 L control modified Melin-Norkrans (MMN) nutrient agar, pH 5.5 with glucose as the carbon source (10 g/L).
- Trace elements added: MgSO4·7H2O (300 mg/L), CaCl2·2H2O (50 mg/L), FeCl3·6H2O (12 mg/L as a 1% solution), NaCl (25 mg/L).
- Preparation: 15 g agar and 1 L distilled water, distributed into 90-mm petri dishes containing the control MMN.
- Nine different MMN solutions: only nitrogen and phosphorus sources altered; other components unchanged.
- Nitrogen sources:
  - Inorganic N: ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, 175 mg/L)
  - Organic N: glycine (82 mg/L), glutamines (78 mg/L), glutamic acid (161 mg/L), phenylalanine (181 mg/L)
- Phosphorus sources:
  - Inorganic P: monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 1.6 g/L)
  - Organic P: phytic acid dipotassium salt (1.44 g/L)

## Measurements

- Colony diameter measured daily using a ruler over 57 days.
- Biomass determination: fungal mycelia harvested, freeze-dried, and weighed on a microbalance.
