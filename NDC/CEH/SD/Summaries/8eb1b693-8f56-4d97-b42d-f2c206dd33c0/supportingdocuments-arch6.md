# Data structure

- Data characteristics
  - Numerical continuous data organized in columns according to experimental treatments.
  - Measured outputs include growth rate (mm per day) and biomass (g dry weight per cm²).

- Experimental design
  - 7 ECM fungal isolates cultured on agar plates.
  - 9 treatments created by varying nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) sources while keeping other components constant.
  - Data structured around a table with columns representing agar composition, N source, P source, growth rate, and biomass.

- Organisms (fungal isolates)
  - Laccaria bicolor (lb101B)
  - Laccaria amethystina (la56)
  - Paxillus involutus (Pi47)
  - Piloderma byssinum (PbUP185)
  - Suillus bovinus (O96)
  - Suillus viscidus (Sv171)
  - Suillus viscidus (SvAFST1)

- Nitrogen and phosphorus treatments
  - Nitrogen sources
    - Inorganic N: ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3, 175 mg/L)
    - Organic N: glycine (82 mg/L), glutamines (78 mg/L), glutamic acid (161 mg/L), phenylalanine (181 mg/L)
  - Phosphorus sources
    - Inorganic P: monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4, 1.6 g/L)
    - Organic P: phytic acid dipotassium salt (1.44 g/L)

- Culture conditions and medium
  - Fungi cultured at 18°C on 1 L control modified Melin-Norkrans (MMN) nutrient agar.
  - MMN prepared at pH 5.5 with glucose as the carbon source (10 g/L).
  - Trace elements added: MgSO4·7H2O (300 mg/L), CaCl2 (50 mg/L), FeCl3·6H2O (12 mg/L), NaCl (25 mg/L).
  - Final medium: 15 g agar per L of MMN solution.

- Measurements and data collection
  - Colony diameter measured daily with a ruler over 57 days.
  - Biomass measured by harvesting mycelia, freeze-drying, and weighing.
  - Data captured per isolate per treatment, enabling calculation of growth rate (mm/day) and biomass (g dry weight per cm²).
