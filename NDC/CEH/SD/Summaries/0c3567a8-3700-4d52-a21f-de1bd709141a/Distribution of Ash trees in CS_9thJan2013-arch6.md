# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Overview
- This report uses Countryside Survey (CS) data to quantify the extent and distribution of ash trees across Great Britain, with a focus on ash dieback ( Chalara fraxinea) risk.
- CS provides national estimates by integrating data from 1 km squares, habitat mapping, and vegetation plots, and contrasts CS results with Forestry Commission/National Forest Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication.
- Output includes areal extent, counts of individual trees outside woodlands, hedgerow trees, and ash presence within woody linear features and vegetation plots, plus maps and time-based change analyses.

## Data, methods, and scope
- Data sources:
  - Countryside Survey 1 km square sampling across GB, using land classes and ecological gradients.
  - Overlay with NFI/FC data; focus on ash in woodlands <0.5 ha to avoid duplication with large woodland datasets.
  - Additional data from vegetation plots (linear and area plots) and hedgerow surveys.
- Methodology:
  - Areas: Estimate ash presence in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha per 1 km square, then scale by land class to national totals.
  - Individual trees: Record non-woodland ash trees and up to 10 veteran trees per square; identify hedgerow trees via point locations and overlay with linear data.
  - Woody Linear Features (WLF): Record hedgerows, lines of trees, belts; calculate ash proportion by species along linear features using plot data adjacent to hedges (D plots) and percentage cover bands.
  - Vegetation plots: Nested plot design (linear and area plots) to assess ash occupancy and mean cover across landscape contexts (boundaries, hedges, arable margins, roadside, streamsides, field plots, small habitat patches).
- Scale and mapping:
  - National estimates derived by stratifying by land class, using midpoints of percentage cover bands for ash within habitats.
  - Outputs include national extent maps and per-country (England, Scotland, Wales) breakdowns; Appendix 1 provides distribution maps for other broadleaved species.

## Key findings (Ash in GB landscapes)
- Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha: ash covers about 38.5 thousand hectares in Great Britain.
  - England: ~32.1 thousand ha
  - Scotland: ~4.4 thousand ha
  - Wales: ~2.0 thousand ha
- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) after Oak.
- Outside woodlands, an estimated 2.2 million ash trees exist, making ash the second most common species of individual tree.
- Distribution patterns:
  - Ash is common in hedgerows and along linear features (fields, field boundaries, streams, rivers), and also occurs in small patches and around hedgerows.
  - England contains the majority of ash in linear features (about 86.1 thousand km of ash-bearing WLF, with 66.3 thousand km in hedgerows).
  - Hedgerows are a particularly important ash habitat, with ash forming the most common hedgerow tree species.
- Woody linear features:
  - Total ash-containing WLF across GB: ~98.9 thousand km, dominated by hedgerows (≈75.1 thousand km) and lines of trees (≈23.6 thousand km); belts contribute minimally (~0.1 thousand km).
- Individual trees and age class:
  - Distribution across land classes shows most ash outside woodlands are small to mid-sized; veteran trees exist but are relatively rare.
  - Ash is the second most common species among individual trees overall.
- Vegetation plots:
  - Ash occurs across multiple plot types, with notable occupancy in hedgerow-related plots (e.g., D plots and H hedges) and higher mean ash cover in hedges adjacent plots.
  - In hedgerows, ash presence was detected in about 30% of hedge-related plots.
- Temporal changes (1978–2007):
  - Ash occupancy increased on linear features between 1978 and 2007 (significant in linear plots).
  - Ash area occupancy also increased from 1990 to 2007 in area plots, indicating a general rise in ash abundance across the landscape.

## Specific sections with measurements
- Areas (Table 1 context):
  - Ash in GB woodlands <0.5 ha: 38.51 thousand ha; lower/upper confidence intervals provided.
  - England: 32.07 thousand ha; Scotland: 4.44 thousand ha; Wales: 1.99 thousand ha.
- Individual trees (Table 2 context):
  - Total ash outside woodlands: ~2,208,213 trees; England ~1,821,284; Scotland ~146,795; Wales ~240,133.
  - Ash is the second most common individual tree species overall; distribution by land class maps show regional patterns.
- Hedgerow trees and hedgerows (Figures 6 and 7 context):
  - Ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species; hedgerows contain ~66.3 thousand km of ash within WLF in England; overall hedgerow and line features total ash length ~98.9 thousand km GB.
- Vegetation plots (Table 4 context):
  - Ash presence and mean cover reported across boundary plots, hedge plots, D plots, hedgerows, arable margins, roadside, streamside, field plots, and small habitat patches, highlighting ash’s prominence in hedgerow-associated plots.

## Discussion and implications
- Ash constitutes a major component of the British countryside in both small woodlands and hedgerows, and in linear features, underscoring potential vulnerability to dieback while also highlighting its role in habitat provision and landscape structure.
- The CS-based products deliver both areal and linear metrics, enabling landscape-scale risk assessment and monitoring, as well as baseline data for models of ash distribution under future disease and climate scenarios.
- Limitations include not attributing distribution to explicit driving factors within this report and relying on CS methods that differ in scope from NFI woodland inventories; nevertheless, the integration with other datasets lays groundwork for multi-factor analyses.

## Future work and data products
- Develop monitoring protocols for ash diseases and mortality within the CS framework.
- Expand linear product development to scale from 1 km squares to GB-wide coverage, potentially integrating LIDAR and OS map data with Land Cover Map.
- Conduct deeper analyses linking ash distribution with abiotic/biotic variables (soil, climate, deposition) and identify plant species associations affected by ash presence or loss.
- Enhance cross-dataset complementarity with FC and NFI to improve comparability and trend interpretation.
- Explore event-based analyses to distinguish causes of ash expansion on linear features (e.g., post-elm decline dynamics) and to model future ash distribution under disease pressure.

## Appendices and related outputs
- Appendix 1 provides distribution maps for additional broadleaved species (e.g., birch, oak, beech, sycamore, hazel, hawthorn, willow, alder, sweet chestnut).
- Overall, the report presents a comprehensive, data-driven view of ash distribution in GB using CS data, with explicit emphasis on areal, point-based, and linear-feature metrics and clear avenues for future data-driven monitoring and modelling.
