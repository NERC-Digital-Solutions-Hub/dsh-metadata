# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Purpose and context
  - Responds to concern about ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea) and aims to determine the potential impact by understanding the extent and distribution of ash trees in the countryside.
  - Uses Countryside Survey (CS) data to estimate areal extent, number of individuals, distribution in linear features, and presence in vegetation plots across Great Britain.
  - Seeks to inform monitoring and future analyses linked to landscape components and potential drivers of ash distribution.

- Data sources and monitoring framework
  - Countryside Survey: stratified random sampling of 1 km squares across GB, designed to scale up to national estimates using landclass/gradient frameworks.
  - Overlap with other datasets to avoid duplication:
    - Overlay with Forestry Commission/National Forestry Inventory (NFI) maps to exclude woodland parcels already covered by NFI.
    - Focuses on ash in woodlands <0.5 ha and ash outside woodland, providing complementary perspective to larger woodland inventories.
  - Measurement types:
    - Areas: ash presence in broadleaved woodland parcels <0.5 ha using midpoints of percent-cover categories to estimate national extent.
    - Individual trees: ash outside woodland recorded with estimated modal DBH; includes small clumps (mmu < 20 m × 20 m); veteran trees recorded with supplementary data.
    - Woody Linear Features: hedgerows and lines of trees; ash proportion estimated within these features (natural vs. unnatural shapes; use of D plots for hedge composition).
    - Vegetation plots: across linear and areal features to assess occupancy and mean cover of ash by habitat type; change indices account for nested sampling design.
  - Scale and products:
    - National estimates by landclass; maps produced where possible (landclass means and, where feasible, Land Cover Map 2007-based distributions).
    - Provides a basis for building linear-products (e.g., for hedgerows) and for linking ash distribution to other drivers.

- Key quantitative findings
  - Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha: approx 38,510 ha of ash in Broadleaved woodlands.
  - Country distribution (woodland ash area):
    - England: ~32,070 ha
    - Scotland: ~4,440 ha
    - Wales: ~1,990 ha
  - Ash in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha): second most abundant tree species after Oak.
  - Individual ash outside woodland: ~2.2 million trees in GB; England ~1.82 million; Scotland ~146,795; Wales ~240,133.
  - Distribution context:
    - Ash most common hedgerow tree species; Oak second.
    - Ash frequently occurs in fields, field boundaries, hedgerows, and along streams.
  - Woody linear features (total length containing ash): ~98,900 km across GB (England ~86,100 km; hedgerows ~66,300 km; lines of trees ~19,700 km; belts ~0.1 km; most in England).
  - Ash in hedgerow and linear components: substantial contribution to hedgerows and landscape belts, with significant presence in hedgerows and along watercourses.
  - Vegetation plots (ash occupancy and mean cover by plot type):
    - Boundary plots: ash in 23.8% of plots; mean cover 23.8%.
    - D (hedge diversity) plots: ash in 30.0% of plots; mean cover 17.7%.
    - Hedge plots: ash in 20.0%; mean cover 20.8%.
    - Arable margins: ash in 5.4%; mean cover 18.8%.
    - Roadside: ash in 9.8%; mean cover 19.7%.
    - Streamside: ash in 13.3%; mean cover 24.8%.
    - Field plots: ash in 5.1%; mean cover 15.5%.
    - Small habitat patches: ash in 9.7%; mean cover 30.9%.
  - Temporal trends (1978–2007):
    - Ash increased on linear features (in hedgerows and lines) over time; changes significant in linear plots.
    - Ash also increased in area plots from 1990 to 2007.

- Spatial and regional patterns
  - Distribution map indicates higher ash abundance in south-east England for small habitat patches; lower likelihood in north-west Scotland.
  - England shows the greatest ash presence in both area and linear features, followed by Scotland and Wales in varying degrees.
  - Hedgerows are a critical component of ash distribution, reflecting long-standing landscape-scale integration with agricultural features.

- Methodological notes and data considerations
  - CS methodology provides consistent, repeatable estimates that align with national ecological gradients through landclasses.
  - Important nuance: CS focuses on current land cover rather than stocking status (unlike some woodland inventories), avoiding some duplication but requiring careful integration with NFI data.
  - Data presentation includes national estimates by landclass, with upper/lower confidence intervals; maps are approximate spatial representations rather than precise geospatial surfaces.
  - Metadata and data sharing: CS data are compiled with explicit documentation and are designed for dissemination; the study acknowledges opportunities for richer metadata and data-sharing practices to improve verification and reuse.

- Limitations and interpretive caveats
  - Acknowledges that the analysis does not attribute distribution to specific explanatory variables; further work could integrate soils, climate, deposition, and other drivers.
  - Spatial explicitness is constrained by methods that rely on landclass means and available overlap with other datasets.
  - The report prioritises ash distribution and extent over detailed ecological impacts on other species, though it notes potential effects and opportunities for future analyses.

- Implications for monitoring practice
  - Demonstrates robust monitoring of a key environmental health issue (ash distribution) using a multi-component framework (areas, individuals, linear features, vegetation plots).
  - Highlights value of integrating multiple data sources (CS with NFI) to avoid duplication and to build comprehensive national insights.
  - Supports development of scalable, landscape-wide monitoring products (e.g., linear-feature products) suitable for extrapolation to GB.
  - Recommends future monitoring enhancements for disease impact, vulnerabilities, and interactions with other species, including potential integration with LIDAR and other geographic datasets.

- Future directions (as proposed)
  - Develop monitoring protocols to capture tree diseases and mortality.
  - Create a linear-product that scales from 1 km squares to GB-wide coverage.
  - Expand analyses of vegetation plots to identify ash-associated plant species and potential ecological interactions.
  - Attribute ash distribution changes to multiple explanatory drivers (climate, soils, dispersal) and develop predictive models of future distribution, including impacts from ash dieback.
