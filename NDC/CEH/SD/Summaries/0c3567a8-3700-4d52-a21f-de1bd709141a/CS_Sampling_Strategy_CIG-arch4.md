# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Document the sampling strategy underpinning Countryside Survey field work up to 2007.
  - Show how the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework evolved over three decades (1978–2007) to support national and country-specific environmental reporting.

- Core concepts and data architecture
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework for GB ecological surveying.
  - Use of stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage and minimize bias.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; central square plus surrounding quadrats to assign class.
  - Data collected across surveys include vegetation, soils, habitat mapping, and later land-use features.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
  - 1978 (first version): 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes; centre 1 km square classified, plus four surrounding squares; 6039 km2 classified; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
  - 1984: Landscape-focused land-use survey; sampling expanded to 384 squares (12 per class); continuation of 1978 class framework for national estimates.
  - 1990: All 1 km squares classified; Land Cover Map linked; 508 squares surveyed; output aligned with policy needs; national estimates adjusted to reflect all GB squares.
  - 1998 (CS1990–CS2000 transition): Classification extended to 40 classes to improve regional estimates; groundwork for Scotland reporting and broader national applicability.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Introduced separate “country unit” estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); sub-division of Land Classes into country-specific variants; 40 strata refined to 45; added 19 new squares for country representation, plus 11 extra to balance England/Wales sampling; uplands module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting needs drive further refinements; creation of country-unit Welsh subclasses (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure minimum representation; some English classes temporarily reduced in sample size; Wales receives enhanced representation for policy-relevant outputs.

- Sampling framework by survey and country
  - CS1978: 256 squares; eight samples per Land Class; development of national estimates from class-area relationships.
  - CS1984: 384 squares; growth in sample size within the same framework to improve reliability.
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares reclassified with a broader Land Classification; link to first Land Cover Map; policy-oriented outputs considered.
  - CS2000: 30–31+ class structure across the UK with country-unit adjustments; detailed allocation to ensure representative coverage by country; upland habitat module added to improve accuracy in England and Wales.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused refinements; explicit Wales-only class subdivisions and increased Welsh sampling; overall GB sampling rate maintained to support cross-year comparability; updated maps show revised England/Wales/Scotland framework and sample locations.

- Outputs, estimates, and comparability
  - National estimates calculated from class-level means and class-area proportions, with ongoing adjustments as classifications evolve.
  - Changes in Land Classification affect comparability across surveys; preference noted to use the latest classification for consistency within an individual survey while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Tables and maps document square counts, strata, and sampling rates by class and by country, reflecting increasing complexity to support country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales).

- Practical governance and data implications for Data Leaders
  - Data lineage and metadata are critical: document classification changes, sampling frame adjustments, and country-unit reporting decisions to preserve interpretability over time.
  - Stratification enhances representativeness and reduces sampling variance, but evolving classifications require careful handling to maintain time-series continuity.
  - Country-focused outputs require sub-dividing and reweighting classes, increasing the need for clear governance around classifications, class definitions, and sample allocation.
  - There is a trade-off between precision (more classes and more squares) and practical sampling effort, particularly for Wales and upland areas.
  - Historical documentation and cross-reference with primary surveys (e.g., CS1990 main report, CS2000 outputs) are essential for traceability.

- Takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Build and maintain a robust, evolving stratification framework that aligns with user needs (policy, land management, biodiversity) while preserving long-term time-series integrity.
  - Plan for country-level reporting early, enabling appropriate sub-classifications and targeted sampling to reflect regional policy needs.
  - Balance data collection depth (number of classes and squares) with available resources to optimize precision without compromising comparability.
  - Emphasize metadata and methodology transparency to facilitate discovery, reuse, and correct interpretation of time-series environmental data.
