# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Aim
- Assess the extent and distribution of ash trees in Great Britain to understand potential impacts from ash dieback.
- Determine ash presence and distribution across landscape components (small woodlands, individual trees, hedgerows, river corridors) and across temporal changes.

## Key findings
- Areal extent in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: about 38,510 ha.
- Ash occurs in various landscape components, notably hedgerows; second most abundant in small woodland patches after Oak.
- Country breakdown (ash in woodlands <0.5 ha): England ~32,100 ha; Scotland ~4,400 ha; Wales ~2,000 ha.
- Outside woodland, about 2.2 million individual ash trees; England contains the majority (~1.8 million).
- Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; total length of ash in woody linear features across GB ~98,900 km (mostly hedgerows).
  - England accounts for the large majority of this linear ash presence (about 86,100 km).
- Distribution in hedgerows and lines of trees shows ash as a key component of linear features; less frequent in Scotland and Wales.
- Ash is present across different vegetation types, with substantial occurrence in hedgerow plots (about 30% of hedgerow plots).
- Age/size: most ash trees are in small-to-medium diameter ranges (DbH 21–50 cm); relatively few veteran trees.
- Temporal change: ash increased in the number of plots occupied on linear features between 1978 and 2007 and in area plots between 1990 and 2007.

## Methodology
- Countryside Survey (CS) samples 1 km squares across Great Britain using a stratified random design based on land classes and ecological gradients.
- Areas: identify ash presence within 1 km squares using percentage cover categories; overlap with National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication, focusing on ash in woodlands <0.5 ha.
- Individual trees: record outside woodland trees and estimate modal diameter at breast height (DbH); include small clumps; collect veteran-tree data (up to 10 per 1 km square).
- Hedgerows and lines of trees: map ash within woody linear features (hedgerows, belts, lines) using proportion bands to estimate ash share; for hedges adjacent “D plots” (hedgerow vegetation plots), calculate mean ash cover per stratum.
- Vegetation plots: linear plots along features and small plots in fields, margins, and other habitats; track presence and mean cover of ash by plot type and over time.
- Data analysis: national estimates derived by weighting per land class; spatial products create approximations of ash distribution across GB.

## Areas and community distribution
- Ash in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) is concentrated in England, with lower totals in Scotland and Wales.
- Areal maps show ash most abundant in south-eastern England within small patches; lower presence in north-west Scotland.

## Individual trees
- Estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England hosts the majority (about 1.8 million).
- Ash is the second most common species among individual trees after Oak.
- Hedgerow trees: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species.
- Veteran trees: relatively scarce; many veteran specimens fall into the 1–2 m DBH category, suggesting variability in trunk size across landscapes.

## Woody linear features
- Total ash in woody linear features: ~98,900 km GB.
  - Hedgerows: ~75,100 km
  - Lines of trees: ~23,600 km
  - Belts: ~100 km
- England dominates the linear ash presence, especially hedgerows.
- Ash contributes significantly to hedgerow and belt components, indicating potential vulnerability if ash declines.

## Vegetation plots and changes over time
- Ash present in about 30% of hedgerow plots.
- Increases in ash occupancy on linear plots from 1978 to 2007; increases in ash presence on area plots from 1990 to 2007.
- Overall, ash appears to be more widespread in the landscape over recent decades, particularly along linear features.

## Discussion
- Countryside Survey provides novel, integrated products for ash distribution, including linear-feature maps and area-based estimates.
- Ash is a substantial component of the British countryside; its loss could create significant gaps, especially in hedgerows.
- The dataset highlights ash’s prominence in hedgerows and line features, which has implications for habitat and connectivity.
- The report emphasizes the potential usefulness of combining CS data with other datasets (e.g., LIDAR, OS maps, Land Cover Map) to scale spatial products to GB level.
- Limitations: the analysis focuses on extent and distribution rather than causal drivers; no direct attribution to climate, soil, or dispersal dynamics in this report.

## Future work
- Develop monitoring protocols to capture ash disease impact and mortality (e.g., ash dieback) within CS.
- Create a linear-product that scales from 1 km squares to all of GB, integrating CS field data with additional spatial data.
- Further analysis of CS vegetation plots and woodland survey data to determine ash’s impact on associated plant species.
- Incorporate multiple explanatory variables (climate, soil, deposition) to model ash distribution and potential future changes under disease pressures.
- Explore complementary data sources to understand elm dieback interactions and broader forest composition shifts.
