# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, tying together concepts and activities behind the ITE Land Classification and explaining how the current methodology was derived from its predecessors.

- Core goals for monitoring frameworks: ensure representative, stratified sampling to detect change over time; use a robust land-classification framework to stratify samples; enable national and country-specific estimates; adapt the framework to policy and regional reporting needs.

- Key concepts guiding the design:
  - Stratified random sampling to reduce bias and better reflect ecological variation.
  - ITE Land Classification as the stratification basis, linking environmental attributes to sampling units.
  - Use of 1 km squares as the primary sample unit, selected from a standardized grid system.
  - Central square approach (centre of a 15x15 km grid) with surrounding squares assigned to classes to expand representation.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) as the multivariate method to define land classes in early stages.

- Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling Framework:
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey:
    - ISA used on environmental attributes to create 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15x15 km grid; classified 1215 of 1228).
    - For each centre class, four surrounding squares were classified, totaling 6039 km squares.
    - Sampling: 8 squares per class (total 256).
    - National estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the land-class area.
  - 1984 – Second Field Survey:
    - Same framework; sample size increased to 12 squares per class (total 384).
    - Results published in Landscape Changes in Britain.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and 3rd Field Survey:
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeats of vegetation quadrats; broader data collection including a Land Cover Map from satellite data.
    - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - 1998–2000 – Revised Land Classification and Separate Country Reporting:
    - Recognition that regional estimates needed refinement; extended classification to cover all squares with surrogate climatic/geological factors.
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) with class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation per country.
    - Additional sampling allocated to represent new country-unit classes; upland habitat reporting added as a module to improve precision in England and Wales.
  - 2007 – Wales-specific Reporting and Further Sub-divisions:
    - Wales reporting required distinct Wales-only results post-devolution; Wales classified with additional country-unit subdivisions (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Sampling frame expanded to 45 strata (from 40); 43 additional squares allocated in Wales; England’s Welsh squares removed from Wales but not from England’s reporting.
    - Upland module further refined habitat estimates for England and Wales.
    - Overall goal: deliver Wales-only and England+Wales and Scotland reporting with improved precision for Wales and maintained comparability.

- Sampling Design and Data Structure:
  - Land Classes (initially 32; expanded to 40; then to 45 with country-unit subdivisions) guide the stratification for sampling.
  - Each survey stage (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) progressively refined the classification and sample allocation to improve regional and country-specific estimates.
  - Tables and maps (referenced in the document) illustrate the number of squares per class, the sampling rates, and country-specific distributions.

- National Estimates and Consistency:
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates; thus, the document notes that consistency can be achieved by using the latest classification for within-survey estimates or the original classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - Practical approach often favors using the latest classification for internal survey consistency, while recognizing the need for cross-survey comparability via the original framework.

- Upland Module and Policy Relevance:
  - Additional upland sampling (CS2000) and Wales-specific adjustments (CS2007) address policy and environmental reporting needs, ensuring more accurate habitat status and change information for Wales and upland regions.
