# Countryside Survey 2007

- A two-part national monitoring initiative:
  - Field Survey: habitats, vegetation, soils (0-15 cm) and freshwater in the countryside.
  - Land Cover Map: a satellite-derived digital map to be published in 2009.
- Coverage and scale:
  - Field Survey across 591 1 km x 1 km sample squares in England, Scotland, and Wales; supplemental 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares in Northern Ireland (via NICS).
  - Combined GB-wide results with NI data to form UK-wide estimates.
- Data outputs:
  - Estimates of habitat area and change, vegetation condition, soil properties (pH, carbon concentration, bulk density), and freshwater/pond condition.
  - Comprehensive habitat classification framework (Broad Habitats and Priority Habitats) and measures of landscape features (hedges, walls, ponds, trees).

- Field and sampling design:
  - Sampling framework: random 1 km squares stratified by Land Classes to capture environmental gradients; same squares often revisited across surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) with statistical modelling (bootstrapping) to maximize data use and estimate change.
  - Land Classes: 45 classes used to derive Broad Habitat areas; expansion to include Priority Habitats (65 identified UK-wide).
  - NI integration: NI Countryside Survey (NICS) with regional masks and harmonized reporting to UK Broad Habitats.

- Habitat classification and reporting:
  - Broad Habitats cover categories such as woodland ( Broadleaved/Mixed/Yew; Coniferous ), various grasslands (neutral, calcareous, acidic, improved), heath, fen/marsh/swamp, hedgerows, arable land, boundaries/linear features, freshwater features, built-up/urban.

- Aggregate Classes (ACs) for vegetation condition:
  - AC1 to AC8 describe vegetation communities (e.g., Crops and Weeds; Tall Grass and Herb; Fertile/Infertile Grasslands; Lowland/Upland Wooded; Moorland; Heath/Bog).
  - ACs enable cross-year comparison of vegetation condition across Broad Habitats.

- Priority Habitats and reporting:
  - Priority Habitats identified in UK Biodiversity Action Plan; results presented where possible, with caveats about representation and compatibility with UK BAP figures.
  - Priority Habitats addressed include hedgerows, ponds, margins, upland/lowland woodlands, bogs, and others listed in project material.

- Data collection methods and technology:
  - Field teams trained to high standards; 2007 introduced electronic data capture (GIS-based forms) with field GIS on rugged laptops; GPS relocation of plots; integrated database linking mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data.
  - Habitat and feature mapping to polygonal units with standardized keys; minimum mapping thresholds established (e.g., 400 m² polygons for Broad/Priority Habitats).

- Vegetation sampling:
  - Up to ~67 vegetation plots per 1 km square; Main Plots plus additional plots targeted to specific habitats/features.
  - Plot data collected on species presence and percent cover; plots relocated across survey years using GPS and photographs.

- Soil sampling (0–15 cm):
  - Five Main Plots per square; additional soil parameters collected for 2007 (pH, carbon concentration, bulk density; loss on ignition methodology for carbon).
  - Soil samples analyzed with standard QA procedures; full methods in the Soils Manual (Annex 4).

- Freshwater sampling:
  - Headwater streams and associated riparian zones surveyed in 373 squares; biological (macroinvertebrates) and plant communities evaluated.
  - Stream condition indices include Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and River Habitat Survey (RHS) for physical habitat diversity (Habitat Quality Assessment, HQA).
  - Ponds assessed for Priority Habitat status using plant-based criteria; a subset previously surveyed in 1996 Lowland Pond Survey used for change analysis.
  - PSYM (pond quality assessment) used to combine plant metrics into an overall pond condition score (Very Poor to Good).

- Data analysis and reporting:
  - Change and significance assessed at 0.05 level, with arrows and asterisks indicating direction and strength of change.
  - Long-term vegetation change (1978–2007) tracked via AC-based cohorts; changes interpreted within the context of Broad Habitat evolution.
  - Conversion flows between Broad Habitats described (not strictly statistical estimates but directional ecological information).
  - Box 1.3 lists vegetation condition measures (diversity, plant food sources for farmland butterflies, butterfly food plants, Grass:Forb ratio, Competitor/Stressor/Ruderal scores, light, fertility, Ellenberg pH, and moisture).

- Priority Habitats and masks for spatial allocation:
  - Use of multiple spatial masks (Scottish SNH regions; JNCC woodland masks; English Natural Areas; Welsh upland mask) to delineate Priority Habitats across countries.
  - Masks help separate upland/lowland contexts and aid definitional consistency.

- Outputs and accessibility:
  - Results prepared for UK level with country-level reports to follow; data linked in a central GIS-enabled database to support access and analysis by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners.
  - Documentation emphasizes careful interpretation and limitations of extrapolation beyond the surveyed squares.

- Acknowledgements and governance:
  - Funded by a partnership of nine government bodies led by NERC and Defra; extensive collaboration with landowners, field staff, and data management and analysis teams.
  - Clear disclaimers about risk and the need to consult original data for detailed interpretation.
