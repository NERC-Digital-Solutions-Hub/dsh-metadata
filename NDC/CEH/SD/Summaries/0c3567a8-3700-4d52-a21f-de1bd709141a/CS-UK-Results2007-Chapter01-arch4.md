# Countryside Survey 2007

## Overview
- National-scale survey combining Field Survey data (habitats, vegetation, soils, freshwater) with a forthcoming Land Cover Map derived from satellite data.
- Two-part structure: Field Survey (present in this report) and Land Cover Map (to be published in 2009).
- Provides a 30-year time series (since 1978) of changes in the British countryside; supports policy and environmental monitoring, including UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) reporting.

## Purpose and scope for data leadership
- Establishes national and regional estimates of Broad Habitats, some Priority Habitats, vegetation condition, and landscape features (hedges, walls, ponds, trees).
- Enables assessment of habitat extent and change, vegetation condition, soil chemistry (pH, carbon, bulk density), and freshwater quality/structure.
- Data underpin long-term policy questions and environmental change analysis, including links to Living With Environmental Change initiatives.

## Data collection and management architecture
- Field Survey: 591 sample squares (1 km x 1 km) across England, Scotland, and Wales; NI sampling via 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares (NICS) for UK totals.
- Stratified sampling across 45 Land Classes and 32 ITE Land Classes to ensure representative coverage of environmental gradients.
- Data captured electronically in the field via bespoke GIS software on rugged laptops; central, geographically referenced database links mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soil and freshwater data.
- Plot relocation: fixed plots tracked over time with GPS in 2007 (and earlier methods), enabling change detection across years.

## Habitat and vegetation data
- Broad Habitat classification (27 Broad Habitats) and Priority Habitats (65) aligned to UK Biodiversity Action Plan; maps produced as polygons with minimum mappable areas and associated land use attributes.
- Vegetation sampling: up to 67 plots per 1 km square across various plot types (Main Plots and additional targeted plots) to capture species composition and cover.
- Aggregate Classes (ACs): eight ACs used to standardize vegetation condition across Broad Habitats for cross-year comparisons.
- Longitudinal tracking: 1978–2007 data allow analysis of vegetation change within AC cohorts; retrospective assignment maintains cohort continuity.

## Soil and habitat sampling specifics
- Soils (0–15 cm): five plots per square with pH, carbon concentration, bulk density; sample depths and locations adjusted across survey years for consistency.
- Freshwaters: headwater streams sampled in 373 squares; RHS (River Habitat Survey) methodology used for physical habitat diversity; aquatic plants sampled along a 100 m stream stretch.
- Ponds: 2007 introduced pond assessments; pond condition assessed using plant-based criteria and PSYM (ponds quality assessment) with three plant metrics (submerged species, trophic ranking, and uncommon species); 75%+ similarity to pristine conditions indicates better quality.
- Biological indicators: macroinvertebrates (stream), plant-based indicators for streams and ponds, PSYM-based pond quality.

## Classification and reporting framework
- Broad Habitat system formalized in 1998; UK-wide reporting uses 45 Land Classes to estimate area, change, and conversion between Broad Habitats.
- Priority Habitats estimated where possible; retrospective alignment with earlier years (1990, 1998) maintained to aid trend analysis.
- Flow analyses describe net conversion between Broad Habitats (not strictly statistical estimates but directional change information, acknowledging potential mapping/processing noise).
- Measures of vegetation condition (Box 1.3) include species richness, plant food resources for farmland birds and butterflies, Grass:Forb ratio, and plant functional scores (Competitor, Stress-tolerator, Ruderal, Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, Moisture).

## Data quality, analysis and significance
- Bootstrapping approach used to derive area estimates and change statistics; significance levels (0.05, with stronger indicators where p<0.01 or p<0.001) reported for changes.
- Emphasis on reporting stock, change, and condition at UK/GB level; country-specific analyses to be published separately (Spring 2009).
- Results presented with confidence intervals and significance markers to aid interpretation for policy and management decisions.

## Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
- Independent program aligned to UK CS methods; 0.5% sampling intensity (288 squares in 1998; 288 in 2007 with adaptation).
- Data integration with GB estimates to produce UK totals; includes region-specific habitat masks and extended representative stratification (littoral, montane, freshwater lake strata).

## Data accessibility, copyright, and usage
- Data and outputs are governed by NERC and CS partnership policies; rights and reproductions outlined, with licensing and attribution requirements.
- Clear disclaimers on extrapolation limits and the need to reference original data when used for analyses beyond intended scope.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates robust, long-term, geographically stratified data collection and integration across multiple environmental domains.
- Highlights importance of standardized classification schemes (Broad/Priority Habitats, ACs) and back-compatibility for trend analysis across decades.
- Emphasizes advanced data infrastructure: electronic field data capture, GPS-enabled plot relocation, GIS-based habitat mapping, and a unified georeferenced database enabling cross-year analyses.
- Underlines governance considerations: data quality assurance, transparency in statistical significance, and controlled dissemination to policymakers and researchers.
- Provides a model for cross-agency collaboration and data sharing to support national environmental monitoring and policy alignment.
