Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Overview and purpose
  - Countryside Survey is a long-running national audit of the UK countryside (since 1978) used to detect gradual changes over time.
  - This report estimates the extent and distribution of ash trees in Great Britain, focusing on: woodlands <0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodlands, ash in linear features (hedgerows/lines), and changes over time, to inform understanding of ash dieback risk and landscape role.
  - CS uses current land cover data and avoids duplication with the Forestry Commission’s National Forestry Inventory; emphasis is on current habitat dominance rather than stocking in large woodlands.

- Key findings
  - Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha: ash covers about 38,510 ha; England ~32,070 ha; Scotland ~4,440 ha; Wales ~1,990 ha.
  - Ash distribution across landscape: common in fields, field boundaries, rivers/streams, and especially hedgerows; second most abundant species in small patches after oak.
  - Individual trees outside woodland: ~2.2 million ash trees (outside woodlands) in GB; England ~1.82 million; Scotland ~146,795; Wales ~240,133.
  - Size and veteran status: most outside woodlands have modal diameter at breast height between 21–50 cm; veteran trees are relatively rare.
  - Hedgerows and linear features: ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; total ash in woody linear features is about 98,900 km across GB, with England contributing the majority (≈86,100 km) and hedgerows being the largest component (≈66,300 km); lines of trees contain about 19,700 km.
  - Woody linear feature composition: ash forms a substantial portion of hedgerows and lines of trees, with ash presence quantified through proportion bands and plot-based measures near hedges.
  - Vegetation plots and occupancy: ash present in about 30% of hedgerow plots; ash occupancy has increased on linear plots from 1978–2007 and in area plots from 1990–2007, indicating an overall rise in ash presence in the landscape.
  - Geographic pattern: distribution maps indicate higher ash abundance in south-east England with lower likelihood in north-west Scotland.

- Methodology highlights (how the data were produced)
  - Sampling design: stratified random 1 km square sampling across GB, aligned to landclass ecological gradients; scaling uses landclass areas to generate national estimates.
  - Areas (woodlands): mapping habitats within 1 km squares; recording dominant species by percent cover; overlaying with Forestry Commission data to avoid duplication; estimating ash area using mid-point cover percentages.
  - Individual trees: recording outside woodlands, estimating modal DbH; inclusion of small clumps; cataloguing up to 10 veteran trees per square with extra data when present.
  - Hedgerows and linear features: distinguishing natural vs unnatural shapes; estimating ash proportion along lines of trees, hedgerows, and belts by percent-cover bands; using D plots to derive mean ash cover near hedges; scaling lengths per landclass to national totals.
  - Vegetation plots: nested plot design (linear plots along features; small square plots nearby); occupancy change index to assess variation over time.
  - Data integration: cross-referencing CS data with other datasets (e.g., Land Cover Map 2007, NFI) to build coherent national estimates and derived products.

- Areas, trees, and linear features (selected figures and tables)
  - Areal estimates: ash in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) is the second most abundant species after oak; England dominates ash area in these patches.
  - Individual trees: 2.2 million outside woodlands; England holds the majority; ash is the second most common species among individual non-woodland trees.
  - Hedgerows and lines: ash in woody linear features totals ~98,900 km GB; England ~86,100 km; hedgerows component ~66,300 km; lines of trees ~19,700 km.
  - Vegetation plots: ash present in 30% of hedgerow plots with mean cover values varying by plot type (e.g., hedges ~20.8% mean cover; streamside ~24.8%; small habitat patches ~30.9%).

- Discussion and implications
  - Ash is a significant and increasingly detectable component of the British countryside, particularly in hedgerows and along linear features.
  - The rise in ash occupancy on linear features and in area plots suggests changes in landscape woodiness/additions outside traditional woodlands, with potential biodiversity implications.
  - The report emphasizes the potential for integrating ash distribution data with explanatory variables (climate, soil, deposition) to model future distribution and disease impacts.

- Future work and recommendations
  - Develop monitoring protocols for tree diseases and mortality (e.g., ash dieback).
  - Create a linear-product that scales from 1 km squares to GB-wide coverage, integrating CS data with LIDAR, OS maps, and Land Cover Map for enhanced linear feature mapping.
  - Analyze associations between ash and other plant species using CS and GB woodland survey data to identify potential beneficiaries or losers from ash decline.
  - Explore attribution of ash distribution changes to multiple driving variables (abiotic and biotic) and examine potential interactions with elm loss and Dutch elm disease history.
  - Consider expanding CS to capture additional tree metrics (e.g., veteran status in woodlands) while complementing Forestry Commission datasets.

- Appendix and data notes
  - Maps and tables (Appendix 1 and Figures 2–9) illustrate distribution by landclass and plot type.
  - Distinctions between CS current land cover measures and FC/NFI stocking data are highlighted to avoid duplication and to clarify measurement scope.
