# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the evolution of the sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes how stratified, random sampling and environmental classifications underpin national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.
- Shows how advances in classification, computing power, and political devolution (England, Scotland, Wales) shaped sampling design and reporting.

## Historical development of the ITE Land Classification
- Origins in the early 1970s with expanding ecological survey concepts and the need for representativeness.
- Stratified sampling used to ensure all parts of the population (land classes) are represented.
- ITE Land Classification emerged from scaling vegetation-classification methods (e.g., ISA) to land attributes (altitude, geology, climate).
- 1 km square as the sampling unit for national surveys; centre square plus surrounding squares classified to form land classes.
- Early classification produced 32 land classes, guiding the 1978 field survey.

## Sampling framework by survey year

### 1978 – Initial Land Classification (1st Field Survey)
- 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes.
- Sample framework: 1 km squares with eight samples per class (256 total squares).
- Surrounding four squares per centre square also classified, yielding a broader stratified sample.
- National estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each land class multiplied by the class area.

### 1984 – Second Field Survey
- Sample size increased by 50% within the same framework: 12 squares per class (384 total).
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

### 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (3rd Field Survey)
- Recognition that every GB square should be classified; incorporation of urban and sea corrections.
- Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
- Repeats of the 1978 vegetation quadrats and added features recorded.

### Developments of the ITE Land Classification (post-1990)
- A more extensive framework attempted to classify every GB square using surrogates for climate, geology, and physiography due to computational limits.
- Compared new classifications to the original 1228-square source; best result achieved 62% correspondence with some reallocation to neighboring classes.
- Resulting changes affected the distribution of classes and the national estimates derived from them.

### 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Need to support separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) for policy and reporting, plus upland habitat estimates.
- Modifications:
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Aggregation of low-representation rump classes within each country.
  - Additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes (minimums per class).
  - Wales-specific adjustments to improve Wales reporting; Isle of Man squares removed from country estimates.
- Introduction of an uplands module funded separately to boost statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Summary table and maps illustrate the revised sampling distribution and class maps for England with Wales and Scotland.

### 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
- Wales-only reporting requirements increased; existing Wales sampling (64 squares) deemed insufficient for Wales-only estimates.
- Welsh-only adjustments:
  - Sub-division of land classes into five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Expansion to 45 strata from 40.
  - Additional 43 squares in Wales to ensure minimum representation (at least 6 squares in each Welsh class).
  - England classes adjusted due to removal of Welsh squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) retain only four squares each, with precision deemed acceptable by scoping studies.
- England, Scotland, and Wales sample distributions updated (maps and tables provided).
- Summary tables show numbers of squares surveyed by class and country; overall sampling rate adjusted to maintain consistency and comparability.

## National estimates and country reporting
- Note: Changing the basic Land Classification impacts consistency of national estimates; two approaches discussed:
  - Use latest, country-specific classifications for national estimates within a survey.
  - Use the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
- Table and figures illustrate how the number of squares and class distributions evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Welsh reporting adjustments (CS2007)
- Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; explicit Wales-only classifications introduced.
- Additional Welsh squares and sub-divided Welsh land classes ensure robust Wales-specific habitat estimates.

## Uplands module
- An additional uplands module was added in CS2000 to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales, accounting for country-based reporting needs.

## Data, analysis considerations, and interpretation
- Stratification aims to reduce sampling error by ensuring representative coverage of ecological variation.
- Revisions to Land Classification across surveys can affect comparability; researchers may need to map older estimates to newer classifications or rely on country-unit classifications for internal consistency.
- The methodology emphasizes transparent documentation of sampling frames, class definitions, and the rationale for country-specific reporting.
