- Document title and provenance: Countryside Survey: Individual Ash tree distribution 2007; Document Version: 1:19-8-2013; Data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; Prepared by C.M. Wood, L.C. Maskell, P.A. Henrys (CEH Lancaster)
- Dataset file: CS07_Ash_Ind_Trees
  - Content: Estimates of individual ash trees for Great Britain; trees counted outside woodland/hedgerows; based on Countryside Survey 2007 data
  - Associated datasets: ITE Land Classification (2007); Countryside Survey website
- Data columns
  - LC2007: Land Class (numeric)
  - LandClass: Land Class (text)
  - Mn_tree_km: Mean number of individual ash trees per 1km per land class
  - Resolution: 1km
  - Coordinate system: British National Grid
  - Projection: Transverse Mercator
  - Extent: Great Britain
  - Projection reference: OSGB1936
- Sampling and methodology
  - Countryside Survey samples 1km squares across GB using stratified random sampling based on land classes derived from ecological gradients (soils, geology, climate)
  - In each 1km square, every individual tree in the landscape (outside woodland) is recorded with an estimate of modal DBH
  - Small clumps included if above the minimum mappable unit (mmu) of 20m x 20m; if clumps were above mmu, they would be included in area data
  - Up to 10 veteran trees recorded per 1km square (maximum 2 per species)
- National estimates and calculation
  - National areal extent of ash for GB derived by:
    - Counting trees within each 1km square (as point features by land class)
    - Calculating mean ash trees per 1km square for each land class
    - Multiplying by the area of each land class
    - Summing across all land classes
- Land classification
  - Used 2007 ITE Land Classification with 45 land classes
- Purpose and outputs
  - Enables scaling from 1km square samples to national estimates of ash distribution
  - Produces standardized outputs suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance
