# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Summary
- Countryside Survey (CS) provides national estimates of ash distribution to support understanding potential impacts of ash dieback.
- Key results show ash is a major component of the British countryside, especially in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha), hedgerows, and along linear features.
- Data are derived from 1 km square stratified sampling across GB (CS methodology), with cross-referencing to the National Forestry Inventory (NFI) to avoid duplication and to focus on current land cover rather than stocked woodland.
- The report presents area-based estimates, counts of individual trees outside woodland, and the length of ash-containing woody linear features, with spatial products based on land-class distributions and, where possible, Land Cover Map 2007.

## Data and Methods
- Sampling framework: CS surveys 1 km squares using a stratified random design tied to national ecological gradients (landclasses).
- Data types collected per 1 km square:
  - Areas: Ash presence in Broadleaved woodland patches <0.5 ha; dominant species by cover category.
  - Individual trees: Outside woodland (plus small clumps) with estimated modal diameter at breast height (DbH); veteran trees recorded (up to 10 per square).
  - Woody Linear Features: Hedgerows, lines of trees, belts; ash proportion estimated by species where possible.
  - Vegetation plots: Linear (verges, banks, hedges) and areal plots (fields, semi-natural patches) to track ash occupancy and cover.
- Data integration: Excluded woodland parcels covered by NFI; overlain NFI forestry map to prevent duplication; used mid-point band percentages to estimate ash area/length; scaled to national figures by landclasses and area.
- Timeframe: Repeated measurements across survey years (notably 1978–2007 for trends).

## Key Findings
- Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha: ash accounts for about 38,510 ha.
- Geographic spread: ash is most abundant in England, with about 32,070 ha; Scotland about 4,440 ha; Wales about 1,990 ha.
- Ash as an individual tree: estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England hosts the majority (≈1.83 million).
- Ash in hedgerows: ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; hedgerow trees are a major component of ash distribution.
- Ash in woody linear features: estimated total ash-containing linear features length ≈ 98,900 km across GB (England ≈ 86,100 km; Scotland ≈ 3,700 km; Wales ≈ 9,100 km combined across hedgerows, lines of trees, and belts).
- Density and size: most individual ash trees are small to mid-range DbH (21–50 cm); veteran trees are rare.
- Proportion in hedgerow plots: ash present in about 30% of hedgerow vegetation plots analyzed.
- Trends (1978–2007): ash increased in linear features on CS plots (significant in linear plots); ash also increased in area plots from 1990–2007.

## Spatial Distribution and Maps
- Generated maps show ash distribution across GB by:
  - Areal extent within broadleaved woodland parcels <0.5 ha (via landclass means and proportion cover in 1 km squares).
  - Distribution of ash in linear features (lines of trees, hedgerows, belts) with methods differing by feature type.
  - Individual ash trees displayed by landclass to approximate GB-wide distribution (not a single precise spatial map).
- Maps indicate higher ash abundance in south-east England and lower in north-west Scotland.
- Appendices provide distribution maps for other broadleaved species.

## Temporal Trends and Change
- Linear features: ash occupancy increased from 1978 to 2007 on linear plots.
- Areal plots: ash occupancy increased from 1990 to 2007 in area-based analyses.
- Overall implication: ash has become more widespread and abundant across multiple landscape components in recent decades.

## Data Products and GIS Implications
- Core products:
  - National estimates of ash area in woodlands <0.5 ha.
  - National counts of individual ash trees outside woodland.
  - Estimated ash length in woody linear features (hedgerows, lines of trees, belts).
  - Vegetation-plot-based occupancy/cover statistics by plot type.
- GIS relevance:
  - Provides a basis for monitoring ash dieback spread and potential ecological impacts on hedgerows and small woodlands.
  - Supports scenario modeling by linking ash presence to landscape components (fields, streams, hedgerows).
  - Enables scaling to GB-wide analyses using landclass and Land Cover Map 2007.
  - The approach yields non-spatially explicit maps with indicative distributions; further work could enhance spatial explicitness (e.g., linear-product integration with LIDAR and OS data).

## Limitations and Integration
- CS focuses on current land cover; it does not report stocked areas as NFI does, so cross-dataset reconciliation is required.
- Spatial maps are indicative rather than precise spatial predictions; estimates rely on landclass weighting and mid-band percent covers.
- The report suggests potential complementarity with forestry datasets and other environmental drivers (soil, climate, deposition) for explanatory modeling.

## Future Work
- Develop monitoring protocols for ash diseases and mortality within CS.
- Create a linear-product that scales from 1 km CS squares to national coverage, potentially integrating LIDAR and Land Cover Map data.
- Extend analyses to CS plot data and GB woodland survey to assess ash’s impact on co-occurring plant species.
- Attribute ash distribution and change to multiple driving variables (climate, soils, dispersal) to inform predictive models for ash dieback impacts.
