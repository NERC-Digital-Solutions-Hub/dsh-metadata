# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Summary
- Countryside Survey provides a national, longitudinal assessment of ash distribution in the UK to understand potential impacts from ash dieback and to establish baselines for future monitoring.
- Focuses on ash in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha), individual trees outside woodlands, hedgerows, and woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees).
- Uses 1 km square stratified sampling, integration with Forestry Commission/National Forestry Inventory data, and land-class based extrapolation to UK scale.
- Key findings show ash is a major component of the countryside, especially in hedgerows and linear features, with England showing the highest abundance; veteran trees are rare; and ash has increased in linear features and area plots over the study period.

## Key findings
- Areal extent in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: about 38,510 ha; ash is the second most abundant tree in these patches after oak.
- Geographic distribution: England has the largest ash area; Scotland and Wales have substantially less.
- Individual trees outside woodland: ~2.2 million ash trees; England contains most, with Scotland and Wales far fewer.
- Hedgerows: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species; oak is second; other species are much less common.
- Woody linear features: total ash-containing woody features are ~98,900 km in GB (majority in England as hedgerows).
- By landscape component, ash is common in hedgerows, field boundaries, streamsides, and other linear features; also present in some field plots.
- Temporal change (1978–2007): ash increased in linear plots and, from 1990–2007, in area plots as well.
- Appearance in vegetation plots: ash detected in about 30% of hedgerow plots and in various other plot types, with notable mean cover in hedges and roadside vegetation.

## Methodology
- Data source: Countryside Survey (CS) samples across GB, with supplementary data from the Forestry Commission National Forestry Inventory (NFI).
- Sampling design: 1 km square grid with stratified random sampling based on land classes and ecological gradients; habitats mapped within squares; focus on current land cover rather than stocked woodland.
- Data types:
  - Areal data: extent of ash in woodlands <0.5 ha using percentage cover by landclass; cross-referenced with NFI to avoid duplication.
  - Individual trees: tally outside woodlands and record modal diameter at breast height (DbH); includes small clumps (below mmu of 20 m x 20 m) and veteran trees (up to 10 per square).
  - Hedgerow trees: identify ash within hedgerows and lines of trees.
  - Woody linear features: measure ash proportion in hedgerows, belts, and lines of trees; use D plots in hedges to estimate species composition.
  - Vegetation plots: nested plot design (linear and areal plots) to assess ash occupancy and mean cover over time.
- Analysis: national estimates by multiplying 1 km square results by landclass area, using mean percentages and band midpoints to convert cover data into area/length estimates; separate analyses for areas, trees, hedgerows, and linear features; maps created to indicate relative abundance.

## Distribution and landscape components
- Ash is widespread but variable by landscape component:
  - Most ash in hedgerows and hedgerow trees; substantial presence in small woodlands (<0.5 ha).
  - Ash occurs along streamsides and field boundaries, and is present in belts and belts of scrub, though less extensively than in hedgerows.
  - Larger woodland areas (>0.5 ha) are not the primary focus; results emphasize small patches and linear features.

## Spatial and temporal patterns
- Distribution maps indicate ash is most abundant in south-eastern England and least in north-west Scotland, with England contributing the majority of ash in hedgerows and linear features.
- Temporal trends show a notable increase in ash occupancy on linear features from 1978 to 2007, and an increase in ash area plots from 1990 to 2007, suggesting broader expansion of ash across the landscape over the study period.

## Implications for ash dieback and data use
- Establishes a baseline distribution of ash across landscape components, informing potential disease impact assessments (Chalara fraxinea).
- Provides data for modeling future ash distribution under multiple drivers (climate, soil, dispersal) and assessing consequences for habitats and species that depend on ash.
- Data integration with CS soils, water, land use, and other variables enables multifactor analyses to explore drivers of ash distribution and potential mitigation strategies.

## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- CS focuses on current land cover and may diverge from NFI/FC reporting on stocked areas; overlaps with NFI areas were excluded to avoid duplication.
- Veteran trees are recorded with some uncertainty in diameter due to field variability and coppicing effects.
- Spatial explicitness is achieved via general distribution maps rather than precise per-tree geolocation; some maps rely on mean percentages by landclass rather than exact coordinates.
- The study is not a sole explanation of drivers but a robust baseline dataset with potential for further integration (e.g., LIDAR, OS maps) to improve linear feature mapping.

## Future work
- Develop monitoring protocols to capture disease impacts, mortality, and health indicators for ash.
- Develop a linear product that scales from 1 km squares to national coverage, integrating CS field data with LIDAR, OS map data, and Land Cover Map.
- Extend analyses to understand relationships between ash presence and other plant species using CS plot data and GB woodland survey datasets.
- Explore attribution of ash distribution changes to multiple explanatory variables (climate, soil, dispersal) and assess implications for ash dieback modeling.
- Investigate historical baseline data (e.g., Dutch elm disease context) to interpret changes in ash relative to other tree species and landscape shifts.
