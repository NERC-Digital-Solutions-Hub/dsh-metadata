# Countryside Survey 2007

## Overview
- Long-term, national survey providing data on habitats, vegetation, soils (0-15 cm), and freshwater to monitor changes and support policy.
- Two main parts: Field Survey (described here) and the Land Cover Map (satellite-based, published 2009).
- Produces estimates of habitat areas, vegetation condition, soil properties, and freshwater/pond status to inform environmental management and policy decisions.

## Sampling design and scope
- Field Survey collected data from 591 sample squares (1 km x 1 km) across England, Scotland, and Wales; Northern Ireland data included from a separate 0.5 km x 0.5 km survey (NICS).
- Sampling intensity and squares: England (289), Wales (107), Scotland (195); NI included via 288 squares in NI survey.
- Stratified across Land Classes to reflect environmental gradients; aims for national and country-level reliability; time-series linkage across surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007).
- For changes, a statistical model maximizes use of available data across years.

## Field Survey components
- Habitat and landscape feature mapping: Broad Habitats (45 Land Classes) and selected Priority Habitats; includes status and changes; excludes urban/sealed areas below minimum mapping thresholds.
- Vegetation sampling plots: Up to 67 plots per square; Main Plots plus smaller targeted plots to capture habitat variation; vegetation species presence and cover recorded; plots are spatially fixed to enable change detection.
- Soil sampling: Five Main Plots per square sampled for 0-15 cm soil; analyses include pH, carbon concentration, bulk density, and other soil properties; soil sampling locations varied by year to avoid disturbance.
- Freshwater sampling: Headwater streams, rivers, ponds surveyed; macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and River Habitat Survey (RHS) features documented; pond condition assessed using plant-based criteria and PSYM in 2007.

## Data collection and management
- Field teams trained to high standards; 2007 introduced electronic data capture (GIS-based mapping, GPS-enabled plot tracking, web-based data management).
- Data consolidated into a single GIS-linked database linking mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data for integrated analysis and broad accessibility.

## Habitat classification and change analysis
- Broad Habitat framework aligned with UK Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP); 27+ Broad Habitats (and 65 Priority Habitats) used to characterize land cover.
- Area estimates calculated for each Broad Habitat by Land Class and country; UK totals derived by aggregating GB and NI data.
- Conversion flows track net changes between Broad Habitat types (1998–2007) to illustrate landscape-level transitions, acknowledging potential mapping and data-processing noise.
- Vegetation condition within each Broad Habitat assessed via plots; results presented with significance testing (0.05 level, with stronger levels where applicable).

## Priority Habitats
- Priority Habitats identified and allocated to polygons based on habitat and species data; back-allocation to 1998 where feasible; targeted plots recommended within Priority Habitats.
- Use of masks (e.g., SNH, JNCC, Natural England, Welsh upland) to delineate upland vs. lowland and to refine estimates, particularly for woodland-related Priority Habitats.

## Vegetation condition and measurement (Box 1.3)
- Measures include:
  - Species richness (total taxa per plot, excluding lichens/mosses/liverworts; genus-level data allowed).
  - Number of butterfly and farmland bird food plants.
  - Grass:Forb ratio (log ratio of grass to forb cover).
  - Competitor, Stress-tolerator, and Ruderal scores (plant strategy metrics).
  - Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, and Moisture scores as indirect habitat-condition indicators.

## Soil analyses (0-15 cm)
- Parameters: pH, carbon concentration (via loss on ignition), bulk density; other soil properties (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, metals) summarized in accompanying Soil Manual.
- Stock of soil carbon calculated by combining carbon concentration with bulk density to yield tonnes of carbon per hectare.
- Methodological details and QA/QC described in the Countryside Survey Soils Manual (Annex 4).

## Freshwater assessments
- Headwater streams: 500 m habitat assessment; macroinvertebrates sampled along 350 m; aquatic plant surveys over 100 m; RHS (River Habitat Survey) used to assess physical habitat diversity (Habitat Quality Assessment index).
- Ponds: Condition assessed using plant-based criteria and PSYM (Predictive System for Multimetric Pond Quality); 2007 pond sampling in 260 squares; comparison with 1996 lowland pond survey allowed temporal analyses.
- PSYM specifics: plant-based metrics (submerged/marginal species, trophic ranking score, number of uncommon species) aggregated to produce a pond-quality percentage matching a four-tier ecological condition scale (Very Poor to Good).

## Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
- Independent NI survey integrated post-hoc to provide UK-wide estimates; 0.5% sampling intensity (288 squares in 2007); field maps/records aligned with NI classifications and masks.
- Sizes and methods refined to enable comparability with GB Broad Habitats and NI Primary Habitats, incorporating updated hedgerow definitions and habitat attributes.

## Reporting and interpretation
- Results reported at UK, GB, and country levels, with country-specific reports forthcoming; emphasis on stock, change, and condition measures.
- Signs of significance indicated in tables/figures (0.05, 0.01, 0.001) and direction shown with arrows; ecological relevance discussed in accompanying text.
- Long-term context provided for 1978–2007 via repeat plots and AC (Aggregate Class) approach to vegetation condition.

## Accessibility and caveats
- Mapped data support analysis of habitat change and conversions; not all changes are definitively ecological versus mapping artifacts—interpretation notes provided.
- Data intended to be discoverable with metadata; extrapolation beyond the survey design should be treated with caution.
