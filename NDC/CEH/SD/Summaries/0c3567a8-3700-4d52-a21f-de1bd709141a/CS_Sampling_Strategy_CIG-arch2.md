# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification (a stratified environmental classification) to ensure representative national monitoring of countryside habitats over time.
  - Emphasizes linkage between sampling design, classification, and time-series national estimates.

- Core concept: stratified sampling via the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification divides GB land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ensure representative sampling.
  - Early approach used in 1978 with a centre-square 1 km grid and ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) to define 32 land classes; surrounding squares were assigned to related classes.
  - The Land Classification evolved across surveys to improve national and country-level estimates (GB-wide, England, Wales, Scotland).

- Evolution of the sampling framework by survey

  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification & first field survey)
    - Used 1 km squares classified into 32 Land Classes (via ISA-based approach on 1228 centre squares).
    - Surveyed 8 squares per class (total 256 squares) to estimate national habitat areas.
    - National estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the land class area.

  - CS1984 (Second land use survey)
    - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (total 384 squares).
    - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
    - Provided insights into landscape changes; some results published (Landscape Changes in Britain).

  - CS1990 (All Squares land classification; third field survey)
    - Land Classification expanded to cover all GB squares (linking land use with the entire grid).
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping from earlier survey.
    - First integration of a Land Cover Map; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

  - CS2000 (Revised classification; country-based estimates)
    - Introduced a revised Land Classification to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland).
    - Created 40 strata; subdivided Land Classes into country-unit versions; added 19 extra squares (minimum 6 per new class) to improve representation.
    - Implemented separate country reporting; Wales received extra emphasis with additional Welsh-specific sub-classes and squares; consideration of upland habitats led to additional sampling.

  - CS2007 (Welsh-specific adjustments; Wales-focused reporting)
    - Added Welsh country-unit sub-classes (five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - Allocated 43 extra Welsh squares to ensure adequate Welsh representation; England did not receive similar increases in this round.
    - Adjusted class numbers and sampling rates to maintain precision for Wales and England with devolution context.

- Outputs and formats
  - Field results organized into clear formats (tables, maps, charts) for analysis and policy use.
  - Habitat estimates produced per Land Class; national estimates derived by combining class-level information with class area.
  - Data and results supported by revised class maps and sample square maps for each survey year.

- Country-specific reporting and upland focus
  - England with Wales and Scotland treated as separate country units for reporting from CS2000 onward.
  - Wales required additional sampling and sub-division of Land Classes to deliver Wales-only results.
  - An uplands module in CS2000 added 30 squares specifically to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- National estimates and consistency notes
  - Changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates.
  - CS1990 used the 1990 Land Classification for GB estimates; later surveys used updated classifications for country-specific reporting.
  - A crosswalk approach discussed to maintain comparability across surveys, noting that different classifications yield different but related estimates.

- Data management and dissemination
  - Emphasis on storing and uploading created datasets to appropriate portals.
  - Outputs intended to support monitoring of environmental health, landscape change, and policy performance over time.

- Acknowledgements and references
  - Acknowledges contributions from individuals and institutions across the DETR, CEH, and ITE.
  - Contains extended bibliographic references and historical context for the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey methodology.

- Practical implications for analysts monitoring the environment
  - The sampling strategy provides a robust time-series framework for detecting change in habitat extent and composition.
  - The Land Classification offers a reproducible, stratified basis for national and country-level estimates, while recognizing trade-offs in comparability across classification revisions.
  - Wales-specific adjustments and upland modules highlight the need to tailor sampling density to policy and reporting needs.
  - Data governance practices (quality assurance, transformation, storage, and portal uploads) are integral to making the datasets usable and auditable over time.
