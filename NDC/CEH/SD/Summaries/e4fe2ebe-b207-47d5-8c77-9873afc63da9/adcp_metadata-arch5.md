# Discovery metadata

- File: adcp_####_xs#.csv
- Authors: Chris Unsworth, Andrew Nicholas, Phil Ashworth, Dan Parsons, Greg Sambrook Smith
- Data description: These files contain water depths and velocities measured at cross-sections on the South Saskatchewan River, Canada. The file naming convention encodes year and cross-section number:
  - The first four # symbols indicate the year of data collection.
  - The # after 'xs' indicates the cross-section number.
- Contextual metadata (structure and content):
  - Five data columns:
    - Column 1: Measurement location UTM Easting (m)
    - Column 2: Measurement location UTM Northing (m)
    - Column 3: Water depth (m)
    - Column 4: Depth-averaged velocity component in Easting direction (m/s)
    - Column 5: Depth-averaged velocity component in Northing direction (m/s)
  - Purpose: Data collected to map the distribution of flow across river cross-sections.
  - Instrumentation and methods:
    - Instrument: Sontek M9 Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (aDCP)
    - Mounting: On a small zodiac boat or SonTek Hydroboard
    - Positioning: Recorded with RTK differential GPS (dGPS)
    - Data processing: Velocities corrected using boat speed and heading derived from dGPS
    - Sampling: Pulse coherent mode, 7 pings/s, averaged to 1 Hz for improved signal-to-noise
    - Transducers: 9 transducers; frequency range 0.5–3.0 MHz
    - Velocity accuracy: ±1 cm/s
    - Alignment: Cross-sections extended between banks and oriented approximately perpendicular to downstream flow
    - Reported velocity: Two horizontal components of depth-averaged velocity

- Data management and sharing notes:
  - Files are intended to be uploaded to relevant portals and catalogued as a dataset collection.
  - Documentation of work performed on datasets may accompany the data (dataset provenance and processing steps).
- Data quality and governance considerations (for Data Stewards):
  - Metadata includes essential units and column definitions; ensure consistent use across all cross-sections and years.
  - Provenance: clear record of instruments, mounting, positioning, data corrections, and averaging.
  - Limitations to note: cross-sections are aligned perpendicularly to flow; potential gaps in year-to-year continuity if sections vary.
  - Potential challenges highlighted in broader governance context: timely data delivery, standardization across many formats, handling large waveform-derived datasets, and alignment with older or non-interoperable systems.
