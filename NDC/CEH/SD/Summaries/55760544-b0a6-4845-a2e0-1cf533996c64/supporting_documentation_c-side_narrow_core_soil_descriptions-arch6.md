# Data resource description for C_SIDE_narrow_core_soil_description.csv

- Project and funding: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE); funded by NERC (NE/R010846/1).
- Dataset scope: Soil profile descriptions from narrow diameter cores (30 mm) in UK saltmarshes, collected between 2018 and 2021.
- Coverage: 474 sampling sites across UK saltmarshes; sites chosen to represent diverse saltmarsh habitats and located around the UK coastline for comparability.
- Location data: Observations located within UK extent using decimal longitude/latitude (WGS84). Bounding coordinates include 60.973491, -8.019200; 60.973491, 2.176113; 49.844006, -8.019200; 49.844006, 2.176113.
- Variables observed: Core_ID, Location (saltmarsh name), Depth_interval_cm (upper and lower depth horizons), Soil_description.
- Observational method: Each soil core described using the Troels-Smith classification (1955); depth transitions recorded.
- Data quality and evaluation: Core descriptions produced independently by two experts and then combined to form the final output.
- Data format: CSV file named C_SIDE_narrow_core_soil_description.csv.
- Data fields and formats:
  - Core_ID: Text (Core identification)
  - Location: Text (Saltmarsh name)
  - Depth_interval_cm: Number (Upper and lower depth horizons of soil transitions)
  - Soil_description: Text (Description of soil per Troels-Smith, 1955)
- Calibration and statistics: Not applicable (NA) in the dataset metadata.
- Quality control: Independent descriptions by two experts followed by data integration to produce final descriptions.
