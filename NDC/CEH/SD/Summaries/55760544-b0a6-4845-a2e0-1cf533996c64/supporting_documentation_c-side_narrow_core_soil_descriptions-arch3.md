# Data resource description for C_SIDE_narrow_core_soil_description.csv

## Project and funding
- Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE)
- Funding: NERC (NE/R010846/1)

## Dataset overview
- Data resource: Soil profile descriptions from narrow diameter cores in UK saltmarshes
- Timeframe: 2018–2021
- Sampling effort: 474 sites across UK saltmarshes
- Geographic scope: United Kingdom saltmarsh environments (coordinates provided in decimal degrees, WGS84)
- Purpose: Describe soil profiles from narrow diameter cores to support environmental health and carbon storage assessments
- Location detail: Sites chosen to represent diverse saltmarsh habitats across the UK coast

## Data content and structure
- Core elements recorded:
  - Core_ID: Text identifier for each core
  - Location: Saltmarsh name (text)
  - Depth_interval_cm: Upper and lower depth horizons of soil transitions (number)
  - Soil_description: Troels-Smith soil classification description (text)
- File format: .csv
- Observational description: Soil cores described using the Troels-Smith (1955) scheme with transitions between depth horizons recorded

## Data collection and quality checks
- Observation procedures: Soil core descriptions conducted using Troels-Smith classification
- Quality control: Each core description examined by two experts independently; descriptions merged to form final output
- Metadata and data handling: Dataset includes clear variable definitions and formats; no calibration procedures reported
- Data issues: Statistical treatment not specified (NA); some metadata fields marked as NA where not applicable

## Data governance and metadata
- Data provenance: Data resource ID and project context provided
- Sharing and storage: Underlying data described with field-level metadata; explicit data sharing constraints not stated
- Data formats and standards: CSV format; coordinates provided with explicit geographic reference (WGS84)

## Implications for monitoring and policy evaluation
- Provides a standardized, comparable set of soil profile descriptions across UK saltmarsh sites
- Supports assessment of soil properties related to carbon storage and environmental health
- Enables cross-site comparisons and integration into broader monitoring frameworks
- Highlights the importance of independent expert validation in data quality for environmental datasets
