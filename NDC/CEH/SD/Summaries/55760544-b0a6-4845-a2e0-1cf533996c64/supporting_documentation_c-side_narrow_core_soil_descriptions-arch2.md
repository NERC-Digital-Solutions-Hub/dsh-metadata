# Soil profile descriptions from narrow diameter cores in UK saltmarshes collected between 2018 and 2021

## Overview
- Project: Carbon Storage in Intertidal Environments (C-SIDE)
- Funding: NERC (NE/R010846/1)
- Purpose: Describes soil profiles from narrow-diameter cores in UK saltmarshes to support assessment of carbon storage and environmental conditions.
- Data resource scope: 474 sampling sites across UK saltmarshes collected between 2018 and 2021.

## Data Coverage
- Geographic extent: United Kingdom saltmarshes; coordinates provided in decimal degrees (WGS84) for site locations; site selection spans around the UK coastline to capture habitat diversity.
- Data format: CSV file (C_SIDE_narrow_core_soil_description.csv).

## Variables and Observations
- Core_ID: Identifier for each soil core.
- Location: Saltmarsh name corresponding to each core.
- Depth_interval_cm: Upper and lower depths of soil horizons (in centimeters).
- Soil_description: Description of soil following the Troels-Smith classification (1955).

## Methods
- Core collection: Narrow diameter cores with a diameter of 30 mm.
- Soil description: Each core described using Troels-Smith classification; depth transitions recorded.
- Calibration: Not applicable (NA).

## Quality Assurance and Validation
- Observations were described by two experts independently.
- The two independent descriptions were compared and combined to form the final dataset.

## Data Format and Access
- File format: CSV
- Data resource structure: C_SIDE_narrow_core_soil_description.csv
  - Core_ID: Text
  - Location: Text
  - Depth_interval_cm: Number
  - Soil_description: Text

## Data Management and Standards
- Site selection aims for comparability across UK saltmarsh habitats.
- Descriptions follow established soil classification (Troels-Smith, 1955).
- Data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals for accessibility.
