Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

- Overview
  - Provides sampling design, collection methods, laboratory analyses, and data structure for a study of aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in peatland headwater streams in the Flow Country (Sept 2008 – Aug 2010).
  - Supports assessment of carbon cycling and GHG fluxes across natural, drained, and restored peatland catchments.

- Sampling design and regime
  - Six headwater streams sampled approximately fortnightly over the study period.
  - Within each peatland management type (natural, restoration, drained), a nested design with an upper site and a lower site (lower encompasses the upper catchment).
  - Sampling locations labeled Natural upper (NU), Natural lower (NL), Restoration upper (RU), Restoration lower (RL), Drained upper (DU), Drained lower (DL).

- Site details
  - NU: 58°22'26.47" N, 03°58'08.29" W
  - NL: 58°22'29.25" N, 03°58'21.66" W
  - RU: 58°23'00.24" N, 03°56'58.84" W
  - RL: 58°23'37.41" N, 03°57'08.04" W
  - DU: 58°26'20.28" N, 03°55'54.87" W
  - DL: 58°26'06.58" N, 03°55'33.56" W

- Sampling collection methods
  - On each occasion, 500 mL acid-washed glass bottles used to collect samples for POC, DOC, and DIC.
  - In-situ dissolved gas sampling via headspace method: 40 mL of water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air in a 60 mL syringe, under water, for CO2 and CH4 analysis.
  - Separate ambient air sample collected at each occasion.

- Laboratory analyses
  - Filtration within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
  - POC estimated by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964 method).
  - Filtrate stored at 4°C and analyzed for DOC and DIC within four weeks using a PPM LABTOC Analyser (0.1 to 4000 mg L−1 range).
  - Dissolved CO2 and CH4 measured from headspace using HP5890 GC with flame ionisation detectors (CH4) and methaniser for CO2; detection limits: CO2 = 10 ppmv, CH4 = 70 ppbv.
  - Dissolved concentrations calculated for CO2 and CH4 from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry’s law (Hope et al., 2001).
