Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

## Overview
- Describes sampling design, methods, and laboratory analyses used to quantify aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater peatland streams across natural, restored, and drained catchments (Flow Country, Northern Scotland) from Sept 2008 to Aug 2010.

## Sampling locations & regime
- Six headwater streams in the Flow Country were sampled on an approximately fortnightly basis between Sept 2008 and Aug 2010.
- Within each peatland management type (natural, restoration, drained), a nested sampling approach was used with:
  - Upper site
  - Lower site (the lower site covers the catchment of the upper site)
- Site names and coordinates:
  - Natural upper (NU): 58°22'26.47" N, 03°58'08.29" W
  - Natural lower (NL): 58°22'29.25" N, 03°58'21.66" W
  - Restoration upper (RU): 58°23'00.24" N, 03°56'58.84" W
  - Restoration lower (RL): 58°23'37.41" N, 03°57'08.042" W
  - Drained upper (DU): 58°26'20.28" N, 03°55'54.87" W
  - Drained lower (DL): 58°26'06.58" N, 03°55'33.56" W

## Sampling methods
- On each sampling occasion at each site, a 500 mL acid-washed glass bottle was used to collect water for POC, DOC, and DIC analyses.
- In-situ dissolved GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4) were sampled using a headspace method:
  - 60 mL syringe; 40 mL of water equilibrated with 20 mL of ambient air by shaking under water for 1 minute to maintain temperature.
  - The equilibrated headspace was transferred to a gas-tight syringe for analysis.
  - A separate ambient air sample was collected.

## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration: Stream water samples were filtered within 24 hours through pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
- POC: Determined by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964 method).
- Filtrate handling: Stored in the dark at 4°C; chemical analyses conducted within four weeks.
- DOC and DIC: Measured in filtrate using a PPM LABTOC Analyser (detection range 0.1–4000 mg/L).
- Dissolved CO2 and CH4: Analyzed from headspace samples using an HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph with flame ionisation detectors (CH4) and a methaniser for CH4; CO2 detection limits 10 ppmv and CH4 detection limit 70 ppbv.
- Calculations: Dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations derived from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry's law.

## Nature and units of recorded values

  - Date: date of sampling
  - Site: site of sampling
  - DOC: mg/L
  - DIC: mg/L
  - POC: mg/L
