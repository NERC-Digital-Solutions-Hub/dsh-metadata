# Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010

## Overview
- Study of aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in six headwater streams in the Flow Country, Northern Scotland.
- Peatland catchments categorized as natural, restoration, and drained.
- Nested sampling: each catchment has an upper and a lower sampling site; the lower site encompasses the upper site’s catchment.
- Sampling conducted approximately fortnightly from September 2008 to August 2010.

## Sampling locations & regime
- Natural upper (NU) – 58°22'26.47" N, 03°58'08.29" W
- Natural lower (NL) – 58°22'29.25" N, 03°58'21.66" W
- Restoration upper (RU) – 58°23'00.24" N, 03°56'58.84" W
- Restoration lower (RL) – 58°23'37.41" N, 03°57'08.042" W
- Drained upper (DU) – 58°26'20.28" N, 03°55'54.87" W
- Drained lower (DL) – 58°26'06.58" N, 03°55'33.56" W

## Collection methods
- At each sampling occasion and site, 500 mL acid-washed glass bottles collected for POC, DOC, and DIC analyses.
- In-situ dissolved GHGs (e.g., CO2, CH4) measured via headspace method: 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air in a 60 mL syringe; headspace transferred to a gas-tight syringe for GC analysis; separate ambient air sample also collected.
  
## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
- POC estimated by loss-on-ignition (Ball, 1964).
- Filtrate stored at 4°C and analyzed for DOC and DIC within four weeks using a PPM LABTOC analyser (0.1–4000 mg L⁻¹ range).
- CO2 and CH4 concentrations determined from headspace samples by HP5890 Series II GC (FID with methaniser for CH4; FID for CO2).
- Detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv; CH4 70 ppbv.
- Dissolved CO2 and CH4 concentrations calculated from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry’s law.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Data reported to two decimal places.
- Missing values indicated with an asterisk.
- Recorded variables and typical units (Table 2):
  - Date (sampling date)
  - Site (sampling location)
  - DOC (mg L⁻¹)
  - DIC (mg L⁻¹)
  - POC (mg L⁻¹)
  - CO2 (mg L⁻¹)
  - CH4 (µg L⁻¹)

## Data handling and potential uses
- Data enable cross-site and cross-management-type comparisons (natural, restoration, drained) of aquatic carbon and GHG concentrations over time.
- Suitable for analyses of relationships between carbon species, gas evasion, and peatland management practices.
- Can be integrated with environmental drivers (e.g., temperature, precipitation) to explore temporal variability in concentrations and fluxes (references include Dinsmore et al. 2013; Hope et al. 2001).
