# Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

## Overview
- Describes the sampling design, methods, and data structure for a study of aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in peatland headwater streams in the Flow Country, Scotland (Sept 2008–Aug 2010).
- Focuses on six headwater streams across three peatland management types: natural, restored, and drained.
- Uses a nested sampling approach (upper and lower sites) within each management type to capture catchment-scale variation.

## Sampling locations and regime
- Six sites in total, each with an upper and a lower sampling site:
  - Natural upper (NU)
  - Natural lower (NL)
  - Restoration upper (RU)
  - Restoration lower (RL)
  - Drained upper (DU)
  - Drained lower (DL)
- Coordinates:
  - NU: 58°22'26.47' N, 03°58'08.29' W
  - NL: 58°22'29.25' N, 03°58'21.66' W
  - RU: 58°23'00.24' N, 03°56'58.84' W
  - RL: 58°23'37.41' N, 03°57'08.042' W
  - DU: 58°26'20.28' N, 03°55'54.87' W
  - DL: 58°26'06.58' N, 03°55'33.56' W
- Sampling cadence: approximately fortnightly between September 2008 and August 2010.

## Collection methods
- Water samples (500 mL acid-washed bottles) collected for POC, DOC, and DIC analyses.
- In-situ dissolved greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4) measured using headspace method:
  - 60 mL syringe; 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air by shaking for 1 minute.
  - Headspace transferred to a gas-tight syringe for GC analysis.
  - A separate ambient air sample collected at each occasion.

## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration: samples filtered within 24 hours through pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
- Particulate organic carbon (POC): determined by loss-on-ignition per Ball (1964).
- Filtrate storage: kept dark at 4°C; chemical analyses within four weeks.
- Dissolved carbon species: DOC and DIC measured using a PPM LABTOC analyser (0.1–4000 mg/L range).
- Dissolved gases: CO2 and CH4 concentrations derived from headspace GC (HP5890 Series II) with FID and methaniser.
  - Detection limits: CO2 ≈ 10 ppmv; CH4 ≈ 70 ppbv.
  - Dissolved concentrations calculated from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry’s law.

## Nature and units of recorded values

- Recorded fields and units:
  - Date (Date of sampling)
  - Site (Site of sampling)
  - DOC (mg/L)
  - DIC (mg/L)
  - POC (mg/L)
  - CO2 (mg/L)
  - CH4 (µg/L)
