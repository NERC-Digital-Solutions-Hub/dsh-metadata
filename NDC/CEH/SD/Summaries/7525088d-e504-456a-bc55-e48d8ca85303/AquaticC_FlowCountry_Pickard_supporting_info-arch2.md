# Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

- Purpose and scope
  - Characterizes aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in six headwater streams draining peatland catchments under natural, restored, and drained management.
  - Timeframe: September 2008 to August 2010; sampling occurred approximately fortnightly.
  - Design: nested sampling within each peatland management type (upper and lower stream sites; lower site encompasses the upper site of the same stream).

- Sampling locations and regime
  - Six headwater streams in the Flow Country, Northern Scotland.
  - Site pairs and coordinates:
    - Natural upper (NU): 58°22'26.47" N, 03°58'08.29" W
    - Natural lower (NL): 58°22'29.25" N, 03°58'21.66" W
    - Restoration upper (RU): 58°23'00.24" N, 03°56'58.84" W
    - Restoration lower (RL): 58°23'37.41" N, 03°57'08.042" W
    - Drained upper (DU): 58°26'20.28" N, 03°55'54.87" W
    - Drained lower (DL): 58°26'06.58" N, 03°55'33.56" W
  - Sampling frequency: roughly every two weeks.

- Collection methods
  - Sample type: water for POC, DOC, DIC; headspace method for dissolved GHGs (CO2 and CH4).
  - Water collection: 500 mL acid-washed glass bottles.
  - In-situ headspace sampling: use 60 mL syringe to equilibrate 40 mL water with 20 mL ambient air by vigorous shaking for 1 minute; transfer equilibrated headspace to a gas-tight syringe; analyze CO2 and CH4 via gas chromatography. An ambient air sample was collected at each event.

- Laboratory analysis
  - Filtration: water filtered within 24 hours through pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
  - Particulate organic carbon (POC): determined by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964).
  - Filtrate storage: dark at 4°C; chemical analyses within four weeks.
  - DOC and DIC: measured in filtrate with PPM LABTOC analyser (0.1–4000 mg L⁻¹ range).
  - Dissolved gases: CO2 and CH4 concentrations derived from headspace analyses with a HP5890 Series II gas chromatograph (FID with methaniser for CH4; detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv, CH4 70 ppbv).
  - Calculations: dissolved gas concentrations derived from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry’s law.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Data reported to two decimal places; missing values indicated with an asterisk.
  - Units:
    - DOC: mg L⁻¹
    - DIC: mg L⁻¹
    - POC: mg L⁻¹
    - CO2: mg L⁻¹
    - CH4: µg L⁻¹
  - Additional fields include Date, Site, and Details/Units.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and data use
  - Demonstrates standardized, QA-conscious data collection and laboratory methods for cross-site, multi-year comparison.
  - Data are suitable for synthesis into time-series analyses, comparisons across natural/restored/drained peatlands, and integration into broader environmental health assessments.
  - Designed to support outputs such as reports, maps, and charts, with datasets stored for shared access and reuse.
