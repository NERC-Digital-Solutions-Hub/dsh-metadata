# Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

## Sampling locations & regime
- Six headwater streams in the Flow Country, Northern Scotland.
- Peatland management types: natural, restoration, drained.
- Nested sampling design: each management type has an upper and a lower site; the lower site encompasses the catchment of the upper site.
- Sampling frequency: approximately fortnightly from September 2008 to August 2010.
- Site names and coordinates (NU, NL, RU, RL, DU, DL) provided (natural upper/lower, restoration upper/lower, drained upper/lower).

## Collection methods
- At each sampling occasion and site, 500 mL acid-washed glass bottle used for POC, DOC, DIC analysis.
- Dissolved GHGs measured in situ via headspace method:
  - 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air using a 60 mL syringe, under water for 1 minute.
  - Headspace transferred to gas-tight syringe for analysis of CO2 and CH4 by gas chromatography.
- A separate ambient air sample collected at each occasion.

## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
- POC estimated by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964).
- Filtrate stored at 4°C in the dark; chemical analysis within ~4 weeks.
- DOC and DIC measured with a PPM LABTOC Analyser (0.1–4000 mg/L).
- CO2 and CH4 concentrations determined from headspace analyses using HP5890 GC with FID (CH4) and methaniser for CO2.
- Detection limits: CO2 ~10 ppmv; CH4 ~70 ppbv.
- Concentrations of dissolved CO2 and CH4 calculated from headspace and ambient concentrations using Henry’s law (Hope et al. 2001).

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Values reported to two decimal places; missing values indicated with an asterisk.
- Variables and units (Table 2):
  - Date of sampling
  - Site of sampling
  - DOC: mg/L
  - DIC: mg/L
  - POC: mg/L
  - CO2: mg/L
  - CH4: µg/L
