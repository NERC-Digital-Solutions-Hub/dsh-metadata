# Supporting information for 'Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas concentrations in headwater streams draining from natural, drained and restored peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland, September 2008 - August 2010'

## Overview
- Focus: Aquatic carbon and greenhouse gas (GHG) concentrations in six headwater streams draining peatland catchments in the Flow Country, Scotland.
- Timeframe: September 2008 to August 2010.
- Sites and design: Natural, restored, and drained peatland catchments with nested sampling (upper and lower sites; lower site encompasses the upper’s catchment).

## Sampling design and sites
- Six sampling sites, with two per catchment:
  - Natural upper (NU) and Natural lower (NL)
  - Restoration upper (RU) and Restoration lower (RL)
  - Drained upper (DU) and Drained lower (DL)
- Coordinates provided for each site to enable precise geolocation.
- Sampling cadence: Approximately fortnightly during the study period.
- Nested approach: Lower site represents the broader catchment of the upper site.

## Sampling methods
- Water collection: 500 mL acid-washed glass bottles for POC, DOC, DIC analyses.
- In-situ dissolved GHGs: Headspace method.
  - Process: 40 mL water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient air in a 60 mL syringe, under water, for about one minute.
  - Transfer: Equilibrated headspace to a gas-tight syringe for analysis of CO2 and CH4 via gas chromatography.
  - Ambient air sample collected at each occasion for reference.

## Laboratory analysis
- Filtration: Within 24 hours using pre-ashed GF/F filters (0.7 µm).
- POC: Calculated by loss-on-ignition (Ball 1964).
- Filtrate storage: Dark storage at 4°C; chemical analyses within four weeks.
- DOC/DIC: Measured in filtrate using PPM LABTOC analyser (0.1–4000 mg L⁻¹).
- Dissolved GHGs: CO2 and CH4 quantified from headspace samples using HP5890 GC (FID with methaniser).
  - Detection limits: CO2 10 ppmv; CH4 70 ppbv.
  - Concentrations derived from headspace/ambient concentrations using Henry’s law.

## Data fields, units, and quality notes
- Data values recorded to two decimal places.
- Missing values indicated with an asterisk.
- Key fields:
  - Date (sampling date)
  - Site (NU, NL, RU, RL, DU, DL)
  - DOC, DIC, POC (mg L⁻¹)
  - CO2 (mg L⁻¹)
  - CH4 (µg L⁻¹)
- Unit details are provided in accompanying table; standardized across all samples to support interoperability and reuse.

## Data governance and availability considerations
- Metadata should document:
  - Sampling regime, site coordinates, peatland management type, and nesting design.
  - Analytical methods and instruments, including detection limits and calibration procedures.
  - Data processing steps (loss-on-ignition for POC; Henry’s law calculations for dissolved GHGs).
- Considerations for data sharing:
  - Clear data provenance, versioning, and any embargo or access restrictions.
  - Provision of complete method references and data tables to enable reproducibility (see cited references).
