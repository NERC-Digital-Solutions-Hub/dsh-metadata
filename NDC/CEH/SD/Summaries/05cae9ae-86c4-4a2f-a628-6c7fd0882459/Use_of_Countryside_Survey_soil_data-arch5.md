# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Scope and purpose
  - Documents sampling design and measurement protocols used in the Countryside Survey (CS) soils program for 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Includes power analyses to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling design and scope
  - 1978 and 1998: the same 256 CS squares were sampled.
  - 2007: soils sampled from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were taken on every sample.
  - Power analyses aimed to inform sampling sufficiency for detecting change over time.

- Sample location and plot structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced x-plots.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates (different land uses, soil types, etc.).
  - Plots relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or relocation uncertainty.
  - Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) for tracing across years; approximate sampling around a 2m x 2m permanent plot (2–3 m between exact core locations).

- Sampling methodology
  - Depth: top 15 cm sampled (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
  - 1998/2007: soil cores hammered in and pulled out.
  - 1978: soil pit used to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Core-related notes: in 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for two of the four cores; stones and shallow soils caused deviations from the ideal core approach.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1998/2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carry different measurements (see Table 1 in the documentation).
  - No chemical analyses by horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - 2007: bulk density measured (not using ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
  - Data catalogued include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, etc.
  - All-squares vs original squares: measurements were taken at varying frequencies across square sets (e.g., some measurements only on a subset of plots or cores).

- Data structure and availability
  - A detailed table (Table 1) lists measurements by core and by square/plot, including which squares/plots carried which measurements.
  - Some data were released only after the Soils Report published November 2009.
  - Data from all 591 CS squares are available for 2007 for certain measurements; original 256 squares preserved for others.

- Data interpretation and statistical guidance
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; failure to do so can bias population-level estimates.
  - If land classes are incorporated, results become national estimates of stock and change; otherwise, they reflect plain population stocks and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not universally applied in CS soils analyses.
  - Recommended modelling approach: a mixed model with square treated as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
  - Design-based approaches (e.g., dispersed sampling) can increase precision and regional coverage when spatial structure is not the primary interest.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review publications using CS soils data accessible via the CS website.

- Data stewardship implications for governance
  - Unique repeat identifiers (e.g., 2RPT1) essential for traceability across years; documentation should preserve cross-year linkage.
  - Multi-year, multi-core data with varying measurements necessitate robust metadata detailing which measurements exist for which cores/squares/years.
  - Incomplete measurement coverage across years and plots highlights the need for clear data availability statements and versioning.
  - Metadata should capture deviations from protocols (e.g., non-ISO bulk density method in 2007, pit sampling in 1978) to support reproducibility and accurate interpretation.
  - Data release timing and access (post-2009 releases; public CS website) should be tracked to manage user expectations and data licensing.
