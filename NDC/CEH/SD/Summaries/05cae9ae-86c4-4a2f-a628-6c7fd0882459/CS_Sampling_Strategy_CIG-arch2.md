# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field component (up to 2007) is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, which began in 1978.
- Purpose: to provide a consistent, time-series framework for monitoring environmental conditions across Great Britain, enabling national and country-level estimates and change detection over time.

## Core concepts and methods

- ITE Land Classification: stratifies land into classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling.
- Stratified, random sampling: used to reduce bias and ensure samples cover the full range of ecological variation within GB.
- Sampling unit: 1 km² squares; classification often relies on centre squares with surrounding squares allocated to the same land class.
- Outputs: national habitat estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each land class, multiplied by the land-class area (area-weighted). Outputs are presented in reports, maps, and charts, with datasets stored in appropriate portals.

## Evolution by survey year

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 centre 1 km squares.
  - Classified surrounding 4 squares per centre; total classified squares ~6039 km².
  - Field survey: 8 km² per land class; total 256 squares.
  - National estimates based on mean habitat area per square times land-class area.

- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Maintained the same framework, expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Emphasis shifted to land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
  - Land Classification updated to incorporate data from all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First integration with Land Cover Map of GB derived from satellite imagery.
  - Result: land-class framework adjusted for broader coverage; some squares changed class.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; CS1990 findings published; CS1990 used for context)
  - Extended classification to 40 classes to support regional and local estimates, including Scotland reporting.

- 2000 (CS2000)
  - Introduced country-based reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) to meet policy needs after devolution.
  - Classification implemented with country-unit subdivisions and aggregations to create 40 strata.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; overall sampling increased in England and Wales to improve country-specific estimates.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve accuracy for upland estimates in England and Wales.

- 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-specific needs led to further Wales-only adjustments.
  - Land Classes sub-divided into England and Wales country units, creating five new classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure minimum representation (6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: two classes (5e, 15e) ended with 4 squares per class; overall precision regarded as acceptable per scoping study.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country; England sampling adjusted to compensate for Welsh additions.

## Data structure, outputs, and reporting

- CS programs provide:
  - National estimates of habitat areas (via area-weighted contributions from land classes).
  - Country-specific estimates (England & Wales together, Scotland) and Wales-only reporting (CS2007).
  - Maps and tables illustrating class distributions, sample locations, and change statistics over time.
- Tables and figures referenced (e.g., maps of land classes and sample squares) accompany the published reports.

## Data quality, access, and reuse

- Consistent, standardized approach across surveys ensures comparability over time.
- Data quality and classification decisions documented, with notes on alignment between classifications and national estimates.
- Outputs are published in national reports and CEH/DOE documentation, with underlying data intended for storage in appropriate data portals for reuse and policy scrutiny.

## Key considerations and challenges for monitoring

- Representativeness: maintaining balanced representation across land classes while accommodating country-specific reporting.
- Changing classifications: evolving Land Classification can affect comparability; CS1990 onward adopted updated classifications to improve relevance for policy, at the cost of cross-survey consistency.
- Country-specific needs: devolution necessitated England, Wales, and Scotland-specific reporting, requiring sub-division, aggregation, and additional sampling to preserve precision.
- Value of time-series data: the framework is designed to maximize the usefulness of repeated surveys for detecting change in environmental features and policy outcomes.
