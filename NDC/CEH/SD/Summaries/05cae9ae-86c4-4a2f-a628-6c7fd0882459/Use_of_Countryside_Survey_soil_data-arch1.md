# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Sampling design
- Soils were sampled in 1978, 1998 and 2007.
- 256 squares were sampled in 1978 and 1998; 2007 sampled all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
- Power analyses were performed to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change.

## Sample location
- Samples come from CS x-plots; there are 5 x-plots per CS square.
- x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses and soil types.
- Over time, x-plots may be relocated due to destruction, access denial, or relocation uncertainty.
- Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) referring to square 2, repeat plot 1.
- Locations within a square are typically 2–3 m apart, sampled around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot corners.

## Sampling
- Soils sampled from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998 and 2007 used a soil core; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Full core sometimes not possible due to stones or shallow soils.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores sampled (black cores and N mineralization cores).

## Measurements
- 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores have different measurements (as listed in Table 1).
- No chemical analyses by horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density measured in 2007, but not using ISO whole-core method.
- A full description and implications are provided in Emmett et al. 2008.

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for the data structure; land class structure affects results.
  - Without land class adjustment, results reflect stock and change of the population.
  - With land class adjustment, results are weighted by land classes and can yield national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not consistently used across analyses.
- Recommended approach: mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots per CS square.
- CS design typically emphasizes dispersed sampling rather than fine spatial structure to improve regional precision and coverage.
- Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and review existing CS publications accessible via the CS website.

## Data details and restrictions
- The 2007 measurements included various cores and measurements (e.g., LOI, pH, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photos, depth of organic layer, texture, moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, etc.).
- Some data are released only after the Soils Report (November 2009).
- Data availability differs by original 256 squares vs all 591 squares and by which measurements were taken on which cores.
