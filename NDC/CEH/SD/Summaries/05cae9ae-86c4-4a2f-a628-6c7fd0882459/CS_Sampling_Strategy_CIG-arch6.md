# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Introduction
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007 and its link to the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasises that understanding the sampling design requires tracing 30 years of methodological evolution since the first survey.
- Highlights the aim to produce representative, policy-relevant estimates of countryside features by systematically stratifying the landscape and sampling within strata.

## The Beginning: The Importance of Stratification
- Pure random sampling risks bias and non-typical samples; stratification ensures representatives across ecological variation.
- Stratification combines environmental, physiographic, climatic, and land-use factors to form Land Classes, providing a robust basis for sampling GB-wide habitat estimates.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification (First Version)
- Early work (Bunce and Shaw) used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group 1 km squares by environmental attributes rather than species alone.
- In the mid-1970s, due to limited computing, a center-square approach within a 15x15 km grid classified 1,228 squares (plus surrounding squares) into 32 Land Classes.
- This classification formed the primary sampling framework for the first GB ecological survey in 1978.

## The Sampling Framework for CS1978 (First Field Survey)
- Eight samples per Land Class were selected at random, totaling 256 1 km squares across GB.
- Habitat area estimates were derived by linking the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class to the total area of that class.
- The framework established a replicable way to estimate national habitat areas from stratified samples.

## The 1984 Survey (CS1984)
- Increased sample size to 12 squares per Land Class (total of 384 squares) to improve precision.
- Outputs continued to rely on the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

## The 1990 Survey (CS1990) and All Squares Land Classification
- Land Classification was revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares (all-squares approach); urban and sea corrections were included.
- A field survey of 508 squares was conducted; this iteration also repeated key vegetation quadrats from 1978.
- Land Cover Map of GB was linked to the program, expanding the data basis.

## Developments of the ITE Land Classification (CS1990 onward)
- Recognised the need to classify every square in GB, but computing limits required using surrogates (climate, geology, physiography) and various multivariate approaches.
- The best-surrogate replacement led to a 62% correspondence with the original classification; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes with similar averages, justifying acceptance of the new system.
- The sampling distribution among classes shifted due to reclassification, affecting representative representation in some classes.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Reassessment of sample numbers and the need for separate country-level estimates (England, Scotland, Wales).
- Creation of a revised Land Classification with country-unit subdivision: 40 strata (expansion from 32).
- Additional squares were allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country; some classes in each country were aggregated to maintain representation.
- Special module for uplands in England and Wales funded to improve estimates for upland habitats where country-specific reporting is essential.

## Separate Country Estimates (CS2000)
- CS1990 used all-GB classes to produce country estimates, potentially mixing country-specific land class distributions.
- CS2000 introduced sub-division and aggregation to produce England & Wales estimates separately from Scotland, with adjustments in the sampling plan to support country-level reporting.
- Wales received increased sampling to improve Wales-only estimates.

## Survey of Uplands in England and Wales (CS2000)
- Added a dedicated uplands module (30 extra squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats, ensuring adequate representation within the upland land classes.

## Summary of CS2000 Sampling
- Detailed tabular counts show the distribution of sample squares across land classes and countries, reflecting the move toward country-specific reporting and improved stratification.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
- Wales-only reporting necessitated further revisions to accommodate Wales-specific habitat status and change information.
- Wales gained additional class subdivisions (5 new Welsh versions: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and the total strata increased to 45.
- Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; England did not receive additional squares for all classes, though two English classes (5e, 15e) would have only four squares per class.
- The revised Land Classification maps reflect England with Wales and Scotland for CS2007, and the CS2007 sampling framework is shown in accompanying figures and table.
- Table 3 provides the summary of squares surveyed for CS2007 across land classes and countries, illustrating the expanded Welsh sampling and updated stratification.

## Note on Creation of National Estimates
- The 2006 scoping study notes that changing classifications affects the consistency of stock estimates; GB estimates can be calculated using the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 classification.
- For survey consistency, the latest framework is preferred for country estimates, while the original classification offers cross-survey comparability.
- Table 4 presents the number of squares per class under the Original (1990) Land Classification across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Beginning, Middle, and End: The Evolution in One View
- 1978: Introduced a center-square stratification with 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class.
- 1984: Expanded sampling to 12 squares per class; continued use of earlier Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990: Implemented an all-squares Land Classification; integrated with Land Cover Map; 508 squares surveyed.
- 1990s: Revisions to classify all GB squares with surrogate variables; adjusted sampling distribution accordingly.
- 2000: Split country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland); added upland module; refined class structure to ensure country representation.
- 2007: Introduced Wales-specific sub-classes; expanded Welsh sampling; updated country-specific sampling framework for Wales, England, and Scotland.
