# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose for GIS specialists
  - Provides standardized, map-based data collection and documentation to support national land-cover, habitat, and vegetation analyses.
  - Enables robust time-series analysis and integration with remote-sensing datasets, with GIS-ready outputs and explicit change-detection workflows.

- Core data model and mapping framework
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) combines data sheets with enlarged 1:10,000 maps for GIS-ready recording.
  - Data elements cover ownership, physiography, inland/coastal water, agriculture and natural vegetation, woodland/trees, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, universal codes, and Broad Habitat Designations (BAPs).
  - Features are annotated with primary and secondary codes; dominant or mosaic representations documented when multiple codes apply.
  - Emphasis on field-derived decisions, qualitative notes for atypical cases, and careful coding to minimize map clutter.

- Sampling, plots, and change detection
  - CS2000 builds on CS1990 with expanded sampling and two-tier habitat framework:
    - Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs) for lowland/enclosed landscapes.
    - Plottable Broad Habitats for upland/unenclosed landscapes.
  - Plot types provide multi-dimensional data for spatial analyses (habitat composition, boundaries, hedgerows, vegetation structure).
  - Old squares use CS1990 references for change detection; new squares mapped de novo.
  - Separate theme maps and FAB data forms ensure traceability between ground observations and mapped products.

- Plot types and recording protocols (selected highlights)
  - X PLOTS (200 m²): main habitat plots with permanent markers and nested 4 m² subplots; full species cover data.
  - Y PLOTS (2 m × 2 m): five plots per square; random placement within habitats.
  - U PLOTS (2 m × 2 m): unenclosed plots distributed across Plottable BAPs.
  - B PLOTS (200 m² total): boundary plots prioritized at field boundaries.
  - A PLOTS (100 m × 1 m): arable field margins adjacent to boundaries.
  - H PLOTS and D PLOTS: hedgerow and hedgerow diversity plots for woody species inventories.
  - S/W PLOTS and R/V PLOTS: streams, verges, roadsides with standardized sampling along linear features.
  - Relocation practices include using marks, plates, plans, and photographs; if features shift, relocate to nearest permissible location and rename accordingly.

- Vegetation data, species lists, and coding
  - Nested plots record presence, abundance, and 5% cover increments for ~200 common plant species; unlisted species logged with Latin names where possible.
  - Special handling for bryophytes and lichens with fixed cover values; separate woodland codes for trees and shrubs (age, canopy, usage context).
  - Extensive code lists (e.g., for ferns, forbs/woody species, mosses/lichens) with primary and secondary designations to support GIS attribute tables and thematic mapping.

- Design and semantics of codes
  - Primary codes describe dominant land-cover; secondary codes provide qualifiers (height, cover, age, usage).
  - Proportional and age information linked to habitat components (e.g., canopy proportions, DBH benchmarks).
  - Change and universal codes (e.g., 888 New to map; 999 No longer on map; 701 Genuine change; 702 Probable mis-recording) support change-detection workflows and rapid mapping.
  - Boundary and curtilage codes enable rapid GIS classification in urban-to-rural transitions.

- GPS data, relocation, and annex workflows
  - Annex outlines GPS-enabled data capture and relocation workflows to improve time-series consistency, especially in uplands and older squares.
  - Step-by-step GPS procedures cover: battery power checks, stationary vs moving feature capture, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), sampling rate, and plotting IDs.
  - Emphasizes PDOP guidance (target 3D PDOP < 6) for accuracy; notes potential obstructions and practical fixes (antenna extension, elevated position).
  - Recording stationary plot locations requires sufficient sky visibility and typically 3–5 minutes of logging in clear conditions.

- Sampling procedures (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Sampling conducted in CS2000 squares (five soil samples per X-plot in each square; within 1 km squares used in prior survey for time-series basis).
  - Soil samples collected with specific pipe types at defined offsets, labeled, bagged, and shipped to ITE Merlewood for analysis (pH, ignition loss, heavy metals; soil fauna, microbiology).
  - Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen sampling aligned with nitrogen deposition studies; standardized collection, drying, labeling, and despatch to Merlewood.
  - Freshwater biota sampling may be conducted by IFE staff; coordination with CS2000 co-ordinators.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Cameras provided; photographs capture vegetation plots with reference features to support GIS interpretation.
  - Photographs must clearly show square/plot identifiers and reference features; aim for balanced framing to support future revisits.
  - Procedures after survey emphasize data verification, minimizing transcription errors, and timely return of FABs and samples to ITE stations.

- Practical GIS implications for data users
  - Standardized, code-backed data model enabling GIS-ready exports for landscape metrics, habitat mapping, and ecosystem trend analyses.
  - Explicit change-detection framework for old squares (CS1990 to CS2000) with pathways for Mappable vs Plottable BAPs.
  - Rich, multi-dimensional plot schemas (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V) support detailed spatial analyses, boundary dynamics, hedgerow structure, and vegetation composition.
  - Strong emphasis on data quality, repeatability, and clear documentation of uncertainties to support robust time-series analyses and policy-relevant reporting.
