# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- This policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## Current CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects the integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- Confidential policy intended to be in the public interest; handled under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- General releases allow identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are considered only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing instead of releasing raw locations. External release requires demonstrating that associated data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify square location and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- Upon license expiry, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- Data should not be released to third parties that could compromise square locations or used to plan visits to CS squares.
- Data must not be used to check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must show project-management standards (at least equivalent to JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit but with lower IP-confidentiality criteria.
- A clause prevents licensees from attempting to derive precise square locations from the data or claim they have done so.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising location-data applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Reasonable preprocessing by CEH is encouraged for internal CS partner use; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners and other potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH may assist in defining requirements or support appropriate use, potentially as collaboration or paid work, negotiated case-by-case.
