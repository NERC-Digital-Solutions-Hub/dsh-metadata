# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and scope
- Defines guidelines for field data collection on land use, vegetation, landscape features and biodiversity.
- Standardises how data are gathered, recorded, mapped and integrated with satellite imagery.
- Supports time-series monitoring and policy/biodiversity targets within a national rural environment framework.

## Data collection framework
- Sampling framework: 1 x 1 km squares; CS2000 expands to 568 squares with 60 additional sites and enhanced detail.
- Two main components:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats: detailed mapping of major habitats with stable, repeatable coding.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats: upland/open landscapes tracked via plots rather than precise boundaries.
- Stratification: country- and class-specific with 37 strata to ensure representative sampling.
- Plot types and concepts:
  - X plots: 200 m² main habitat assessments within squares.
  - Y plots: 2 m × 2 m baseline vegetation plots.
  - U plots: 2 m × 2 m plots in Plottable Broad Habitats for unenclosed landscapes.
  - B plots: boundary plots at field boundaries.
  - A plots: arable field margins for weed/edge biodiversity.
  - H/D plots: hedgerow sampling and hedgerow diversity plots.
  - S/W and R/V plots: linear plots along streams, roadsides, verges, etc.
- Permissions and access: landowner consent required; use prior contacts and documentation; replacement squares used if access is refused.
- Data recording and mapping: core components mirror CS1990; three-tier mapping focuses on de novo mapping, change mapping, and broad habitat reporting aligned with biodiversity action plans.

## Field procedures and workflow
- Planning and site visits: six ITE research stations manage squares; typical square surveyed over several days; logistics prioritize local travel.
- Equipment readiness: full provisioning (safety gear, GPS, maps, aerial photos, plotting tools, etc.) with emphasis on care and safety.
- On-site and post-survey data handling: verify access, plan routes, document omissions; post-survey records ensured legible and well-structured.
- Plot relocation: permanent markers and GPS locations for relocation; documentation includes distances, bearings and sketches; photography recommended for verification.
- Output and dissemination: promote outputs, gather feedback, and support iterative product improvements; outputs may be shared to enhance reuse.

## Taxa mapping and coding (standardization)
- A coded vocabulary approach is used for plants (and mosses/lichens) to ensure consistency across surveys.
- Abbreviations map to full species names (e.g., Athy fil = Athyrium filix-femina; Dryo fil = Dryopteris filix-mas; etc.), enabling standardized data entry in plots and FABs.
- The dataset includes extensive alpha-numeric coding and an integrity-check framework to maintain cross-record consistency.

## Data recording and FABs (Field Assessment Booklets)
- FAB structure includes:
  - Ownership and contact details.
  - Physiography, inland/coastal features, agriculture, natural vegetation, boundaries, buildings/structures, and universal codes.
  - Combination of numeric codes, descriptive text and space for qualitative notes.
- Three-tier mapping and standardized field recording aim to ensure comparability and data quality across time and regions.
- Emphasis on consistent observer training, QA, and documentation of exceptions or judgments made in the field.

## Data quality, standardization and training
- Strong emphasis on standardized observer training and QA processes.
- Field-based decision making preferred; any deviations are documented with comments to preserve data integrity.

## GPS data collection and annexes (Annex 1)
- Step-by-step GPS data collection guidance to ensure precise, repeatable plot coordinates.
- File naming: each plot/feature copy must have a unique data file name combining square number and plot/feature identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
- Operational steps cover satellite checks, stationary vs moving logging, data rate, feature naming, and start/stop logging.
- PDOP guidance: aim for PDOP < 6 for 3D fixes; obstructions may require adjusting the antenna or location.
- Handling data recording: use a reference list to quickly select plot IDs; use a keypad to speed data entry.
- Battery management, almanac updates, and recovery from obstructions are described to maintain data quality.

## Sampling types (Section 10)
- Three sampling types in CS2000:
  - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per 1 km square for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, metals), fauna diversity, and microbiological status; processed at ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen concentrations collected to assess nitrogen deposition impacts; 30–50 g CYG shoots per square; sent to ITE Merlewood.
  - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams.
- Background on soil data: baseline soil indices support soil sustainability assessments and long-term monitoring.
- Sample collection details:
  - Soil: center plot sampling within X-plots; specific procedures described for core collection, packing, and dispatch.
  - Calluna: standardized collection, drying, labeling, and transit procedures.
  - Freshwater: coordinated scheduling with IFE.

## Photography (Section 11)
- One camera per team; initial film stock provided; additional films claimed through T&S.
- Photos should document every vegetation plot showing general appearance and relation to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and uniquely identifiable; photos must include square/plot identifiers on a board placed at the plot edge.
- Composition guidelines emphasize including the plot and reference features, avoiding excessive sky.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey data checks: read through data sheets to ensure no omissions.
- If essential, data may be transposed to fresh maps only when necessary and avoided otherwise.
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly.

## GPS data collection details (Annex 1: GPS)
- Stepwise instructions for GPS setup, stationary vs moving logging, file naming, and plotting.
- Emphasis on ensuring sufficient satellites (at least four) and low PDOP for accurate positioning.
- Guidance on navigating the Magellan keypad for data entry, and handling obstructions to improve signal reception.
- Recording stationary plot positions and ensuring clear view of the sky for optimal reception.

## Accessibility and outputs
- Outputs are designed to be integrated with policy and biodiversity targets and to facilitate national-scale monitoring.
- The handbook provides a comprehensive, code-driven framework for data collection, mapping, plotting, permissions, and quality control to ensure robust, comparable data across time and space.
