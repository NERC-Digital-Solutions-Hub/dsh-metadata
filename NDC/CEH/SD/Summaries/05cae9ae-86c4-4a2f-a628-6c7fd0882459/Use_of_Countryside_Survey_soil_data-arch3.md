# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Purpose
  - Outline sampling design, measurement methods, and statistical analysis for Countryside Survey Soils 2007 to monitor soil properties and detect significant change over time.
  - Provide guidance on power analyses and protocols to inform future monitoring efforts.

- Sampling design
  - Soils sampled in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - 1978 and 1998 used the same 256 CS squares; 2007 expanded to 591 CS squares.
  - Power analyses conducted to determine the number of samples needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - Not all measurements were made on all samples in 2007, reflecting multi-variable constraints across years.

- Sample location
  - Soils collected from CS x-plots; five x-plots per CS square.
  - x-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc.
  - Some x-plots relocated over time due to land access or destruction; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Repeat locations are considered the same site but may be ~2–3 m apart from the original point.
  - Sampling targets the top 15 cm of soil (8 cm depth for invertebrate cores); sampling uses permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plots and cores are taken from the corners.

- Sampling
  - Consistent sampling depth for most measurements; variations occurred (1978 used a pit; 1998/2007 used cores hammered into the soil).
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - For 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for some cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).

- Measurements
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot with different measurements per core (as detailed in Table 1); measurements include pH (in water and CaCl2), %C, %N, bulk density (2007), core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, soil texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, mineralisable N, and other attributes.
  - Not all measurements are available for all samples or squares; data coverage varies by year and core type.
  - Asterisk indicates data released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

- Statistical analysis
  - Analyses should account for land class structure to avoid biased national estimates; weighting by land class yields national stock/change estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; emphasis on appropriate modelling of spatial structure.
  - Recommended to use mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - Design-based approaches may be more efficient for regional estimates, given the dispersed sampling strategy.
  - Users are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review relevant CS publications for context and prior data usage.
