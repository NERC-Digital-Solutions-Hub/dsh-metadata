# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise the utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

- CS partners (current)
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - The Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

- Circumstances for release and precision
  - Access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
  - Six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external requests require demonstration that accompanying data/IP protect confidentiality at least as strongly as CS data, making CEH processing unavoidable.
  - Spatial data from within squares could identify a square and will be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - Licences restrict use to defined projects and prohibit attempts to locate CS squares or monitor landowners.

- Specific licensing conditions
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals.
  - Licences are finite in period and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end and evidence of destruction provided.
  - No data or derived information may be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - If requested, licensees must show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit using data to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences with required clauses; licences signed by senior authority from the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures to support the decision.
  - CEH provides CS partners with an annual report summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests handled case-by-case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may assist via scientific leads, with possible collaborative or paid arrangements negotiated case-by-case.
