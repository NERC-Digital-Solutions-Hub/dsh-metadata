# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides guidelines for the CS2000 field survey across Britain, updating CS1990 to plan, collect, standardise, and analyse land-use, land-cover, and vegetation data.
  - Aims to support time-series monitoring, policy contexts, and link field data with remote sensing and biodiversity frameworks.
  - Emphasises standardisation to minimise observer variation and enable robust time-series comparisons.

- Data domains and coding
  - Extensive flora and moss/lichen coding with standardized species lists and synonym mappings (e.g., FORBS/WOODY SPECIES, MOSSES/LICHENS) to ensure consistent identification and recording across observers.
  - Plot types and layouts include a range of areal and linear plots (e.g., A1–A5 areal plots; X PLOTS; U PLOTS; Y PLOTS; B PLOTS; H, D, S, W PLOTS) with precise positioning and permanent markers.
  - Universal and boundary conventions cover curtilage boundaries, boundary types, and conditions; codes capture changes, including boundaries that no longer exist (code 999) or new boundaries (code 888).

- Sampling design and workflow
  - Three primary sampling themes within CS2000: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
  - Soil sampling (Section 10): in each square, five replicate samples from the same squares used in 1978 survey; five cores per square collected via specific pipe types and sent to ITE Merlewood for analysis (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals, etc.).
  - Calluna sampling (Section 10.9): foliar nitrogen sampling within each square containing Calluna vulgaris; standardized collection from current year’s growth for potential nitrogen deposition analysis.
  - Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11): coordinated sampling with IFE to occur alongside CS2000 fieldwork.

- Data capture, recording, and management
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) linked to 1:10,000 maps; essential for clean, unambiguous data entry and later analysis.
  - Data items include square identifiers, ownership, physiography, water features, vegetation and woodland details, and boundary information.
  - Data are codified hierarchically (primary CS1990 base codes with secondary/combining and universal boundary codes); datasets are intended to be discoverable with robust metadata and traceable links between FABs, theme maps, BAP maps, and data forms.
  - Photography is mandatory for vegetation plots, with standardized camera use, film management, and reference features to ensure plot position is verifiable over time.
  - Post-survey procedures emphasize data quality checks, with strict guidance against re-transcribing data unless necessary.

- GPS data collection and handling
  - Annex 1 outlines GPS data collection practices and planned integration into CS2000; emphasis on obtaining reliable fixes and proper file naming.
  - Step-by-step instructions cover battery/power checks, stationary vs moving position logging, creating plot-specific file names (e.g., 501X4.PSE), logging intervals, and data storage/transmission.
  - File naming conventions require square number and plot ID to ensure traceability; examples show feature naming (e.g., 501F1.MOB) for new features.
  - Guidance covers PDOP targets for accuracy, dealing with obstructions, and using GPS tools and keyboards effectively.

- Soil, Calluna, and vegetation sampling specifics
  - Soil sampling: three cores per centre plot in each X-plot (five total soil locations per square), with careful handling and shipping instructions to ITE Merlewood; emphasis on rapid processing for certain analyses.
  - Calluna sampling: random selection of CYG shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) within Calluna-dominated areas; careful bagging and despatch to ITE Merlewood with proper labeling.
  - Vegetation sampling: plots capture up to 200 common species per square; a nested sampling approach records species progressively from inner plots outward; use 5% cover categories; bryophytes and lichens recorded from restricted lists with precise cover values.

- Photography and documentation
  - Each vegetation plot photographed to document appearance and position relative to landmarks; photographs must include square/plot identifiers and a marker board; composition aims to balance plot exposure with clear reference features.

- Procedures after survey
  - End-of-day checks to ensure data completeness; recommended avoidance of re-transcribing data unless necessary; prompt transport of FABs and samples to CS2000 stations.

- Annexes and background context
  - GPS-focused annexes describing data collection practices and the anticipated role of GPS in CS2000.
  - Background materials address erosion, sampling near X plots, and forms for erosion scar data.
  - The handbook situates CS2000 within biodiversity, sustainability, and policy contexts (Rio, EU directives, Biodiversity Action Plans).

- End-use and analysts’ orientation
  - Deliver robust time-series of land cover, landscape features, and vegetation; quantify changes at plot and broad-habitat scales; distinguish ecological change from observer variation.
  - Produce standardized, well-documented datasets with metadata to support policy, planning, and scientific analysis.
  - Emphasises data interoperability, discoverability, and the ability to reuse datasets in future work.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - Data are highly standardised but require careful handling of diverse data types (plant species codes, mosses/lichens, soils, Calluna foliar data, freshwater data, GPS-derived coordinates).
  - Time-series integrity depends on consistent observer practices, standardized coding, and robust metadata linking FABs to maps and thematic layers.
  - Enables cross-domain analyses (vegetation dynamics, soil quality indices, nitrogen deposition proxies) within policy-relevant biodiversity frameworks.
