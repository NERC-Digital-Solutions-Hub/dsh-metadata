# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy focuses on confidentiality and controlled access for survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and securing future landowner permission to survey.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- 4-digit grid references: may be released under licence to show which 10x10 km grid square contains each CS square.
- 6-digit grid references: released only if pre-processing analysis can be done by CEH to avoid direct release; otherwise, VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances required for external release under licence.
- Within-square spatial data (maps of habitats, etc.) could in some cases reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional release terms as six-digit data.
- For highly sensitive external use, the IP confidentiality level of the external data must be equal to or higher than that of the CS data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases; licences include restrictions to prevent attempting to deduce precise square locations.

## Licencing and data handling responsibilities
- CEH, acting for NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences; licences must be signed by a senior authorised person from the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows the Act and Regulations to support the decision.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- To make practical the use of data, CEH aims to support pre-processing analysis within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partner organisations are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use the data; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for data governance
- Maintain clear licensing terms and renewal processes for location data.
- Ensure secure storage, access controls, and documented destruction at licence end.
- Document decision rationales for approvals or denials and provide annual reporting to governance bodies.
- Facilitate pre-processing capabilities within CS partnerships to enable responsible data use while protecting confidentiality.
