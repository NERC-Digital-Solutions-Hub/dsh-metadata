# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public-interest use of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and obtaining landowner permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and levels of location release

- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must show that external data/IP is as confidential as CS data and cannot be released to CEH for processing with CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.
- The policy also allows approximate location identification under predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).

## Conditions of release and licensee obligations

- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate needs.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- End-of-license: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data can be released to third parties that could compromise CS square locations; data cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases and include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by a senior person authorised for the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows Act and Regulations procedures and supports the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH can provide pre-processing analysis support within the CS partnership, subject to moderate demand.
- Requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data under this policy; CEH may assist as appropriate, either collaboratively or for payment.

## Practical guidance for analysts monitoring the environment

- Use four-digit/grid-precise data only under licence and within the defined constraints; otherwise rely on aggregated or approximate data.
- Engage CEH early to define requirements and ensure compliant use; CEH can provide scientific leadership or guidance.
- Plan for finite licensing periods and secure handling, storage, and destruction of data as required.
