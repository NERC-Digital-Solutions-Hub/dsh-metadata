# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004 via CEH.

## Release and precision levels
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to indicate the 10x10 km grid containing the square.
- Precise locations: six-digit grid references are only considered under very exceptional circumstances, with CEH possibly performing pre-processing to avoid release.
- Exceptionally, external release of precise locations may be allowed if the requesting organisation demonstrates that its own data/IP is equally or more confidential/protected.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and will be released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for the approved project.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; avoid using data to plan visits or check landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-compliant project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with a lower IP confidentiality threshold; licensees must not attempt to deduce precise square locations.
- Licences for location data will not allow attempts to identify exact square locations or to claim such capabilities.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee organisation.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS use, CEH aims to provide necessary pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated.

## Access to other CS data
- All other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, and Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Implications for data support practice
- Data Support should clarify licensing requirements, help clients understand four-digit vs six-digit releases, and coordinate potential pre-processing to minimize need for precise locations.
- Design data products (dashboards, reports) that avoid exposing precise site locations while still enabling meaningful analysis at appropriate aggregation levels.
- Communicate constraints to end users and ensure governance aligns with confidentiality terms; work with CEH to facilitate compliant data access and usage.
