# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS partners (current)
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Confidentiality deemed in the public interest; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Location access can show whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate approximate square locations.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require very exceptional circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing analyses to avoid releasing precise locations; exceptional external release requires legal demonstration that the licensee’s data/IP confidentiality is at least as strict as CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional release terms as six-digit locations.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational responsibilities.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data were secure and have been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; not to be used to plan visits or to check on landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower IP confidentiality requirements; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations or claim such derivation.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences (for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data) with terms reflecting this policy; licences must be signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decision-making under the relevant Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides the CS partners with an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For internal use within CS partners, CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly encouraged to consult CEH before using data under this policy; CEH involvement may vary by collaboration or payment.
