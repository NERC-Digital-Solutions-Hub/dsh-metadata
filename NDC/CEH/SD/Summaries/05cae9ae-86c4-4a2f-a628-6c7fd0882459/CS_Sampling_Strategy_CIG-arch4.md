# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the latest in a 30-year evolution of the ITE Land Classification and its use to stratify a national field survey of Great Britain ( Countryside Survey, CS).
- Emphasizes the linkage between land classification, sampling framework, and time-series estimates for habitat and land-use change.
- Documents the progression from a single classification system to country-specific and Wales-specific frameworks to support policy and reporting needs.

## Data Framework: ITE Land Classification
- ITE Land Classification used to stratify GB into discrete land classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Evolution of classes:
  - 1978: 32 classes (original framework).
  - 1990: expanded to 40 classes; all GB squares classified.
  - 2000: further refinements to support separate England & Wales and Scotland reporting (country-unit versions and class subdivisions).
  - 2007: further subdivision for Wales-specific reporting, increasing strata to 45 (later adjustments to 40s with country-unit refinements).
- Classification methods included Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate approaches; initial classification used centre 1 km squares within a 15x15 km grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes.
- Land Class maps and resulting sampling frames are presented in figures throughout, with detailed descriptions of each class (e.g., land form, land use, vegetation).

## Sampling Design and Time-series across Surveys
- 1978 (Initial Survey): 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class across 32 classes); gridded, stratified, random sample; captures habitat and soils, with additional habitat mapping.
- 1984 (Second Survey): 384 squares (12 per class); same framework but expanded sample; later reports used the 1978 classification for national estimates.
- 1990 CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification): 508 squares surveyed; developed Land Cover Map; integrated data from all 1 km squares; provided groundwork for regional/local estimates.
- 2000 CS2000 (Separate country estimates): frameworks adjusted to deliver England & Wales and Scotland-only estimates; introduced sub-division and aggregation of land classes to create 40 strata; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat module added for England & Wales.
- 2007 CS2007 (Welsh-only Estimates and uplands): added Welsh-specific classes (5 new country-unit classes) and increased Welsh sampling to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class; no corresponding English increase in some classes; introduced an upland sub-module to improve country-specific estimates; total sampling numbers adjusted (Tables and maps illustrate distributions).

## Data Assets and Outputs
- Land Classification maps and the list of 32/40/45 (and country-unit) Land Classes used to assign each 1 km square.
- Sampling frame: number of squares per class per survey; changes in class definitions and country subdivisions impact representativeness and comparability.
- National estimates: calculated as the mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class; country-specific estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) produced for policy-relevant reporting.
- Time-series outputs: cross-survey comparability challenged by reclassification; documentation explains how to maintain consistency within surveys and across surveys.

## Data Governance, Provenance, and Comparability
- Revisions to Land Classification affect cross-survey comparability; CS1990 used updated classification (all GB squares) which changed class representation versus earlier schemes.
- Note on national estimates: two approaches exist—use latest classification for within-survey consistency, or the original (1990) classification for cross-survey consistency.
- Welsh-only reporting motivated by devolved policy needs; Wales required more targeted sampling and class subdivisions to improve precision.

## Accessibility, Gaps, and Challenges for Data Leaders
- Fragmentation and evolution of the classification create representational gaps and potential biases if not carefully tracked.
- Changes in class definitions and country-unit subdivisions necessitate careful documentation for longitudinal analyses.
- Access to country-specific outputs improved (Welsh and English/Wales, Scottish reporting), but consistency across years requires attention to classification maps and sampling rate adjustments.
- The document includes acknowledgements, extensive references, and figures illustrating classifications and sampling frames for transparency and reuse.

## Endnotes and References
