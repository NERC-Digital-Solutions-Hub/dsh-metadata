# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose: Establish a national, standardised, time-series field handbook for monitoring environmental conditions and policy performance, enabling long-term trend analysis and data interoperability.
- Scope: Field methods cover land classification, vegetation, soils, and fauna across Great Britain and nearby territories; emphasis on data quality, standardisation, and reuse of underlying data.

## Aims and Scope
- Create a consistent, time-series dataset to monitor environment and policy performance.
- Use standardised field recording for scrutiny of environmental health over time.
- Support government, NGO, and industry with comparable land-use, habitat, and vegetation data.
- Emphasise standardised data collection, quality control, and accessibility of underlying datasets for reuse.

## The Survey Framework and Core Sample
- England, Scotland, Wales, and Isle of Man: repeated 1x1 km squares across ITE Land Classes to monitor landscape change.
- Countryside Survey lineage (CS1990 and CS2000) aims to update land-use databases and policy indicators.
- CS2000 builds continuity with CS1990 via re-surveys and expanded sampling to enable trend analysis; links ground data with satellite imagery for national land-cover maps.
- Focus on reducing observer variation through standardised field recording and robust quality control.

## Planning Site Visits
- Six ITE Research Stations survey groups of squares (≈95 squares per team).
- Typical square survey duration around four days; travel considerations and scheduling flexibility.
- Prioritise minimal revisits; aim for consistent seasonal timing by repeating 1990 visit order when possible.

## Equipment
- Field gear and Field Assessment Infrastructure (FABs) including maps, GPS, compasses, cameras, plotting tools, and safety gear.
- Strong emphasis on equipment stewardship and team identification; replacement procedures are in place.

## General Field Survey Procedures
- Two square types: old (for change detection) and new (stock/land-cover detailed capture).
- On arrival: assess access, confirm landowner permission for full square coverage, plan route for complete coverage.
- For new squares: record all land-cover types; for old squares: focus on changes since 1990.
- Ensure meticulous data capture and post-survey completeness verification.

## Permissions for Access
- Landowner consent required for access to all parts of a square.
- Pre-survey communications include letters; permissions often granted on the day.
- If access is refused for all parts, abandon and replace the square; partial refusals trigger adjustments per guidelines.
- Documentation and follow-up with landowners are important; survey teams carry ITE identity and explanatory handouts.

## Data Recording (Filling in the FAB)
- Core elements: mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling data.
- Three enabling components:
  - Mapping: annotate large-scale maps with feature codes.
  - Vegetation plots: record species presence and cover in nested plots using a standard FAB.
  - Sampling: employ fixed plot types and standardised measurement protocols.
- Key CS2000 changes:
  - Mapping change only in old squares to track true changes.
  - Reporting by broad habitats (BAPs) to align with biodiversity action plans.
  - Use of up to ten extra plots to improve monitoring in upland and unenclosed landscapes.

## Mapping and Plotting
- Standardised codes (primary/secondary) to annotate areas, lines, and points; aim to minimise clutter.
- Boundaries and boundary condition documented; changes may be renumbered with rationale.
- Aerial photography interpretation (API) is supplementary; ground-truthing remains essential.

## Ponds, Other Mapping, and Plotting
- Ponds require special paperwork and are tracked against previous surveys.
- New/enhanced plot types to capture vegetation dynamics:
  - X, Y plots for areal vegetation changes and baseline vegetation.
  - U plots for upland/unenclosed landscapes.
  - B plots for boundaries; A plots for arable margins.
  - H/D plots for hedgerow vegetation and diversity.
  - S/W and R/V plots for streamsides, verges, and roadside habitats.
- Plot types have defined dimensions, relocation rules, and data recording requirements; permanent marking and GPS relocation ensure repeatability.

## Species and Data Standards
- Vegetation data use a fixed list of around 200 common species, with spaces for unlisted species.
- 5% cover categories; multiple nested plots per large plot; summative cover across plots.
- Aggregations allowed for difficult identifications to maintain comparability with past surveys.
- Bryophytes and lichens have restricted lists; specific forms/classifications for certain mosses are used.

## Design and Access to Data
- Emphasis on standardisation to reduce observer bias and improve time-series reliability.
- Encourages sharing underlying data to enhance dataset value and cross-linking with other data sources.
- Annexes provide guidance for GPS data collection, plot relocation, and data curation for robust, reusable datasets.

## Annexes and Background
- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data – practical steps and checks for precise geolocation.
- Background: National concern about soil erosion and sedimentation in uplands; multi-agency collaboration to quantify sedimentation and erosion patterns; CS2000 data feed into broader environmental assessments.

## Section 10- Sampling
- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling.
- Freshwater sampling conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff in coordination with CS2000 fieldwork.

### Soil Sampling
- Five replicate soil samples per square in the designated X-plots; samples sent to ITE Merlewood.
- Samples target soil chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals) and soil fauna/microbiological assessments.
- Samples collected from three cores per X-plot (centered in the plot), with careful handling and rapid processing.

### Calluna Sampling
- Collect Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen indicators to help identify regions with deposition above critical loads.
- Sampling within squares where Calluna occurs; collect current-year growth (CYG) shoots; 30–50 g fresh weight per sample; proper labeling and posting to Merlewood.

### Despatching Samples
- Guidelines for timely dispatch to ITE Merlewood, with receipts claimed on T&S forms.

## Section 11- Photography
- Use of cameras to photograph vegetation plots, with reference features that are obvious, permanent, and clearly visible in photos.
- Photos labeled with square/plot identifiers and positioned to cover key plot details; standard composition guidance provided.

## Section 12- Procedures After Survey
- Post-survey data checks to ensure completeness; avoidance of transcription errors; transfer to ITE stations when needed.

## Annex 1 - Collecting GPS Data
- Step-by-step GPS data collection protocol: battery/power checks, stationary vs moving feature logging, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), sampling rate, plot labeling, and logging controls.
- Emphasis on achieving good PDOP (<6 for 3D), avoiding obstructions, and preserving data integrity during transport.

## Key Takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- CS2000 advances CS1990 with a focus on change detection and broad-habitat reporting to support long-term monitoring and policy evaluation.
- FAB-based, codes-driven data capture ensures consistency across observers and years.
- Integration of ground-truth data with remote sensing supports national land-cover mapping and enables upland/lowland comparability.
- Emphasis on data accessibility and interoperability to maximize reuse for policy review and biodiversity action plans.
- Comprehensive procedures cover permissions, planning, data capture, mapping, plotting, and data management to ensure robust, repeatable environmental monitoring.
