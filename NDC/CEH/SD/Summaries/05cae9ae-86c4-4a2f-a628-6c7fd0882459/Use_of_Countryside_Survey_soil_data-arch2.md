# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols.

- Overview
  - Describes the sampling design and measurement protocols used in the Countryside Survey (CS) soils component across 1978, 1998, and 2007.
  - Includes details on how sampling intensity, locations, and measurements evolved, and explains power analyses conducted to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

- Sampling design
  - 1978 and 1998: same 256 squares sampled.
  - 2007: soils collected from all 591 CS squares, though not all measurements were made on every sample.
  - Power analyses used to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change.

- Sample location and structure
  - Soils sampled from CS x-plots; each CS square contains 5 x-plots randomly spaced.
  - X-plots are not replicates due to potential differences in land use, soil type, etc., within a square.
  - Some x-plots relocated over time due to land use change, access, or uncertainty; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Sampling occurs at a permanently marked 2m x 2m plot per location; samples from corners to capture spatial variation (approx. 2–3 m between exact positions).

- Sampling methodology
  - Top 15 cm sampled in 1998 and 2007 (8 cm depth for invertebrate samples); cores used to extract soil.
  - 1978 used a soil pit to sample the top 15 cm.
  - Some soils prevented full core collection due to stones or shallow soils.
  - In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores at selected plots.

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1990: soil mapping activities conducted.
  - 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot, with different cores having different measurements (see Table 1 in the source).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to practical constraints).
  - A full description and implications are detailed in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Measurements by core type (examples)
  - Measurements include pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photography, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, and mineralisable N.
  - Some measurements applied to all 591 squares; others applied to original 256 squares or specific sub-samples (as indicated by the data table references).

- Statistical analysis and data interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land classes yields stock/change estimates that may be biased.
  - When land class structure is considered, results are weighted by land classes to produce national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not always used; the CS design should be accounted for.
  - Recommended approach is a mixed model with square as a random factor to accommodate multiple x-plots within each CS square.
  - For design-based monitoring with dispersed observations (where spatial structure is not central), widespread sampling increases precision and regional representativeness.
  - Users should consult CEH prior to analysis and interpretation and review CS publications exploiting the data (listed on the CS website).

- Data accessibility and documentation
  - Data structure reflects repeated measures across years and locations, with evolving sampling intensity (256 vs. 591 squares).
  - Detailed notes on what measurements were taken on which samples are documented (e.g., Table 1 in CS2007).
