# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- The policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## When locations may be released and precision
- Users can identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
- Precise six-digit locations are only possible under very exceptional licence, requiring CEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing locations externally.
- Very exceptional external release requires legal demonstration that the external IP/data has equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, linear features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional conditions as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained to fulfil other responsibilities.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality; do not use data to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require equivalent IP confidentiality criteria.
- Licences prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate terms; licences must be signed by a senior authority.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising licensing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be negotiated or arranged as needed.
