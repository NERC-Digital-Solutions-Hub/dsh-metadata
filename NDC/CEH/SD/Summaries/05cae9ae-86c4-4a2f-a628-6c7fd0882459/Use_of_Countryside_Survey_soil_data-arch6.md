# Sampling design

## Overview
- Soils sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) in 1978, 1998, and 2007.
- 256 squares were sampled in 1978 and 1998; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.
- Power analyses were used to determine the number of samples required to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).

## Sample location and plot structure
- Samples taken from CS x-plots; 5 x-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates (they may differ in land use or soil type).
- X-plots can be relocated over time due to plot destruction, access permission, or uncertainty in relocation; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
- Same location identifiers refer to the same site, though exact sampling coordinates may shift ~2–3 m around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

## Sampling protocol
- Depth: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for invertebrate samples).
- 1998 and 2007 used a soil core hammered in and pulled out; 1978 used a soil pit.
- Some soils could not yield a full core due to stones or shallow depth.
- In 2007, core photographs and detailed measurements of core dimensions were taken for 2 of the 4 cores.

## Measurements and laboratory analyses
- 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998 and 2007: multiple cores per x-plot; different cores carried different measurements (see Table 1).
- No chemical analyses by horizon; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core constraints).
- A full methods description is provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

## Data structure and availability
- Measurements collected in 2007 include: pH (in water and CaCl2), LOI, %C, %N, bulk density, core dimensions, photographs, depth of organic layer, hand texture, soil moisture, Olsen P, metals, and other variables (as listed in Table 1).
- Data availability varies:
  - Some measurements cover all 591 squares.
  - Some measurements cover only the original 256 squares.
  - Some measurements are limited to 2–5 x-plots within each original square.
- The table of measurements (Table 1) documents which data exist for which cores.
- Some data were released only after the Soils Report published in November 2009.

## Statistical considerations and guidance
- Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring it yields stock/change estimates of the population rather than national estimates.
- If land classes are accounted for, results are weighted to national estimates.
- Bootstrapping is not always used in analyses of CS soils data.
- Use a mixed model with square as a random factor to account for multiple x-plots within a CS square.
- In CS design-based contexts, a dispersed set of observations improves regional estimates of precision and coverage.
- Most CS analyses use only one core per location; researchers are advised to consult CEH prior to analysis and to review CS publications for prior methodologies (listed on the CS website).
