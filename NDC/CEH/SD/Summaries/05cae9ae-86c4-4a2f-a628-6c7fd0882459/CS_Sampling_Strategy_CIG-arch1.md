# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Overview
  - Document describing the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, the latest development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasizes the long 30-year evolution of the sampling and classification system and its central role in producing national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - Links survey design to data quality, comparability, and practical decision-making in environmental policy.

- Core concepts and approach
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage and reduce bias across ecological variation.
  - Stratification based on the ITE Land Classification, which groups land into discrete classes using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
  - Quadrat-to-square extrapolation: habitat areas are estimated by combining mean habitat area per class with the total area of each class.

- Development history of the ITE Land Classification
  - Origin: 32 land classes developed in the 1970s using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares; centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified, with surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
  - 1978 CS framework: initial stratification used 1 km classified squares; eight samples per class were selected (256 total).
  - 1984 CS: sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); larger emphasis on land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 CS: Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; reuse of 1984 features plus a repeat of 1978 quadrats and the first Land Cover Map (from satellite data) linked to the programme.
  - 1990s: development of a revised Land Classification to enable regional and local estimates; efforts to classify every GB square using surrogates for climate, geology, and physiography; some class-shifts occurred when reclassifying squares.
  - 2000 CS: adjustments to address representation across Scotland, England, and Wales; introduction of separate country estimates; subdivision and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata; additional squares added to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat estimation module discussed.
  - 2007 CS: Wales-specific reporting formally accommodated; Welsh-only Land Class subdivisions created (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; some English classes reduced to maintain precision; introduction of an uplands module to improve statistics for upland habitats.

- Sampling framework by survey year
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per Land Class) across 32 classes; national estimates based on mean habitat area per class multiplied by the area of each class.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); sampling scaled up to improve national estimates.
  - CS1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; Land Cover Map linked; repeated vegetation quadrats recorded; broader feature set.
  - CS1998/CS2000: Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; separate country estimates introduced; 19 additional squares added to ensure representation; 6 squares per new class minimum in each country; Wales-specific sub-divisions refined results.
  - CS2007: Wales reporting formalized with country-unit class subdivisions; 45 strata; 196–203 Welsh squares in latest framework; uplands module added (30 squares) for better upland habitat estimates; overall rebalancing of class representation and sampling intensity.

- Separate country estimates and class subdivision
  - To deliver England & Wales vs. Scotland country-level estimates, Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and re-aggregated where necessary.
  - The framework created 40 (then 45) strata to maintain adequate representation across country units.
  - Additional squares were allocated to ensure each class had minimum representation, with Wales receiving more emphasis to support Wales-only reporting.

- Uplands module
  - An additional CS2000/CS2007 module placed 30 squares in upland and marginal upland classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data interpretation, comparability, and caveats
  - Note on national estimates: changing the basic Land Classification used for estimation can affect the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
  - The 1990 Land Classification was preferred for cross-survey consistency within an individual survey series, though different classifications may be used for cross-survey comparability.
  - The document provides guidance (Table 4) on how sample squares per class varied across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, illustrating shifts in sampling design and the need for careful alignment when comparing results over time.
  - The evolution of classifications and country-specific subdivisions means analysts must align their analyses with the specific Land Classification version and country framework used in the target dataset.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - When using CS data, ensure alignment with the Land Classification version and country-unit framework relevant to the estimates.
  - Be mindful of class sub-divisions (e.g., Welsh or English country-units) and the corresponding sample sizes per class in each country.
  - Consider the uplands module if analyses focus on upland habitats or risk under-sampling non-lowland areas.
  - Acknowledge potential shifts in class definitions over time when performing trend analyses; cross-year comparability may require mapping or bridging between classifications.
  - Data interpretation benefits from understanding the sampling design (strata, class areas, and sample sizes) to properly assess uncertainty and representativeness.
  - For data discovery and reuse, datasets are accompanied by metadata and are intended to be made discoverable through portals.
