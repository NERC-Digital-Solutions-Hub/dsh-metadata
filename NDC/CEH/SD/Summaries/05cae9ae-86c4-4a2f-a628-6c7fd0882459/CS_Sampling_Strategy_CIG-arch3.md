# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes how Countryside Survey field data were sampled and classified, linking the sampling framework to the ITE Land Classification.
- Documents the evolution of the sampling strategy from 1978 to 2007 and how changes supported policy-relevant, country-specific environmental monitoring.

## Key Concepts for Monitoring Framework Authors
- ITE Land Classification
  - A stratified environmental framework used to divide Great Britain into discrete land classes for sampling.
  - Classes have evolved from 32 to 40, then to 45 (with country-unit subdivisions for England, Wales, and Scotland).
- Stratified Random Sampling
  - Stratification ensures representative coverage across diverse land types, reducing bias in national estimates.
  - Samples are drawn from classified squares (typically 1 km squares, with surrounding squares assigned using a defined key).
- Data and Outputs
  - Field surveys cover vegetation, soils, land use, habitat mapping, and later land-cover information (including satellite-derived data).
  - National and country-specific estimates are produced by combining class-level statistics with the area of each class.
- Time-series and National Consistency
  - The framework emphasizes continuity with earlier surveys to enable change detection, while adapting classifications to meet policy needs and country reporting.

## Evolution of the Sampling Framework
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & 1st Field Survey)
  - 32 ITE Land Classes created from environmental attributes for 1228 centre 1 km squares (plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
  - Final sample: 256 squares (8 per class) for vegetation quadrats and soils.
  - National estimates: calculated from class means multiplied by class area.
  - Publication: foundational work on landscape classification and sampling.
- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the original 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Focus shifted toward land use, landscape features, and habitat mapping.
- 1990 (CS1990 – All Squares Land Classification)
  - Extension to classify every square in GB; a conservative revision with some squares reclassified.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats; addition of the first Land Cover Map (satellite-derived).
  - National estimates based on the 1990 Land Classification; enhanced regional and local applicability.
- 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification & CS2000)
  - Development of a new Land Classification to improve regional estimates; ~40 classes.
  - Separate country estimates introduced to report England with Wales and Scotland independently.
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit versions; class aggregation to maintain representation; 40 strata expanded to 40Rather, to 40/45 across country units.
  - Additional sampling: 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Summary tables/maps detail the distribution and sampling rates by country.
- 2007 (CS2007 – Wales-focused Reporting)
  - Wales required Wales-only reporting; Wales sampling intensified with country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Number of strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure six squares per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments: some classes remain with 4 squares per class due to precision considerations; overall precision deemed acceptable.
  - Updated maps and tables reflect revised England-Wales-Scotland sampling framework for CS2007.

## Country Units and Upland Focus
- Separate country estimates became essential due to devolution, necessitating England with Wales and Scotland-specific reporting.
- An uplands module in CS2000 improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales, addressing prior under-sampling in those areas.

## Data, Governance, and Outputs
- Outputs include habitat status and change information, with country-specific reporting to satisfy policy and legislative needs.
- The sampling design acknowledges the impact of changing classifications on national estimates, emphasizing consistency and comparability across surveys.
- Note: The framework highlights trade-offs between precision, class representation, and the practicalities of field sampling, especially when adjusting for country-specific reporting.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Representativeness: Stratified sampling reduces bias and improves reliability of national and country-level habitat estimates.
- Comparability: Changes in Land Classification must be managed to maintain temporal consistency in national estimates; the document discusses approaches to align or reconcile classifications over time.
- Policy-Relevance: The evolution toward country-specific reporting (England with Wales, Scotland) and upland-focused modules demonstrates how monitoring frameworks adapt to statutory and policy needs.
- Transparency and Documentation: Detailed descriptions of class definitions, sampling allocations, and changes over time support reproducibility and governance of environmental monitoring programs.
