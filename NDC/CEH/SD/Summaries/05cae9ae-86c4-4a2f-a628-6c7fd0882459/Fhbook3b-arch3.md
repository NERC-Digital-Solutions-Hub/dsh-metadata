CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a national, standardized framework for GB countryside environmental monitoring to support policy scrutiny, trend analysis, and decision-making.
  - Builds on CS1990 with emphasis on standardized field methods, metadata, and data governance to enable transparent sharing and reuse.
  - Integrates field data with broader policy contexts (e.g., soil sustainability, biodiversity indicators) through consistent data handling.

- Sampling framework and types
  - Three sampling types:
    - Soil sampling: conducted by CS2000 field surveyors; soil chemistry, soil fauna, and microbiological status analyzed by ITE Merlewood; five replicate samples per 1 km square square as baseline.
    - Calluna sampling: foliar (Calluna vulgaris) sampling to support nitrogen deposition research; current year growth (CYG) shoots collected within squares.
    - Freshwater biota sampling: conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; coordinated with CS2000 timing.
  - Spatial design and logistics
    - Centralized 1 km square sampling with multiple plots (X-plots) and additional sampling to capture land-cover types; samples shipped to ITE Merlewood for processing.
    - Emphasis on repeatability and traceability of plots and features, with clear relocation procedures and GPS tagging guidance.

- Soil sampling procedures (section 10.7)
  - In each X-plot center, five soil sampling locations per square (three core samples per central plot, plus two supplementary cores at specified offsets).
  - Sampling protocol uses three pipes of specific lengths to obtain soil cores; samples are labeled, bagged, and shipped promptly via pre-paid envelopes.
  - Shorter soil cores (for soil fauna and microbiology) processed and shipped quickly; longer cores (soil chemistry) handled by regional coordinators and collected by Soil Ecology staff.

- Calluna sampling procedures (section 10.9–10.10)
  - Collect current year growth (CYG) Calluna shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants within each square.
  - Bags labeled clearly, properly dried if needed, sealed, and dispatched to ITE Merlewood; options for despatch depend on research station reporting.

- Freshwater sampling (section 10)
  - Coordinated with IFE activity; field surveyors align timing with IFE staff to avoid conflicts and ensure data integration.

- Data collection, forms, and governance
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) used to consolidate square data, maps, and codes; promotes consistent data capture and post-survey analysis.
  - Emphasis on standardized observer procedures to reduce inter-observer variance; clear documentation of updates to codes and crosswalks between CS1990 and CS2000.
  - Data management and open data considerations: outputs include maps, charts, and policy-relevant reports; data should be quality-assured, documented, and shared where possible, acknowledging governance constraints.

- GPS data collection (Annex 1)
  - Step-by-step GPS protocol for recording stationary and moving features; requires minimum four satellites and PDOP below 6 for reliable fixes.
  - File naming convention: each plot/feature gets a unique file name combining square number and plot/feature ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE).
  - Procedures for logging, data rate, and feature designation; steps to address obstructions and battery power; guidance on using the Magellan keypad.
  - Emphasis on moving and stationary position recording, with explicit steps to ensure reproducible plot relocation.

- Photography (section 11)
  - One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Include square and plot numbers on a marker board in each photo; compose to include significant reference features; minimize sky in frames.

- Procedures after survey (section 12)
  - Post-fieldwork data checks to ensure features are not omitted; prefer retaining original maps but allow re-transcription only if necessary due to damage.
  - Arrangements for returning FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

- Permissions, access, and field ethics
  - Landowner consent required; proactive engagement with landowners and stakeholders is essential; clear procedures for access refusals or changes in land use.

- Practical value for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates a rigorous, repeatable template for long-term environmental health monitoring across multiple domains (soil, vegetation, freshwater).
  - Illustrates integration of field data with policy-relevant frameworks (soil sustainability indices, deposition studies, biodiversity monitoring).
  - Highlights comprehensive data governance, metadata practices, and stakeholder coordination necessary for auditable, transparent monitoring programs.
