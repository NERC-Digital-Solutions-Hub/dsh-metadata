# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Provides standardized field data collection guidelines for the Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to produce current, comparable datasets for national land-use, biodiversity, and landscape monitoring.
- Supports government, NGOs, and researchers by ensuring data are current, well-documented, and comparable over time.
- Documents sampling types, data capture procedures, metadata practices, and post-survey workflows to ensure reproducibility and traceability.

## Sampling programme and scope
- Three sampling types:
  - Soil sampling (CS2000 field surveyors)
  - Calluna sampling (CS2000 field surveyors)
  - Freshwater biota sampling (accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Rationale highlights:
  - Addresses soil sustainability indices and baseline data needs for national assessment.
  - Calluna foliar nitrogen data linked to nitrogen deposition for potential regional assessments.
  - Freshwater sampling coordinated with IFE, aligned in timing with field survey work.

## Soil sampling (Section 10.2–10.6)
- In each 1 km square:
  - Five replicate soil samples collected for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiological status; sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.
- Sampling design and logistics:
  - Three cores per X-plot centre (center of the 2x2 m plot) using specified pipe sizes.
  - Shortest pipes used for fast-turnaround analyses posted by first-class mail; longer pipes handled via regional coordinators.
  - Clear instructions for packing, labeling, and dispatch to ensure sample integrity and traceability.
- Equipment and distribution:
  - Standard CS2000 equipment plus distributed items (pipes, envelopes, bags) labeled with square and plot identifiers.
- Detailed procedural notes:
  - Step-by-step centre-plot sampling procedure, including exact locating points, depth, handling of soil, and post-sample packaging.
- Despatching process:
  - Envelopes containing soil samples shipped to ITE Merlewood; procedure ensures timely forwarding and receipt documentation.

## Calluna sampling (Section 10.8–10.10)
- Objectives:
  - Collect current-year growth (CYG) Calluna vulgaris shoots to analyze foliar nitrogen relative to deposition data.
- Collection protocol in each square:
  - Identify CYG growth, collect 30–50 g fresh weight from multiple plants, and place into provided bags.
  - Allow samples to dry if needed; seal and label properly; post to ITE Merlewood or deliver via a research station with receipt claimed on T&S forms.

## Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11)
- Coordination:
  - Specially trained IFE field personnel may work in CS2000 squares concurrently with survey teams; CS coordinators liaise with IFE to schedule suitably.

## Photography (Section 11)
- Equipment:
  - Cameras provided to each team; initial supply of film; additional film purchasable and claimable.
- Coverage and composition:
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to document general appearance and position relative to landmarks.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within view for repeat visits.
  - Each photo must clearly show square and plot numbers on a visible board at the plot edge; frame should balance plot area and reference features.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- Data integrity checks:
  - Post-field-checks to ensure no feature omissions; avoid transcription from maps unless necessary (only in damage/spoilage scenarios).
- Logistics:
  - Arrange prompt transportation of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
- GPS readiness:
  - Ensure battery power, satellite lock (minimum four satellites; PDOP ideally < 6 for accuracy).
- Position recording:
  - Stationary positions: record at each plot center; moving positions for new features or boundaries.
- File naming and data management:
  - Each plot/feature requires a unique file name combining square number and plot/feature identifier (e.g., 501X4.PSE or 501F1.MOB).
- Logging workflow:
  - Step-by-step instructions for starting, recording, and stopping GPS logging; guidance on data rates and handling obstructions.
- Power and calibration:
  - Battery charging, almanac updates, PDOP considerations, and antenna placement guidance to mitigate signal obstruction.

## Flora, mosses, and lichens coding (embedded within data capture)
- The document includes an extensive, standardized coding scheme mapping plant species and groups to numeric codes (e.g., Athy fil, Dryo fil, etc.) to support consistent data entry and compatibility with CS1990/CS2000 datasets.
- Includes dedicated sections for mosses/lichens with cross-referenced codes and placeholders for unmapped taxa, emphasizing structured data capture and provenance.

## Data governance and stewardship implications (Data Stewards)
- Standardization and reproducibility:
  - Unified procedures for soil, Calluna, and freshwater sampling, along with photography and GPS data, enable consistent data collection across teams and time.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Clear documentation of sample types, collection methods, packaging, dispatch, and GPS data handling supports traceability and long-term data use.
  - Use of FABs, plot identifiers, and comprehensive labeling enhances data discoverability and re-use.
- Interoperability and time-series integrity:
  - Alignment with prior CS1990 and subsequent CS2000 protocols facilitates robust time-series analyses and cross-survey comparability.
- Quality control and training:
  - Emphasis on correct sampling methods, labeling, and post-survey checks underpins data quality and reduces observer bias.
- Governance of access and data flow:
  - Explicit procedures for sample dispatch to external institutes and coordination between organizations (ITE Merlewood, IFE) illustrate governance considerations for data sharing and material custody.
- Data volume and management:
  - The multi-component workflow (soil, Calluna, freshwater, GPS, photography) requires robust versioning, storage, and traceability mechanisms to manage complex, multi-layer datasets.

## Key challenges and considerations
- Coordinating multiple sampling types across large geographic areas with consistent adherence to evolving standards.
- Maintaining data provenance amid shipments, external lab processing, and cross-institution collaboration.
- Managing large volumes of imagery, GPS logs, and comprehensive flora/mosses/lichens coding in a way that preserves linkages to plot-level data.
- Ensuring timely delivery of biological samples to laboratories to preserve sample integrity and analysis viability.
