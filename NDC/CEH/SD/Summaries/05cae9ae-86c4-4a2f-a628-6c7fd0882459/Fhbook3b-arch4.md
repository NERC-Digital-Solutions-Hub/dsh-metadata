# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Overview
  - National field survey to update land use, land cover, and vegetation data across Britain; builds on CS1990/CS1978 lineage; data support policy frameworks (biodiversity, sustainable development, agri-environment schemes) and remote sensing integration.

- Aims, time-series emphasis, and scope
  - Emphasizes monitoring change over time to identify trends and processes in the countryside.
  - 1998 CS2000 plan targeted 568 squares (including upland additions) to enhance detail, collaboration, and satellite data linkage to create a Britain-wide land cover map with ground-truthing across scales.

- Sampling framework and design
  - CS1990: 508 1-km squares sampled with country-level estimates by class; random allocation across ITE Land Classes.
  - CS2000 refinements:
    - Re-survey all 508 CS1990 squares (with replacements as needed); split class definitions by country units; add squares to ensure representation; up to 30 upland new squares.
    - Total of 568 squares; standardized procedures to reduce observer variation and improve time-series reliability.

- Data collection framework (three core elements)
  - Mapping
    - Annotated OS 1:10,000 maps; focus on change detection and broad habitat reporting; parcel-based feature linkage with Parcel Numbers; rules for documenting changes and mosaics.
  - Plots
    - Vegetation sampling via predefined plots (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V) with fixed sizes; relocation across survey rounds.
  - Sampling
    - Occurrence and abundance data using standardized forms; core 200-species list plus additional species; supports cross-theme data integration.

- Mapping methodology and data structure
  - Change mapping for old squares vs. full stock mapping for new squares.
  - Broad Habitat framework supports national biodiversity monitoring; upland/montane habitats have specific conventions.
  - Parcel-centric data architecture links each feature to Parcel Numbers; changes generate new parcel codes as needed; supports data provenance and traceability.

- Field data recording and FABs (Field Assessment Booklets)
  - FAB combines data sheets and maps; requires neat, legible entries to ensure robust time-series analysis.
  - Sections include ownership, farmer information, physiography, vegetation, woodland, boundaries, buildings, recreation, and universal codes.
  - Clear procedures for permissions, refusals, partial access, or relocation to maintain data integrity.

- Plot types and layouts
  - X plots: five large plots per square in representative habitats; relocation via markers; nested subplots for detailed species cover.
  - Y plots: five 2m x 2m plots for baselines in natural/semi-natural habitats.
  - U plots: up to 10 plots in unenclosed upland habitats.
  - B plots: five 200 m2 plots at field boundaries; monitor boundaries and hedgerows.
  - A plots: 100 x 1 m arable margin plots for weed vegetation.
  - H plots: hedgerow plots (new in 1998) along hedgerows.
  - D plots: hedgerow diversity plots to monitor woody species.
  - S/W plots: streamside/waterside plots along watercourses.
  - R/V plots: roadside/verge plots along roadsides.
  - Relocation rules to maintain continuity when features shift or disappear.

- Vegetation data collection and species
  - Standardized data sheets with a core top-200 species list; full vascular plant records; bryophytes/lichens limited to a defined list.
  - Emphasis on careful ID, appropriate cover categories, and accurate plot-level taxonomy, with attention to crops, trees, hedgerows, and semi-natural habitats.

- Species, habitats, and coding
  - Detailed habitat and species codes linked to primary habitat classifications; cross-references CS1990 primary codes with CS2000 mappings; consistent boundary and hedge coding to capture changes.

- GPS data and Annex
  - Annex 1 covers collecting GPS data to relocate plots and improve spatial precision, especially in upland and new squares.

- Permissions, safety, and logistics
  - Landowner consent required; advance letters and on-site verification; procedures for refusals, partial access, or relocation; focus on data integrity and minimizing wasted effort.

- Quality control and standardization
  - Standard Field Handbook reduces observer variation; emphasizes training and ongoing quality control to ensure robust time-series data.

- Outputs and impact
  - CS2000 data inform government, NGOs, and partners; support biodiversity indicators, sustainable development goals, and policy implementations; designed for integration with remote sensing and ground-truthing to create a national land cover map.

- Practical takeaways for data leaders
  - Provides a rigorous, standardized framework for large-scale environmental data collection with explicit change-detection methodologies and cross-theme data linkage (maps, plots, FABs).
  - Prioritizes time-series continuity, data provenance, and structured governance through FABs, parcel coding, and metadata.
  - Aligns field observations with policy-relevant classifications (Broad Habitats, biodiversity indicators), enabling monitoring across sectors and networks.

- Section 10 – Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
  - Soil sampling: five replicate samples per 1 km square (CS2000), three cores per X-plot across five sampling locations; analyses include pH, organic matter, heavy metals; samples sent to ITE Merlewood; rapid processing for certain cores.
  - Calluna sampling: foliar nitrogen sampling within Calluna vulgaris; current-year growth shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) collected, bagged, and dispatched to ITE Merlewood; timing coordinated with research stations.
  - Freshwater sampling: coordinated with Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; sampling conducted in parallel with field teams.
  - Equipment and distribution: standardized to regional coordinators; field teams receive specific packaging and envelopes to ship samples promptly; post-dispatch procedures described.

- Section 11 – Photography
  - One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features; include square/plot numbers on a visible board; aim for clear, land-marked compositions.

- Section 12 – Procedures after survey
  - Post-field checks to ensure no features are omitted; data can be transposed only if necessary; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

- Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data
  - Step-by-step guidance for GPS readiness, stationary vs moving feature logging, file naming conventions (e.g., 501X4.PSE), data rate settings, and handling PDOP/satellite considerations; tips for improving GPS reception in obstructed environments.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Detailed list of field equipment, packaging, and handling instructions to ensure standardized sample collection and data capture across all squares.
