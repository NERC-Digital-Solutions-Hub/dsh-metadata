# Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire

## Overview
- Dataset of channel cross-section surveys for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory.
- Survey method: Trimble R8 TM dGPS.
- Westbrook Channel surveyed in May 2013; River Lambourn surveyed in November 2013.
- Supports hydrological and ecological analysis; related to climate change impacts and groundwater/surface-water interaction studies.
- Related publications: House et al. (2015, 2016); Marsh & Hannaford (2008); Rodwell (1991).

## Site description
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire, UK (51.445° N, 1.384° W).
- Features: 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland; Westbrook Channel divides the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment: approximately 162 km²; river drains chalk from the Berkshire Downs; baseflow index ~0.96; mean discharge ~1.73 m³ s⁻¹ at Shaw (5 km downstream).
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to brook lamprey (Lampetra planeri), bullhead (Cottus gobio), and Desmoulin’s whorl snail (Vertigo moulinsiana); EU Habitat Directive vegetation designations for associated aquatic and riparian habitats.

## Data collection and methods
- Cross-sections: 44 locations along the Westbrook Channel; 42 locations along the River Lambourn (Figure 1 in the dataset).
- Timeframe: Westbrook in May 2013; River Lambourn in November 2013.
- Access: locations restricted by dense vegetation; line of sight limitations affected surveying.
- Bankfull stage definition: identified as an abrupt change in slope, dominant bench level, and, if applicable, the lower limit of riparian vegetation.
- Equipment: Trimble R8 TM dual-frequency survey-grade dGPS.

## Data outputs and usability
- primary outputs are channel cross-section measurements at the specified locations for both channels.
- Data are suitable for analyses of channel morphology, hydrological modeling, and integration into broader datasets on riparian wetlands and chalk valley hydrology.
- Outputs support further modelling (including groundwater/surface-water interactions) and comparisons with related studies.
