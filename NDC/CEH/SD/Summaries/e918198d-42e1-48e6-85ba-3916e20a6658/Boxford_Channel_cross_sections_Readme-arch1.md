Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford, Berkshire

## Overview
- Dataset of channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire.
- Surveys conducted with Trimble R8 TM dGPS in May 2013 (Westbrook Channel) and November 2013 (River Lambourn).
- Related publications: House et al. 2015; House et al. 2016.

## Site description
- CEH Observatory comprises a 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland.
- Westbrook Channel divides the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment area at the observatory ~162 km²; large baseflow component.
- Nearest gauging station Shaw (5 km downstream): baseflow index ~0.96; mean discharge ~1.73 m³ s⁻¹.
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to brook lamprey, bullhead, and Desmoulin's whorl snail.
- EU Habitat Directive vegetation: river supports Ranunculion fluitantis and Callitricho-Batrachion vegetation; wetland supports MG8 vegetation (Cynosurus cristatus - Caltha palustris) per UK NVC (Rodwell, 1991).

## Data collection
- Cross-sections: 44 locations along the Westbrook Channel; 42 along the River Lambourn (Figure 1).
- Access restricted by dense vegetation; line-of-sight limitations during surveying.
- Bankfull stage defined as an abrupt change in slope, dominant bench level, and the lower limit of riparian vegetation where applicable.

## Data provenance and interpretation
- Data collected via high-accuracy surveying (Trimble R8 TM dGPS).
- Cross-sections provide spatial structure of channel geometry at fixed locations along a 600 m reach and adjacent wetland context.
- Positions and scales suitable for analyses of channel morphology, bankfull geometry, and potential hydrological interactions with the riparian wetland.

## Relevance for analysis and modelling
- Supports modelling groundwater–surface-water interaction in chalk valley riparian wetlands.
- Useful for assessing climate-change impacts on chalk valley riparian systems.
- Integrates with broader hydrological and ecological studies cited in House et al. (2015, 2016) and Marsh & Hannaford (2008).
