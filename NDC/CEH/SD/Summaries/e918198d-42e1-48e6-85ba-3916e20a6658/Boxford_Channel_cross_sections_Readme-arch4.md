# Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel

## Introduction
- Dataset containing channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire, UK.
- Surveys conducted with Trimble R8 TM dGPS in May 2013 (Westbrook) and November 2013 (River Lambourn).

## Site description
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire (approx. 51.445°N, 1.384°W); 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland.
- Westbrook Channel divides the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment area: ~162 km²; baseflow-dominated Chalk valley river.
- Gauging context: Shaw gauging station ~5 km downstream; baseflow index ~0.96; mean discharge ~1.73 m³ s⁻¹.
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) for brook lamprey, bullhead, and Desmoulin's whorl snail; EU Habitat Directive vegetation associations (MG8) in the wetland.
- Figure reference: Locations for River Lambourn (L) and Westbrook (W) channel cross-sections.

## Data collection
- Cross-sections: 44 along the Westbrook, 42 along the River Lambourn.
- Survey conditions: Access restricted by dense vegetation; line-of-sight constraints noted.
- Bankfull stage definition: Abrupt change in slope, dominant bench level, and/or lower limit of riparian vegetation.
