# This dataset contains channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford, Berkshire.

## Overview
- Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire.
- Surveys conducted using Trimble R8 TM dGPS: Westbrook Channel in May 2013; River Lambourn in November 2013.
- Cross-sections surveyed at 44 locations along the Westbrook and 42 along the River Lambourn; access limitations due to dense vegetation.
- Related research papers: House et al. (2015, 2016).

## Site description
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire, UK (approximately 51.445°N, 1.384°W).
- Features: 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland; the Westbrook Channel divides the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment: Lambourn catchment ~162 km²; characterized by chalk geology with a large baseflow component.
- Hydrology: Nearest gauging station Shaw (5 km downstream) records baseflow index ~0.96 and mean discharge ~1.73 m³/s.
- Designations: SSSI and SAC due to brook lamprey, bullhead, and Desmoulin's whorl snail; also contains MG8 vegetation community of the UK NVC in the wetland.
- Figure reference: Locations for River Lambourn (L) and Westbrook (W) cross-sections.

## Data collection methods
- Instrumentation: Trimble R8 TM dGPS used for survey.
- Timing: Westbrook cross-sections collected in May 2013; River Lambourn cross-sections in November 2013.
- Scope: 44 cross-sections along Westbrook; 42 along River Lambourn.
- Practical notes: Access and line-of-sight constraints due to dense vegetation.
- Bankfull stage definition: Observed as an abrupt slope change, dominant bench level, and, if applicable, the lower edge of riparian vegetation.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Establishes a fixed-set of cross-sections at a biologically and legally sensitive site (SSSI/SAC) to monitor geomorphic change over time.
- Demonstrates integration of high-precision field measurements (dGPS) with ecological context (riparian wetlands and protected species).
- Highlights practical data collection considerations for monitoring frameworks, including access limitations, vegetation interference, and clear bankfull indicators.
- Supports data quality and transparency needs by documenting survey dates, locations, and methodology, facilitating reproducibility and longitudinal analyses.
- Provides foundational data for linking physical channel changes to broader environmental health questions, such as groundwater–surface-water interactions, climate-change impacts, and habitat assessments.
