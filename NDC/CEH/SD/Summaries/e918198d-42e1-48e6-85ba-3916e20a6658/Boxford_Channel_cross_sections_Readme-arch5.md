# Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford, Berkshire

## Overview
- Dataset of channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire.
- Cross-sections surveyed using Trimble R8 TM dGPS in May 2013 (Westbrook Channel) and November 2013 (River Lambourn).
- Related publications: House et al. (2015, 2016) and other cited sources.

## Site description
- CEH River Lambourn Observatory is a 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland.
- Westbrook Channel splits the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment area at the observatory ~162 km²; river drains chalk of the Berkshire Downs; predominantly baseflow-dominated system.
- Downstream gauging at Shaw (5 km away) indicates baseflow index 0.96 and mean discharge 1.73 m³ s⁻¹.
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to brook lamprey, bullhead, and Desmoulin’s whorl snail; vegetation habitats of note per UK NVC.

## Data collection and methods
- Channel cross-sections collected with Trimble R8 TM dGPS.
- Westbrook: 44 cross-sections; River Lambourn: 42 cross-sections.
- Survey locations constrained by restricted access and line-of-sight limitations from dense vegetation.
- Bankfull stage defined by an abrupt change in slope, dominant bench level, and the lower limit of riparian vegetation where applicable.

## Data quality and definitions
- Field definitions and survey approach anchored on visible hydraulic/geomorphic indicators (bankfull stage criteria).
- Location accuracy influenced by vegetation concealment and access constraints; cross-sections captured at predetermined locations along each channel.

## Data management and access
- Data are collected and managed by the CEH River Lambourn Observatory team.
- Metadata likely includes location coordinates, survey dates (May 2013 for Westbrook; November 2013 for River Lambourn), survey instrument, and bankfull criteria.
- Procedures described include data collection, potential updating, and integration with portal/catalogue systems for discoverability.
- Related data and publications provide context for use in hydrological and ecological analyses.

## Limitations and considerations for data users
- Access constraints and line-of-sight limitations during data collection may influence spatial coverage and precision at some cross-sections.
- Data reflect surveys from 2013; users should consider temporal relevance for dynamic riverine environments and corroborate with newer data if available.
- Definitions of bankfull stage are based on observable features and may require interpretation when applying to other studies.
