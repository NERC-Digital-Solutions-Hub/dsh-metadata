# Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) River Lambourn Observatory at Boxford, Berkshire

## What this dataset contains
- Channel cross-sections for the River Lambourn and Westbrook Channel at the CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Boxford, Berkshire.
- Surveys conducted with Trimble R8 TM dGPS for the Westbrook Channel (May 2013) and the River Lambourn (November 2013).
- Cross-sections surveyed at 44 locations along the Westbrook and 42 along the River Lambourn.

## Site description
- Location: CEH River Lambourn Observatory, Berkshire, UK (approx. 51.445°N, 1.384°W).
- Environment: 600 m reach of the River Lambourn with 10 hectares of riparian wetland; Westbrook Channel divides the wetland into northern and southern meadows.
- Catchment: Lambourn at the observatory ~162 km².
- Hydrology: Drains chalk of the Berkshire Downs; baseflow-dominated system (baseflow index 0.96; mean discharge 1.73 m³ s⁻¹ at Shaw downstream).
- Designations: Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Area of Conservation (SAC) due to brook lamprey, bullhead, and Desmoulin's whorl snail; EU Habitat Directive vegetation associations in the river and wetland (MG8 grassland in wetland).

## Data collection methods
- Survey tool: Trimble R8 TM dGPS.
- Timing: Westbrook Channel surveys in May 2013; River Lambourn surveys in November 2013.
- Coverage: 44 cross-sections along the Westbrook; 42 cross-sections along the River Lambourn.
- Access constraints: Dense vegetation limited bank access and line-of-sight during surveys.
- Bankfull definition: Observed as an abrupt change in slope, a dominant bench level, and the lower limit of riparian vegetation when applicable.
