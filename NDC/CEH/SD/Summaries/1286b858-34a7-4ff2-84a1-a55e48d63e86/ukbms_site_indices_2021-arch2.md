# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and organizers: The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with volunteers contributing data.
- Value proposition for analysis: Long-running, site-based monitoring provides annual data on butterfly population status to understand changes and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Data collection and sampling framework

- Sampling components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (up to 26 per year), around 2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August), ~8,050 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: Single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focused on specific species.
- Data scope: Since 1976, with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; data from all sampling methods are analyzed together.

## Nature of data and trend analysis

- Data product: Abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Index construction:
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of population but vary by species detectability.
  - Collated species indices produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting adjustment by the proportion of the flight period surveyed for each site/year.
  - Uses all counts within a season (Pollard, WCBS, targeted surveys) to model seasonal counts and extrapolate to account for recording gaps; observed data have greater influence due to weighting.
- Documentation: Methods and updates referenced (GAI 2016; species checklists through 2020).

## Quality control

- Field recording: Data captured on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Validation workflow:
  - Automatic checks in data entry systems to flag errors (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records).
  - Regional coordinators validate, review questionable records, and monitor throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual checks address distribution range, flight period, first-time site records, extreme or unusual abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and coordination with recorders/coordinators.

## Key challenges for analysts

- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating UKBMS data with other relevant data sources (beyond single-use applications).
- Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to produce final outputs for transparency and reuse.
