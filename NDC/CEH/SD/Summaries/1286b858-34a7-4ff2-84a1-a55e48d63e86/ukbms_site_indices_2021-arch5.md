# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers to collect annual, site-based butterfly population data.
- Purpose: track population status and biodiversity trends across the UK since 1976; data inform policy and conservation decisions.
- Sampling framework includes standard transects (Pollard walks), wider countryside transects (WCBS), and targeted surveys for specific species.

## Data collection and structure
- Standard transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 times/year) across ~2000 sites.
- WCBS: stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits/year, focusing on common habitats (farmland); ~8050 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts, or other methods for particular species.
- All data types are analyzed together to produce population trends.

## Data quality and governance
- Data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker before uploading to a central database.
- Quality checks occur at multiple stages: automatic in-entry checks, regional transect coordinators’ reviews, and automated/manual validation for out-of-range, out-of-distribution, atypical flight periods, or first-time site records.
- Corrections and edits are made to maintain dataset integrity, with ongoing queries and coordination with recorders.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a stable proportion of butterflies at each site; species detectability may vary.
- Overall species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weightings based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
- Counts from all methods contribute to seasonal pattern estimates, enabling extrapolation to account for recording gaps while giving more weight to observed data.

## Details of this data download
- Provides annual abundance indices for each species at each UK site with sufficient data, covering 1976–2021.
- Format: CSV (.csv).
- Key columns: SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (scientific name), COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
- Special value: -2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an accurate site index for that species/site/year.

## Licence and attribution
- Data available under the Open Government Licence (OGL).
- Users must cite the dataset with its DOI in publications, and include the attribution: Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © copyright and database right from Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
