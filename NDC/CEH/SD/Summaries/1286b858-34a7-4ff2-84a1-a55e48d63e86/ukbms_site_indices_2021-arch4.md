# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A collaborative, funded program by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BT O), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Relies on volunteer data to track annual butterfly population status across the UK since 1976.
- Generates a large, long-running dataset with over 2,500 actively recorded sites annually; data are analyzed collectively across sampling methods.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band; 26 counts per year (April–September); ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); ~8,050 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts using various methods.
- Data are collected via standard forms and entered online or with bespoke software (Transect Walker).

## Nature of Data and Analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; some species are easier to detect than others.
- Species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.

## Quality Control
- Multi-layer validation from field forms to online entry and automated checks (e.g., improbable counts, out-of-period records).
- Regional transect coordinators validate and query questionable records; further automated/manual validation targets distribution range, flight period alignment, new site records, and anomalous counts.
- Corrections and edits are applied to ensure data integrity before inclusion in the UKBMS dataset.

## Data Download Details
- This download provides annual abundance indices for each species at each site with sufficient data from 1976–2021, in CSV format.
- Key columns:
  - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (scientific name), COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX.
  - -2 indicates insufficient data to calculate an index for that site/year/species.
- Taxonomic references align with Agassiz et al. up to 2020.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates governance of a long-running, multi-organizational data system with clear data lineage, standards, and quality controls.
- Highlights data discoverability, standardized metadata, and licensing that enable reuse for policy and research.
- Illustrates handling of data gaps, varying data density, and methods to combine heterogeneous data into coherent indices.
- Emphasizes collaboration, attribution, and opportunities for cross-network data collaboration and co-authorship.
