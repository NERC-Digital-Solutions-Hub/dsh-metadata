# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Goal and context
  - Provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy, status, and trend assessments.
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on a large network of volunteers; data have been collected since 1976 with over 2,500 active sites annually.

- Sampling framework and data sources
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide belt, weekly counts from April to September, ~26 counts/year at ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (minimum two in July/August), sample ~8,050 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
  - All data types are analyzed together to produce comprehensive species abundance insights.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site-level indices are combined into species-level (collated) indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting for the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
  - The approach uses all counts from the season to model patterns and extrapolate for gaps, with weighting favoring observed data over extrapolated data.

- Quality control and governance
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker software.
  - Automated checks flag unusual values and timing inconsistencies; regional transect coordinators validate data and monitor records throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation targets records outside known distributions, outside flight periods, first-time site records, and abnormal abundances.
  - Corrections and edits to the primary UKBMS dataset are performed as part of validation.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides annual site- and species-specific abundance indices for 1976–2021 in a CSV file.
  - Columns include:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: regional country for the collated index
    - SPECIES CODE and SPECIES: taxonomic identifiers and scientific names
    - COMMON NAME: common names
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the site and year (with -2 indicating insufficient data to compute an index)
