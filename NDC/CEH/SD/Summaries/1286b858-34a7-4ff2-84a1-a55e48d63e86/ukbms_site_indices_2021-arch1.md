# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Built on volunteer contributions; in operation since 1976 with over 2,500 active sites annually.
  - Data support understanding of butterfly population changes and inform biodiversity status and policy questions.

- Data collection methods (sampling framework)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, recording all butterflies in a 5 m band weekly (April–September), ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August), ~8,050 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, other methods (e.g., Timed Counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on particular species.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of the population; detectability varies by species.
  - Collated species indices computed with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-year weighting based on flight-period coverage.
  - All seasonal counts (from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate and can correct entries; additional automated/manual validation checks target range, flight period, first-time site records, and abnormal abundances.
  - Edits to the primary UKBMS dataset are made following validation discussions.

- Details of the data download
  - Provides annual abundance indices for each species at each site with sufficient data from 1976–2021.
  - Delivered as a CSV file with columns:
    - SITE CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, SITE INDEX
  - SITE INDEX is -2 when a site-year lacks sufficient data to calculate an accurate index.
  - Taxonomic references for species names are included.

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse with few conditions.
  - Must cite the dataset with its DOI in any publications; include the specified attribution: "Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC."

- Offer of collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset use and interpretation; open to co-authorship and intellectual input in publications, conferences, or posters.
