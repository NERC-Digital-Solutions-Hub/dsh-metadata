# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, making it a long-running, national effort to track butterfly populations since 1976.
- Approximately 2,500 actively recorded sites per year support annual population status data used for biodiversity policy questions.

- Data collection framework comprises three components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (ideally 26 per year) from early April to late September; ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); ~8,050 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species.

- Nature of data and trend analysis:
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
  - Global species indices are produced with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site/year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed; combines counts from all methods to estimate seasonal patterns and adjust for data gaps.

- Quality control and data validation:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records).
  - Regional transect coordinators review records; further automated/manual validation checks may query records outside known ranges or with unusual patterns; necessary edits are applied to the main dataset.

- Details of the data download:
  - Provides annual site-species abundance indices for 1976–2021, in a CSV file.
  - Key columns include:
    - SITE CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: region used to create the regional collated index
    - SPECIES CODE: unique species identifier
    - SPECIES: scientific name
    - COMMON NAME: vernacular name
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year; -2 indicates insufficient monitoring within the flight period to compute an index
