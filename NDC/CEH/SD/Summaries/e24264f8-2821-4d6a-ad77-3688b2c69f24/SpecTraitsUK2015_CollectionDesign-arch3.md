# Field site and sampling

- Field context and sites
  - Leaves collected from trees on deep alluvial soils and shallow chalk soils near Mickleham, Surrey, UK.
  - Alluvial site: river Mole loamy soil (deep, several metres). Chalk site: steep south-facing escarpment with shallow topsoil over solid chalk (rendzina-like); chalk soil alkaline (pH 7.9 ± 1.0), alluvial near neutral (pH 6.7 ± 0.2).
  - Fourteen species continuous across sites are not stated; six species common to both sites: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus excelsior, Sambucus nigra.

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - Leaves collected from 66 trees (two fully sunlit branches per tree).
  - For each branch: ten mature leaves selected; three samples of 15 leaf disks (6 mm corer) per leaf, wrapped and frozen for later analysis.
  - Field processing: leaf area measured from fixed-height photographs against white background; leaves weighed to determine hydrated mass; dried at 70 °C for ≥72 h to obtain dry mass; leaf mass per area (LMA) and leaf water content computed.

- Chemical trait assays (laboratory)
  - Elemental composition (B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn): ashed leaves digested in nitric acid; analyzed by ICP-MS.
  - Nitrogen and carbon concentrations and isotopes: determined with elemental analyzer linked to isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).
  - Carbon fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and soluble carbon via sequential acid digestion (Van Soest) using Ankom fiber analyzer; results presented on ash-free dry mass basis.
  - Pigments: chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, total carotenoids, and anthocyanins measured from methanol/water leaf disk extracts by spectrophotometry; wavelengths for chlorophylls (470, 649, 665 nm) and anthocyanins (530, 650 nm); corrections for chlorophyll contamination per published methods.
  - Photosynthetic performance: maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm) estimated from measurements of Fm and Fo with PAM fluorometer.
  - Phenolics: total phenolic content via Folin-Ciocalteau assay (absorbance at 760 nm) with tannic acid equivalents; water blank used.

- Leaf and canopy spectroscopy
  - Ten leaves per branch laid on a matt black surface; reflectance measured from 400–2500 nm using FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer.
  - Measurement setup: contact probe mounted with a clamp to minimize light leakage; abaxial leaf surface oriented toward the probe.
  - Calibration and data handling: Spectralon white reference used for calibration every 5 samples; mean reflectance across the 10 leaf measurements per branch used in analyses.

- Data quality, standardization, and governance implications for monitoring
  - Uses standardized, published protocols (Carnegie Airborne Observatory methods; Van Soest fractionation; published pigment and PSII methods) to enable comparability across sites and studies.
  - Detailed instrumentation and measurement protocols (ICP-MS, IRMS, spectrophotometry, PAM fluorometry, FieldSpec) support reproducibility and traceability.
  - Data integrity requires careful sample handling (lab processing within 2 hours), consistent measurement conditions, and documentation of calibration references; these practices align with governance needs for metadata, QA/QC, and data sharing in monitoring frameworks.
