# Field site and sampling

- Study context and scope
  - Leaves collected from trees on two soil types: deep alluvial loam and shallow chalk soils near Mickleham, Surrey, UK (lat 51°16'N, lon 0°19'W).
  - Soil differences: chalk soils are alkaline (pH ~7.9 ± 1.0), alluvial soils near neutral (pH ~6.7 ± 0.2); nutrient availability expected to differ (e.g., phosphorus less available in chalk).
  - 66 trees across six species; six species are common to both sites: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus excelsior, Sambucus nigra.
  - Sampling design: two fully sunlit branches per tree; 10 mature leaves per branch selected; 3 samples of 15 leaf disks per leaf collected for chemical analyses; samples transported to laboratory within two hours.

- Field measurements and initial processing
  - Leaf area measured from fixed-height photographs against a white background using imageJ.
  - Hydrated mass measured; leaves dried at 70 °C for ≥72 h to obtain dry mass.
  - Leaf mass per area (LMA) calculated as dry mass per unit fresh leaf area.
  - Leaf water content computed as (fresh weight − dry weight) / fresh weight.

- Chemical trait assays (22 traits)
  - Protocols adapted from the Carnegie Airborne Observatory.
  - Element concentrations (B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn): ashing → nitric acid digest → ICP-MS.
  - Nitrogen and carbon concentrations and stable isotopes: elemental analyzer + continuous-flow IRMS.
  - Carbon fractions (hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, soluble carbon): sequential acid digestion (Van Soest 1994) via Ankom fiber analyzer; reported on an ash-free dry mass basis.
  - Photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll a and b, anthocyanins, total carotenoids by spectrophotometry; specific wavelengths and published equations (Lichtenthaler 1987; Giusti et al. 1999; corrected per Sims & Gamon 2002).
  - Maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm): measured with PAM fluorometer (Fm and Fo) to calculate yield in the absence of actinic light (Genty et al. 1989).
  - Total phenolics: Folin-Ciocalteau method (absorbance at 760 nm) with tannic acid equivalents; water as blank (Davey et al. 2007).

- Leaf and canopy spectroscopy (spectral data collection)
  - Remaining leaves: 10 per branch, random selection, undamaged; laid flat on matt black surface.
  - Reflectance measured from 400–2500 nm using FieldSpec 4 (ASD).
  - Measurement setup: contact probe pressed to leaf surface; abaxial surface oriented toward probe.
  - Calibration: Spectralon white reference every 5 samples.
  - Replication: mean reflectance per branch calculated from 10 measurements.

- Data quality and references
  - Replicates and standardization ensure comparability across leaves, branches, and trees.
  - Calibration and correction steps aligned with established methods (e.g., Lichtenhaler 1987; Genty et al. 1989; Sims & Gamon 2002; Van Soest 1994; Davey et al. 2007).
