# Field site and sampling

- Aim context: Use standardised data to monitor environmental condition, enabling scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Study scope: Leaves from trees across two soil types, with comprehensive leaf-level chemistry and spectral measurements to support environmental monitoring datasets.

## Study sites and soils

- Location: Near Mickleham, Surrey, UK (latitude 51°16'N, longitude 0°19'W).
- Soils:
  - Alluvial site: deep loam along the River Mole banks; near-neutral pH ~6.7 ± 0.2 (n = 10).
  - Chalk site: steep south-facing escarpment; thin topsoil over solid chalk; alkaline pH ~7.9 ± 1.0 (n = 10).
- Nutrient context: Chalk soil tends to make phosphorus less available; deeper loamy alluvial soil likely provides greater nutrient availability to plants.
- Tree sampling: 66 trees representing six species; six species present at both sites: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus excelsior, Sambucus nigra.
  
## Tree and leaf sampling design

- Branch selection: two fully sunlit branches per tree.
- Leaf sampling: ten mature leaves per branch.
- Leaf disks: three samples of 15 leaf disks per branch (6 mm corer); disks wrapped and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later analysis.
- Sample handling: branches transported to the lab and processed within two hours.
- Imaging and mass: leaf area measured from fixed-height photos against a white background using ImageJ; leaves weighed when hydrated, then dried at 70°C for at least 72 hours to obtain dry mass.
- Derived leaf traits: leaf mass per area (LMA) = dry mass per unit fresh area; leaf water content = (fresh weight − dry weight) / fresh weight.
- Additional trait set: 22 leaf chemical traits measured (see below).

## Chemical assays (laboratory methods)

- Sample preparation: oven-dried leaves ground; elements measured by ashing, nitric acid digestion, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn.
- Carbon and nitrogen: concentrations measured with elemental analyzer and isotope ratio mass spectrometry to obtain C and N concentrations and stable isotopes.
- Carbon fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and soluble carbon quantified by sequential digestion (Van Soest method) using an Ankom fiber analyzer; reported on ash-free dry mass basis.
- Photosynthetic pigments: chlorophyll a and b, total carotenoids; anthocyanins measured from methanol/water leaf extracts; absorbance at 470, 649, 665 nm for greens; 530 and 650 nm for anthocyanins; pigment concentrations calculated with published equations and chlorophyll contamination corrections.
- PSII efficiency: maximum PSII efficiency (Fv/Fm) derived from maximum (Fm) and dark-adapted fluorescence (Fo) using a PAM fluorometer.
- Phenolics: total phenolic concentration via Folin-Ciocalteau assay; absorbance at 760 nm; expressed as tannic acid equivalents with water as a blank.

## Leaf and canopy spectroscopy

- Sample preparation: remaining leaves laid flat on a matt black surface; 10 leaves per branch selected randomly, avoiding damaged or very young leaves.
- Spectral measurements: reflectance across 400–2500 nm using FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer; contact probe clamp applied firmly to ensure light does not escape.
- Measurement protocol: readings taken at the mid-point between the main vein and leaf edge, on the abaxial surface facing the probe.
- Calibration and replication: Spectralon white reference used for calibration every 5 samples; the mean reflectance of the 10 measurements per branch used in analyses.
