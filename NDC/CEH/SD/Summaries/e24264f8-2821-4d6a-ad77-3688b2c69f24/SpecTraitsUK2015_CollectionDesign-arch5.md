# Field site and sampling

- Location and soils: leaves collected near Mickleham, Surrey, UK (latitude 51°16′N, longitude 0°19′W); two soil types noted—deep alluvial loam along the river Mole and shallow chalk soils on a steep south-facing escarpment; chalk soil pH 7.9 ± 1.0 (n=10), alluvial soil pH 6.7 ± 0.2 (n=10).
- Sampling design: 66 trees representing six species; six species common to both sites.
- Branch and leaf collection: two fully sunlit branches per tree; from each branch, ten mature leaves were selected; three samples of 15 leaf disks were cored from these leaves using a 6 mm punch, wrapped in foil, and frozen in liquid N for later analyses.
- Leaf measurements and mass: leaf area measured from fixed-height photographs against a white background using ImageJ; scanned leaves weighed to obtain hydrated mass, then dried at 70 °C for ≥72 h to obtain dry mass; leaf mass per area (LMA) calculated as dry mass per unit fresh leaf area; leaf water content computed as (fresh weight − dry weight) / fresh weight.
- Taxa and sampling detail: leaves collected from 66 trees across six species; leaves sampled from both sunlit branches and multiple leaves per branch to ensure representation.

## Chemical assays

- Protocol basis: methods adapted from Carnegie Airborne Observatory protocols.
- Elemental composition: B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn determined by ashing, nitric acid digestion, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
- Nitrogen and carbon: N and C concentrations measured with an elemental analyzer linked to a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer, providing stable isotopes of N and C.
- Carbon fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and soluble carbon quantified by sequential acid digestion (Van Soest method) using an Ankom fiber analyzer; reported on an ash-free dry mass basis.
- Pigments: chlorophyll a and b, anthocyanins, and total carotenoids assessed from methanol/water extracts via spectrophotometry; pigment concentrations calculated using published equations (Lichtenthaler 1987; Giusti et al. 1999; corrected for chlorophyll contamination per Sims & Gamon 2002).
- Photosystem II (PSII) efficiency: maximum PSII efficiency estimated from measurements of maximum fluorescence (Fm) and Fo (fluorescence yield without actinic light) using a PAM fluorometer; Fv/Fm derived per Genty et al. (1989).
- Phenolics: total phenolic concentration determined colorimetrically with Folin-Ciocalteau method (absorbance at 760 nm) and tannic acid equivalents; water used as a blank (per Davey et al. 2007).

## Leaf and canopy spectroscopy

- Sample selection: 10 leaves per branch chosen at random, avoiding damaged, soft, or very young leaves.
- Measurements: leaves laid on a matt black surface; reflectance measured across 400–2500 nm with FieldSpec 4 (ASD); probe mounted with a clamp to ensure no light leakage; readings calibrated against a Spectralon white reference every 5 samples.
- Replication and data usage: the mean reflectance value from the 10 measurements per branch used in subsequent analyses.
