# Field site and sampling

## Field site and sampling
- Location: Mickleham, Surrey, UK (51°16'N, 0°19'W); soils include deep alluvial loam near the River Mole and shallow chalk soils on a steep south-facing escarpment; chalk soils are alkaline (pH 7.9 ± 1.0, n=10) while alluvial soils are near neutral (pH 6.7 ± 0.2, n=10).
- Rationale: soil depth and chemistry influence nutrient availability; chalk sites may limit phosphorus availability.
- Plant material: leaves collected from 66 trees spanning six species; six species common to both sites: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus excelsior, Sambucus nigra.
- Sampling design: two fully sunlit branches per tree; branches transported to the lab within two hours.
- Leaf sampling: for each branch, ten mature leaves selected; three samples of 15 leaf disks were taken with a 6 mm corer, wrapped in foil, and frozen in liquid N for later analyses.
- Leaf measurements: leaf area measured from fixed-height photos against a white background using ImageJ; leaves weighed when hydrated, then dried at 70°C for ≥72 h to derive dry mass and leaf mass per area (LMA); leaf water content computed as (fresh weight − dry weight) / fresh weight.
- Data collected: 22 additional leaf chemical traits measured (details below).
- Spectroscopy sampling: remaining leaves detached; 10 leaves per branch selected, avoiding damaged/young leaves; leaves laid on a matt black surface for canopy reflectance measurements.

## Chemical assays
- Protocol basis: adapted from Carnegie Airborne Observatory methods.
- Elemental analysis: oven-dried leaves ground; elements B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn measured by ashing, nitric acid digestion, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
- Carbon and nitrogen: C and N concentrations and their isotopes measured with elemental analyzer coupled to a continuous flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS).
- Carbon fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and soluble carbon determined by sequential acid digestion (Van Soest) using an Ankom fiber analyzer; results expressed on ash-free dry mass basis.
- Pigments: chlorophyll a and b, total carotenoids measured spectroscopically from methanolic extracts; wavelengths 470, 649, 665 nm; anthocyanins measured at 530 and 650 nm with chlorophyll contamination corrections.
- Photosynthetic efficiency: maximum PSII efficiency calculated from Fm and Fo using PAM fluorometry.
- Phenolics: total phenolics quantified by Folin-Ciocalteau assay at 760 nm and expressed as tannic acid equivalents.
- Output scope: comprehensive chemical trait profile including elemental concentrations, carbon/nitrogen metrics and isotopes, carbon fractions, pigments, PSII metrics, and phenolics.

## Leaf and canopy spectroscopy
- Sample size and placement: 10 leaves per branch, avoiding damaged or soft leaves.
- Measurement: reflectance from 400–2500 nm using FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer with a contact probe; probe mounted to clamp to ensure no light leakage; abaxial leaf surface oriented toward probe.
- Calibration: measurements calibrated against a Spectralon white reference every 5 samples.
- Data handling: the mean reflectance across the 10 measurements per branch used in analyses.

## Data management and quality considerations
- Replicates and standardization: use of multiple leaves per branch and multiple measurements to enhance reliability; standardized leaf processing and drying times.
- Provenance and metadata: precise location, soil type, pH, species, branch and leaf identifiers, sampling times, and instrument settings underpin data discoverability and reuse.
- Cross-domain integration: coordinated collection of chemical, isotopic, pigment, and spectral data enables integrated analyses across datasets and sites.
- Potential data issues: variability due to site differences, sample handling timing, and calibration drift; addressed via replicates, calibration references, and established protocols.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data stewardship: clearly defined sampling design, standardized protocols, and multi-modal data (chemical traits, isotopes, pigments, and spectroscopy) with associated metadata.
- Supports data discoverability and reuse: comprehensive provenance, instrument calibration details, and clear data formats (e.g., ash-free dry mass basis for carbon fractions; mean reflectance per branch).
- Highlights data integration opportunities: harmonized data across chemical and spectral domains across two contrasting soil sites; potential for cross-site collaboration and broader data-sharing through established community practices.
- Identifies data strategy considerations: maintaining data quality, managing diverse data types, and fostering coordination among teams to minimize duplication and strengthen communities of practice.
