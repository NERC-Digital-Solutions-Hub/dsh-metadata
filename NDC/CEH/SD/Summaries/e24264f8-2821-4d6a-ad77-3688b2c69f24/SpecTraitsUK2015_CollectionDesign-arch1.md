# Field site and sampling

- Field location and soil context: leaves collected from trees near Mickleham, Surrey, UK (latitude 51°16'N, longitude 0°19'W); two soil types observed—deep alluvial loam along the Mole river and shallow chalk soils on a south-facing escarpment with rendzina characteristics.
- Soil chemistry: chalk soils are alkaline (pH mean 7.9 ± 1.0, n=10); alluvial soils near neutral (pH 6.7 ± 0.2, n=10); greater depth on alluvial surfaces likely increases nutrient availability.
- Tree sampling: 66 trees across six species; six species common to both sites: Acer campestre, Acer pseudoplatanus, Corylus avellana, Crataegus monogyna, Fraxinus excelsior, Sambucus nigra.
- Branch and leaf collection: two fully sunlit branches per tree were collected, transported to the lab within two hours. For each branch, ten mature leaves were selected.
- Leaf discs and sample processing: three samples of 15 leaf disks were cored from the leaves using a 6 mm corer, wrapped, and frozen in liquid nitrogen for later chemical analyses.
- Leaf measurements: leaf area measured from fixed-height photos against a white background using ImageJ; leaves weighed to obtain hydrated mass, then dried at 70 °C for at least 72 h to determine dry mass; leaf mass per area (LMA) = dry mass per unit leaf area; leaf water content calculated as (fresh weight − dry weight) / fresh weight.
- Additional chemical traits: 22 leaf chemical traits measured (details described below).

# Chemical assays

- Protocol basis: methods adapted from Carnegie Airborne Observatory protocols.
- Elemental analysis: leaves ashed in a muffle furnace, digested in nitric acid, and analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry for B, Ca, K, Mg, Mn, P, Si, Fe, Zn.
- Carbon and nitrogen: N and C concentrations determined with an elemental analyser linked to a continuous-flow isotope ratio mass spectrometer, providing stable isotopes of N and C.
- Carbon fractions: hemicellulose, cellulose, lignin, and soluble carbon determined by sequential acid digestion (Van Soest, 1994) using an Ankom fiber analyzer; fractions presented on an ash-free dry mass basis.
- Pigments: chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, anthocyanins, and total carotenoids measured by spectroscopy of solutions from frozen leaf disks; absorbance at 470, 649, 665 nm for chlorophylls and carotenoids (per Lichtenthaler); anthocyanins assessed at 530 and 650 nm with corrections for chlorophyll contamination (per Giusti et al. 1999; Sims & Gamon 2002).
- Photosynthetic efficiency: maximum PSII efficiency calculated from Fm and Fo using a PAM fluorometer (per Genty et al. 1989).
- Phenolics: total phenolic concentration determined colorimetrically by Folin-Ciocalteau method (absorbance at 760 nm) and quantified as tannic acid equivalents with water as blank (per Davey et al. 2007).

# Leaf and canopy spectroscopy

- Sample preparation: remaining leaves detached; 10 leaves per branch selected at random, avoiding damaged or young leaves.
- Spectral measurement: leaves laid on a matt black surface; reflectance measured from 400–2500 nm with a FieldSpec 4 spectroradiometer; probe mounted on a clamp to ensure no light escape; readings calibrated against a Spectralon white reference every 5 samples.
- Measurement protocol: readings taken at the mid-point between the main vein and the leaf edge, roughly halfway between the petiole and leaf tip, with the abaxial surface toward the probe.
- Data handling: the mean reflectance value of the 10 measurements per branch used in statistical analyses.
