## Data quality and provenance
- Completeness: Full record for each site.
- Instrumentation and methods documented (gauge and data logger details).
- Metadata includes precise timestamps, units, and location coordinates for discoverability.

## Access and reuse
- Licensing and access constraints are not specified in the document; confirm prior to reuse.
- Clear provenance (authors and collection method) supports traceability and reproducibility.
- Suitable for cross-site comparisons, runoff analysis, and integration with broader environmental datasets.

## Relevance to Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data asset: acquisition method, high-resolution temporal data, geolocation, and structured metadata.
- Supports understanding data discovery, governance, and discoverability needs across networks.
- Provides a model for documenting data lineage, instrument details, and temporal coverage to enable reuse by policy colleagues and collaborators.
