# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) standing crop biomass on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Purpose: document standing crop biomass (kgDW m^-2) on salt marsh sites, using standardized quadrat measurements to understand biomass patterns across two contrasting regions.
- Sampling frame: winter and summer 2013 field campaign.
- Data format: Excel workbook containing detailed field observations and descriptive metadata.

## Study sites and context
- Essex (clay soils; saltmarsh):
  - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51°47'N, 0°52'E
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51°49'N, 0°58'E
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51°41'N, 0°56'E
  - Grazing context: hare grazing across sites; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese.
- Morecambe Bay (sandy soils; saltmarsh):
  - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54°10'N, 3°00'W
  - Warton Sands (WS) – 54°08'N, 2°48'W
  - West Plain (WP) – West Plain site; grazing described as light (less than ~2 sheep ha^-1)
  - Grazing context: intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 sheep ha^-1) with pink-footed geese grazing in winter.
- Representativeness: sites chosen to represent two contrasting soil types (clay vs sandy) and broader regional differences in inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.

## Methods and sampling design
- Field protocol: at each 1 m × 1 m quadrat, vegetation cut at ground level; samples collected in winter and summer.
- Biomass determination: dried at 60°C for 72 hours to derive standing crop biomass (Kg DW m^-2).
- Quadrat layout: 22 quadrats per site (Quadrat Number 1–22).
- Area used per measurement: original sampling area of 50 cm × 25 cm per quadrat; data scaled up for larger-area considerations (scaling method described in dataset metadata, details not fully specified).
- Seasonal coverage: Winter (W) and Summer (S) observations.

## Data structure and file format
- Primary file format: Excel workbook.

  - Site: CS (Cartmel Sands), WS (Warton Sands), WP (West Plain) for Morecambe; AH (Abbotts Hall), FW (Fingringhoe Wick), TM (Tillingham Marshes) for Essex
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM)
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22
  - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m to upper limit)
  - Biomass: Kg DW m^-2

## Data provenance and personnel
- Staff responsible for dataset: Hilary Ford.

## Notes and context
- The dataset provides a structured, multi-site biomass dataset intended to support broader analyses of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services within the CBESS framework.
- Contextual notes highlight how site selection and grazing regimes relate to biomass patterns across contrasting soil types and inundation regimes.
