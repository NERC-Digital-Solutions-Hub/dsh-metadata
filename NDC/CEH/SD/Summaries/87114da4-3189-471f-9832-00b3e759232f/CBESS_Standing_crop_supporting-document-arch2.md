# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) standing crop biomass on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset measuring standing crop biomass of coastal vegetation on saltmarsh sites.
- Focuses on above-ground biomass collected from small plots (50 cm × 25 cm) and dried to determine dry weight biomass.
- Part of Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) program.

## Location and site descriptions
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS). Also referenced as West Plain (WP) for one site.
- Coordinates provided for each site in degrees, minutes (approximate):
  - Essex: AH (~51.783°N, ~0.867°E), FW (~51.817°N, ~0.967°E), TM (~51.683°N, ~0.933°E)
  - Morecambe Bay: CS (~54.167°N, ~3.000°W), WS (~54.133°N, ~2.800°W)
- Habitat and soil contrasts:
  - Essex: clay soils; hare grazing; over-winter Brent goose grazing at AH and FW.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils; intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 ha⁻¹) with winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain experiences light grazing.

## Sampling and monitoring
- Monitoring occurred during Winter and Summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.
- Sampling unit is a 50 cm × 25 cm area within 1 m × 1 m quadrats.
- Observed variable: Biomass expressed as kg dry weight per square meter (kg DW m⁻²).
- Procedure: vegetation cut to ground level within each quadrat and dried at 60 °C for 72 hours to obtain standing crop biomass.

## Data collection, processing, and scale
- Data verified and cleaned from field measurements; standardised approach across sites and seasons.
- Measurements from small quadrats scaled up to larger scales for analyses/simulations (i.e., upscaling from 0.125 m² to broader estimates).

## Dataset structure and formats
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Dataset field details include:
  - Row Number (numeric; for sorting)
  - Season (Winter W or Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M or Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Habitat (Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A = 1 m, B = 1–10 m, C = 10–100 m, D = 100–upper limit)
  - Biomass (Kg DW m⁻²; numeric)
- The dataset uses a structured schema to support cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses.

## Data quality and access
- Calibration procedures: none indicated.
- Data checking procedures (quality control): not detailed in the description.
- Accessibility and storage: dataset described as an Excel workbook; aligns with standard monitoring outputs that can be stored in portals or repositories as part of ongoing environmental monitoring.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Provides a standardised metric of saltmarsh standing crop biomass across contrasting soil types and grazing regimes.
- Supports longitudinal assessment of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability by offering comparable biomass data across sites and seasons.
- Illustrates typical monitoring workflow: define sites, collect standardized quadrat data, apply drying protocol, compute biomass, scale up for analyses.
