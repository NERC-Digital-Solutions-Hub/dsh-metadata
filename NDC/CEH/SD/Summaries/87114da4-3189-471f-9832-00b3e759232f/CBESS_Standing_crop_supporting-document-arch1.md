# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) standing crop biomass on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- The dataset measures standing crop biomass of above-ground vegetation on salt marsh sites, using 50 cm × 25 cm quadrats cut to ground level and dried to determine biomass (kg DW m^-2).
- Staff: Hilary Ford.
- Monitoring period: Winter and summer 2013 as part of a general field campaign.

## Study Sites and Context

- Locations and sites:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates:
  - Essex: AH (51°47'N, 0°52'E), FW (51°49'N, 0°58'E), TM (51°41'N, 0°56'E).
  - Morecambe Bay: CS (54°10'N, 3°0'W), WS (54°8'N, 2°48'W).
- Habitat focus: Saltmarsh; additional habitats include Mudflat (MF).
- Soil types and landscape: Essex sites with clay soils; Morecambe Bay sites with sandy soils.
- Broader environmental differences: Essex and Morecambe Bay differed in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
- Grazing regimes:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; intensive grazing by Brent geese at AH and FW.
  - Morecambe Bay: intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 ha^-1) at CS and WS, pink-footed geese grazing in winter; West Plain (WP) lightly grazed (<2 sheep ha^-1).

## Sampling Protocol

- Quadrats: 1 m × 1 m per site; within each, a 50 cm × 25 cm area is sampled to estimate standing crop biomass.
- Seasonal sampling: Winter (W) and Summer (S) 2013.
- Biomass processing: Vegetation from each quadrat dried at 60°C for 72 hours to determine dry weight biomass (kg DW m^-2).
- Data scaling: Observations scaled up from the 50 cm × 25 cm area for larger-scale considerations and simulations.

## Data Structure and Variables

- File format: Excel workbook.
- Key fields (Dataset Field Descriptions):
  - Row Number: Numeric sort order.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: Morecambe: CS, WS, WP; Essex: AH, FW, TM.
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A = 1 m; B = 1–10 m; C = 10–100 m; D = 100—upper limit.
  - Biomass: Numeric value in Kg DW m^-2.
- Additional notes: “Calibration procedures” = None. “Data checking procedures” not specified. “Statistical treatment” indicates scaling measurements from the 50 cm × 25 cm quadrats for simulations.

## Data Access and Documentation

- The dataset is documented as an Excel workbook with a structured layout to support analysis across seasons, locations, sites, habitats, and quadrats.
- Metadata provided includes species context (grazers and grazing intensity), site-specific environmental contrasts, and the procedural steps for biomass measurement.
