# Supporting Documentation Impacts of chronic radiation exposure on reproduction, development and genetic diversity of the freshwater crustacean Asellus aquaticus at Chernobyl

## Overview
- A collection of datasets generated to assess how chronic radiation exposure affects reproduction, development, and genetic diversity in Asellus aquaticus from Chernobyl-affected areas (Belarus and Ukraine).
- Datasets produced under the TREE project and contributed by Neil Fuller, Liubov L. Nagorskaya, Dmitri I. Gudkov, Alex T. Ford, and Jim T. Smith, with genetic data generated at Cornell University.
- Covers temporal comparisons (2003–2005 and 2015–2016) and multiple environmental measurements alongside biological metrics.
- Data are organized in multiple CSV files with accompanying methodological details, sampling sites, and environmental context; blanks indicate missing data.

## Datasets included
- FA_Data_Chernobyl_2015.csv
  - Morphological data from Asellus aquaticus collected in 2015 from Belarus/Ukraine; 394 individuals with 3988 measurements.
  - Key variables: Site, Sex, Morphological trait, Fluctuating Asymmetry FA2, Dose rate (µGy/hr), Conductivity (µS/cm), Oxygen saturation (%), pH, Temperature (°C), Number of antennal segments.
  - Methods: dissection, slide mounting, imaging (Leica camera), two replicate blind measurements; dose rates via ERICA; environmental parameters via HANNA probe.
  - Purpose: assess developmental stability along a radiation gradient; mapping site locations (Figure S1).
- Fecundity_Data_Chernobyl.csv
  - Fecundity data for Asellus aquaticus across six lakes in Belarus/Ukraine over 2015–2016.
  - Key variables: Eggs, Egg weight (mg), Female weight (mg), Site, Year, Eggs per female weight, Sampling date, Dose rate (µGy/hr), Proportion gravid.
  - Methods: sexing via pleopods, egg imaging, weighing, brood weight; calculation of eggs per weight and gravid proportion.
  - Purpose: provide insight into reproductive capacity under chronic radiation exposure.
- FA_Data_Chernobyl_2003.CSV
  - Morphological data for Asellus aquaticus from 2003–2005 (Figure S1 reference).
  - Key variables: Site, Morphological trait, FA2, Dose rate, Number of antennal segments, Sampling date, Temperature (°C), pH, Conductivity (µS/cm), Oxygen saturation (%), Dissolved Oxygen (mg/L), Conductivity (µS/cm) or related environmental measures, and total hardness (mmol/L).
  - Methods: similar to 2015 dataset (field collection across sites, environmental measurements, and faunal measurements).
  - Purpose: compare fluctuating asymmetry across time to assess temporal changes in developmental stability.
- Chernobyl_Genetic_Diversity.csv
  - Genetic diversity data for Asellus aquaticus from 2003–2005 and 2015.
  - Key variables: Sample ID, Inbreeding Coefficient, Expected Heterozygosity, Observed Heterozygosity, Tajima's D, Nucleotide Diversity.
  - Methods: Genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) performed at Cornell University; DNA extracted from samples across 6 sites; analysis using UNEAK/TASSEL, with diversity statistics calculated in VCF tools and PopGenome.
  - Purpose: establish baseline and temporal changes in genetic diversity associated with radiation exposure.

## Data collection, provenance, and personnel
- Timeframe and scope:
  - 2003–2005: Asellus aquaticus samples and environmental data collected by Liubov L. Nagorskaya and colleagues; analyses by Neil Fuller.
  - 2015: Samples and measurements collected by Neil Fuller; environmental data captured in the field.
  - 2016 (Belarus lakes): Additional sampling by Nagorskaya; analyses by Fuller (University of Portsmouth).
  - Genetic data (GBS): Generated by Cornell University Genomic Diversity Facility; samples collected by Fuller and Nagorskaya.
- Project context: TREE project funded by NERC, Environment Agency, and Radioactive Waste Management.
- Data structure intent: Each dataset includes clear variable definitions, collection methods, and site information; blank cells indicate missing data.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data files provide:
  - Clear column definitions and units (e.g., dose rate in µGy/hr; temperature in °C; pH; conductivity in µS/cm; etc.).
  - Site-level sampling locations and yearly context where applicable.
  - Documentation of measurement protocols (e.g., ImageJ measurements, replicate measurements, and statistical descriptors like FA2).
  - Genetic data descriptors (SNP-based diversity metrics) and the analytical tools used (UNEAK, TASSEL, VCF tools, PopGenome).

## Purpose, use, and governance considerations
- Purpose: enable researchers to evaluate how chronic radiation exposure affects development (fluctuating asymmetry), reproduction (fecundity metrics), and genetic diversity in a model freshwater crustacean across temporal and spatial gradients.
- Intended use: secondary analyses, meta-analyses, and cross-time comparisons; data can support assessments of developmental stability, reproductive output under contamination, and population genetic responses to radiation.
- Data governance for Data Stewards:
  - Maintain clear provenance: document collectors, collection years, and processing steps.
  - Conform to consistent metadata standards across datasets to facilitate discovery and interoperability.
  - Note and manage missing data, blanks, and any caveats related to measurement methods or site geographies.
  - Ensure appropriate data sharing permissions and update mechanisms, including versioning and potential cross-dataset linkage (e.g., linking FA data with site environmental context and genetic data).
  - Document any methodological changes between 2003–2005 and 2015 datasets to support valid temporal comparisons.

## Key considerations for Data Stewards
- Heterogeneous formats and temporal depth require careful harmonization when integrating across datasets (morphology, fecundity, and genetics).
- Missing data across columns (blanks) should be captured in metadata and communicated to data users.
- Environmental measurements accompany biological data, enabling contextual analyses along radiation gradients.
- Genetic data involve external sequencing facilities; ensure traceability of sample IDs and cross-referencing with metadata in older datasets.
