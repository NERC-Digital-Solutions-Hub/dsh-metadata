# soil_profile_data.csv

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents soil profile data collected along a transect in the Siksik catchment, Northwest Territories, Canada, to monitor environmental health and support policy performance over time.
  - Aims to verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data for standardized outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts) and to support data sharing.

- Location and context
  - Country: Canada; State/Territory: Northwest Territories; catchment: Siksik.
  - Geographic coordinates: Longitude 133°26'26"W; Latitude 68°44'17"N; Elevation 85 m.
  - Sampling date: September 2014.
  - Sampling design: soil samples collected along a transect; soil profiles along transect labeled P1–P10; 14C analysis indicated where applicable; plant community names associated with profiles.

- Data content and structure
  - Columns and fields (sampled dataset soil_profile_data.csv):
    - sample: Sample identification number (1–64).
    - location: Soil profile identification; 14C indicates 14C analyses.
    - depth_1: Upper depth of sampling depth (cm).
    - depth_2: Lower depth of sampling depth (cm).
    - ph: pH measured using a 1:5 soil:water suspension method.
    - Bulk_density_gcm3: Bulk density (g/cm3) following Blake and Hartge (1986) method.
  - Additional contextual notes
    - Names correspond to dominant plant communities.
    - P1–P10 denote soil profiles along the transect.

- Methods and references
  - Bulk density determined according to Blake and Hartge (1986) as described in Klute (ed.), Methods of Soil Analysis, Part 1.
  - pH measured via 1:5 soil:water suspension (standard method referenced in the data sheet).

- Data quality, management, and sharing
  - Data are meant to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed prior to analysis.
  - Outputs are planned in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) to aid environmental monitoring.
  - Datasets should be stored properly and uploaded to appropriate portals to enable broader access.
  - Key challenges for analysts include increasing the value of the datasets by integrating them with additional relevant data and ensuring access to underlying data for reuse.
