# soil_profile_data.csv

## Overview
- A soil profile data sheet collected in September 2014 along a transect in the Siksik catchment, North West Territories, Canada.
- Records soil properties and sampling metadata to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Key variables include sampling location, depth, pH, and bulk density, with precise geographic coordinates and elevation.

## Data Content and Column Definitions
- sample: Sample identification number (1 to 64).
- location: Soil profile identification; notes that 14C analysis were carried out on a given soil sample; profiles along a transect labeled P1 to P10; names refer to the dominant plant community.
- depth_1: Upper depth of the sampling depth (cm).
- depth_2: Lower depth of the sampling depth (cm).
- ph: pH measured using a 1:5 soil:water suspension method.
- bulk_density_gcm3: Bulk density measured according to Blake and Hartge (1986).
- longitude: Location of sampling within the Siksik catchment (degrees/minutes/seconds or decimal format as recorded).
- latitude: Location of sampling within the Siksik catchment (degrees/minutes/seconds or decimal format as recorded).
- elevation (m): Elevation of sampling site in metres.
- Column_heading: Explanations and units for each column (e.g., samples, units).

## Materials and Methods
- Sampling timeframe and location
  - Soil samples collected in September 2014 along a transect in the Siksik catchment, NW Territories, Canada.
  - Geographic coordinates and elevation recorded for each sampling point.
- Measurements and standards
  - Bulk density determined following Blake and Hartge (1986) methods.
  - pH determined using the 1:5 soil:water suspension method.
  - References and method notes are provided (e.g., Klute, 1986; Blake & Hartge, 1986).
- Data sheet structure
  - Dataset described as soil_profile_data.csv with accompanying explanation of column headings and units.
  - 14C analysis noted on samples where applicable.

## Data Quality, Metadata and Accessibility
- Metadata include explicit column explanations and units to support interpretation and interoperability.
- Location and depth metadata enable spatial and vertical analysis of soil properties.
- The sheet references standard soil analysis methods and a formal dataset description, aiding reproducibility and quality assessment.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates collection of core soil health indicators (pH, bulk density) across spatial transects, useful for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Provides baseline data and traceable methods suitable for future trend analysis and comparison across sites or time.
- Emphasizes the need for standardized metadata, transparent methods, and data provenance to support governance and public sharing.
