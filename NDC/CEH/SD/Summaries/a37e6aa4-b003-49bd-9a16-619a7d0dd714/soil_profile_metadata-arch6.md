# soil_profile_data.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of soil profile data collected along a transect in the Siksik catchment, North West Territories, Canada.
- Samples collected in September 2014; coordinates and elevation recorded for each sampling point.
- Includes 64 samples (sample identifiers 1 to 64) and references to soil profiles along the transect (P1 to P10) and 14C-related sample labeling.
- Data dictionary entries link column headings to explanations and units.

## Data dictionary and key columns
- sample: Sample identification number (1 to 64).
- location: Soil profile identification; notes that 14C analyses may have been carried out; names refer to dominant plant community; P1 to P10 indicate soil profiles along the transect.
- depth_1: Upper depth of the sampling depth (units: centimetres).
- depth_2: Lower depth of the sampling depth (units: centimetres).
- ph: pH determined by 1:5 soil:water suspension method.
- bulk_density_gcm3: Bulk density (units: grams per cubic centimetre) following Blake and Hartge (1986).
- longitude: Longitude of sampling within the Siksik catchment (part of location data).
- latitude: Latitude of sampling within the Siksik catchment (part of location data).
- elevation (m): Elevation in metres.
- Column_heading and Units: Metadata structure indicating explanations for each column and their measurement units.

## Materials and methods
- Sampling occurred in September 2014 along a transect in the Siksik catchment, NW Territories, Canada. Example location reference: Longitude 133°26'26"W, Latitude 68°44'17"N, Elevation 85 m.
- For each sample, both depth range (depth_1 to depth_2) and precise geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude) were recorded.
- Bulk density was measured following Blake and Hartge (1986).
- pH was measured using a 1:5 soil:water suspension method (reference methods provided in the data notes).
