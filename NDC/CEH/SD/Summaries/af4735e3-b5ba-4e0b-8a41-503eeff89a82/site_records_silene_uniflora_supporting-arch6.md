# Collection/generation methods

- Timeframe and source
  - Observations collected during field work between February 2018 and September 2021.
  - Sites identified as potentially colonised by Silene uniflora from Botanical Society of the British Isles records, existing literature, and communication with county recorders.
  - Sites visited to record the approximate geographic extent of populations based on observed plants.

- Data collection approach
  - Geographic extent defined using GPS positions recorded for observed specimens.
  - GPS data captured as latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, Datum: WGS84.
  - Habitat or substrate type recorded for each population (montane, coastal, mine, serpentine).

- Data quality and validation
  - GPS positions checked against satellite imagery to ensure correct location.
  - Quality control procedures applied to verify location accuracy.

- Data structure and fields
  - The dataset comprises 56 rows, each representing a single population.
  - Population naming: named after local area names/landmarks (Column 1); population codes (Column 2) used for a connected dataset (Heavy metal tolerance records for Silene uniflora).
  - Column 3 records habitat type.
  - Remaining columns contain latitude/longitude pairs that define points bounding the site (polygon-like extents).
  - Outputs are prepared to support integration with the connected dataset on heavy metal tolerance.
