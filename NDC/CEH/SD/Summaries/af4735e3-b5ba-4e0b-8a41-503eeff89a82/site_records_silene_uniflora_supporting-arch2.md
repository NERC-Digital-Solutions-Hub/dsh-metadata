# Silene uniflora populations: GPS-based extent and habitat data (2018–2021)

## Purpose and context
- Observations collected during field work from 02/2018 to 09/2021 to identify sites potentially colonised by Silene uniflora.
- Identification sources included Botanical Society of the British Isles records, existing literature, and communication with county recorders.
- Aimed to record the approximate geographic extent of populations using GPS-based locations.

## Data collection and methods
- Sites identified from records and communications; field visits conducted to map population extent.
- Approximate extents defined by observed specimens using GPS coordinates.

## Data values and units
- For each population: a series of GPS positions (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, Datum: WGS84) that define the population’s approximate extent.
- Habitat/substrate type recorded per population (montane, coastal, mine, serpentine).
- GPS positions or extents cross-checked for accuracy against satellite imagery.

## Quality control
- Verification of GPS accuracy against satellite imagery to ensure correct location.
- Quality control processes applied to ensure correct site placement.

## Data structure and contents
- Dataset comprises 56 rows, each representing a single population.
- Columns:
  - Column 1: population name (based on local area names/landmarks)
  - Column 2: population code (used for a connected dataset)
  - Column 3: habitat type
  - Remaining columns: latitude/longitude pairs defining points bounding the site
- Population codes are used for integration with a connected dataset (Heavy metal tolerance records for Silene uniflora).

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, geo-referenced data on species distribution and habitat types, enabling longitudinal monitoring and cross-dataset integration (e.g., with heavy metal tolerance data).

## Challenges and considerations
- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources.
- Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
