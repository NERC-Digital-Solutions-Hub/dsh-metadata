# Heavy metal tolerance records for Silene uniflora

## Overview
- Documenting populations of Silene uniflora and their geographic extents, used to support a connected dataset on heavy metal tolerance.
- Fieldwork conducted between February 2018 and September 2021.
- Population sites identified from Botanical Society of the British Isles records, existing literature, and communications with county recorders; sites visited to record extent.

## Data collection methods
- Approximate geographic extent of each population recorded using GPS based on observed plants.
- GPS accuracy and extent checked against satellite imagery for quality control.

## Data units and values
- For each population, a series of GPS positions (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, Datum: WGS84) define the population’s approximate extent.
- Habitat/substrate type recorded per population (e.g., montane, coastal, mine, serpentine).

## Data quality and validation
- GPS positions validated against satellite imagery to ensure correct location.
- Quality control steps implemented to verify location accuracy.

## Data structure and fields
- Dataset comprises 56 rows, each representing a single population.
- Columns:
  - Column 1: population name based on local area names/landmarks.
  - Column 2: population code (used for a connected dataset).
  - Column 3: habitat type.
  - Remaining column pairs: latitude/longitude values bounding the site (points defining the extent).
