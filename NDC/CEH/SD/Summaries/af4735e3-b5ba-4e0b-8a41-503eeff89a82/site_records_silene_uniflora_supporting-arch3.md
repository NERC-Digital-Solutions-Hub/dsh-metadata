# Heavy metal tolerance records for Silene uniflora

## Data collection and sources
- Field observations collected between 02/2018 and 09/2021
- Potentially colonised sites identified from Botanical Society of the British Isles records, existing literature, and communication with county recorders
- Sites visited; approximate geographic extent of populations recorded via GPS based on observed specimens

## Measurement units and accuracy
- For each population, the record is a series of GPS positions (latitude and longitude in decimal degrees, Datum: WGS84) defining the population's approximate extent
- Broad habitat/substrate type recorded for each population (montane, coastal, mine, serpentine)
- GPS positions checked against satellite imagery to ensure correct location

## Data structure and content
- Dataset comprises 56 rows, each corresponding to a single population
- Populations named by local area names/landmarks (Column 1) and assigned population codes (Column 2) used for a connected dataset (Heavy metal tolerance records for Silene uniflora)
- Column 3 contains habitat type
- Remaining pairs of columns contain latitude/longitude positions for points bounding the site

## Data quality and governance
- Quality control applied to verify correct location
- The dataset is linked to a connected dataset on heavy metal tolerance, indicating structured data management and cross-referencing between related data records
