# Collection/generation methods

## Data collection and experimental design
- Data were collected using deep water culture experiments between 03/2021 and 09/2021.
- Cuttings from 50 Silene uniflora populations were propagated in common conditions.
- Cuttings were grown in diluted Hoagland's solution (pH 5.5) using deep water culture for 4 weeks.
- Roots were stained with activated charcoal and transferred to fresh Hoagland's with 1000 μM ZnSO4.
- After 48 hours, root growth was scored as: 0 = no growth, 1 = visible growth, 2 = visible growth with new root growth >30% of original length.
- Population tolerance levels were estimated as the mean score per population.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- For each population: mean zinc tolerance score, the standard deviation, and the number of cuttings scored.
- Geographic positions of the scored populations are recorded (linked to a connected dataset).

## Quality control
- Experiments and data were scored by a single author (Giles, L).
- 10% of the scores were verified by the other two authors.

## Details of data structure
- The dataset contains 50 rows, each representing a single population.
- Population identifiers: column 1 contains population names (local area names/landmarks) and population codes; full names and geolocations are provided in a connected dataset (Site records for Silene uniflora).
- Column 2: number of cuttings assessed.
- Column 3: zinc tolerance score for the population.
- Column 4: standard deviation for the zinc tolerance score.
