# Collection/generation methods

- Purpose: describe how data on zinc tolerance in Silene uniflora populations were generated to support environmental health monitoring and policy decisions.

- Study design and timeline:
  - Deep water culture experiments conducted from March 2021 to September 2021.
  - 50 wild Silene uniflora populations sampled via cuttings.

- Experimental procedure:
  - Cuttings propagated and grown under common conditions.
  - After initial growth, cuttings transferred to Hoagland's solution (pH 5.5) with 1000 µM ZnSO4 for 48 hours.
  - Root growth scored on a 0–2 scale:
    - 0 = no growth
    - 1 = visible growth
    - 2 = visible growth with new root growth >30% of original length
  - Population zinc tolerance levels determined as the mean score per population.

- Data recording and units:
  - For each population: mean root growth score, standard deviation, and number of cuttings scored.
  - Geographic positions of scored populations are recorded.

- Quality control:
  - Scoring performed by a single author (Giles, L).
  - 10% of scores verified by the other two authors.

- Data structure details:
  - Dataset contains 50 rows (one per population).
  - Columns:
    - Column 1: population name (local area name/landmark) and population code.
    - Column 2: number of cuttings assessed.
    - Column 3: zinc tolerance score (population mean).
    - Column 4: standard deviation of the zinc tolerance score.
  - Full population names and geolocations available in a connected dataset titled “Site records for Silene uniflora.”
