# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- A user guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2023 (LCM2023), detailing production, validation, and data accuracy to help informed use.
- LCM2023 comprises seven datasets: three for Great Britain (GB) and three for Northern Ireland (NI) plus a 1 km summary raster product for both GB and NI.
- Aim is to support annual, comparable land-cover mapping with attention to temporal change and data quality.

## What the LCM2023 includes (Product Suite)
- 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
- Classified Land Parcels (GB and NI)
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
- 1 km Summary Raster products (GB and NI; includes dominant class and percentage cover)
- Seasonal Composite Images (Sentinel-2-based)
- Context Rasters (10 m) to reduce spectral confusion
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework and related metadata

## Data structure and formats
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - Derived from Classification Scenes; each pixel has a class and a confidence probability.
  - First band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band = classification confidence.
  - Not generalised by the Land Parcel framework to preserve fine-scale features (e.g., narrow patches).
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Land parcels generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Provides parcel-level attributes and supports change detection.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterised from the Land Parcel dataset; three attributes carried per parcel: dominant class (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products
  - Summary products created by aggregating 25 m rasters to 1 km cells.
  - Include dominant class, percentage cover (for both classes and aggregates); percentage values are integer-based and may not sum exactly to 100.
- Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters
  - Seasonal Composite Images built from four seasonal periods of Sentinel-2 data (10 bands used; some gaps may occur due to cloud).
  - Context Rasters (GB: height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask; NI: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/roads/water, foreshore and water masks) to improve discrimination.
- Datasets are accompanied by a data licence-free, DOIs for citation and a companion colour recipe file for mapping.

## Data production workflow
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Built from Google Earth Engine; Sentinel-2 reflectance resampled to 10 m with four seasonal periods.
- Classification Scenes and Bootstrap Training
  - 32 GB classification Scenes for GB; 1 Scene for NI.
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCM outputs (LCM2020–LCM2022) to sample training data with >80% probability and consistent class across three years.
  - Training data used to train a Random Forest classifier; 10,000 samples per bag with replacement to balance classes.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Framework used to structure land parcels; MMU ~0.5 ha; parcels generally dominated by a single land-cover type; designed to support noise reduction and change detection.
- Software and validation
  - Custom UKCEH software integrates WEKA with PostGIS and GDAL; all open-source components.
- Data provenance and updates
  - Annual production enables temporal consistency and change detection; future improvements may be retroactively applied if accuracy gains justify reprocessing.

## Validation and quality
- Validation with 33,107 reference points across 21 classes.
- Overall accuracy: 83%.
- Validation sources include GB countryside survey, open data inventories, and bespoke validation points.

## Known issues and caveats
- Some polygons missing from vector land parcel products; negligible impact on 1 km products; 10 m classified pixels are unaffected.
- Reality vs method-driven changes: ongoing methodological evolution means some year-to-year differences may reflect method changes as well as real change.

## Data access, citation, and metadata
- Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI and must be cited accordingly.
- Datasets include:
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - 1 km Summary Rasters
- Companion references provided (e.g., Marston et al. 2023–2024 papers) for production methods and validation details.
- Appendix materials provide detailed mapping between UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats, plus full class descriptions and recommended color schemes.

## Practical considerations for Data Leaders
- Holistic data system view: LCM2023 provides multiple resolutions and parcel-based products to support different analytical needs and change detection workflows.
- User needs and governance: results are designed for policy-relevant decision making, with explicit metadata, DOIs, and validation metrics to facilitate trust and repeatability.
- Data gaps and accessibility: pay attention to MMU-related limitations and the known issue of missing land parcel polygons; ensure appropriate QA when deriving downstream indicators.
- Temporal planning: annual updates enable differentiation of real change from classification noise; plan for method updates and potential reprocessing if accuracy gains are realized.
