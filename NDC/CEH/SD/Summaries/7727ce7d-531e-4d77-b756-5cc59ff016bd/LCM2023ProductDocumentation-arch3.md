# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview and purpose
- UKCEH LCM2023 is an annual land cover map produced for Great Britain and Northern Ireland (GB and NI), consisting of seven datasets: three GB datasets and three NI datasets (10 m classified pixels, land parcels, and 25 m rasterised land parcels) plus a 1 km summary raster covering both GB and NI.
- The aim is to help users scrutinise and evaluate environmental policy, monitor state and change, and inform future decisions by providing data production details, validation, and accuracy information to enable informed use.
- Outputs are designed for clear communication through reports, charts, or dashboards, with an emphasis on data provenance, quality, and governance.

## Data products and structure
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - Separate datasets for GB and NI created from multiple Classification Scenes classified with a Random Forest (RF) classifier using Bootstrap Training.
  - Each pixel has: the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer code) and a second band with the corresponding classification confidence.
  - High detail preserved (no generalisation to the Land Parcel Spatial Framework) to retain fine landscape features; validation was conducted against the 25 m rasterised parcels dataset.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting the 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to produce land parcel attributes.
  - Includes per-parcel details (e.g., hist, mode, purity, confidence, aggregation) and parcel identifiers (gid).
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterised version of the Land Parcel dataset at 25 m resolution, carrying three attributes: per-parcel land cover (mode), mean confidence (_conf), and per-parcel purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products
  - Summary rasters summarising the 25 m data to 1 km resolution: dominant class, dominant aggregate class, and percentage cover per class (21 bands for classes, 10 for aggregates).
  - Percentage values are rounded; sums may deviate from 100% due to rounding and coastal areas outside the mapped extent.
- Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters
  - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 data (10 m) across four seasons, using multiple spectral bands to create Classification Scenes.
  - Context Rasters (10 m GB / NI) include terrain (height, aspect, slope) and proximity masks (distance to buildings/roads/water, foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh, etc.) to improve discrimination of spectrally similar classes.
- Classification Scenes and production approach
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes tiled across the land surface; NI: a single 49-band Classification Scene ( Sentinel-2 seasonal bands plus NI Context Rasters).
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCM maps (LCM2020–LCM2022) to automatically sample training data; RF classifier assigns each pixel to the most probable class.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - A long-standing framework that generalises national cartography to delineate land parcels (minimum ~0.5 ha) used to structure the 10 m pixel data into parcels for time-series comparison.

## Production method and software
- Bootstrap Training
  - Uses historical wall-to-wall maps to generate large training samples, reducing the need for field data.
  - Training data are filtered to pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across three consecutive years.
- Random Forest classification
  - A balanced sampling approach is used to ensure rarer classes are adequately learned.
  - Produces two outputs per pixel: class membership and associated probability/confidence.
- Data processing tools
  - Custom UKCEH software integrating WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL; uses open-source components.

## Validation, accuracy, and known issues
- Validation
  - 33,107 validation reference points across all 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
  - Overall accuracy reported: 83% for LCM2023.
- Known issues
  - A small number of polygons are missing from the vector Land Parcel products, resulting in nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised parcels; impact minor and mainly on parcel products, not on 10 m classified pixels.
- Notes for users
  - Validation for the 10 m pixels was not performed against the same dataset used for 25 m parcel validation; users should consider this when comparing outputs at different resolutions.

## Data relationships and class definitions
- UKCEH Land Cover Classes (21 classes) are closely related to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats but are not identical; italicised BAP terms are used to indicate cross-references for clarity.
- Appendix notes describe detailed mapping between UKCEH classes and BAP Broad Habitats, including where splits occur (e.g., Urban vs Suburban, Heather vs Heather grassland) and known spectral confusion among certain classes (e.g., Bog, Acid grassland, Fen, Marsh, Swamp).

## Data availability, citations, and governance
- DOIs and formal citations are provided for all LCM2023 products (10 m classified pixels GB, 10 m classified pixels NI, 25 m rasterised land parcels GB, 25 m rasterised land parcels NI, land parcels GB, land parcels NI, 1 km summary rasters GB/NI).
- Users are encouraged to cite the appropriate dataset DOIs and associated Marston et al. papers for methodological context.
- Disclaimer notes that annual updates may introduce methodological changes, affecting comparability to previous maps; changes reflect ongoing development and improvements.

## Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Temporal capability
  - Annual production enables differentiation of random errors from real change, aiding change detection and trend analysis as the time-series matures.
- Data quality and transparency
  - Clear documentation of data production steps, validation, and accuracy supports governance and data quality assurance.
  - Availability of detailed metadata (classes, confidence measures, parcel attributes) enhances data provenance and reproducibility.
- Data accessibility and sharing
  - Outputs are designed for dissemination via reports, charts, and dashboards; underlying data are shared with corresponding DOIs to facilitate reuse.
  - Potential barrier: public sharing of underlying datasets; LCM2023 addresses this via structured metadata and open data practices, but users should plan for data governance requirements.
- Change management and comparability
  - Known issues and method changes between years should be documented when comparing maps across time to avoid misinterpreting methodological artifacts as real change.
- Alignment with monitoring objectives
  - The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes map onto BAP Broad Habitats with some pragmatic adaptations, enabling compatibility with historic classifications while supporting modern satellite-based monitoring.
