# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview and Purpose
- User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2023 (LCM2023).
- Product comprises seven datasets: three per region (Great Britain and Northern Ireland) plus a 1 km summary raster product.
  - 10 m dataset of classified pixels.
  - Dataset of classified land parcels.
  - 25 m pixel dataset (rasterised land parcels) or a vector land parcel dataset.
  - An additional 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
- LCM2023 provides 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes based on Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; includes detailed production, validation, and accuracy information to aid informed use.
- Overall validation accuracy reported at 83%.

## Key Concepts and Data Structures
- UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes aligned with BAP Broad Habitats; relationships and nuances with BAP definitions are documented (Appendices 1–2).
- Classification Framework:
  - Classification Scenes: classification units built from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus Context Rasters; GB uses a grid of 32 tiles (Classification Scenes), NI uses a single Scene.
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic sampling from historic LCM maps (LCM2020–LCM2022) to train Random Forest classifiers; relies on high-probability, consistently labeled pixels across years.
  - Random Forest (RF): supervised classifier trained with balanced sampling to avoid dominance by common classes.
  - Seasonal Composite Images: four-season Sentinel-2 spectra (with 10 bands) used to create Classification Scenes; occasional cloud gaps are tolerated.
  - Context Rasters: 10 m context layers to reduce spectral confusion (GB includes terrain height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore mask, woodland mask, saltmarsh mask); NI includes urban mask and various distance masks.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework:
  - Parceled representation of land cover derived from generalised national cartography; parcels typically ~0.5 ha minimum (MMU).
  - Land parcels provide a stable unit for change detection and reducing classification noise.
  - Unique parcel identifiers (gid) are not guaranteed to match past LCM datasets due to framework reordering.
- Data Processing and Tools:
  - Production software is bespoke, combining Weka RF with PostGIS and GDAL; uses open-source components.
  - All methods are subject to ongoing evolution and potential changes in future releases.

## Data Products and Metadata
- 10 m Classified Pixel Datasets (GB and NI):
  - Multiband mosaic of Classification Scenes; first band is the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band is the associated class membership probability.
  - GB: 2 bands; NI: 3 bands (additional metadata band).
  - 10 m pixels are not generalised by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine-scale detail.
  - Validation for these pixels is separate from the 25 m parcel validation.
- Land Parcel Datasets (GB and NI):
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel Product: three attributes per parcel (dominant land cover class [mode], mean confidence [conf], and pixel purity [purity]); raster origin aligned with national grid.
  - Land Parcel Vector Product: detailed parcel attributes (gid, hist, mode, conf, purity, agg, n, etc.) suitable for spatial analyses and time-series comparisons.
- 1 km Summary Raster Data (GB and NI):
  - Summarises 25 m rasters to 1 km pixels; provides dominant class per 1 km pixel and percentage cover across all classes and aggregates.
  - Percentage sums may differ from 100% due to rounding and coastal edge effects.
- Datasets and Citations (DOIs):
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; citations provided (e.g., Marston et al. 2024, for various dataset types).
  - Users should cite the specific dataset DOIs when using the data.

## Production Methods in Practice
- Seasonal and Context Data:
  - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2; 10 m resolution; bands listed in the documentation.
  - Context Rasters provide additional spatial information to resolve spectral confusion.
- Scenes and Tile Strategy:
  - GB classified in ~100 km tiles (about 32 Classification Scenes); NI uses a single Classification Scene due to smaller geographic extent.
- Training Data and Validation:
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCM maps (LCM2020–LCM2022) filtered for high probability (>80%) and consistent labeling across three years.
  - Validation uses a large composite reference set (~33k points) spanning all 21 classes; overall accuracy reported at 83%.
- Change Management and Future Updates:
  - UKCEH aims for annual LCM production with ongoing methodological improvements; significant accuracy gains may justify reapplication across the full catalogue to maintain temporal consistency.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Known Issues
- Accuracy and Validation:
  - Overall accuracy 83% with producer’s and user’s accuracy metrics provided in Appendix 4.
  - Validation data drawn from GB countryside surveys, open data inventories, and bespoke validation points.
- Known Issues:
  - Some polygons missing in the vector land parcel products, resulting in nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised land parcels dataset; impact considered negligible for 1 km products.
  - 10 m classified pixels datasets are unaffected by the known polygon gaps.
  - Differences in parcel identifiers relative to LCM2015; direct parcel-ID comparisons across older maps may not be possible.
- Method Variability:
  - Continuous development means some method changes across releases may cause apparent, not real, changes between maps.

## Accessibility, Citation, and Governance for Data Stewards
- DOIs and Citations:
  - Each data product has a DOI and recommended citation; use the DOI to reference the exact dataset version.
  - Key references include Marston et al. (2024a–g) and Marston et al. (2023) for production methods.
- Usage Guidance:
  - 10 m classified pixels preserve fine-scale detail but require awareness that they are not parcel-aggregated; ideal for high-resolution analyses and change detection at fine scales.
  - 25 m rasterised land parcels provide a simplified, parcel-based view suitable for time-series analyses and integration with other parcel-level datasets.
  - 1 km summary rasters offer a standardized, aggregated view for broad-scale monitoring and cross-regional comparisons.
- Color and Visualization:
  - Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide recommended color schemes and color-blind-friendly palettes; accompanying QGIS symbology files are provided (lcm_raster.fxml and lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml).
- Coordinate Systems and Extents:
  - GB datasets use British National Grid (EPSG:27700); NI datasets use Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG:29903).
  - Datasets cover GB and NI extents with region-specific extents and parcel counts specified in Table 2 and Table 3.
- Data Management Considerations:
  - The UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework is a fixed structure; changes in the framework can affect cross-version comparability of parcel identifiers.
  - Users should be aware of the annual update cycle and method changes that can influence apparent changes between releases.
- Appendices and Supplementary Materials:
  - Appendix 1–2 describe UKCEH Land Cover Classes and their relationship to BAP Broad Habitats, with notes on potential spectral confusion and classification nuances.
  - Appendix 3 lists the full dataset catalog and DOIs; Appendix 4 provides confusion matrices and accuracy metrics; Appendix 5–6 present color recipes for visualization.

## Summary for Data Stewards
- LCM2023 provides a comprehensive, annually produced land cover product suite with detailed production methodology, validation, and documentation to support discovery, governance, and reuse.
- Key governance points:
  - Maintain awareness of versioning and dataset-specific DOIs; cite exact datasets when reusing.
  - Recognize the difference between high-resolution 10 m classified pixels and parcel-based 25 m rasters/land parcel vectors; align usage with project needs.
  - Account for annual methodological changes and known issues (e.g., missing vector parcels) when designing analyses and reporting results.
  - Leverage the provided context rasters, seasonal composites, and classification scenes to understand classification decisions and improve downstream data integration.
  - Use the color palettes and visualization files to ensure consistent, accessible mapping of land cover classes.
