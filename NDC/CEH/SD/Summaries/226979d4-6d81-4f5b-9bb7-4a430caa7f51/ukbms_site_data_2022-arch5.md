# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and governance
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteers; aims to monitor population status of butterflies across the UK since 1976.
  - >3,000 actively recorded sites annually; data used to understand biodiversity trends and inform policy questions.

- Data collected and sampling framework
  - Three main components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, across habitat units, 5 m width, weekly during flight season (April–September).
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares, two parallel transects per site, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouragement for spring visits).
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for particular species.
  - Site coverage: over 2,000 standard transect sites and additional WCBS sites; comprehensive, site-based monitoring with data integrated across methods.

- Nature of the data and analysis
  - Data are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts; indices reflect proportion of butterflies present per site but vary by species detectability.
  - Collated indices constructed using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
  - All counts from all methods are used to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate to account for recording gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data over extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software.
  - Automatic checks and regional transect coordinators review data for errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods or distribution).
  - Further automated and manual validation to detect out-of-range or atypical records; corrections made through queries and coordination with recorders/coordinators.
