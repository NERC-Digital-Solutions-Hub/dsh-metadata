# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Engages volunteers; provides annual population status data for butterflies since 1976.
  - Aims to inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends through a large-scale, site-based monitoring program.

- Data collection and sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts (up to 26 visits per year) from April to September; typically 45 minutes to 2 hours per survey; over 2000 sites recorded annually by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum two in July/August); samples ~800 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts; alternative methods used for specific species.
  - Data integrate all methods to produce national abundance insights.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Collated indices created with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-by-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - All counts across a season (Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys) inform seasonal patterns and gaps are extrapolated; observed data receive greater weight in final indices.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation to flag out-of-range distributions, atypical abundances, or site-new records; corrections made through queries and edits to the main dataset.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides location and attribute data for UK sites monitored under UKBMS from 1976 to 2022; sensitive site data excluded; delivered as CSV.
  - Key columns include Site_number, Site_name, Gridreference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, N_Sections, N_Yrs_surveyed, First_year_surveyed, Last_year_surveyed, Survey_type (Standard UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse.
  - Required citation (including DOI) in any reports/publications using the data; attribution statement included with derived information or images.
  - Since 2017, data submitters have agreed to OGL availability; some historical data IP restrictions may apply; notify if concerns arise.

- Offer of collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS partners can advise on dataset details and interpretation; open to co-authorship and intellectual input for publications, conferences, or posters.
  - Contacts: UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (Marc Botham) ukbms@ceh.ac.uk; Butterfly Conservation Transect Co-ordinator transect@butterfly-conservation.org.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates practical data governance, openness, and collaboration across organisations.
  - Addresses key framework challenges: data gaps and access, interoperability, metadata quality, data transformation, governance, and clear communication of complex findings through reports and dashboards.
