# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Over 3000 actively recorded sites each year; data collection spans from 1976 to present.
- Volunteers conduct site-based monitoring through a mix of methods to understand butterfly population status and biodiversity trends, informing policy questions.
- Sampling framework includes:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weekly during active season.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
- All data types are analyzed together to produce overall species abundance insights.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- Data are summarized as abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
- Indices for species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (developed 2016) with a site- and year-weighting adjustment based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- The method uses all counts from multiple methods to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate missing data, with greater weight given to observed counts.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators review data for questionable records; data undergo further automated and manual validation, including checks against distribution ranges and typical site patterns.
- Corrections are made via queries and discussions with coordinators/recorders as needed.
