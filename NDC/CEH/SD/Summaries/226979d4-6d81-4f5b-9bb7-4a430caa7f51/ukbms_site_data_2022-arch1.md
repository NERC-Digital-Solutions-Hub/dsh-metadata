# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and collaborators: The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It relies on volunteers and produces data to understand butterfly population changes and inform biodiversity policy.

- Sampling framework and scope:
  - Site-based monitoring with three components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts up to 26 times per year, across more than 2000 sites by 2022.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km square transects, 2–3 visits per year, ~800 squares annually.
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - Data from all methods are analyzed together.
  - Active monitoring across the UK since 1976, with data from all methods contributing to national indices.

- Nature of data and trend analysis:
  - Indices derived from counts are relative measures of population size.
  - Overall species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with an additional site-year weighting that reflects the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
  - The method uses all seasonal counts to model patterns and extrapolate gaps, with greater weight given to observed data over extrapolated data.

- Data quality control:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS system or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks during the season.
  - Additional automated and manual validation queries ensure records are within known distributions and normal ranges; corrections are made as needed.
