# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Each laboratory is responsible for managing its own resources and analyses under controlled conditions.
  - Laboratories must document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - Procedures reviewed annually by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.

- Approved methodologies and reference techniques
  - Determinands have approved techniques; alternative methods listed in a reference table.
  - Example determinands include pH, conductivity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl, NO3-N, SO4-S, Alkalinity, PO4-P, DOC, Total N.
  - Techniques may quantify related fractions; laboratories should monitor alternative techniques to check for bias when a preferred method is not used.
  - For each determinand, the reference technique and the ultimate detection limit are specified.

- Methodology documentation and data records (metadata)
  - Laboratories keep detailed method documentation; a summary is stored in the ECN database.
  - Data records are created per determinand per ECN site, linked by site, core measurement, determinand, and date.
  - Example format (nitrate) illustrates typical concentrations, sample types, calibration ranges, measurement method, detection limit, and QC.
  - When methodology changes, a new dated record is added to ensure traceability and assessment of data suitability.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control.
  - Participation in interlaboratory analysis (e.g., AQUACHECK) to assess accuracy; record accuracy checks and any corrective actions.
  - Accuracy: assessed by comparison across laboratories and control samples; operational frequency of external checks is limited, so internal records of accuracy checks are required.
  - Precision: controlled using synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported with each sample set; data should be withheld if QC indicates poor performance.
  - An example accuracy record demonstrates reporting, comparison to mean, and corrective measures if needed.

- Quality control procedures (ECN-specific QC)
  - A separate ECN QC system exists to validate batch performance; encourages independent QC validation and participation in interlaboratory schemes.
  - Potential for calculating between-site correction factors; helps detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
  - QC: preparation of two concentrated QC solutions (one for cations, one for anions) distributed to sites; periodic continuity checks with annual re-preparation.
  - Analysts manage QC practice; sites may perform pH and conductivity locally and require aligned QC dilution protocols if so.

- Data transfer, formatting, and reporting
  - QC data submitted to the ECN Central Coordination Unit (CCU) in the same format as sample data.
  - Data records include batch-specific QC information across anion and cation analyses.
  - Data fields are detailed and order-specific (free-format, comma-separated), including preparation dates, analysis completion dates, pH (AQC, stirred/unstirred), conductivity, alkalinity, and all determinands (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, Cl, SO4-S, DOC, Total N), plus quality codes.
  - An example Moor House QC record demonstrates the structure and sequencing of fields.
  - Laboratories are advised to provide QC data in machine-readable form to the ECN Database Manager.

- Operational guidance and handling
  - Follow Initial Water Handling Protocols for pH and conductivity measurements.
  - When different techniques are used (e.g., a technique that quantifies a slightly different fraction), monitor and compare alternatives to confirm absence of bias.
  - Detection limits, calibration ranges, and measurement units are standardized within the ECN framework, with site-specific operation ranges acknowledged.

- Overall data integrity and traceability
  - Data traceability is ensured via dated methodological records and consistent data formatting.
  - Any methodological changes are captured with new database records and time stamps to preserve data quality history.
  - The protocol establishes a framework for accuracy, precision, and long-term data quality through interlaboratory collaboration and structured QC processes.
