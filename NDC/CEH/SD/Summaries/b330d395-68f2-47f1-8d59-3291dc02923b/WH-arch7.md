# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; to slow deterioration use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background quality control procedures are provided in referenced documents.

## Initial storage
- Store samples cold (1°C–4°C) if more than seven hours before measurement of conductivity and pH.
- Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day as measurements.
- If samples are sent to another site for initial handling, ship on collection day by fastest method.
- In transit, place samples in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use HMSO 1978 method; report results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample used for conductivity, but conductance measured first; do not return subsample to main sample).
- Use HMSO 1988 method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filtering within 60 hours of collection; follow Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes described in Protocols (Appendix I).
- After filtration, analyse for dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is limited, use the priority order for determinands when choosing analyses.
- Separate documentation is provided for chemical analysis (see AG Protocol) if volumes are insufficient for all determinands.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Storage temperature: 1°C–4°C.
- Analysis ideally within 16 days of collection, but must be completed within 28 days.
- If samples are sent elsewhere for analysis, minimize time out of cold storage; specify next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment:
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm)
  - Membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm)
  - Glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C)
  - Vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar vacuum)
- Procedures:
  - Rinse all filter assembly parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; each filter for one sample.
  - Soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering through glass fibre filters; pre-rinse filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - Transfer filtered water to a clean dry 250 ml bottle; do not return to unfiltered bottle.
  - If volume > 100 ml, take a 20 ml subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Any sampler code needed to uniquely identify the sample (e.g., SS sampler code)
  - The final data submitted to the ECN database must include this unique reference.
- Suppliers: BDH (head office), Millipore (UK)

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Use Decon products (e.g., Decon-90) or machine cleaning (e.g., Deconatic if available) for cleaning.
- Rinse steps:
  - Four rinses with tap water and three rinses with deionised/distilled water after washing.
  - After use, rinse three times with distilled water and re-cap for reuse with the same sampler.
- After washing, shake to remove drops, dry in warm, dust-free air, and re-cap immediately.
- Decon products can be obtained from multiple suppliers (e.g., BDH).
