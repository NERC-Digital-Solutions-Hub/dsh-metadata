# Analytical Guidelines for Water Samples Version 1.1

- Purpose
  - Provide standardized guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Each laboratory bears responsibility for its own resources; participating labs must conduct analyses under controlled conditions and document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - Annual review of procedures by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.
  - Establishes target detection limits and a framework for method validation and comparability.

- Approved techniques and reference methods
  - Determinands include pH, conductivity, major cations (Na, K, Ca, Mg), trace metals (Fe, Al), nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P, SO4-S), chloride, alkalinity, DOC, and Total N.
  - Multiple approved techniques per determinand; references reference HMSO Blue Books and methods such as AAS, IC, and colorimetric / flow-injection approaches.
  - Some techniques quantify related species; require comparative tests to ensure suitability and monitor for biases when alternative fractions are used.
  - For pH and conductivity, additional guidance exists in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

- Methodology documentation and data provenance
  - Laboratories maintain detailed methods for internal use; ECN database holds summarized method information per determinand/site/date, linked to site/core measurement/date to indicate methodology, precision, and any changes.
  - When changes occur, a new data record with a date stamp is created to track methodology evolution and suitability for purpose.
  - A sample data record format is provided (example using nitrate) to illustrate the type of metadata stored (substance, sample types, concentration ranges, calibration, accuracy notes, etc.).

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC.
  - Accuracy: closeness to true value and agreement among laboratories (e.g., via control samples like AQUACHECK). Labs must record accuracy checks and any corrective procedures.
  - Precision: assessed using QC controls and interlaboratory comparison schemes; synthetic QC solutions are used to monitor batch bias; results reported to Site Managers.
  - Laboratories should participate in interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK) and maintain records of accuracy and precision.

- Quality control and interlaboratory context
  - A dedicated QC system for ECN participants replaces the need for periodic stand-alone interlaboratory studies.
  - Opportunity to compute between-site correction factors if all sites use the same QC solutions and procedures; enables long-term trend and rogue-batch detection.
  - Annual preparation of two QC concentrates (one for cations, one for anions), distributed to sites for the next year; procedures for preparing QC solutions are specified.
  - QC data must be submitted in the ECN data format, including preparation dates, measurement results, and quality codes; a single QC data record covers both anion and cation results per batch.

- Data transfer, reporting, and bias considerations
  - Data must be reported for the specified fraction (e.g., SO4 2- by ion chromatography); if alternative techniques are used (e.g., IC vs ICP/OES), laboratories must monitor both to confirm absence of bias.
  - Operational detection limits may vary between laboratories; assess whether those limits are sufficient for study purposes; re-analysis with lower ranges may be necessary.
  - Describes that data and methodology details reside in a meta-database for auditability and comparability.

- Priority handling when sample volumes are limited
  - A priority listing guides handling and analysis when sample volumes are scarce (higher priority: pH and conductivity; followed by cations and anions in order; subsequent priorities for ammonium, DOC, total N, alkalinity, etc.).
  - This aids site operators and analysts in decision-making during low-rainfall periods.

- Change management and record-keeping
  - Any methodological changes must be captured with a dated record to maintain traceability and determine data suitability.
  - Emphasizes changes in instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training as part of the methodology record.

- End notes
  - Authors and governance: notes attributed to A.P. Rowland and collaborators; reflects ECN’s emphasis on standardized, transparent, and trackable analytical practice across laboratories.
