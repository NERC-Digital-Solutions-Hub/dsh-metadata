# ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

- Purpose and scope
  - Provide guidelines for analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
  - Each laboratory manages its analytic resources but must conduct analyses under controlled conditions and document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
  - Annual review of procedures by an Analytical Working Group with representatives from each laboratory.

- Approved techniques and reference methods
  - Compiled table of approved techniques for determinands (pH, conductivity, major ions, gases, nutrients, DOC, total N, etc.) with method types (AAS, IC, ICP/OES, colorimetric, Col/PVC, etc.) and corresponding notes.
  - Reference techniques establish primary benchmarks; laboratories may use alternatives but must assess comparability and report ultimate detection limits.

- Methodology reporting and data context
  - Laboratories must keep detailed methodology at the lab; provide summary information to the ECN database.
  - Data records in a meta-database include site, core measurement, determinand, date, methodology, precision, typical concentrations, calibration range, detection limits, and accuracy notes.
  - When methodology changes, a new dated record is added to document suitability and changes.

- Validation, accuracy, and precision
  - Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal QC; participation in interlaboratory schemes (e.g., AQUACHECK) is required.
  - Accuracy: closeness to true value, monitored via control samples and external schemes; all accuracy checks must be recorded.
  - Precision: controlled via synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported with results; unacceptable QC values prohibit data submission.

- Quality Control (QC) framework
  - A separate ECN QC system supports interlab validation and batch assessment; can enable between-site correction factors and trend detection.
  - Merlewood prepares annual QC concentrates for cations and anions; sites analyze QC solutions in the same way as samples.
  - QC data are submitted to the ECN Database Manager in a standardized format, enabling batch-level evaluation.

- Data transfer, metadata, and traceability
  - Data transfer format is specified as comma-separated, free-format records including: measurement code, site ID, QC sample codes, preparation and analysis dates, pH, conductivity, determinand results, and other analytes; quality codes may follow.
  - A single QC data record covers both anion and cation results per batch.
  - Documentation supports traceability of method changes and assessment of data suitability.

- Priority guidance for limited sample volumes
  - When sample volumes are limited, a priority list guides analytical options:
    1) pH and conductivity
    2) Cations (Ca, Mg first; then K, Na)
    3) Anions (NO3, SO4, then PO4, Cl)
    4) NH4-N
    5) DOC
    6) Cations requiring separate acidified portions (Fe2+, Al3+)
    7) Total N and alkalinity
  - Refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling and acidification specifics.

- Practical notes and data integrity
  - If an analysis uses a fraction different from the primary specification (e.g., S by ICP/OES vs IC), laboratories must monitor for bias and report comparability.
  - Documentation of instrument maintenance, calibration, drift, and staff training is linked to records of methodological changes and suitability.

- Illustrative example
  - Includes an accuracy record example (SO4 2- measured by ion chromatography) and an outline of how accuracy results are reported and used to validate data quality.

- Summary for monitoring framework authors
  - Emphasizes standardized, auditable methodologies with annual governance review.
  - Establishes a clear framework for method validation, accuracy/precision assessment, and external QC participation.
  - Prioritizes data comparability across sites through unified detection limits, metadata in a central database, and explicit data transfer formats.
  - Provides a robust QC infrastructure to detect batch issues and enable intersite comparability and trend analysis.
