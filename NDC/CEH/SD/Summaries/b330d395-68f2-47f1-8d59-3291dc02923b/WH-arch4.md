# WH Protocol

- Aim: To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale:
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
  - Use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification to slow deterioration.
  - Requires training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance; refer to related background and quality control documents.

- Initial storage and handling:
  - Store samples cold (1–4°C) if more than seven hours pass before conductivity and pH measurements.
  - Return to cold storage if filtration is not completed the same day.
  - If samples are sent to another site for initial handling, ship on the collection day in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

- Conductivity measurement:
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Report results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm-1).

- pH measurement:
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample as conductivity but conductivity must be measured first and not returned to the main sample after measurement.
  - Use the method requiring separate glass and reference electrodes.
  - Report results to two decimals (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering:
  - Filter within 60 hours of collection using the Appendix I method.
  - Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, follow the priority order in the chemical analysis documentation.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis:
  - Store at 1–4°C.
  - Ideally complete analysis within 16 days of collection; definitely within 28 days.
  - If samples are sent to another location for analysis, minimize the transit period.

- Data management and sample labeling:
  - Use unique sample codes and ensure proper documentation for data submission to the ECN database.
  - Containers must be labeled with: ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06), ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date, and any additional sampler code to uniquely identify the sample.
  - If volume >100 ml, subsample 20 ml for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.

- Appendix I: Filtering (equipment and procedure highlights)
  - Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters 0.45 µm (Whatman WCN), glass fibre filters GF/C, vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
  - Handling: rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; use a filter for each sample.
  - Pre-filtration: SS and rivers water may require pre-filtering through a glass fibre filter, which must be washed with 250 ml distilled water before use.
  - Subsampling: for volumes >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe analysis and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
  - Labeling: containers must include site, measurement, location, date, and sampler details.

- Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing
  - Use a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
  - Cleaning options: automated washing or overnight soaking in Decon-90.
  - Rinse sequence: four rinses with tap water, three with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and re-cap; store to avoid contamination.
  - Ensure containers are dry and free of moisture before reuse.
