# WH Protocol

## Overview
- Protocol for measuring conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- Includes subsequent filtration prior to chemical analysis.
- Emphasizes steps to slow sample deterioration: filtration, cold storage, and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
- Notes that some activities require trained personnel and specialized equipment; references to further QC procedures and standard methods.

## Data quality and standardization (aim aligned)
- Standardized procedures enable consistent data handling and comparability over time.
- Samples are labeled and tracked with unique codes that feed into the ECN database.
- Underpins transparent quality control and data storage for monitoring and policy assessment.

## Sample handling and storage
- Initial storage: store at 1–4°C if measurement delay >7 hours; re-cool if not filtered the same day; ship samples promptly if sent elsewhere.
- In transit: use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.
- Conductivity: measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
- pH: measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; use the same subsample as for conductivity (conductivity first); report to 0.01 pH unit.
- Filtering: perform within 60 hours using Appendix I method; record filtering details; filter should be used to determine key ions and DOC (DOC optional for precipitation).
- Storage before analysis: keep 1–4°C; analysis ideally within 16 days, but within 28 days maximum.
- Acidification for Al/Fe: if needed, acidification of a 20 ml subsample with 20 µl HCl.

## Filtration procedure (Appendix I)
- Equipment: filter funnel, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Handling: rinse all contact surfaces with deionized/distilled water; do not touch filters or contact surfaces by hand; move filters with forceps; one filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: soils/rivers may require pre-filtering with glass fibre filter; rinse pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Sample transfer: pour filtered water into a clean, dry bottle; do not return to the unfiltered bottle.
- Sub-sample for Al/Fe: for volumes >100 ml, take a 20 ml subsample for Al/Fe and acidify as specified.
- Documentation: label containers with ECN Site ID, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; include this reference on final data submission to ECN.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Keep samples at 1–4°C.
- Analyze within 16 days preferred; up to 28 days acceptable.
- If sending to another site, minimize time out of cold storage and arrange next-day delivery where possible.

## Bottle and vial washing (Appendix II)
- Cleaning agents: phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agents.
- Cleaning routine: wash in a laboratory cleaning agent before first use and about every six months or after high contamination.
- Rinsing: four taps with tap water followed by three rinses with deionized/distilled water; between uses, rinse three times with distilled water and reuse with the same sampler.
- Drying and storage: shake dry, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, then re-cap immediately.
- Decon products: available from multiple suppliers (e.g., BDH, Decon-90).

## Quality control, safety, and references
- Training and safety: some steps require laboratory training and chemical-handling safety precautions.
- References include HMSO methods (conductivity, pH) and supplier information for equipment and reagents; authorship listed (J.K. Adamson and HMSO documents).

## Practical outputs for analysts
- Clear, time-bound procedures ensure data comparability across time and sites.
- Standardized data formats and unique sample identifiers support robust data storage and portal submission (ECN database).
- Explicit ordering of determinands for cuando sample volume is limited, ensuring priority measurements are recorded.
