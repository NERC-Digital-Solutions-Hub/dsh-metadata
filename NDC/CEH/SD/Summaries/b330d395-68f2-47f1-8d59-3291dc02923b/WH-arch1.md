# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; to slow this, use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training and safety measures; background quality control procedures are provided in referenced documents.

## Initial storage Method
- Store samples cold (1°C to 4°C) if more than seven hours elapse before conductivity and pH measurement.
- Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed on the same day as measurements.
- If samples are sent to another site, ship the same day; in transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Follow HMSO (1978) method; report results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample (subsample used for both conductivity and pH; conductivity measured first).
- Use separate glass and reference electrodes according to HMSO (1988) method.
- Report results to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH4⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO3⁻-N, SO4²⁻, PO4³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (DOC not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, prioritise analyses with a dedicated priority order (chemical determinands).
- For Al and Fe, transfer a 20 ml subsample (if volume allows) and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Documentation: label containers with ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler code; include this reference with final data for the ECN database.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1°C to 4°C.
- Analyze preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days of collection.
- If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage; aim for next-day delivery.

- WH Protocol references and background materials guiding sample handling and quality control.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters (Whatman WCN 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Handling: rinse all filter contacts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; avoid hand contact with filters and contact surfaces; use forceps; each filter for a single sample.
- Pre-filtration: soils solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtration through GF filters; wash GF filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsampling: if sample volume > 100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al/Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Sample labeling: include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any additional sampler code; ensure unique reference appears with final ECN data.
- Suppliers: BDH, Millipore, with contact details provided in the Appendix.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers cleaned with a laboratory cleaning agent before first use and approximately every six months or after high contamination (e.g., bird droppings).
- Cleaning agent must be free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Cleaning options: Decon-90 (or Decomatic if available) or other suitable decontaminants; multiple rinses with tap water and deionised/distilled water.
- After washing: shake to remove drops, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and re-cap immediately.
- Decon products can be obtained from listed suppliers (BDH, etc.).

## Procedure
- The WH Protocol outlines the overall procedure for initial water handling, including the steps above and references to specific supplier details and method documents.
