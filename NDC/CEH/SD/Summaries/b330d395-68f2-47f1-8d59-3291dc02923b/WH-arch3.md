# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water, and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; deterioration is slowed by filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are provided in referenced documents.

## Initial storage method
- Store samples cold (1–4°C) if more than seven hours elapse before measurement.
- Return unfiltered samples to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day.
- If sending to another site, ship the same day; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; express to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
- Conductivity measurement should be performed before pH, using a separate subsample; do not return the subsample to the main sample after measurement.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; use methods requiring separate glass and reference electrodes; express to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using the method in Appendix I.
- Record filtration details with unique sample codes; if sample volume is limited, prioritise determinands accordingly.
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved ions including Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3-N, SO4, PO4, alkalinity, and DOC (DOC optional for precipitation water).

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C; analyse preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent elsewhere, minimise out-of-storage time; plan next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

## Author references
- References to J.K. Adamson and HMSO methodologies (1978, 1988) for conductivity, pH, and related procedures.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Handling: avoid contact with filter surfaces; use forceps; one filter per sample; soil/river pre-filters may require pre-washing.
- Sample handling: if >100 ml, transfer 20 ml for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labelling: containers must include ECN Site ID, Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; data should be submitted with a unique reference to the ECN database.
- Suppliers: contact details for BDH and Millipore provided.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers washed with a cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite; use Decon-90 or Decomatic; rinse repeatedly with tap and deionised water; air-dry and recap; reuse with the same sampler.

## Procedure
- Documented steps and supplier information support standardized sample handling, traceability, and data integrity for environmental monitoring.
