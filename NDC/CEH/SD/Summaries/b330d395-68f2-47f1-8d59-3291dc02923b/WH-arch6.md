# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Use three methods to slow deterioration: filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations only) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, experience, and safety compliance; seek guidance from chemists performing analyses.
- Background and quality control procedures are documented in related materials.

## Initial storage Method
- Store samples cold (1°C–4°C) if the interval before measuring conductivity/pH exceeds seven hours.
- Return to cold storage if filtration is not completed the same day as measurements.
- If sending to another site, ship on the collection day by fastest method.
- In transit, place samples in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the specified HMSO (1978) method.
- Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample.
- Use the HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes; conductance measured first.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Perform filtering within 60 hours of collection following Appendix I.
- Record filtering details using the unique sample codes described in the Protocols.
- After filtration, analyze for dissolved Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO4 2−, PO4 3−, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is limited, prioritize determinands according to Appendix I of the Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1°C–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection but definitely within 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize out-of-cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Author References
- WH Protocol references: J.K. Adamson; HMSO 1978 and 1988, with notes on conductivity and pH measurement in low ionic strength waters.

## Washing bottles
- Refer to Appendix II for bottle and vial washing procedures.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly (eg Millipore Sterifil, 47 mm), membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
- Procedures: rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch contact surfaces with hands; use forceps; single-use filters per sample.
- Optional pre-filtering for soils and rivers; pre-filter filters must be washed with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Subsamples (≤100 ml total) may be taken for Al and Fe (acidified with 20 µL HCl if volume allows).
- Labeling: ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code; ensure the unique reference appears with final data submitted to the ECN database.
- Supplier information for components (BDH, Millipore) included.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers washed with a phosphate-free laboratory cleaning agent; use Decon products (Decon 90, Decomatic as appropriate) and rinse sequence: four taps of tap water and three of deionised water, or equivalent cleaning protocol.
- After washing: shake dry, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, and recapped immediately.
- Cleaning schedules: adopt routine intervals (approx. every six months) or as needed after contamination.

## Procedure
- The document provides the procedural alignment for sample processing, storage, filtering, analysis, and data documentation.
- Suppliers and contact details are listed for protocol components and cleaning agents.
