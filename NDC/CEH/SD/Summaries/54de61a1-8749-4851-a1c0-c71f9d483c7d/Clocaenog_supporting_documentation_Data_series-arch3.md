# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and context
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment in upland moorland to reflect 20–30 year climate predictions.
  - Automated roof technology creates drought and warming treatments; site established in 1998 in Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales.
  - Dominant habitat is wet upland heath (Calluna vulgaris) with a long-term replication of drought and warming treatments across plots.

- Climate change treatments and experimental design
  - Drought treatment: retractable roof reduces rainfall on treatment plots; originally May–Sept (1999–2011), since 2012 April–October; ≈80% of rain excluded during active drought periods.
  - Warming treatment: retractable aluminium curtains over plots to reduce heat loss at night; rain-induced retraction to protect rainfall; average site rainfall reduction ≈14%.
  - Treatment structure: 9 plots (three replications for each of three conditions: warming, drought, control) arranged in blocks to mirror shading effects; curtains do not operate in winds >10 m s-1.
  - Site data span: climate and treatment data collected from 1997 onward, with ongoing adjustments through 2014.

- Data types and measurements collected
  - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements of air temp, humidity, rainfall, wind, net radiation, PAR, etc.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily plot-level soil and air temperature, soil moisture.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (biweekly), rain chemistry samples (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4) analyzed in lab.
  - Throughfall (plot-level rainfall): biweekly measurements used to derive plot rainfall as a percentage change from site-level rainfall.
  - Water table depth: biweekly measurements via permeable tubes to bedrock (max detectable depths per plot).
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly measurements using collars; multiple instrument transitions (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, LI-COR 8100); data converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; automated campaigns in 2013–2014.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): static chambers with gas sampling and GC analysis; legacy processing notes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): chamber-based measurements (2002–2004, 2011) with adjustments for biomass.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient and response-curve measurements (two datasets: ambient conditions and response curves for selected species).
  - Vegetation survey data (plant biomass): Pin-point method across 3 quadrats per plot; annual surveys with biomass calibration; conversion from pin-hits to biomass.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2004, 2003–2004).
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth, and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, herbivory and fungal infection notes; 1999–2009 with ongoing observations.
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates; analyzed on green and senesced material.
  - Litterfall: monthly to yearly collection (1999–2002; later less frequent) with oven-dried mass and carbon/nitrogen analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (2003–2013) including soil cores, washing, and WinRHIZO analysis for fine root detection.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC measurements.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: incubation cores to estimate ammonium and nitrate fluxes (1998–2004).
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: core-based analyses to derive soil organic matter, carbon content and bulk density, with conversions to g m-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned soil water samplers (biweekly) analyzing pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC.

- Data processing, quality, and governance
  - Data handling across decades involved multiple instruments and methods; conversions between units (e.g., CO2 flux units) documented.
  - Quality control: basic visual QC in Excel used for on-site data validation; acknowledges limitations of automated bounds versus human memory of conditions.
  - Data processing notes for legacy datasets indicate variable documentation quality; some processing steps are described but not always fully archived.
  - Data storage and access: on-site storage with broader data archived at CEH Bangor; not all datasets are stored in the EIDC; contact listed for access to smaller or post-2015 datasets (Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett, CEH Bangor).

- Accessibility, metadata, and barriers
  - Data availability may be limited by: lack of good-quality data, access timeliness, organizational silos, need to publicly share underlying data, maintaining up-to-date metadata, data transformation requirements, and establishing data governance.
  - Documentation includes site layout appendices and quadrant layouts to support replicability and interpretation.

- Appendices and site layout
  - Appendix 1: plot and site layout with grid references and coordinates.
  - Appendix 2: quadrat layout and measurement areas.
  - Appendix 3: extended plot layout with quadrats and measurement zones.

- Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-temporal, multi-protocol monitoring framework integrating meteorological, ecological, and biogeochemical data.
  - Emphasizes the need for clear data provenance, cross-dataset compatibility, and transparent data governance to support policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
  - Highlights ongoing challenges for data sharing and metadata quality, which are central to effective monitoring and evaluation.
