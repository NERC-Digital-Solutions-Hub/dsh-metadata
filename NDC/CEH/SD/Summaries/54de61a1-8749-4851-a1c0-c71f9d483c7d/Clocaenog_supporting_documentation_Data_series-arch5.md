# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Overview
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming treatments reflecting 20–30 year climate predictions.
  - Located in Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales; established in 1998; powered by solar and wind.
  - Experimental design comprises replicated drought (D), warming (W), and control (C) treatments across nine plots (4 m x 5 m each) with three blocks.
  - Drought treatment reduces rainfall via retractable polyethylene roofs; warming treatment uses retractable aluminium mesh curtains to limit heat loss at night. Both treatments have operational limits in high winds.
  - Data cover a wide range of abiotic and biotic measurements, spanning 1998–current, with varying data formats and storage locations.

- Data inventory (Categories and key aspects)
  - AWS meteorological data (on-site automated weather station)
    - Variables: relative humidity, air temperature, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction.
    - Frequency/time scale: daily to current day (1999–present); mast height increased in 2007 after thefts.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data

  - Throughfall data (plot-level rainfall)
    - Plot-level rainfall captured biweekly; used to compute treatment-specific rainfall changes and adjust site rainfall to generate plot-level rainfall estimates.
  - Water table depth
    - Permeable tubes installed in 2009; biweekly measurements; maximum detectable depths per plot documented.
  - Soil respiration
    - CO2 flux measured with collars; multiple measurement methods over time (CIRAS-2, LICOR LI-8100, automated systems from 2013–2014); flux converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
    - Seasonal to ongoing campaigns; three collars per plot; vegetation disturbance monitored.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O)
    - Measured with static chambers on the same collars as soil respiration; samples analyzed by GC; multiple time periods (1999–2000, 2007–2009).
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE)
    - Measured in 2002–2004 and 2011 using Perspex chambers; data converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; biomass adjustments applied to account for plot variation.
  - Photosynthesis
    - Ambient measurements and response curves (PAR and Ci) for multiple years (2001–2007); data include leaf-level measurements and leaf mass data for standardization.
  - Vegetation survey data (plant biomass) – Pin Point method
    - Years: 1998–2012; three quadrats per plot; 300 pins per plot; pin-hits converted to biomass using calibration factors; biomass data converted to g m-2.
    - Detailed species codes and biomass calibration tables included.
  - Canopy reflectance
    - Ground-based NDVI (680 and 570) and PRI indices using spectrometer; measurements around solar noon; two time blocks (2001–2002, 2003–2004).
  - Vegetation phenology, growth and pathogens
    - Spring phenology for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum; shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, herbivory and pathogen signs; annual growth measurements across selected years.
  - Vegetation chemistry
    - Chemical analyses on green and senesced material; determinants include C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates.
  - Litterfall
    - Collected via litterfall collectors; 1999–2002 monthly; later irregular collection; samples dried and weighed; carbon and nitrogen analyses performed.
  - Root biomass
    - Core-based measurements across several years (2003–2013) using varying methods (soil cores, sieving, WinRHIZO analysis); depth-specific root extraction.
  - Soil microbial biomass
    - Chloroform fumigation method; 2000, 2001, 2012; microbial biomass carbon expressed per g soil organic matter.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation
    - Sporadic measurements (1998–2004) using initial/final cores and KCl extraction; ammonium and nitrate determined photometrically/autoanalyser.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density
    - SOM and SOC determined from paired cores; bulk density calculated; data converted to g m-2 basis.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry
    - Lysimeters and tensioned samplers; biweekly sampling; analyses include pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC via TOC, ammonium.
  - Appendix: site layout and quadrat layout
    - Plot layout references (Lysimeters, Pin quadrats, Soil suction samplers); quadrat positions.

- Data processing, units and methods
  - Data are processed to standardised flux units and time scales; examples:
    - Soil respiration: raw to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; historical instruments used CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, automated systems; conversions based on methane/CO2 gas constants and instrument-specific factors.
    - Net ecosystem exchange and photosynthesis: conversions between g CO2 m-2 h-1 and mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; LI-COR and CIRAS data reconciled with conversion factors.
  - Throughfall adjustments: plot-level rainfall inferred by applying percent differences to site rainfall data; missing data infilled with mean reductions when applicable.
  - Pin-point vegetation data: pin hits converted to biomass using species-specific calibration factors; missing pins corrected by ratios to maintain 300 pins per plot.
  - Data quality control: visual QC in Excel due to practical limitations; legacy data notes indicate some data processing steps for trace gases and other datasets may not be fully documented.
  - Data storage and access: not all data are stored in the EIDC; some datasets exist outside the on-site archive; contact CEH Bangor for access and specifics.

- Data governance, access and stewardship
  - Data stewardship focus: maintain data integrity, metadata, and provenance across diverse measurement platforms and long timescales; ensure metadata includes measurement methods, instruments, calibration, and time periods.
  - Accessibility notes: The documentation explicitly states that not all data are stored in the EIDC; for more details and access, contact Sabine Reinsch or Bridget Emmett at CEH Bangor.
  - Data continuity and legacy considerations: method changes (e.g., soil respiration instrumentation, throughfall corrections) require careful interpretation; some datasets are legacy with incomplete documentation of processing steps.
  - Recommended practices: maintain consistent site and plot identifiers, document data lineage, provide clear data dictionaries, and ensure data are accompanied by metadata describing collection methods, units, and processing steps.

- Appendices and site layout
  - Appendix 1 and 2 provide site and quadrat layouts; Appendix 3 shows plot layouts with quadrats and measurement areas.
  - Site reference: Grid SJ019519; coordinates 53.055 N, -3.465 W; notes on climate treatments and block structure.

- Practical takeaways for data stewardship
  - The Climoor dataset presents a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary time-series collection with diverse measurement technologies and several treatment regimes; requires robust metadata to enable discoverability, reuse, and cross-study synthesis.
  - Data governance should emphasize:
    - Clear data provenance and method documentation for each data type and year.
    - Consistent metadata standards across AWS, micro-met, soil, vegetation, and soil solution datasets.
    - Explicit storage plan for datasets not yet in centralized repositories (EIDC) and pathways for future data deposition.
    - Documentation of legacy processing steps and any data gaps or corrections to facilitate reproducibility.
