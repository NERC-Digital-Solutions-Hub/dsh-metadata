# Details of data structure

- Purpose: Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series described in Clocaenog_supporting documentation_Data series.rtf, outlining how the dataset is structured.
- Dataset format: One spreadsheet with 38 columns.
- Columns and content:
  - Date
  - Soil temperature (°C) at 5 cm soil depth for plots 1–9
  - Soil temperature (°C) at 20 cm soil depth for plots 1–9
  - Air temperature (°C) 20 cm above the soil surface for plots 1–9
  - Soil moisture (m3/m3) for plots 1–9
- Row-level details:
  - The second row contains the plot number information.
  - Empty cells indicate that data are not available for that day.
- Data granularity and scope:
  - Daily measurements across multiple plots and variables (temperature at two depths, air temperature, and soil moisture) for plots 1–9.
- Units:
  - Temperature: degrees Celsius
  - Soil moisture: cubic metres per cubic metre (m3/m3)
- Data quality considerations:
  - Missing data are indicated by empty cells; assess patterns of missingness to determine data usability.
  - The document notes a potential discrepancy in column count (stated as 38 columns) vs. the described content (columns for multiple plots and variables), suggesting a need to verify the exact schema with the supporting documentation.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - This file serves as structural documentation for the data series and should be cross-referenced with the Clocaenog supporting documentation for full metadata and context.
- Practical implications for data leaders:
  - Useful for planning data quality checks, gap analysis, and data discovery workflows.
  - Supports cross-plot and cross-depth comparisons for soil temperature and moisture, but requires confirmation of column mappings and consistent metadata.
  - Highlighted need for clear metadata, data standards, and discoverability to address issues such as data gaps and ambiguous column definitions.
