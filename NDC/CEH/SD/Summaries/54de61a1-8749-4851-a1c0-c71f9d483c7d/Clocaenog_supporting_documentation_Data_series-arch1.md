# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years in upland moorland.
  - Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales (53°03'19"N, -3°27'55"W); established 1998.
  - Ecosystem: upland west-atlantic moorland dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather); rich bryophyte and shrub community; soil is humo-ferric podzol.
  - Data emphasis: comprehensive, long-term abiotic and biotic measurements across climate treatments to inform ecological responses and modeling.

- Climate change treatments and experimental design
  - Treatments: drought (D) and warming (W), each with three replicated plots (4 m x 5 m). Three control plots mirror shading effects of structures; total of 9 plots arranged in blocks.
  - Drought treatment
    - Timing: May–September (1999–2011); from 2012, April–October.
    - Method: retractable polyethylene roof over plot; rainfall exclusion reduces annual rainfall by ~20% and excludes ~80% of rain during the drought period.
    - Operation constraints: curtains do not operate in high winds (>10 m/s).
  - Warming treatment
    - Method: retractable aluminium mesh curtains over plots; reflects 96–97% of IR radiation, reducing night-time heat loss; nighttime warming implemented after dusk (~15 minutes with light threshold).
    - Rainfall interactions: roof retraction occurs during rain to minimize rainfall loss; overall annual rainfall reduction ~14%.
    - Operation constraints: curtains paused in high winds (>10 m/s).
  - Treatment schedule details are summarized in accompanying tables (Tables 1–2) with site-specific climate inputs (1997–2014) and growing-season adjustments.

- Site information and baseline characteristics
  - Growing season: typically June–August; shoulder seasons April–May and September–October; winter dormancy November–February.
  - Soil and depth characteristics: variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons; typical depth 6–17 cm for E horizon when visible.
  - Baseline climate and deposition: mean site temperature around 8.0°C; mean soil temperatures ~7.5°C in control plots; mean annual rainfall ~1411 mm; total nitrogen deposition ~20–25 kg N ha^-1 yr^-1.
  - Vegetation and biomass context: Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum; bryophytes and litter dynamics documented; representative forested understory and moss layers recorded.

- Data types, instruments, and data processing (overview)
  - Data inventory (summary): AWS meteorological data; plot-scale micro-meteorological data; rainfall and rainfall chemistry; throughfall rainfall; water table depth; soil respiration; trace gases (CH4, N2O); net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE); photosynthesis; vegetation biomass (Pin-point); canopy reflectance; vegetation phenology; vegetation chemistry; litterfall; root biomass; soil microbial biomass; nitrogen mineralisation; SOM/SOC/bulk density; soil solution and leachate chemistry.
  - Data collection cadence and history: daily to weekly measurements for many variables; long-running datasets (1998–present where possible); multiple measurement technologies evolved over time (e.g., CIRAS versus LI-COR systems for respiration).
  - Data processing and standardization highlights
    - Conversion between raw units to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1 for respiration and NEE using established factor conversions.
    - Biomass calibration for Pin-point data using species-specific conversion factors derived from destructive sampling.
    - Canopy reflectance indices (NDVI at 680 and 570 nm; PRI) calculated from ground-based spectrometry.
    - Phenology and growth metrics collected for leading shoots; standardization across years and species (Calluna, Vaccinium, Empetrum).
    - Litterfall data aggregated to annual biomass and converted to g m^-2.
  - Data management and accessibility
    - Most data described as stored, but not all are in the Environmental Information and Data Centre (EIDC); older or less-frequently collected datasets may be outside the portal.
    - Contacts for data details: Sabine Reinsch and Bridget Emmett (CEH Bangor) for additional data specifics and availability.

- Specific data collection methods and datasets (highlights by topic)
  - AWS meteorological data
    - Sensors: temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, winds.
    - Positioning: originally at 1 m, moved to 4 m after thefts; data sampled every minute, reported as hourly or half-hourly averages.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data
    - Soil and air temperature, soil moisture via TDR sensors and earlier theta probes; data logged daily.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry
    - Site-level rainfall via storage rain gauge (biweekly collection; robust to power issues).
    - Rainfall chemistry: pH, nitrate, chloride, sulfate, DOC, ammonium using ion chromatography and TOC analyses.
  - Throughfall data
    - Plot-level rain collectors (biweekly); data quality checks and exclusions when equipment malfunctions occur; percent-change method used to infer treatment rainfall relative to site rainfall.
  - Water table depth
    - Permeable tubes to bedrock (installed 2009); biweekly manual readings; maximum detectable depths recorded per plot.
  - Soil respiration and trace gases
    - Three collars per plot; progression from static chamber with gas analyzer to automated LI-COR-based systems (2013–2014); respiration expressed as mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1; CH4 and N2O measured with static chambers and GC analysis.
    - Automated campaigns in 2013–2014 with hourly measurements for at least 24 hours per plot.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE)
    - Measurements in 2002–2004 and 2011 using CIRAS-2 and later LI-COR systems; respiration corrections using biomass-adjusted fluxes.
  - Photosynthesis
    - Ambient and response-curve measurements for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum; PAR and Ci controls; leaf mass and area through destructive sampling for standardization.
  - Vegetation biomass and Canopy
    - Pin-point vegetation surveys (1998–2012; quadrats C7, D4, F6; 300 pins per plot); conversion factors to biomass developed per species; bryophyte pooling for calibration.

    - Root biomass from multiple core methods across years (2003, 2004, 2008, 2011); various core sizes and extraction protocols.
    - Soil microbial biomass via chloroform fumigation (2000, 2001, 2012).

- Practical notes, challenges, and data quality
  - Legacy data caveats: some data processing steps may not align with current best practices; data quality control historically performed visually in Excel rather than automated checks.
  - Data gaps and scale challenges: drought and warming data span several years with occasional missing plots due to equipment issues or data gaps; rainfall throughfall adjustments require careful handling when plot data are lost.
  - Access and discoverability: some data may not be housed in central portals; direct contact advised for dataset availability and metadata.
