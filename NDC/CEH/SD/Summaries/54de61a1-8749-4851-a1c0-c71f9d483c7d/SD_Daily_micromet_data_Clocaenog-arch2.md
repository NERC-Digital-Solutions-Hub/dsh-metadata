# This document is a supplement to the supporting documentation for data series detailed in: 'Clocaenog_supporting documentation_Data series.rtf'

## Purpose and scope
- Provides details about the data structure for the dataset referenced in the supporting documentation.
- Supports consistent monitoring and interpretation of environmental conditions across time and plots.

## Data structure details
- The dataset is a single spreadsheet containing 38 columns.
- Columns include:
  - Date
  - Soil temperature at 5 cm depth for plots 1–9
  - Soil temperature at 20 cm depth for plots 1–9
  - Air temperature at 20 cm above the soil surface for plots 1–9
  - Soil moisture (m3/m3) for plots 1–9
- The second row contains the plot number(s).
- Empty cells indicate missing data for that day.

## Data handling and quality (Analyst perspective)
- Data are expected to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as part of standard monitoring workflows.
- Analyses should use standardized methods and outputs (e.g., reports, maps, charts) to illustrate environmental health over time.
- Datasets should be stored persistently and uploaded to the appropriate data portals to enable reuse and accessibility.

## Context and usage
- This document serves as a supplement to the main supporting documentation for the data series.
- The dataset supports monitoring environmental conditions (soil and air temperatures, soil moisture) across multiple plots (1–9) and dates, aiding assessment of environmental health and policy-relevant trends.
