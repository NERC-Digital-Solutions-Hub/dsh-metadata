# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose of box and whisker plots
- Used to provide a visual check of data quality and to assist in interpreting the distribution of LOCAR data.

## What the plots show
- Y-axis: number line corresponding to units of the determinand.
- X-axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; site IDs represent sites.

## Key plot elements
- Red line: median.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## How whiskers are calculated
- Lower whisker: Q1 - 1.5 * IQR.
- Upper whisker: Q3 + 1.5 * IQR.
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 - Q1.

## Outliers
- Values outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Overall use
- Box and whisker plots aid in visually assessing data quality, distribution, and the presence of outliers across sites. A diagram illustrating the concept is referenced but not shown.
