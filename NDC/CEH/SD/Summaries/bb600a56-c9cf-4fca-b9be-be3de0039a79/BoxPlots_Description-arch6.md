# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of a dataset to provide a visual check of data quality and distribution.
- Purpose:
  - Helps interpret how data are spread and where most values lie.
  - Assists in identifying outliers and assessing data quality across sites.
- Plot structure:
  - Y-axis uses the number line and relates to the units of the determinand.
  - X-axis shows different sites; site IDs represent these sites.
  - Red line indicates the median.
  - Box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
  - Whiskers are calculated as:
    - Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR
    - Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR
    - IQR = Q3 − Q1
  - Points outside whiskers are considered outliers.
- Interpretation guidance:
  - Observe how much data fall inside the box versus outside.
  - Longer whiskers indicate greater variability; more outliers suggest data quality or measurement differences across sites.
