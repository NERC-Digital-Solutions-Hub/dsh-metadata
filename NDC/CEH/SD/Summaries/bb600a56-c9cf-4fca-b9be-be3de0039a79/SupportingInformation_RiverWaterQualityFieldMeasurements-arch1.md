# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rivers   (2003-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- LOCAR baseline dataset documenting river water quality measurements (2003–2006).
- Fortnightly sampling at 23 sites across the Frome, Piddle, Pang, Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
- Aimed at establishing baseline water quality for LOCAR; includes multiple solutes and nutrients.

## Variables measured
- Alkalinity as CaCO3 (mg/l)
- Ammonia (mg/l N)
- Chloride-ion (mg/l Cl)
- Conductivity at 20°C (µS/cm)
- Nitrate (mg/l N)
- pH (pH units)
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) (mg/l P)
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD) (mg/l SiO2)
- Sulfate (mg/l SO4)

## Study sites and locations
- Samples taken at Environment Agency monitoring sites; some coincide with NRFA stations.
- 23 LOCAR LCWQ sites across the catchments (examples of site codes: FP01, FP02, FP06, FP11, FP12, FP15, FP21, FP22, FP23, FP26, FP31, PL09, PL15, PL17, PL18, PL19, PL20, TE03, TE05, TE09, TE16, TE20, TE22).
- LCWQ denotes LOCAR water quality sampling site; NRFA stations noted for some sites.

## Timing
- Routine fortnightly sampling from November 2003 to June 2006.

## Sampling and analysis methods
- Sampling: single main-flow river sample per site, collected in bottles supplied by Thames Water.
- Handling: pH and alkalinity in glass bottle; SRP filtered in the field; other determinands unfiltered.
- Analysis: Thames Water laboratories conducted analyses.
- Nitrate conversion: nitrate values given as mg/l NO3 converted to mg/l N using factor 14/64.
- Documentation: detailed methodology and quality indicators provided by Thames Water.

## Who collected and processed data
- Field collection by Catchment Service Team; samples sent to Thames Water for analysis.

## Data quality and quality assurance
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water.
- Weekly QA: duplicate and QC samples sent to Thames Water for inter-lab comparison.
- Data presentation includes box-and-whisker plots to summarize range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Analytical performance notes (calibration, accuracy, detection limits) provided for each analyte:
  - Example accuracies: chloride ~99.3% (with ~5% uncertainty), nitrate ~98.9%, SRP ~100.5%, SRD ~91.2%, sulfate ~94.5%, ammonia ~94%.
  - Detection limits and method-specific details (e.g., LODs, measurement approaches) documented.
- Data handling: all determinations labeled with units and methods; nitrogen in nitrate converted to nitrogen content where applicable.
