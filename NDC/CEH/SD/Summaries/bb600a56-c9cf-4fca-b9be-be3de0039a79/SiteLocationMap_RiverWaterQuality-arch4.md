# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

- Purpose and scope
  - Focuses on a river water quality site within the Pang Lambo urn catchment, identified as LCWQ; relevant to data leaders planning data strategy around environmental monitoring.

- Data availability and discovery
  - Consider how data from this site is located, stored, and accessed (platforms, search methods, and contacts for data owners).
  - Identify any gaps or granularity shortfalls that limit analysis or monitoring.

- Data quality, standards, and metadata
  - Assess data format, quality, update frequency, and the completeness/clarity of metadata.
  - Ensure data suitability for intended analyses and decision-making.

- Data governance and stewardship
  - Establish responsibilities for data ownership, version control, documentation, and long-term discoverability.

- User needs and co-ownership
  - Align data products with user requirements (e.g., policy colleagues) and explore opportunities for co-ownership and joint stewardship.

- System-wide integration
  - Position the LCWQ site within the broader data ecosystem for catchment management, ensuring interoperability with other data sources.

- Access, barriers, and compliance
  - Anticipate potential access challenges (data protection rules, restricted access, or other constraints) and plan mitigation strategies.

- Collaboration and communities of practice
  - Engage with the wider data community to share standards, practices, and improvements to the environmental data system.

- Recommended actions for data leaders
  - Verify data availability, granularity, and quality; map data gaps.
  - Coordinate data collection or commissioning as needed.
  - Implement robust metadata, data formats, and update procedures.
  - Prioritize user-centered design and feedback to refine data products.
  - Foster collaboration across partners to enhance the catchment data ecosystem.
