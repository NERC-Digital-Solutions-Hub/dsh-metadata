# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rivers   (2003-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Overview
- LOCAR baseline dataset of river water quality measurements collected between 2003 and 2006.
- 23 sampling sites across four catchments: Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern.
- Data collected as part of the Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) programme.
- Site locations generally align with Environment Agency monitoring sites and NRFA stations.

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Spatial: 23 monitoring sites within the Frome, Piddle, Pang, Lambourn, and Tern catchments (sites identified with codes such as FP01, FP11, PL09, TE05, etc.).
- Temporal: Routine fortnightly sampling from November 2003 to June 2006; variable site length depending on location.

## Variables Measured
- Alkalinity (as CaCO3)
- Ammonia (mg/l N)
- Chloride-ion (mg/l Cl)
- Conductivity at 20°C (µS/cm)
- Nitrate (mg/l N; nitrate measured as NO3 and converted to N)
- pH (pH units)
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP, mg/l P)
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD, mg/l SiO2)
- Sulphate (mg/l SO4)

## Sampling and Analytical Methods
- Sampling: One sample from the main flow per site; bottles prepared by Thames Water Laboratory.
  - pH and alkalinity: glass bottle.
  - SRP: filtered in the field.
  - Other determinands: unfiltered samples.
- Analysis: Thames Water conducted laboratory measurements using standard methods.
  - Nitrate conversion applied as needed (NO3 to N).
  - Site data logged with method-specific parameters (e.g., detection limits, calibration standards).
- Field collection: Conducted by Catchment Service Team; samples sent to Thames Water for analysis.

## Data Quality and Provenance
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water.
- Weekly routine inclusion of duplicate and QC samples for cross-checking results.
- Data quality checks included box-and-whisker plots to summarize range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Data align with EA monitoring sites; several sites linked to NRFA station references.

## Notes on Use for GIS and Data Integration
- Data are suitable for map-based visualization of spatial patterns in water quality across multiple catchments and time periods.
- Useful for comparing across sites with LCWQ designation and aligning with NRFA geospatial data where available.
- Raw data include detailed QA metrics and site-specific metadata (site codes, catchment codes, and NRFA references) for integration into GIS workflows.
