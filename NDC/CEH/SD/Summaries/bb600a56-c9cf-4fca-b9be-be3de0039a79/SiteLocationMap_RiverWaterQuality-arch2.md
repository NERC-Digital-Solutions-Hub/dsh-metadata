# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Purpose
- Identifies a specific river water quality monitoring site within the Pang Lambourn catchment, referred to as LCWQ.

## Relevance to Environmental Analysts
- Aligns with standard monitoring workflows: using established data sources, quality assurance, data cleaning and transformation.
- Analyzes data using standardised methods to assess water quality against standards.
- Produces outputs such as reports, maps, and charts.
- Ensures datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.

## Likely Contents (inferred from the title)
- Site location, identifier, and catchment context.
- Measured water quality parameters (e.g., nutrients, dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, etc.).
- Sampling frequency, methods, and QA procedures.
- Data management practices and portal submission details.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts
- Increasing the value of the LCWQ dataset by integrating with related environmental data.
- Facilitating access to underlying data used to generate outputs for broader scrutiny and use.
