# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose of the box and whisker plots
- Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of LOCAR data.
- They provide a visual check of data quality and help interpret the distribution.

## Plot components
- Y-axis: number line, corresponding to the units of the determinand.
- X-axis: different sites, represented by site IDs.
- Red line: median of the data.
- Box edges: Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Whiskers and outliers
- Lower whisker: Q1 - 1.5 × IQR.
- Upper whisker: Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 - Q1.
- Points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation notes
- Used to visually assess data quality, distribution shape, and the presence of outliers.
- The description references a diagram illustrating these concepts.
