# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose of the box and whisker plots
- Provide a visual check of data quality for LOCAR measurements.
- Aid interpretation of data distribution (range, central tendency, spread).
- Help assess whether most data fall within expected ranges and identify outliers.

## Plot structure and axes
- y-axis: number line corresponding to the units of the determinand being displayed.
- x-axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; each site represented by its Site ID.
- Red line inside the box: median.

## Box and whisker components
- Box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR.
- Upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- Data points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and application
- Use the plot to judge data distribution, the concentration of values within the central box, and overall spread.
- Assess the presence and extent of outliers across sites.
- Supports quality assurance by providing a standardized visual summary of LOCAR baseline data.
