# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Overview
- Focus on a river water quality monitoring site within the Pang Lambourn catchment, designated as LCWQ.

## Data Approach (Analyst perspective)
- Define data-driven questions the LCWQ site can answer (e.g., current status, trends, potential drivers).
- Identify and assemble relevant data: river water quality measurements (pH, dissolved oxygen, nutrients, turbidity, contaminants, etc.), sampling dates, site metadata; and auxiliary data (rainfall, river flow, land use, upstream activities).
- Data quality and governance: implement QA/QC, validate data, handle missing values, standardize units and formats.
- Data processing: clean, transform, and integrate multiple datasets; align temporal and spatial scales.
- Analysis: perform descriptive statistics, trend analyses, correlations with drivers, multivariate analyses, and develop predictive models (time-series or regression-based) where appropriate.
- Visualization and reporting: create charts, trend visualizations, and maps; clearly state conclusions and uncertainties.
- Reproducibility and discoverability: document data sources, maintain metadata, and upload datasets to accessible portals when possible.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Data availability at the catchment/local scale; potential data gaps.
- Access barriers to datasets (documentation, permissions, registration).
- Heterogeneous data formats and standards complicating unification.
- Data protection and privacy considerations, especially for health-related implications.
- IT barriers: restrictions, legacy software, and computational demands for large datasets.
- Translating findings into actionable insights for managers and stakeholders.

## Practical Next Steps for Analysts
- Confirm the scope and key questions with stakeholders.
- Compile LCWQ site data and relevant ancillary datasets.
- Establish QA/QC procedures and a streamlined data pipeline.
- Run initial analyses to establish baselines and identify trends or anomalies.
- Produce an evidence-based report with clear conclusions and actionable recommendations.
- Document data sources and metadata; share or publish datasets to enhance discoverability.
