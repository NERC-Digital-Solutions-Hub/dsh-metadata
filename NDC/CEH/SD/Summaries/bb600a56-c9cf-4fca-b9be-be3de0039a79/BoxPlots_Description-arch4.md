# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Box and whisker plots display the range, median, and quartiles of the LOCAR data.
- Purpose is to provide a visual check of data quality and to aid interpretation of the data distribution.

## Plot structure
- Y axis: number line relevant to the units of the determinand.
- X axis: different sites where the determinand was measured; site ID represents sites.
- Median: red line inside the box.
- Quartiles: box edges represent Q1 (25th percentile) and Q3 (75th percentile).

## Statistical definitions
- IQR (interquartile range) = Q3 − Q1.
- Lower whisker = Q1 − 1.5 × IQR; upper whisker = Q3 + 1.5 × IQR.
- Points outside the whiskers are considered outliers.

## Interpretation and use
- The plots help assess data distribution and variability across sites.
- Outliers highlight unusual observations and potential data quality issues.
- Useful for visually evaluating data quality and guiding further data reporting or cleaning steps.

## Notes
- The description references a diagram below illustrating the concepts.
