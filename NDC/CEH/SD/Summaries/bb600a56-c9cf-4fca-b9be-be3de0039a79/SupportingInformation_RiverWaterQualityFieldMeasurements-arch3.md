# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rivers   (2003-2006) [LOCAR]
LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS
LOCAR

## Aim and scope
- Field-based baseline assessment of river water chemistry as part of the LOCAR programme.
- Fortnightly sampling (2003–2006) at 23 Environment Agency monitoring sites across the Frome, Piddle, Pang, Lambourn and Tern catchments.

## Measured parameters and units
- Alkalinity as CaCO3: mg/l
- Nitrate (as N): mg/l N (converted from mg/l NO3 where applicable)
- Ammonia: mg/l as N
- Chloride-ion: mg/l Cl
- Conductivity at 20°C: µS/cm
- pH: pH units
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP): mg/l P
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD): mg/l SiO2
- Sulphate: mg/l SO4

## Sampling locations and catchments
- EA monitoring sites; many correspond to NRFA stations.
- Catchments included: Frome/Piddle (FP), Pang/Lambourn (PL), and Tern (TE).
- Site codes (e.g., FP01, FP11, PL09, TE05) and NRFA station identifiers provided for linking site data.

## Sampling frequency and procedures
- Routine sampling occurred fortnightly from November 2003 to June 2006.
- A single main-flow river sample collected per site per occasion.
- Sample handling:
  - pH and alkalinity: glass bottle.
  - SRP: field-filtered.
  - Other determinands: unfiltered.
- Field collection by Catchment Service Team; analyses performed by Thames Water.

## Laboratory methods and analytical performance
- Analyte-specific methods (Seal discrete analyser or pH/conductivity electrodes) used for:
  - Chloride-ion, Sulphate, Nitrate, SRD, SRP, Ammonia, pH, Conductivity, Alkalinity.
- Quality indicators (examples):
  - Calibration standards, mean concentration accuracy (e.g., around 94–100% for several analytes), and reported uncertainties (varying by analyte, e.g., ~5–21%).
  - Limit of detection (LOD) values provided for each parameter.
  - Nitrate conversion from mg/l NO3 to mg/l N using the standard 14/64 factor.

## Data quality and governance
- Thames Water conducted data quality control.
- Weekly/regular inclusion of duplicate and QC samples for inter-laboratory comparison.
- Data visualised with box-and-whisker plots to display range, median, quartiles and outliers.
- Documentation includes detailed methodological notes and calibration/uncertainty information to support data interpretation and comparability.

## Notes for interpretation and use
- Fortnightly frequency provides a baseline trajectory of river chemistry over multiple seasons and catchments.
- Data are linked to specific sites and NRFA stations, enabling integration with broader hydrological datasets.
- Conversion note: nitrate sometimes recorded as NO3 and converted to mg/l N for unit consistency.
