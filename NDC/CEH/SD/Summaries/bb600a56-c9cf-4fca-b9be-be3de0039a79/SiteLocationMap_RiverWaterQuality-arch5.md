# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Overview
- Represents a dataset focused on river water quality at a site within the Pang Lambourn catchment, associated with LCWQ.
- Likely includes measurements or observations of water quality parameters collected at a specific location over time.

## Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Data Stewards ensure appropriate data governance, storage, sharing, and discoverability for this dataset.
- Aligns with the practice of understanding user needs to produce usable, well-documented data.

## Metadata and Standards
- Emphasizes documentation of dataset standards (accuracy, consistency, metadata, format).
- Capture provenance: who collected data, methods, instruments, sampling frequency, and QA/QC procedures.
- Define data formats and schema to support interoperability across systems.

## Data Quality and Transformation
- Perform quality assurance, cleaning, and necessary transformations before sharing.
- Identify and document any data limitations, gaps, or embargoes (disclosure risks, proprietary issues).

## Access, Sharing, and Residency
- Ensure sharing limitations are respected; determine licenses and access rights.
- Plan for updates and version control; decide on embargo periods if applicable.
- Upload to relevant portals and catalogue the dataset for discovery by data users.

## Data Lifecycle and Maintenance
- Establish processes for incoming data, ongoing updates, and change management.
- Maintain metadata and documentation of work performed on the dataset.

## Challenges to Anticipate
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Timely acquisition of data from creators.
- Ensuring metadata and standards are met across diverse data producers.
- Handling multiple systems and formats, including non-interoperable ones.
- Managing large datasets and potential legacy databases requiring bespoke solutions.

## Recommended Actions for Data Stewards
- Engage with data creators to define and align on standards and metadata requirements.
- Document data provenance, collection methods, and QA/QC procedures.
- Ensure timely ingestion, transformation, and preparation of data for sharing.
- Catalog and publish the dataset with clear licensing, access terms, and update schedules.
- Maintain ongoing dialogue with data users to refine dataset usability and discoverability.
