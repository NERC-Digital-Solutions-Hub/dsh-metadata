# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity, pH and nutrients in rivers (2003-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

- Overview
  - LOCAR baseline dataset of river water quality featuring measurements from 23 sites across the Frome, Piddle, Pang, Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
  - Sampling period: fortnighly from November 2003 to June 2006.
  - Purpose: baseline water quality assessment to support catchment-scale analyses and data-driven decision making.

- Variables measured and units
  - Alkalinity as CaCO3 (mg/L)
  - Ammonia (mg/L as N)
  - Chloride-ion (mg/L Cl)
  - Conductivity at 20°C (µS/cm)
  - Nitrate (mg/L as N; converted from NO3)
  - pH (pH units)
  - Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) (mg/L as P)
  - Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD) (mg/L as SiO2)
  - Sulfate (mg/L as SO4)

- Sampling sites and coverage
  - Located at Environment Agency monitoring sites; many correspond to NRFA registered stations.
  - Sampling across catchments includes sites such as Bere Stream, Frome, Piddle, Pang, Tern, Lambourn, and others (23 LCWQ sites in total; site codes include FP01–FP31, PL09, PL15–PL20, TE03–TE22, etc.).

- Sampling schedule and collection details
  - Routine sampling conducted fortnightly.
  - Samples drawn from the main river flow; one sample per event used to fill bottles for analysis.
  - pH and alkalinity measured in glass bottles; SRP filtered in the field; other determinands unfiltered.

- Measurement methods and quality assurance
  - Analyses performed by Thames Water using standard methods for each analyte (specific methods and calibration details per analyte provided in the dataset).
  - Nitrate reported as NO3 and converted to mg/L N using the factor 14/64.
  - Data quality controlled by Thames Water; includes weekly duplicates and QC samples for comparison.
  - Thames Water provided method performance indicators (e.g., detection limits, calibration standards, repeatability metrics).

- Data processing and quality presentation
  - Quality control processes documented; duplicate and QC samples regularly analyzed.
  - Box-and-whisker plots generated for all variables to show range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

- Data usage and considerations
  - Suitable for trend analysis, cross-site comparisons, and integration with other LOCAR data.
  - Useful for baseline assessments of water quality and informing catchment management decisions.
  - Data provenance includes location, catchment, sampling frequency, analytes, units, and QA details to support reproducibility and data cleaning.

- Source and accessibility notes
  - Data collected by Catchment Service Team and analyzed by Thames Water; quality assurance and methodological details documented within the dataset.
  - Conversion and interpretation notes included (e.g., nitrate to nitrogen, QC indicators).
