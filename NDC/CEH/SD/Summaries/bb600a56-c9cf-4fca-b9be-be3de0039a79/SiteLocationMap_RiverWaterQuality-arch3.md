# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Overview
- A monitoring site focused on river water quality within the Pang Lambourn catchment, designated as LCWQ.

## Relevance for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Provides a concrete data source to assess environmental health and support policy evaluation and future decision-making.
- Highlights the need to define clear data collection methods and indicators for meaningful interpretation.
- Emphasizes the importance of documenting metadata and provenance to verify data suitability.

## Data and Governance Considerations
- Data availability and timely access are critical for effective monitoring.
- Adequate metadata is required to assess data quality and applicability.
- Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier; governance and openness must be balanced with privacy or rights concerns.
- Potential organizational silos can hinder data integration and use.

## Data Lifecycle and Communication
- Data must be quality assured, cleaned, transformed, and analyzed, with findings presented clearly (e.g., reports, charts, dashboards).
- Outputs should be disseminated to stakeholders, with appropriate data sharing and governance processes in place.

## Next Steps (for framework authors)
- Define standard data collection protocols and indicators for river water quality at the site.
- Establish metadata standards and data provenance documentation.
- Implement data governance: storage, sharing permissions, retention, and update frequency.
- Develop user-friendly outputs (reports/dashboards) and plan stakeholder consultations to validate findings.
