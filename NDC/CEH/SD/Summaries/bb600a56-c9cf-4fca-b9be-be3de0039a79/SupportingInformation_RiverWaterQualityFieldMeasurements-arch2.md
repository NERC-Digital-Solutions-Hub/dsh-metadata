# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rivers   (2003-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview and purpose
- Provides baseline river water quality data for environmental monitoring and policy performance assessment.
- Part of the LOCAR programme; fortnightly sampling across 23 sites in Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments from 2003 to 2006.

## Variables measured and units
- Alkalinity as CaCO3 (mg/l)
- Ammonia (mg/l N)
- Chloride (mg/l Cl)
- Conductivity at 20 °C (µS/cm)
- Nitrate (mg/l N)
- pH (pH units)
- Phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP) (mg/l P)
- Silicate reactive dissolved (SRD) (mg/l SiO2)
- Sulphate (mg/l SO4)

## Location and sampling sites
- Sampling at Environment Agency monitoring sites; some correspond to NRFA stations.
- 23 sites across catchments:
  - Frome/Piddle catchment: FP01, FP02, FP06, FP11, FP12, FP15, FP21, FP22, FP23, FP26, FP31
  - Pang/Lambourn Catchment: PL09, PL15, PL17, PL18, PL19, PL20
  - Tern Catchment: TE03, TE05, TE09, TE16, TE20, TE22
- Site types indicated as LCWQ; NRFA station references provided where applicable.

## Sampling frequency and period
- Fortnightly routine sampling.
- Timeframe: November 2003 to June 2006 (variable site lengths).

## Field and laboratory methods
- Field: A single sample from the main river flow was collected.
- Sample handling:
  - pH and alkalinity: glass bottle.
  - SRP: filtered in the field.
  - Other determinands: unfiltered samples.
- Transport and analysis: Thames Water Laboratory.

## Analytical methods and performance (Thames Water)
- Chloride: Seal discrete; mean concentration and performance metrics reported (e.g., mean C measured ~99.3%, uncertainty ~5%, LOD ~0.5).
- Sulphate: Seal discrete analyser; mean concentration ~94.5%, uncertainty ~9.3%, LOD ~0.4.
- Nitrate: Seal discrete analyser; mean concentration ~98.9%, uncertainty ~5.8%, LOD ~0.1.
- Silicate (SRD): Seal discrete analyser; mean concentration ~91.2%, uncertainty ~21%, LOD ~0.05.
- Phosphorus SRP: Seal discrete analyser; mean concentration ~100.5%, uncertainty ~8.9%, LOD ~0.024.
- Ammonia: Seal discrete analyser; mean concentration ~94%, uncertainty ~97.1%, LOD ~0.038.
- Conductivity, Alkalinity: measured with respective standard methods; detailed C (calibration) values and LODs are provided in the dataset.
- Nitrate converted to mg/l N using standard conversion for reporting.

## Data quality and quality assurance
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water.
- Weekly replication: a duplicate and a QC sample were sent to Thames Water for comparison.
- Data visualization: box-and-whisker plots produced for all variables to display range, median, quartiles, and outliers.

## Data management and accessibility
- Data originate from LOCAR baseline datasets; measurements tied to specific LCWQ sites and NRFA stations where applicable.
- Metadata include site codes, catchment attribution, sampling frequency, and analytical methods.
- Emphasis on documenting analytical accuracy, repeatability, and detection limits to support downstream analyses and dataset integration.
