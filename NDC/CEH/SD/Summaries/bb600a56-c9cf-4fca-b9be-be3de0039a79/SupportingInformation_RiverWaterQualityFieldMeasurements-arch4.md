# Field measurements of alkalinity, chloride-ion, conductivity,   pH   and   nutrients   in   rivers   (2003-2006) [LOCAR] LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Purpose and scope
- Baseline river water quality dataset from the LOCAR programme, covering 23 sites across four catchments (Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, Tern) between 2003 and 2006.
- Variables measured include alkalinity (as CaCO3), pH, ammonia (as N), chloride (Cl), nitrate (as N), conductivity (20°C), phosphorus soluble reactive (SRP), silicate reactive dissolved (SRD), and sulphate.
- Routine sampling conducted fortnightly to establish baselines and compare across sites and catchments.

## Geography, sites and data sources
- Sampling locations were Environment Agency monitoring sites, with many corresponding to National River Flow Archive (NRFA) stations.
- Examples of site codes include FP01, FP02, FP06, FP11, FP12, FP15, FP21, FP22, FP23, FP26, FP31, PL09, PL15, PL17, PL18, PL19, PL20, TE03, TE05, TE09, TE16, TE20, TE22, with catchment prefixes FP (Frome/Piddle), PL (Pang/Lambourn), TE (Tern).
- Site metadata includes site type (LCWQ) and associated NRFA station numbers where applicable (e.g., 44001, 44004, 44006, 54044, 54041, 39032, 39019, 39115, 39114, 44013, 44014, etc.).

## Temporal coverage and sampling frequency
- Fortnightly sampling conducted from November 2003 to June 2006.
- A single main-flow river sample collected per site per visit.

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Sample collection and handling:
  - Single sample from main river flow; bottles prepared by Thames Water Laboratory.
  - pH and alkalinity samples in glass bottles; SRP filtered in the field; other determinands unfiltered.
  - Catchment Service Team collected samples; Thames Water performed analyses.
- Analyte-specific methods (as reported by Thames Water):
  - Chloride-ion, sulphate, nitrate, ammonia, SRD, SRP, conductivity, alkalinity, pH, with method details such as Seal discrete analyser or pH electrode where applicable.
  - Units specified for each parameter (e.g., mg/l for many ions, µS/cm for conductivity, mg/l N for nitrogen species, pH units for pH).
- Notes on data formatting and calibration:
  - Concentrations and quality indicators are aligned with standard laboratory calibration practices; a single concentration measurement is compared against calibration baselines and limits of detection as described in the lab metadata.

## Data quality, control and metadata
- Data quality controlled by Thames Water.
- A duplicate and a QC sample were sent weekly to Thames Water to validate laboratory results.
- Data visualization included box-and-whisker plots for all variables to depict range, median, quartiles, and outliers.
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Site codes, site types (LCWQ), and NRFA station associations included for traceability.
  - Catchment designation indicated (FP = Frome/Piddle, PL = Pang/Lambourn, TE = Tern) and LCWQ labeling acknowledged.

## Relevance for data governance and use
- Provides a well-documented, multi-site, time-series baseline of key water-quality indicators with explicit QA/QC procedures.
- Demonstrates cross-agency data collection and harmonization (EA sites, NRFA connections, Thames Water analyses) and clear metadata standards.
- Highlights importance of standardized measurement methods, consistent units, and transparent quality controls to support data stewardship, comparability, and long-term trend analysis across catchments.
