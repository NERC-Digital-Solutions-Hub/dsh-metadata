# PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RIVER WATER QUALITY SITE (LCWQ)

## Overview
- The document title indicates a data product focused on monitoring and presenting river water quality at a site within the Pang Lambo(u)rn catchment, identified as LCWQ.

## Data Support Approach for this Site
- Define data needs: specify water quality parameters (e.g., pH, dissolved oxygen, turbidity, nutrients), sampling frequency, and data sources (in-situ sensors, lab results, external datasets).
- Data handling: collect, quality assure, clean, and transform data; integrate data from multiple systems.
- Analysis: identify patterns, trends, and significant features in water quality data.
- Outputs: develop self-serve products such as dashboards and pivot tables; create reports and charts; provide guidance on use.
- Stakeholder engagement: promote outputs, gather feedback, and iterate; advocate for better data creation where needed.

## Expected Outputs and Tools
- Interactive dashboards and charts enabling users to explore water quality over time and by location within the catchment.
- Reports and summaries describing data sources, methods, and any data limitations.
- Data dictionaries and user guides to aid interpretation and reuse.

## Challenges and Considerations
- Potential patchy data and multiple data formats across different systems.
- Time required to understand the exact ask and how best to meet it.
- Communicating complex water quality information in a clear, accessible way.
- Ensuring outputs are widely shared and reused.

## Next Steps (Recommended)
- Clarify specific parameters, locations, and timeframes for LCWQ.
- Identify and connect data sources; establish data pipelines and quality checks.
- Develop initial dashboards and reports; gather user feedback; refine visuals and documentation.
- Promote the outputs and advocate for robust data creation where gaps exist.
