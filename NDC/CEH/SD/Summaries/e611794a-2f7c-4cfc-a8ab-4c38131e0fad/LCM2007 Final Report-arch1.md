# Final Report for LCM2007 - the new UK land cover map

- Overview of comparative analysis with Countryside Survey (CS) 2007
  - The document assesses how LCM2007 area estimates align with CS 2007 across Broad Habitats, using country-level and UK-wide comparisons, and discusses reasons for similarities and discrepancies.
  - The analysis uses CS 2007 as a reference, noting differences in methodologies (field-based CS vs. satellite-based LCM) and spatial/mapping structures (MMU, parcel vs. square-based units).

- Very similar area estimates (CS upper/lower 95% limits within each country)
  - Coniferous Woodland
  - Freshwater
  - Built-up Areas and Gardens
  - Calcareous Grassland
  - Rationale: These classes showed strong agreement between CS and LCM2007 in the correspondence matrix, reflecting robust signatures or well-delimited extents.

- Similar area estimates (within UK 95% limits)
  - Broadleaved Woodland
  - Acid Grassland
  - Inland Rock
  - Rationale: Correspondence falls within CS limits, indicating reasonable concordance for these habitat types.

- Dissimilar area estimates (outside UK CS 95% limits)
  - Arable and Horticulture
  - Improved Grassland
  - Neutral Grassland
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath
  - Bog
  - Montane Habitats
  - Coastal habitats
  - Explanation highlights:
    - Differences in how Arable and Horticulture are defined and spectral variability across crops can lead to over-/misclassification.
    - Boundary and Linear Features mapping: CS delineates boundaries differently; LCM MMU often aggregates such features into field polygons, changing extent estimates.
    - Spectral confusion and temporal dynamics: multi-year imagery influences spectral signatures; temporally variable classes (temporary grassland, arable) can shift classification.
    - Grassland subtypes (Improved, Neutral, Calcareous, Acid) show allocation differences due to spectral mixing and soil context.
    - Fen, Marsh and Swamp often misrepresented due to mosaic nature and CS vs. LCM spatial structures.
    - Small or mosaic habitats (Fen, Montane, coastal) are challenging due to spatial scale and survey design differences.

- Key factors driving CS–LCM2007 agreement and disagreement
  - Spatial scale and MMU differences (CS uses a fine-scale sampling; LCM uses a 0.5 ha MMU for many parcels).
  - Boundary generalisation and mosaic classifications alter area totals.
  - Spectral variability of grassland and agricultural classes causes misclassifications.
  - Inclusion of Boundaries and Linear Features in LCM2007 classifications when CS maps them separately.
  - Temporal dynamics: LCM2007 requires multi-year imagery; changes in land use between years affect arable/temporary grass classifications.
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp: complexity and mosaic nature lead to substantial cross-walking differences with CS.

- 4.4 UK Land Cover: distribution patterns and cross-UK comparison
  - UK-wide share of land cover:
    - More than 50% of the UK is either intensive agriculture (Arable and Horticulture + Improved Grassland) or built up (Built-up Areas and Gardens).
    - Woodlands account for about 12% (split roughly evenly between Broadleaved and Coniferous).
    - The remainder is semi-natural (e.g., coastal, semi-natural grassland, mountain habitats).
  - Country-level patterns:
    - England: highest intensive land use (about 76%; large shares of Arable and Horticulture and Improved Grassland, plus Built-up Areas).
    - Northern Ireland and Wales: around 64% intensive land use.
    - Scotland: 36% intensive land use but largest share of Coniferous Woodland and substantial semi-natural land (notably Mountain, Heath, and Bog).
  - Comparisons with LCM2000:
    - LCM2007 reports higher Arable area (26%) and lower Semi-natural Grassland (13%) than LCM2000 (23% and 17%, respectively).
    - Moderate changes in Coniferous Woodland (5.4% to 6.1%).
  - Note on accuracy and scale: The document discusses the potential impacts of changing the spatial framework and MMU on long-term comparability with earlier CEH maps.

- 4.5 Summary and discussion
  - Overall agreement between LCM2007 and CS varies widely across Broad Habitats; grassland classes are particularly problematic due to one-to-many relationships (grass types spanning multiple Broad Habitats).
  - Broad Habitat Association (BHA) rules were developed to improve interpretability of correspondences across levels (Broad Habitat, Broad Habitat Association, and Aggregate classes).
  - LCM2007 shows high correspondence with CS 2007 for the 1 km squares specifically for Arable and Horticulture, but UK-wide Broad Habitat extents suggest LCM2007 estimates a larger Arable area.
  - Fen, Marsh and Swamp estimates diverge by an order of magnitude due to the complexity of fen mosaics and differences in spatial structure; much CS-recorded Fen areas may be mapped as Rough Grassland or Acid Grassland by LCM2007.
  - Key takeaways:
    - The agreement pattern varies by habitat type and country context.
    - Grassland categories require careful interpretation; the Broad Habitat Association rules help contextualize correspondences beyond simple class-to-class matches.
    - There is potential to refine allocation of mosaic/fen areas with additional knowledge-based enhancements.
  - Implications for use:
    - LCM2007 provides coast-to-coast UK coverage and a robust basis for habitat monitoring, policy support, and landscape analysis, but users should account for known discrepancies in grasslands and fen-related habitats.
    - Cross-dataset synthesis (with CS, and other data like soils, hydrology, and terrain) improves interpretation and management support.

- Access to and use of data (context)
  - 1 km raster data sets are available via the CEH Information Gateway.
  - The full vector product and 25 m raster product are available on request under licence from CEH (licensing may apply).
  - Products include rich metadata and documentation to support traceability and cross-walking with CS and other data sources.

- Practical implications for policy and research
  - LCM2007 offers a consistent UK-wide framework aligned with Broad Habitats, enabling habitat connectivity analyses, landscape planning, and catchment management when used alongside CS and other datasets.
  - The study emphasizes the need for careful interpretation of grassland and fen-related classes and highlights opportunities for methodological refinements (e.g., additional KBEs to better allocate fen areas, and improved handling of boundaries and mosaics).
