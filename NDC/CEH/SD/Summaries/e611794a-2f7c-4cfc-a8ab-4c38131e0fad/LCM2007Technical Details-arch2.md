# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 is available in formats to suit different user requirements, with two main data products: vector data and raster data.
- Vector data provides the most detailed representation of land cover with parcel-level polygons and metadata about how the information was derived.
- Raster data reduce detail into gridded formats, suitable for broad-scale analyses and compatibility with raster-based workflows.

## Vector data
- Each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata on derivation (see Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation).
- Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.

## Raster data
- Five raster products in total.
- A 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata for the raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel size.
- Supply format: GeoTIFF.
- Coverage: UK.
