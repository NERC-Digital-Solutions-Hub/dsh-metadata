# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users.

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides both vector and raster formats to meet diverse user needs within the UK.
- Vector data is the most detailed product; raster data offers summarized representations.
- Detailed metadata and guidance are referenced in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.

## Data Formats

### Vector data
- The most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with associated attributes and metadata describing how the information was derived (see Dataset Documentation).
- Scale: Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels is 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.

### Raster data
- Five raster products in total to simplify the information.
- A 25 x 25 m raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
- Four freely available 1 x 1 km raster products summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
- Detailed metadata available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
- Supply format: GeoTiff.
- Coverage: UK.

## Documentation & Further Information
- Refer to the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation for detailed guidance:
  - Table 1. Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2. Habitats, LCM2007 classes and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3. Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## Data Steward Considerations
- Ensure alignment between dataset usage and the documented attributes and metadata (reference Tables 1–3).
- Maintain interoperability by understanding the relationship between vector (0.5 ha minimum unit) and raster (25 m and 1 km) formats.
- Manage access and provenance, noting that some raster products are freely available.
- Plan workflows that accommodate both formats and leverage the accompanying metadata for accurate land-cover interpretation.
