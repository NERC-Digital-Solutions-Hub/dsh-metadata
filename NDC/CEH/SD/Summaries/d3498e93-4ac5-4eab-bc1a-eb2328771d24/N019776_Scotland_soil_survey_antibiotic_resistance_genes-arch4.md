# Antibiotic resistance genes found in soils across the entire Scottish landscape

## Overview
- Dataset collates the relative abundance of nearly 300 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across Scotland.
- Based on DNA extracted from soils in the National Soils Inventory of Scotland (NSIS2) sampling (2006–2009) at 183 locations on a 20 km grid.
- Covers major antibiotic classes and resistance traits (aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, MLSB, tetracycline, vancomycin, sulphonamide, efflux pumps, integron genes, etc.).
- Results are expressed as relative gene abundances per total bacteria, using 16S rRNA as a surrogate for total bacterial load.

## Provenance and collaboration
- Developed by Charles Knapp (University of Strathclyde) 2016–2018.
- In collaboration with James Hutton Institute, Institute of Urban Environment (Chinese Academy of Sciences), and Newcastle University.
- Supported by the NERC AMR in the Real World grant (NE/N019776/1).

## Fieldwork and sampling design
- Draws on NSIS2 soil sampling and archived DNA from NSIS2, maintained by the James Hutton Institute.
- NSIS2 sampling details and soil archive protocols available via the James Hutton Institute resources.

## Analytical methods
- Community DNA extracted from soils using a modified CTAB method; stored at -80°C.
- 500–2000 ng DNA freeze-dried and analyzed through high-throughput qPCR at the Institute of Urban Environment, CAS, China.
- qPCR performed with Applied Biosystems OpenArray platform, using predefined primers (references provided).
- Detection threshold set at a cycle threshold of 37.

## Nature of recorded units
- Units are relative gene abundances calculated by the ΔΔCT method.
- 16S rRNA levels quantified to estimate total bacterial abundance.

## Data structure and content
- Main data columns summarized as Table1: high-throughput qPCR assays and their ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) mappings.
- Includes systematic mappings of each gene to ARDB entry and antibiotic class (e.g., aminoglycosides, beta-lactamases, MLSB, tetracyclines, vancomycin, sulfonamides, multidrug, etc.).
- Extensive listing of gene names, ARDB equivalents, and antibiotic classifications to enable cross-referencing and integration.
