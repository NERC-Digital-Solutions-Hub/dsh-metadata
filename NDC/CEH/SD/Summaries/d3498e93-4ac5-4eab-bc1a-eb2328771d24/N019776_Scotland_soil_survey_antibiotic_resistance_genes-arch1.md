# Antibiotic resistance genes found in soils across the entire Scottish landscape

- Overview
  - Datasets collate the relative abundance of nearly 300 antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes across soils in Scotland.
  - Source: National Soils Inventory of Scotland (NSIS2); sampling 2006–2009 at 183 locations on a 20 km grid.
  - Gene set covers major antibiotic classes (aminoglycosides, beta-lactams, MLSB, tetracycline, vancomycin, sulphonamide, etc.) plus efflux pumps and integron genes.
  - Abundances are relative (per total bacteria), using 16S rRNA as a surrogate for total bacterial content.

- Fieldwork
  - Soil samples were previously collected as part of NSIS2 and maintained by the James Hutton Institute.
  - NSIS2 sampling protocols and resampling details referenced (Lilly et al. 2011).

- Analytical methods
  - Community DNA extracted from soils with a modified CTAB method; stored at -80°C.
  - 500–2000 ng DNA per sample was freeze-dried and sent for high-throughput analysis.
  - Quantitative PCR performed via Applied Biosystems OpenArray platform.
  - Primers designed from established references (e.g., Zhu 2013; Looft 2012).
  - Detection threshold: cycle threshold (Ct) of 37.

- Nature of recorded units
  - Results reported as relative gene abundances (ΔΔCT method).
  - 16S rRNA levels quantified to obtain a surrogate for total bacterial abundance.

- Details of data structure
  - Main dataset columns include high-throughput qPCR assays and their ARDB (Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database) nomenclature.
  - Each gene entry linked to an antibiotic classification (e.g., aminoglycoside, beta-lactamase, MLSB, multidrug, etc.).
  - Table1 lists the correspondence between 16S rRNA and ARDB gene entries and their classifications, with numerous gene-specific rows.

- Provenance & quality
  - Project led by Charles Knapp (University of Strathclyde) 2016–2018.
  - Collaborations with James Hutton Institute, Institute of Urban Environment (CAS), and Newcastle University.
  - Funded under the NERC AMR in the Real World grant (NE/N019776/1).
