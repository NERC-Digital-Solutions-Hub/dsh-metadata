# Data collected 2017-18 during field transplant on Mt Etna

## Objective
- Record daily minimum and maximum temperatures across transplant elevations on Mt Etna over one year to monitor environmental conditions.

## Methods
- At each transplant elevation, deploy three Tinytag dataloggers at plant height adjacent to transplanted plants.
- Dataloggers left in the field for 1 year; daily min and max temperatures were extracted from the data.
  
## Quality assurance
- Dataloggers were kept together before deployment to ensure accuracy.

## Data structure / variables
- Elevation: 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m ASL
- Block: A, B, C (three replicate plots at each elevation)
- Date: date of temperature recording
- Temp.Min: daily minimum temperature (°C)
- Temp.Max: daily maximum temperature (°C)

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides a standardised, longitudinal temperature dataset across elevations.
- Enables data verification, cleaning, transformation, and integration with other monitoring data.
- Supports storage and uploading to appropriate data portals, aligning with systematic environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment.
