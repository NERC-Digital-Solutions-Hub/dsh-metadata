# Data collected 2017-18 during field transplant on Mt Etna

## Overview
- At each transplant elevation on Mt Etna, three Tinytag dataloggers were deployed at plant height adjacent to the transplanted plants.
- Dataloggers recorded daily temperatures for 1 year; from them, daily minimum and maximum temperatures (Temp.Min and Temp.Max in °C) were extracted.

## Quality control
- Before deployment, dataloggers were kept together to ensure accuracy.

## Experimental design / Variables
- Elevation (ASL): 500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m
- Block: three replicate plots (A, B, C) at each elevation
- Date: date that temperature was recorded (per day)
- Temp.Min: daily minimum temperature (°C)
- Temp.Max: daily maximum temperature (°C)
