# Data collected 2017-18 during field transplant on Mt Etna

## Overview
- Data were collected at Mt Etna during field transplant experiments across four elevations.
- Three Tinytag dataloggers were deployed at plant height adjacent to transplanted plants at each elevation.
- Dataloggers recorded daily minimum and maximum temperatures for one year, which were later extracted as the dataset.

## Quality control
- Dataloggers were kept together before deployment to ensure accuracy.

## Variables
- Elevation: Transplant elevations (500 m, 1000 m, 1500 m, 2000 m ASL)
- Block: Three replicate experimental plots (A, B, C) at each site
- Date: Date that temperature was recorded
- Temp.Min: Minimum temperature (°C)
- Temp.Max: Maximum temperature (°C)
