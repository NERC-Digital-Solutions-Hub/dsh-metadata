# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Examines climate-driven evolutionary changes in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits of Festuca ovina, a long-lived perennial grass.
- Utilizes 17 years of in-situ drought treatment at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) to create an open-pollinated F1 progeny array from P1 plants collected under drought and ambient conditions.
- Measures heritable traits including germination timing, seed mass, paternal reproductive success, and the influence of flowering time on the mating system.
- Pedigree validated with microsatellite markers to enable robust genetic analyses.

## Study system and treatments
- Location: Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL), calcareous grassland.
- Climate manipulation: drought treatment and ambient control applied annually since 1993 to 3 × 3 m plots; replicated five times in a randomised block design.
- Drought implementation: rain shelters during July–August; soil water potential significantly lower under drought (ψ drought ≈ −1100 kPa) than control (ψ control ≈ −20 kPa).
- Species focus: Festuca ovina (L.), wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, self-incompatible; most abundant grass at BCCIL; observed increased abundance in drought plots.

## Plant material and sampling
- Clonal lines: July 2010 collection of F. ovina from drought and control plots; 30 individuals per climate environment (drought and control) using spatially stratified random sampling.
- Clones: each sample provided 4–8 tillers; established in potting medium and maintained under supervised conditions.
- Number of parental lines: 59 P1 clonal lines survived collection (one died after collection).
- Prior genetic context: previous analysis indicates all sampled individuals were genetically distinct, implying seed-based recruitment is important; some clonal growth exists but is limited; evidence of genetic differentiation among climate treatments consistent with evolutionary responses.

## Creation of an F1 progeny array
- Flowering: by June 2012, most P1 clones flowered; 2–104 flowering tillers per plant recorded.
- Mating: wind pollination during June 2012; cross-fertilisation among distinct genotypes (outcrossing system).
- Seed collection: July 2012, 16 seeds per parent clone chosen at random for a balanced maternal design.
- F1 creation: 472 F1 individuals obtained (eight seedlings per parent clonal line selected from germinants and transplanted to Ness Botanic Gardens).

## Genotyping and pedigree
- Tissue sampling: leaf tissue collected and dried from all P1 and F1 individuals; duplicate tissue from 37 randomly selected P1 clones for genotyping accuracy estimation.
- Microsatellite development: nine loci selected from 48 candidate loci derived from transcriptome data; loci showed high polymorphism and reliable amplification.
- Genotyping: two multiplex PCRs (Qiagen kit); semi-automated scoring with GENEMAPPER v3; up to four allele calls per locus to accommodate tetraploidy; manual verification; ambiguous calls removed.
- Final dataset: 553 individuals genotyped (457 F1 offspring, 59 P1 parents) including replicate genotypes for 37 P1 individuals.

## Common garden experiment
- Design: September 2011, four replicates of each P1 clone planted in pots with rendzina soil; two soil depths tested.
- Phenotyping: flowering time measured in summer 2012 and 2013; inflorescences monitored twice weekly; date of anthesis recorded and inflorescences with anthesis removed promptly.

## Data quality and replication
- Genotyping accuracy: replicate tissue samples used to estimate genotyping error; manual checks performed to ensure data integrity.
- Pedigree confirmation: microsatellite data used to robustly infer parent-offspring relationships within the F1 array.

## Notes on species biology and implications
- Reproductive biology informs interpretation of results: wind pollination and self-incompatibility emphasize cross-paternity and paternal contributions to offspring.
- Clonal growth exists but is variable; seed-based recruitment remains a key source of genetic diversity and potential evolutionary responses to climate treatment.
- Long-term climate manipulation provides a powerful context to detect evolutionary changes across multiple generations, with genetic differentiation among treatments aligning with adaptive responses.

## References and dataset provenance
- Foundational work and context cited include Grime et al. (2000, 2008), Fridley et al. (2011), Ravenscroft et al. (2015), Whitlock et al. (2008), and related taxa-specific literature on Festuca ovina and molecular methods.

## Potential data uses
- Investigate heritable variation in germination timing, seed mass, and flowering time across drought and control environments.
- Analyze paternal reproductive success and its relationship to flowering time and climate treatment.
- Leverage the validated pedigree for quantitative genetic analyses (e.g., estimating heritability, genetic correlations, and selection responses under chronic climate change).
- Facilitate comparative studies across species or environments by providing a well-documented, long-term dataset linking climate manipulation to evolutionary change.
