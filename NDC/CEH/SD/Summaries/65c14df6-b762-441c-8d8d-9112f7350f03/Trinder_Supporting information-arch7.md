# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Investigates climate-driven evolution of reproductive and early-life-history traits in Festuca ovina under 17 years of in-situ drought treatment at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL).
- Created an open-pollinated F1 progeny array from P1 plants collected in drought and ambient (control) plots; pedigree validated using microsatellite markers.
- Measured germination timing and seed mass in F1, assessed paternal reproductive success, and examined how flowering time affects the mating system.

## Study site and climate treatment design
- BCCIL uses a 3 × 3 m plot design with drought treatment applied annually via rain shelters during July–August; five replicates in a randomized block design.
- Drought treatment significantly lowers soil water potential (ψ drought ≈ -1100 kPa; ψ control ≈ -20 kPa).
- Festuca ovina is wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, and self-incompatibility is present; drought plots show increased F. ovina abundance.
- Population shows recruitment from seed is important; clonal growth occurs but genetic analyses indicate most individuals are genetically distinct, implying seed-based dynamics dominate in response to climate treatments.
- Some individuals are short-lived perennials; long-term climate treatments likely impose multi-generational selection.

## Sample collection and propagation (P1)
- July 2010: collected 30 F. ovina individuals from each climate environment (drought and control); 59 clonal lines established (one died).
- Clones grown in pots under managed conditions with grazing-mimicking clipping; seeds were removed in 2011 to prevent self-seeding.

## Creation of an F1 progeny array
- June 2012: P1 plants formed large tussocks; cross-fertilisation occurred via wind with systematic daily reshuffling of pot positions to minimize spatial mating bias.
- July 2012: seeds collected from each P1; 16 seeds per parent clone weighed to create a balanced maternal design.
- 472 F1 individuals (8 seedlings per parent line) established in seed trays and grown outdoors.

## Genotyping and pedigree validation
- DNA extracted from all P1 and F1 individuals; a subset of 37 P1 clones replicated for error estimation.
- Developed 9 microsatellite loci from transcriptome data; screened 48 loci, retained 9 highly polymorphic loci.
- Genotyped P1 and F1 (553 individuals total: 457 F1, 59 P1, plus replicates). Used two multiplex PCRs; allele calls made with manual verification due to tetraploidy.
- Pedigree validated using microsatellite data to establish robust bi-parental relationships.

## Common garden experiment (phenotyping)
- September 2011: four replicates of each P1 clone grown in pots with two soil depths; standardised conditions.
- Flowering time tracked in 2012 and 2013; inflorescences monitored for the day of anthesis and removed upon anthesis.

## Data types and GIS-relevant considerations
- Spatial/climate metadata: drought vs control plots, block design, and daily pot-position rotations to mitigate spatial effects.
- Pedigree data: P1–F1 relationships inferred from 9-locus microsatellite genotypes, enabling analysis of paternal reproductive success.
- Phenotypic data: germination timing, seed mass, flowering time, and paternal contribution to F1 offspring.
- Genotypic data: microsatellite allele calls for tetraploid F. ovina, enabling spatial-genetic analyses and mapping of genetic differentiation across treatments.
- Experimental design data: long-term climate manipulation context, plant collection provenance, common garden conditions, and replication structure (four replicates, two soil depths).

## Limitations and considerations for mapping/analysis
- Outcrossing system and polyploid genotyping add complexity to paternity assignment and downstream spatial genetic analyses.
- Spatial arrangement and pot-based design introduce potential spatial autocorrelation that must be accounted for in GIS-based or landscape-level analyses.
- Integration of multi-year climate treatment data with genetic and phenotypic data requires careful harmonization of temporal and spatial metadata.
