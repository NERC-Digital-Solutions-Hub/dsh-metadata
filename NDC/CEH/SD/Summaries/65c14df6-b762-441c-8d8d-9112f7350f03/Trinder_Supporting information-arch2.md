# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Investigates whether climate change drives evolutionary changes in reproductive and early-life-history traits in Festuca ovina, a long-lived perennial grass.
- Uses plants from Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) after 17 years of in-situ drought treatment to form an open-pollinated F1 progeny array from P1 plants.
- Pedigrees of F1 offspring were validated with microsatellite markers to enable robust genetic analyses.
- Measured traits include timing of germination, seed mass, paternal reproductive success, and the relationship between flowering time and the mating system.

## Methods

### Study site and climate treatments
- BCCIL comprises 3 × 3 m plots with annual drought treatments applied since 1993, replicated five times in a randomized block design.
- Drought treatment uses rain shelters during July–August, causing soil water potential to drop (ψ drought ≈ -1100 kPa) versus ambient control (ψ control ≈ -20 kPa).
- Festuca ovina: wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic but self-incompatible; abundant and sexually reproducing across plots; clonal growth present but recruitment from seed is important; evidence of genetic differentiation among climate treatments suggests evolutionary responses.

### Collection and propagation of F. ovina
- In July 2010, 30 F. ovina individuals were collected from each climate environment (drought and control) using a spatially stratified, randomized design; 59 clonal lines were maintained (one died).
- Clonal lines were potted and established in pots at Ness Botanic Gardens; maintained by biomass clipping and seed head removal to promote clonal growth while mimicking grazing.
- Natural rainfall supplemented with groundwater during growth; these clonal lines are referred to as the parental or P1 plants.

### Creation of an F1 progeny array
- By June 2012, P1 plants formed large tussocks and produced flowering tillers; natural wind pollination occurred in June 2012.
- To minimize spatial effects on paternity, the relative locations of pots were systematically shuffled during flowering.
- Seeds were collected from each P1 plant to create F1 offspring; 16 seeds per parent clone were randomly selected for the germination study, ensuring a balanced maternal representation.
- Paternal and maternal contributions were expected to be from distinct genotypes due to outcrossing.

### Genomic DNA extraction
- Leaf tissue from all P1 and F1 individuals collected and DNA extracted for genotyping.
- An additional replicate tissue sample from 37 randomly selected P1 clones allowed estimation of genotyping error.

### Microsatellite marker development and genotyping
- Microsatellites developed from transcriptome data to establish full pedigree.
- Of 48 candidate loci, 9 polymorphic loci with consistent amplification were retained.
- Genotyping conducted in two multiplexes using Qiagen kit; up to four allele calls per locus were made due to tetraploidy; manual verification of calls; ambiguous data removed.
- Final dataset: genotypes for 553 individuals (457 F1 offspring and 59 P1 parents, including replicate genotypes for 37 parent plants).

### Common garden experiment
- September 2011: four replicates of each P1 individual planted in pots containing rendzina soil at two different depths.
- Flowering time recorded in summers 2012 and 2013 by monitoring inflorescences twice weekly; day of anthesis noted and inflorescences with anthesis removed immediately.
