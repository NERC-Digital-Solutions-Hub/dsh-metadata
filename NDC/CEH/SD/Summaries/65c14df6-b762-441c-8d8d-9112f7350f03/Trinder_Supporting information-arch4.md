# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Aim: test climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits of Festuca ovina under long-term drought treatment at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL).
- Approach: collect established plants from drought-treated and control plots, create an open-pollinated F1 progeny array, validate the pedigree with microsatellite markers, and assess germination timing, seed mass, paternal reproductive success, and the relationship between flowering time and mating system.
- Context: climate treatments at BCCIL have operated for 17 years, with drought induced by rain shelters leading to substantial soil water potential differences; prior work shows drought-driven species abundance shifts and genetic differentiation consistent with evolutionary responses.
- Key data outcomes: a robust bi-parental pedigree (P1 and F1), large-scale genotyping, and phenotypic measurements enabling analysis of heritable responses to climate stress.

## Methods

### Study site and study species
- Location: Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) grassland plots (3 × 3 m), with drought and ambient (control) treatments replicated five times in randomized blocks.
- Drought treatment: rain shelters in July–August; soil water potential sharply reduced (ψ drought ≈ -1100 kPa; ψ control ≈ -20 kPa).
- Species traits: Festuca ovina is a wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, self-incompatible grass; no selfing in practice; clonal growth varies among individuals; recruitment from seed is important; sex-reproducing plants observed in every plot; some individuals are short-lived perennials (<5 years).
- Previous genetic work: evidence of genetic differentiation among climate treatments, indicating evolutionary responses to climate manipulation.

### Collection and propagation of F. ovina
- Sampling: July 2010, 30 individuals collected from each climate environment (drought and control), across 6 plots per environment (spatially stratified, randomized).
- Propagation: clonal lines recovered as bunches of 4–8 tillers, potted in John Innes No. 1 compost, established in 3 L pots, maintained with grazing-mimicking clipping and seed-head removal to limit self-seeding.
- Plants used: 59 field-collected clonal lines (one died after collection) referred to as parental P1 plants.

### Creation of an F1 progeny array
- Crossing: by June 2012, P1 plants formed large tussocks and flowered; wind pollination occurred in June 2012 with daily re-randomization of pot positions to minimize location effects.
- Mating system: F. ovina is outcrossing; each clone can be maternal and paternal; mating occurred among distinct genotypes.
- Seed collection: July 2012, 16 seeds per maternal clone were randomly selected from each parent, yielding a balanced design.
- F1 generation: 472 germinants (F1 offspring) derived from 16 seeds per parent across the P1 clones; 472 were raised in seed trays and then outdoors as established plants.

### Genomic DNA extraction
- Tissue sampling: leaf tissue collected and dried from all P1 and F1 individuals; DNA extracted following established protocols (Whitlock et al., 2008).
- Replicates: additional leaf tissue from 37 randomly selected P1 clones for estimating genotyping error.

### Microsatellite marker development and genotyping
- Marker development: transcriptome-derived microsatellites; screen 48 loci, retain 9 polymorphic loci with reliable amplification.
- Genotyping: two multiplex PCRs (Qiagen Multiplex PCR Kit); scoring via GENEMAPPER v3; up to four allele calls per locus due to tetraploidy; manual checks and removal of ambiguous calls.
- Dataset: genotypes for 553 individuals (457 F1 offspring and 59 P1 parents, including replicate tissues for 37 P1 clones).

### Common garden experiment
- Design: four replicates of each P1 clone planted in pots with rendzina soil; two soil depths tested.
- Measurement: flowering time recorded in summer 2012 and 2013 by monitoring inflorescences and registering the day of anthesis; inflorescences with anthesis were removed promptly.
