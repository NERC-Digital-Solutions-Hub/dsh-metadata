# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Assesses climate-driven evolutionary changes in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits of Festuca ovina under a long-term drought manipulation.
- Uses a multigeneration framework: field-based drought and ambient treatments, establishment of a bi-parental F1 progeny array, and genomic pedigree validation.
- Aims to determine whether chronic climate change can drive evolutionary responses that affect population persistence.

## Study system and long-term climate manipulation
- Location: Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL), Calcareous grassland.
- Climate treatment: drought vs control (ambient) plots since 1993, with rain shelters during July–August.
- Treatment intensity: drought plot soil water potential around -1100 kPa vs control around -20 kPa, indicating substantial moisture limitation.
- Species focus: Festuca ovina, a wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, self-incompatible perennial grass; recruitment from seed is important and clonal growth is present but genetically distinct across individuals.

## Collection and propagation of F. ovina
- Sampling: July 2010, 30 F. ovina individuals from each climate environment (drought and control), totaling 59 usable clonal lines after culturing.
- Propagation: clonal lines established in pots, maintained to mimic grazing pressures and standardize growing conditions.
- Generations: parental (P1) plants used to generate an F1 progeny array for heritability and evolutionary analyses.

## Creation of an F1 progeny array
- Timing: flowering of P1 plants in 2012, followed by natural wind pollination.
- Design: spatially randomized pot placements during flowering to minimize location effects on paternity.
- Seed sampling: 16 seeds per P1 clone randomly selected and germination-tested to form the F1 cohort.
- F1 cohort: 472 individuals germinated and grown outdoors, enabling assessment of heritable trait variation under different climate histories.

## Genotyping and pedigree verification
- DNA work: genomic DNA extracted from all P1 and F1 individuals; additional replicate tissue from 37 P1 clones for error estimation.
- Marker development: nine highly polymorphic microsatellite loci developed from transcriptome data; designed to work in tetraploid Festuca ovina.
- Genotyping: two multiplex PCRs, semi-automated scoring, manual curation of calls; dataset comprised 553 individuals (457 F1 offspring, 59 P1 parents, including replicates).
- Pedigree: microsatellite data used to establish robust bi-parental pedigrees and verify parent-offspring relationships.

## Common garden experiment for phenotypic assessment
- Setup: four replicates per P1 individual planted in pots under standardized soil and depth conditions.
- Measurements: flowering time recorded by monitoring inflorescence anthesis in 2012 and 2013; inflorescences were culled upon reaching anthesis to standardize timing measurements.
- Objective: quantify variation and climate-induced differentiation in flowering time among parental lines.

## Measurements and traits
- Germination timing and seed mass tracked in F1 progeny.
- Paternal reproductive success: inferred from pollen contribution to F1 offspring.
- Mating system effects: assessed in the context of outcrossing and pollen flow.
- Flowering phenology: flowering time data from common garden trials to evaluate heritable shifts across climate histories.

## Data management and monitoring considerations (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
- Long-term data integration: combines environmental treatment records, clonal lineage tracking, pedigrees, germination, seed traits, and flowering phenology.
- Metadata and provenance: detailed documentation of plots, treatment regimes, soil conditions, and plant lineage essential for reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
- Data sharing and governance: generation of genotype and phenotype datasets supports transparency but requires clear data-sharing policies and quality standards, reflecting common governance challenges in monitoring frameworks.
- Data quality and transformation: extensive genotyping in a tetraploid species necessitates careful allele calling and validation; pedigree validation strengthens interpretation of heritable trait changes.
- Collaboration and standardization: systematic randomization and replication enhance inference about climate-driven evolutionary processes and support standardized monitoring across sites and studies.
