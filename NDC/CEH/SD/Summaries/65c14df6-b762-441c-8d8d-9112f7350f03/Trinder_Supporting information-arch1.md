# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview
- Examines climate-driven evolutionary changes in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits of Festuca ovina under chronic drought treatment at Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) over 17 years.
- Established an open-pollinated F1 progeny array from P1 plants collected from drought-treated and control plots, with robust bi-parental pedigree confirmed by microsatellite markers.
- Measured germination timing and seed mass in the F1 generation, assessed paternal reproductive success, and evaluated how flowering time influences the mating system.
- Used a common garden to assess variation and climate-induced differentiation in flowering time among P1 parental clonal lines.
- Notes prior genetic evidence of differentiation among climate treatments, supporting a potential evolutionary response to climate manipulation.

## Methods
- Study site and climate treatments
  - Drought and control plots at BCCIL since 1993 in a 3 × 3 m design with five replicates per treatment in randomized blocks.
  - Drought simulated with rain shelters during July–August, causing ψ drought ≈ -1100 kPa vs ψ control ≈ -20 kPa, indicating strong soil water limitation.
  - Festuca ovina is wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, self-incompatible; abundant at BCCIL and shows evidence of sexual recruitment across plots; clonal growth is present but genetic data indicate predominantly unique genotypes.
- Collection and propagation of F. ovina
  - July 2010: collected 59 F. ovina clonal lines from each climate environment (drought and control) using spatially stratified random sampling; one clone died.
  - Clones rooted and grown in pots, maintained with grazing-mimicking clipping and seed head removal to manage reproduction.
- Creation of an F1 progeny array
  - June 2012: parental clones flowered; seed collected and allowed to cross-fertilize via wind in a controlled, randomized layout to minimize paternal location effects.
  - 16 seeds from each parent were chosen, germination tested under controlled conditions; 8 seedlings per parent clone were transplanted to establish 472 F1 individuals.
- Genomic DNA extraction and genotyping
  - Leaf tissue collected from all P1 and F1 plants; an additional replicate sample from 37 P1 clones for error estimation.
  - Developed 9 microsatellite loci from transcriptome data; genotyped P1 and F1 individuals (553 total: 457 F1, 59 P1, plus replicates) using two multiplex PCR reactions; tetraploid organism with manual allele calling and quality checks.
- Common garden experiment
  - September 2011: four replicates of each P1 clone planted in pots at two soil depths; flowering time measured in summers 2012 and 2013 by recording the day of anthesis.
