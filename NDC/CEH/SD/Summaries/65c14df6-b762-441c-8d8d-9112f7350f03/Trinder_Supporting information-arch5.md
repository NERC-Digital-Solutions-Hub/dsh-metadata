# Supporting information for Climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits in the perennial grass Festuca ovina

## Overview of study and data scope
- Examines climate-driven evolutionary change in reproductive and early-acting life-history traits (germination timing, seed mass, paternal reproductive success, flowering time) in Festuca ovina.
- Uses plants from Buxton Climate Change Impacts Laboratory (BCCIL) after 17 years of in-situ drought treatment.
- Builds an open-pollinated F1 progeny array from P1 plants collected in drought-treated and ambient-control plots.
- Validates the pedigree with microsatellite markers to establish a robust bi-parental pedigree.
- Includes common garden measurements of flowering time and laboratory assessments of seed germination to link genotype, phenotype, and mating system under climate treatment.

## Data collection and study system
- Study site: BCCIL long-term climate manipulation with drought and control plots; treatments applied since 1993 in a 3 × 3 m grid, replicated five times in randomized blocks.
- Climate treatment specifics: drought imposed with rain shelters during July–August; significant soil water potential reduction under drought conditions.
- Species focus: Festuca ovina (wind-pollinated, hermaphroditic, self-incompatible); represents a major component of the grassland community at BCCIL.
- Population structure: genetically distinct individuals identified across plots; recruitment primarily from seed; clonal growth present but limited in shaping climate-response dynamics.
- Temporal scope: samples and measurements spanning from collection in 2010 through generation of F1 progeny in 2012 and subsequent phenotyping in 2011–2013, with prior climate-treatment evolution documented.

## Data types and key variables
- P1 parental plants (clonal lines)
  - Origin: drought vs control environments.
  - Reproductive data: flowering dynamics (tiller flowering, number of flowering tillers per clone, timing of anthesis).
- F1 progeny array
  - Seed collection: 16 seeds per P1 clone selected for progeny, balanced with respect to maternity.
  - Germination trials: germination timing (coleoptile emergence) tracked for 472 F1 individuals derived from 59 parental clones.
  - Growth/transplant data: seedlings planted in seed trays and established outdoors under standardized conditions.
- Genotypes and pedigree
  - DNA data: leaf tissue collected for genomic DNA; 553 individuals genotyped (457 F1 offspring, 59 P1 parents) with replicates for error estimation.
  - Microsatellite markers: developed from transcriptome data; 9 polymorphic loci retained from 48 candidates; tetraploid allele calls (up to four per locus).
  - Pedigree: full F1 parent-offspring relationships established using microsatellite data (bi-parental pedigree).
- Common garden measurements
  - Flowering time: anthesis day recorded for P1 clonal lines in a controlled garden setup over two summers (2012, 2013) at two soil depths with four replicates per line.
  - Seed/phenotype correlations: links among flowering time, germination, and paternal contribution to offspring.

## Data management, provenance, and quality assurance
- Provenance and sampling design
  - Spatially stratified, randomized sampling of F. ovina across drought and control plots; collected 30 individuals per climate environment (6 per plot, per environment).
  - Clones established in controlled conditions, with biomass clipping to mimic grazing and prevent resumption of seeding.
- Laboratory methods and processing
  - DNA extraction following established high-purity protocols; genotyping performed with two multiplex PCRs; allele calling managed in GENEMAPPER with manual verification.
  - Polyploid (tetraploid) data handled by up to four allele calls per locus; ambiguous calls removed after manual checking.
  - Genotyping error assessed via replicate tissue samples from a subset of P1 clones (n=37).
- Data volume and structure
  - Dataset comprises 553 individuals with detailed genotype data, plus phenotypic data from P1 flowering time experiments and F1 germination assessments.
  - Pedigree information enables analysis of heritable changes under climate treatment across generations.
- Documentation and references
  - Data are embedded in a broader study with explicit references for methods (microsatellite development, DNA extraction, growth conditions, climate treatment designs).

## Pedigree, genotyping, and data usability
- Pedigree construction
  - Bi-parental pedigree established to resolve parentage of F1 offspring, enabling assessment of heritable trait changes and mating-system dynamics under drought vs control conditions.
- Genotyping considerations
  - Tetraploid complexity addressed with careful allele calling and manual curation; two multiplexes used to maximize marker performance.
  - Replicate samples provide estimates of genotyping error, supporting robust downstream analyses (evolutionary inferences, heritability estimates).
- Data integration for reuse
  - Combines environmental treatment data (drought vs control), genetic data (microsatellites), and phenotypic data (germination timing, seed mass, flowering time, paternal success) to enable evolutionary and ecological analyses.
  - Rich metadata include sampling design, treatment history, plant IDs, and measurement timings, facilitating cross-study data integration.

## Experimental design and climate treatments (relevance to data governance)
- Long-term experimental framework
  - A well-documented climate manipulation experiment with explicit replication, randomization, and standardized measurement protocols.
  - The drought treatment creates measurable selection pressures across generations, enabling robust genotype–phenotype–environment analyses.
- Measurement consistency and replication
  - Multiple replicates for flowering time measurements and standardized germination assays to ensure reliability.
  - Randomized relocation of pots during seed production to minimize spatial biases in paternity.

## Accessibility, sharing, and usage considerations for Data Stewards
- Data richness and potential reuse
  - The combination of genotype, pedigree, and multi-generational phenotypic data makes the dataset valuable for evolutionary genetics, plant ecology, and climate-change biology research.
- Documentation and versioning
  - Comprehensive methodological documentation (sampling, propagation, germination assays, genotyping workflow) essential for reproducibility.
  - Clear identifiers for P1 and F1 individuals, parental lines, and environmental origins to enable accurate data integration and reanalysis.
- Sharing and licensing
  - While not explicitly stated, the dataset is framed for broader scientific use; governance should include data access policies, licensing, and provenance tracking (e.g., DOIs, data availability statements).

## Challenges and limitations from a data stewardship perspective
- Complex polyploid data
  - Tetraploid microsatellite analysis increases complexity in allele scoring and downstream analyses; requires careful documentation of scoring rules and error rates.
- Site-specific generalizability
  - Data derive from a single grassland site under a specific climate manipulation regime; cross-site comparability may require careful contextualization.
- Long-term maintenance
  - Continued updates to the pedigree, phenotype measures, and potential additional genotyping as methods evolve will require ongoing version control and metadata upkeep.

## Key takeaways for Data Stewards
- Ensure comprehensive metadata capture across all data types (environmental treatments, sampling design, cloning, flowering time, seed germination, and genotyping).
- Preserve full pedigree information with robust documentation of paternity assignments and any updates to genotype data.
- Maintain data quality through replicates, manual verification steps, and explicit error estimation for genotyping.
- Provide clear data dictionaries and data-processing pipelines to support reproducible reuse in evolutionary and ecological analyses.
- Facilitate data sharing by outlining access policies, licensing, and stable identifiers for individuals, clones, and experimental plots.
