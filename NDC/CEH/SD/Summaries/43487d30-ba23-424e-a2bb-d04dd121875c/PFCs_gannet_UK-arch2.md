# Overview

- PFC data from Gannet eggs (Morus Bassanus) collected at Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig, UK, from 1977 to 2013.
- Samples expressed as ng/g wet weight; eggs were frozen after collection until analysis.

## Scope and Sampling

- Sample type: homogenised whole eggs (1 g wet weight per sample).
- Colonies: Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig (UK).
- Time period: 1977–2013.
- Storage: samples frozen post-collection until analysis.

## Analytical Method

- Instrumentation: ACQUITY Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) with a Triple Quadruple Mass Spectrometry Detector (MS) in negative electrospray ionisation.
- Extraction: solid–liquid extraction from homogenised eggs using acetonitrile; 1 g samples spiked with 13C-labelled internal standards (13C-PFOS, 13C-PFOA); 18 h at 4°C; repeated vortexing and ultrasonication (three cycles without solvent exchange).
- Cleanup: 25 mg activated carbon and 50 µL glacial acetic acid; centrifugation; supernatant diluted with mobile phase.
- Columns: residue trap on Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column; subsequent separation on LiChroCART RP-18e column.
- Chromatography: gradient from 70% A to 90–100% B with a total run at 0.4 mL/min.
- Analytes: ten PFCAs and three PFSs quantified (see Compounds Analysed for specifics).

## Quality Control and Detection Limits

- QC: batch blanks; surrogate standards (13C-PFOA for carboxylates, 13C-PFOS for sulfonates); recoveries 72–144% across compounds.
- Method performance: mean LOD for PFCAs ~0.060 ng/g; LODs for PFSs ~0.028–0.137 ng/g (PFDS, PFHxS, PFOS); recoveries corrected for quantified analytes.
- Method reference: Fernandez-Sanjuan et al. 2010 on screening PFCs in aquatic organisms.

## Compounds Analysed

- Perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSs): PFOS, PFHxS, PFDS.
- Perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs): PFBA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTriDA, PFTeDA, PFPeDA, PFHxA (and related homologues as listed).

## Data Structure and Accessibility

- Data files: Results_Ailsa_Craig.csv and Results_Bass_Rock.csv.
- Columns (13 total): column 1 location; column 2 year recovered; columns 3–10 results for PFSAs; columns 11–13 results for PFCAs; all results in ng/g wet weight.
- Purpose: provides standardised, time-stamped datasets suitable for monitoring environmental PFC exposure in seabird eggs.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring

- Aligns with standardised environmental monitoring aims: data verification, quality assurance, transparent methods, and clear outputs (datasets) for assessment of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Facilitates cross-colony and longitudinal analysis of PFC contamination in marine food webs.
- Encourages dataset integration and broader data sharing to enhance monitoring value.
