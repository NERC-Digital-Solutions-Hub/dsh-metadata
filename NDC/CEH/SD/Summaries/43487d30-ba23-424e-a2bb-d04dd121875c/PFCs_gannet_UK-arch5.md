# Overview

- Data provenance and scope: PFC data from egg samples of Gannets (Morus bassanus) from two UK colonies, Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig; time range 1977–2013; samples were stored frozen until analysis and reported as ng/g wet weight.

- Analytical workflow: PFCs measured by UPLC-QQQ-MS after solid-liquid extraction from homogenised whole eggs; 1 g wet weight per sample; samples spiked with 13C-labeled internal standards (13C-PFOS, 13C-PFOA); incubation at 4°C for 18 h; extraction with acetonitrile, vortexing, and ultrasonication in three cycles; centrifugation and drying; residue re-dissolved and cleaned with activated carbon and acetic acid; final dilution with mobile phase; analysis on ACQUITY UPLC with triple quadrupole MS in negative ESI; 50 mm x 2.1 mm BEH C18 residue trap and RP-18e column used; gradient from 70% A to 100% B; flow 0.4 mL/min.

- Analytes quantified: ten perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSs) listed in Table 1 (e.g., PFBA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTriDA, PFTeDA; PFHxS, PFOS, PFDS; with abbreviations and carbon numbers).

- Quality control and reporting: blanks included in each batch; surrogate standards (13C-PFOA and 13C-PFOS) for recovery corrections; reported recoveries 72–144%; method detection limits for PFCAs ~0.060 ng/g (range 0.015–0.107 ng/g) and for PFSs PFDS 0.028 ng/g, PFHxS 0.084 ng/g, PFOS 0.137 ng/g; results corrected for recovery.

- Data files and structure: Two CSV files—Results_Ailsa_Craig.csv and Results_Bass_Rock.csv; each file has 13 columns: column 1 location, column 2 year recovered, columns 3–10 PFS results, columns 11–13 PFCAs results; all results reported in ng/g wet weight.

- Data governance and lineage implications for reuse: Comprehensive method description, QA/QC details, and explicit analyte lists support data discoverability, reproducibility, and harmonization; metadata should capture sample location, year, analytes, units, LODs, recoveries, and batch information for lineage and future updates.
