# PFCs in Gannet Eggs from Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig (UK) 1977–2013

## Overview
- PFC concentrations are reported as ng/g wet weight in Gannet eggs from two UK colonies: Bass Rock and Ailsa Craig, spanning 1977 to 2013.
- Analytical workflow: PFCs analyzed by UPLC-QQQ after extraction from homogenised whole eggs; samples frozen after collection until analysis.

## Analytical Method
- Sample preparation: 1 g wet weight eggs, spiked with 13C-labelled internal standards (13C-PFOS and 13C-PFOA) and incubated for 18 hours at 4°C.
- Extraction: Solid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile, followed by vortexing and ultrasonication (repeated 3 times without solvent exchange).
- Cleanup: Centrifugation, evaporation, resuspension in acetonitrile, ultrasonication, then cleanup with 25 mg activated carbon and 50 µL glacial acetic acid; final centrifugation and transfer to a micro-vial.
- Instrumentation: ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 column (1.7 µm, 50 mm × 2.1 mm) as a residue trap; analysis on a LiChroCART RP-18e column (5 µm, 125 mm × 2 mm I.D.) with a gradient; Waters UPLC system coupled to a Waters Triple Quad MS in negative electrospray.
- Quantified compounds: 10 perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and 3 perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSs) (Table 1).
- Target compounds: PFSA group – PFOS, PFHxS, PFDS; PFCA group – PFBA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTriDA, PFTeDA, PFPeDA, PFHxA.

## Quality Control
- Batch blank included for each run.
- Recovery assessed with 13C-labelled surrogates (13C-PFOA and 13C-PFOS) for carboxylates and sulfonates respectively.
- Reported recoveries ranged 72%–144% across compounds; method LODs for PFCAs ranged from 0.015–0.107 ng g−1 and for PFSs from 0.028–0.137 ng g−1.
- Analyte concentrations were recovery-corrected.

## Compounds Analysed
- Perfluorinated sulfonates (PFSs): PFOS, PFHxS, PFDS.
- Perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs): PFBA, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, PFUnA, PFDoA, PFTriDA, PFTeDA, PFPeDA, PFHxA.

## Data Structure
- Two CSV datasets: Results_Ailsa_Craig.csv and Results_Bass_Rock.csv.
- Each file contains 13 columns: column 1 location, column 2 year of sample recovery; columns 3–10 contain results for PFSs; columns 11–13 contain results for PFCAs, all in ng/g wet weight.
