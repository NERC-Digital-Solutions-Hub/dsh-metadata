# Experimental design/Sampling regime

## Study design and period
- Uses a before-after-control-impact (BACI) framework with an upstream reference (control) zone and a downstream experimental zone.
- Zones are similar in length, habitat structure, slope, flow, substratum, and land use; a 20–50 m gap ensures independence.
- Before period (T1): 61–65 days, Nov 2012 to Jan 2013; no manipulation; both zones treated equally.
- After period (T2): 57–62 days, Jan–Mar 2013; experimental zone manipulated with leaf litter addition.
- January samples are considered part of the before period; February–April samples are associated with the after period.

## Experimental manipulation
- Leaf litter addition using one tonne bags containing oak, birch, and alder leaves.
- Bags placed above the experimental zone and below the reference zone to simulate natural senescence.
- Vegetation nets used to maintain a minimum wet weight of 1.7 kg m^-2 in the experimental zone.
- Additional leaf litter (630 kg wet weight) added to each stream on 12 Feb 2013 and 5 Mar 2013 after two major storm events.

## Sampling and measurement
- Six experimental units (algal tiles) per reach, placed randomly in each reach before and after manipulation.
- Chlorophyll a accrual on tiles used as a proxy for algal production; herbivory rates inferred from grazing pressures.
- Tile setup: unglazed ceramic tiles (100 x 100 mm) glued to bricks and fixed to the benthos; one tile per brick coated with petroleum jelly to deter grazers, the other left as control.

## Laboratory analysis
- Algal biofilm scrubbed from tiles, frozen at -20°C.
- Chlorophyll extracted with acetone and quantified spectrophotometrically.
- Measurements taken at 664 nm (chlorophyll-a) and 750 nm (turbidity); chlorophyll-a concentration calculated with the specified equation.
- Referenced methods include Hladyz et al. 2011 and Layer et al. 2010.

## Data structure, quality control, and calibration
- Calibration steps and values: None.
- Quality control: None described.
- Data structure: Flatbed CSV files with 10 columns for algal production data:
  - site_code, region, date, time, landuse, reach, Vaseline (tile edges treated with Vaseline) or not, treatment, replicate, exposure, chlorophyll (μg cm^-2).
- NA indicates data not available.

## Supporting data and references
- Miscellaneous supporting document: DURESS_CU_site_description.csv (site descriptions, including coordinates, grid references, elevation, survey name, and catchment).
- Key references:
  - Hladyz, Åbjörnsson, Giller, and Woodward (2011)
  - Layer, Riede, Hildrew, and Woodward (2010)
  - Jenkins, Woodward, and Hildrew (2013)

## Data accessibility and alignment with monitoring aims
- Data are organized to enable cross-site comparisons and time-series analyses, aligning with standardized monitoring practices.
- Underlying data (e.g., site descriptions) available to support broader data integration and reuse.
