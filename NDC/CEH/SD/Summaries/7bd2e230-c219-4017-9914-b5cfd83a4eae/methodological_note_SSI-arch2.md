# Semi-structured interviews

## Objectives
- Characterize and quantify production losses due to conflict
- Assess the relation between areas of conflict and environmental variables/landscape features
- Identify mitigation measures used

## Sample
- 29 people from 3 communities
- Interview duration: 25–50 minutes
- Planned to be larger but logistics constrained

## Resources needed
- Tablet with ODK questionnaire
- 30 pebbles for appraisal of production and losses (crops and livestock)

## Methods
- Interviews randomly selected during field work in the communities
- One or two team members administered the questionnaire, privately as possible

## Digital data produced
- a) CSV file with the questionnaire (Portuguese) ready for conversion to ODK format (1 csv)
- b) Summary CSV file with all the data (English) (1 csv)

## Relevance to environment monitoring (Analysts perspective)
- Provides standardized, machine-readable data on production losses linked to conflict and surrounding environmental variables
- Data outputs support comparative analysis and integration with other environmental datasets
- Facilitates transparent data handling from collection (ODK-ready) to summarized datasets in multiple languages

## Data quality and stewardship
- Use of semi-structured interviews with predefined objectives ensures consistency across communities
- Outputs include both raw questionnaire data and a summarized dataset for analysis and reporting

## Limitations and considerations
- Sample size limited to 29 individuals across 3 communities due to logistics
- Privacy considerations implied by private administration of the questionnaire
