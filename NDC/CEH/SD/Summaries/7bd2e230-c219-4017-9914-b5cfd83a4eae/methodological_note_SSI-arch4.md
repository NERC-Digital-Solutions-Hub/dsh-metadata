# Semi-structured interviews

## Overview
- Objectives: (a) characterize and quantify production losses due to conflict; (b) assess the relation between areas of conflict and environmental variables/landscape features; (c) identify mitigation measures used.
- Sample: 29 participants from 3 communities; interviews lasted 25–50 minutes due to logistic constraints.
- Context: field-based data collection with privacy considerations during administration.

## Methodology and Tools
- Interviewers: 1–2 team members randomly selecting interviewees during field work; conducted as privately as possible.
- Instruments: Tablet with an ODK questionnaire; 30 pebbles used for appraisal of production and losses (crops and livestock).

## Digital data produced
- a) CSV file of the questionnaire (Portuguese), ready for conversion to ODK format.
- b) Summary CSV file with all data (English).

## Data governance and quality considerations (Data Leaders lens)
- Data formats and interoperability: plan to convert to ODK; bilingual outputs (Portuguese/English) may require translation and clear metadata.
- Metadata and discoverability: need documentation of variables, sampling method, dates, locations to support reuse.
- Data quality and provenance: small sample size and field-based random selection; potential biases; privacy considerations for interviewees.
- Data stewardship: two digital assets (raw questionnaire CSV and summary CSV) should be accompanied by methodological notes and access controls.

## Challenges and limitations
- Logistic constraints limited the sample size from a larger planned cohort.
- Representativeness across the three communities may be limited.

## Potential uses and next steps
- Analyses linking conflict exposure to production losses and environmental/landscape factors.
- Evaluation of mitigation measures to inform policy and planning.
- Ensure proper archiving with metadata and improve discoverability for collaborators and partners.
