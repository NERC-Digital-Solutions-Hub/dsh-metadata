# Focus groups discussions

## Objectives
- Understand the community-scale of conflict with wildlife.
- Assess seasonality of conflict.
- Explore trends through time.
- Capture perceptions and actions toward conflict and wildlife.

## Sample
- One focus group for each of 10 communities surveyed in the ACES scope.
- Duration: 2 hours per group.

## Resources needed
- 30 pebbles (stones)
- Field script
- Notebook
- Pen or pencil

## Methods
- A field script guides the focus group, covering occurrences of conflict with vertebrates and invertebrates separately and activities to represent seasonality and trends (attached).
- Participants: 6–8 people chosen by the Leader or Secretary to reflect community diversity and knowledge.
- Facilitators: two people ideally; an animator (preferably local language speaker) and a second writer/notes taker.
- Procedure: introduce participants and team; discuss occurrence of conflict, impacted activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; record contributions.

## Seasonality of conflict
- Use 30 small rocks to create a yearly timeline on sand with a 12-month box for each month.
- Participants distribute stones to indicate presence/impact of a specified problematic species; a representative places the stones, encouraging contributions from all participants.
- Repeat process for all species (vertebrates and invertebrates separately); record results on the field sheet.

## Trend analysis
- Draw a line in the sand representing years from the community’s formation to the present.
- Identify reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, wealth cycles, etc.) and note the presence of fauna and evolution of conflict over time.
- Capture all contributions on the field sheet, noting any landmarks or turning points.

## Digital data produced
- a) Field script for the focus group in Word format (rtf) – Portuguese
- b) Transcriptions of the field sheets for each of the 10 communities (rtf) – Portuguese
- c) Summary Excel file with all data (CSV) – English

## Data and potential uses (analyst perspective)
- Provides structured, qualitative data on timing and intensity of wildlife conflicts across multiple communities.
- Enables cross-community comparisons of seasonality and historical trends.
- Supports development of predictive indicators by linking conflict patterns to dates/events (seasonality, climatic events, socio-economic changes).
- Outputs (scripts, transcriptions, and a consolidated CSV) facilitate reproducibility, data sharing, and integration with other datasets.
