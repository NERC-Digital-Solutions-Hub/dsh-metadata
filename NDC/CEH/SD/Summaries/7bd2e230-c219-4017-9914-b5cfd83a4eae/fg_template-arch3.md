# Human Wildlife Conflict: data sheets

## Purpose and use
- Structured instrument to collect community-level data on human-wildlife conflict and agricultural pests.
- Aims to inform policy evaluation, monitoring approaches, and future decision-making.
- Captures which species are involved, types of damage, crops affected, human-wildlife interactions, community actions, and perceptions of interventions.
- Includes qualitative responses and visual outputs; results should be copied and photographed.

## Structure of the data sheet

- A. Participants and general description
  - Collect participant information and general description (age, gender, position in the community, main occupation, etc.)
  - Space for listing participants (1–6)

- B. Characterization of the problems with vertebrates
  - Do fauna present in the area affect agricultural production? (Yes/No/Sometimes)
  - What are the main animals present? (list)
  - What kind of damage do those animals cause in your field (machamba)?
  - Which are the main crops affected by those animals?
  - Cases of human attacks by wild animals; details and timing
  - What has the community done to reduce confrontations?
  - Have problems been communicated to local authorities?
  - Is the community content with interventions? (Yes/No/Other)
  - Do animals’ occurrence affect agricultural production?
  - What actions or changes would be important to reduce/mitigate conflict?
  - Have there been problems with wild animals concerning other livelihood activities?

- C. Characterization of the problems with invertebrates (Pests)
  - Are there invertebrates or pests affecting agriculture? (Yes/No/Sometimes)
  - Which pest species are responsible?
  - What kind of damage do they cause in fields (machambas)?
  - What are the main crops affected by these pests?
  - What has the community done to avoid/reduce pest impacts?
  - Is the community content with actions taken? (Yes/No/Other)
  - If pests’ impact were reduced, would productivity be higher?
  - What measures would you like to see implemented to reduce pest impact?
  - Have pests affected other livelihood activities?

- D. ACTIVITY: Draw a seasonal calendar of conflict
  - For the main species identified (vertebrates and invertebrates, one group at a time)
  - NOTE: COPY AND PHOTOGRAPH THE RESULTS

- E. ACTIVITY: Temporal trends
  - Draw a timeline from the foundation of the community highlighting periods of greater or smaller conflict and reasons
  - NOTE: COPY AND PHOTOGRAPH THE RESULTS

## Recording requirements and outputs
- Results are collected through participant responses and accompanying drawings/images.
- Sections D and E require copying and photographing the outputs to document seasonal patterns and historical trends.
