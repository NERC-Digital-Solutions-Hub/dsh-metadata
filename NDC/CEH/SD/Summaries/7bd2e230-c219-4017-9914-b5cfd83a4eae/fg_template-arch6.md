# Human Wildlife Conflict: data sheets

- The document is a data collection instrument for human-wildlife focus groups, documenting conflicts between humans and wildlife and their impacts on agriculture.
- It aims to capture both vertebrate (wild animals) and invertebrate (pests) problems, interventions, and community perceptions to inform management.

## Structure of the data collection instrument

- A. Participants and general description
  - Collects demographic and contextual information (age, gender, position in the community, occupation, etc).

- B. Characterization of problems with vertebrates
  - Does fauna affect agricultural production? (Yes/No/Sometimes)
  - Main animals present in the area (open-ended list)
  - Types of damage caused in fields
  - Main crops affected
  - Cases of human attacks by wild animals
  - Details on which animals and timing
  - Community actions to reduce confrontations
  - Communication with local authorities about problems
  - Community satisfaction with interventions (Yes/No/Other)
  - Perceived impact on production due to animal occurrence
  - Desired actions or changes to reduce/mitigate conflicts

- C. Characterization of problems with invertebrates (Pests)
  - Presence of pests affecting agriculture (Yes/No/Sometimes)
  - Main pest species
  - Types of damage to fields
  - Main crops affected
  - Community actions to avoid/reduce pests
  - Community satisfaction with interventions
  - If pests were controlled, would productivity increase?
  - Desired measures to reduce pest impact
  - Pests’ impact on other livelihood activities

- D. ACTIVITY: Draw a seasonal calendar of conflict
  - For the main fauna identified (one species/group at a time)
  - Must copy and photograph the results

- E. ACTIVITY: Temporal trends
  - Draw a timeline from the community’s foundation highlighting periods with greater or lesser conflict
  - Question why these periods occurred
  - Must copy and photograph the results

## Data considerations for the Data Support archetype

- Mixed-method data: primarily qualitative responses with some quantitative yes/no items.
- Data collection relies on participant recall and open-ended descriptions, requiring careful coding and standardization for cross-case comparisons.
- Outputs include both recorded responses and visual artifacts (seasonal calendars, timelines) to be photographed.

## Key outputs and uses

- Enables building datasets on wildlife conflicts by species, type of damage, crops affected, and actions taken.
- Supports creation of self-serve dashboards or reports to compare conflicts across communities and seasons.
- Helps identify gaps in interventions and communication with authorities.
- Provides a basis for prioritizing desired measures to mitigate human-wildlife conflicts.
