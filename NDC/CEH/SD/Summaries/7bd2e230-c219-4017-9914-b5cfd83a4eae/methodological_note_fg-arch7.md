# Focus groups discussions

## Objectives
- Understand the community-scale of conflict
- Understand seasonality of conflict
- Identify trends through time
- Explore perceptions and actions towards conflict and wildlife

## Sample
- One focus group for each of the 10 communities surveyed within the ACES scope
- Duration: 2 hours
- Group size: 6–8 people, representative of different groups and knowledgeable about the community
- Selection: by the Leader or the Secretary

## Resources needed
- 30 pebbles
- Field script and notebook
- Pen or pencil

## Methods
- A field script is used to conduct the focus group, including questions on the occurrence of conflict with wild species (vertebrates and invertebrates, separated) and activities to represent seasonality and trends
- Teams typically consist of two people: an animator (preferably speaking the local language) and a second person to write notes and support activities
- Process: introduce participants and team; discuss occurrence of conflict, impacted activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; collect and register contributions on the field sheet

## Seasonality of conflict
- Assign 30 small rocks or pebbles to create a yearly timeline on sand with 12 monthly boxes
- Participants distribute stones by months according to the presence/impact of one problematic species
- A representative places the pebbles on the ground, encouraging contributions from all participants
- Repeat the process for all referred species (vertebrates and invertebrates separately)
- Record results in the field sheet

## Trend analysis
- Draw a line in the sand representing years from community formation to the present
- Identify reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, wealth periods, etc.)
- Mark the presence of fauna and the evolution of the conflict over time, noting landmarks
- Record all contributions in the field sheet

## Digital data produced
- a) Field script for the focus group in Word format (rtf) – Portuguese
- b) Transcription of the field sheet in Word format for each community (10 rtf) – Portuguese
- c) Summary Excel file with all data (csv) – English

## GIS relevance (for data products)
- Enables spatial analysis by linking community-level focus group results to geographic locations
- Supports mapping of seasonality patterns, species involvement, and temporal trends across ACES communities
- Output formats (Word transcripts, field scripts, and a consolidated CSV) facilitate integration into GIS workflows for visualization and decision-making
