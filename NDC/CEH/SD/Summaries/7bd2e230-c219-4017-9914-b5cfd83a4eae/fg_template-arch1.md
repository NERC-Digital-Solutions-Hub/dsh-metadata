# Human-wildlife focus groups

## Overview
- Structured data collection instrument to capture community experiences with human-wildlife conflict and agricultural pests.
- Aimed at informing analysis of patterns, impacts, and potential mitigation actions.

## Respondents and context
- Interviewees: community participants described by age, gender, position in the community, main occupation, etc.
- Scope includes vertebrates (wildlife conflicts) and invertebrates (pests) affecting agriculture.
- Data capture focuses on perceptions of impact on farming and responses by the community and authorities.

## Instrument structure and data categories

### A. Participants and general description
- Fields for listing participants and basic demographic/occupational information.

### B. Problems with vertebrates
- Questions on whether wildlife affect agricultural production (Yes/No/Sometimes).
- Identification of main animals present.
- Types of damage caused to fields (machamba) with multiple example prompts.
- Main crops affected by wildlife.
- History of human-wildlife attacks (which animals, when).
- Community responses to reduce conflicts.
- Communication with local authorities about problems.
- Community satisfaction with interventions.
- Perceived impact on agricultural production.
- Desired actions or changes to reduce conflicts.
- Any impacts on other livelihood activities.

### C. Problems with invertebrates (Pests)
- Questions on presence of pests (Yes/No/Sometimes).
- Main pest species involved.
- Types of damage to fields.
- Main crops affected by pests.
- Community actions to avoid/reduce pest impact.
- Community satisfaction with interventions.
- Perceived impact on productivity if pests were controlled.
- Desired measures to reduce pest impact.
- Pest-related problems in other livelihood activities.

### D. Activity: Seasonal calendar of conflict
- Draw and record a seasonal calendar for the main fauna species (vertebrates and invertebrates) identified.
- Copy and photograph the results.

### E. Activity: Temporal trends
- Draw a timeline from the foundation of the community highlighting periods of greater or lesser conflict.
- Question why these periods occurred.
- Copy and photograph the results.

## Data collection methods and outputs
- Data sheets require both structured responses and qualitative descriptions.
- Visual outputs (seasonal calendars and timelines) must be copied and photographed for documentation.
- Data cover both conflict with wildlife and pest pressures, across multiple crops and communities.

## Data use and considerations for analysts
- Enables cross-cutting analysis of wildlife conflicts and pest impacts on agriculture at the community level.
- Facilitates identification of common pests/animals, affected crops, and effectiveness of interventions.
- Provides temporal and seasonal context to support trend analysis and predictive insights.
- Highlights channels of communication with authorities and community satisfaction with interventions.

## Notes on data scope
- Focus on both vertebrate wildlife conflicts and invertebrate pests.
- Captures stakeholder perspectives on damages, mitigation actions, and productivity impacts.
- Includes qualitative insights into barriers to intervention and local priorities for future actions.
