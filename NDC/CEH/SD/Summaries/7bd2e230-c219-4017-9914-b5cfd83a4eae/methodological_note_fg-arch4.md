# Focus groups discussions

## Objectives
- Understand the community-scale of conflict, its seasonality, trends through time, and perceptions/actions towards conflict and wildlife.

## Sample
- One focus group per each of 10 communities surveyed within the scope of ACES
- Duration: 2 hours

## Resources needed
- 30 pebbles
- Field script and notebook
- Pen or pencil

## Methods
- A field script is used to conduct the focus group, including general questions about the occurrence of conflict with wild species (vertebrates and invertebrates, separated) and activities to represent seasonality and trends (attached).
- Group of 6-8 people, representative of different community segments, gathered in a quiet place.
- Two facilitators recommended: an animator (preferably local language) and a second person to write notes and support activities.
- Procedure: introduce participants and team; discuss occurrence of conflict, impacted activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; collect contributions in the field sheet.

## Seasonality of conflict
- Participants use 30 small rocks or pebbles to create a yearly timeline on sand with 12 monthly boxes.
- Participants distribute stones to reflect the presence/impact of each problematic species (vertebrates and invertebrates separately).
- A representative places the pebbles, with input from all participants to determine the result.
- Process repeated for all referenced species; results recorded in the field sheet.

## Trend analysis
- Draw a line on the sand representing years from community formation to present.
- Mark reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, economic changes, etc.) and note the presence of fauna and evolution of conflict across community life.
- Record all contributions in the field sheet.

## Digital data produced
- a) Field script for the focus group in Word format (rtf) – in Portuguese
- b) Transcriptions of the field sheets for each community (10 rtf) – in Portuguese
- c) Summary Excel file with all data (csv) – in English

## Data governance considerations for data leaders
- Standardized data collection across 10 communities enables cross-site analysis and system-wide insights.
- Outputs include multilingual artifacts (Portuguese field scripts and transcriptions; English CSV summary) promoting discoverability and broader use.
- Simple, low-tech, participatory methods (pebble timeline, sand drawing) support inclusivity but require careful documentation to ensure consistency and reproducibility.
- Clear data lineage and metadata are implied by the structured outputs (field script, per-community transcripts, consolidated dataset), facilitating data quality checks and future updates.
