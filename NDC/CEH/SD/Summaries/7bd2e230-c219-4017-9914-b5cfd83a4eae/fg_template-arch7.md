# Human Wildlife Conflict: data sheets

- Purpose
  - A structured data collection tool for human-wildlife conflict focus groups to capture community experiences, affected crops, damages, and responses, enabling GIS-based analysis and map-based visualization of conflicts.

- Metadata and participants (Section A)
  - Date, Interviewers, Community
  - Participant group: demographic and role information (age, gender, position in the community, main occupation, etc.)
  - Space for up to six participants with general descriptions

- Vertebrate-related problems (Section B)
  - Do fauna affect agricultural production? Yes / No / Sometimes
  - Main animals present (list)
  - Types of damage to fields/machamba (description)
  - Main crops affected
  - Human-wildlife attacks: occurrence, animals involved, timing
  - Community actions to reduce conflicts
  - Communication with local authorities about problems
  - Community satisfaction with interventions
  - Perceived impact on agricultural production if animals occur
  - Desired actions or changes to reduce/mitigate conflicts
  - Other impacts on livelihood activities due to wildlife

- Invertebrate pests (Section C)
  - Presence/absence/frequency of pests affecting agriculture
  - Main pest species responsible
  - Types of damage to fields/machambas
  - Main crops affected
  - Actions taken to avoid/reduce pest impacts
  - Community satisfaction with interventions
  - If pests were absent, would productivity be higher
  - Desired measures to reduce pest impacts
  - Other impacts on livelihood activities due to pests

- Activity D: Seasonal calendar of conflict
  - Drawn for main fauna species (vertebrates and invertebrates)
  - Requires copying and photographing the results

- Activity E: Temporal trends timeline
  - Draw a timeline from community founding highlighting periods of larger or smaller conflict and the reasons
  - Requires copying and photographing the results

- GIS considerations and how this data supports map-based products
  - Qualitative responses and open-ended fields will need coding and standardization for GIS integration
  - Potential to map conflicts by community, species, crops affected, and reported damages
  - Seasonal calendars and timelines provide temporal granularity for time-series and seasonality analysis
  - Photographs from Activities D and E should be linked to records with proper metadata for spatial and temporal context
  - Data gaps and variability across interviews; align categories (Yes/No/Sometimes) for consistent encoding

- Practical notes for GIS specialists
  - Plan to digitize open-ended responses into structured fields (e.g., species codes, damage types, crops)
  - Link each record to a geographic unit (community/village) and, where possible, to farm/field locations
  - Integrate with existing spatial layers (land use, crop patterns, wildlife habitats) to create layered conflict visualizations
  - Prepare workflows to convert seasonal and timeline drawings into time-enabled spatial datasets for dynamic maps

- End-user outputs enabled
  - Community-level conflict maps by species and crop
  - Temporal heatmaps showing peak conflict periods
  - Dashboards combining qualitative insights with spatial patterns for policymakers, clients, or the public
