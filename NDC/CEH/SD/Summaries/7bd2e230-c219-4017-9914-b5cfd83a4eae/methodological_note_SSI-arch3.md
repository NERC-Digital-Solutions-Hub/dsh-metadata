# Semi-structured interviews Methodological note of data produced

## Objectives
- Aimed to characterize and quantify production losses due to conflict.
- Assess the relationship between areas of conflict and environmental variables/landscape features.
- Identify mitigation measures used.

## Sample
- 29 participants from 3 communities (initial plan intended more; constrained by logistics).
- Interview duration: 25–50 minutes.

## Resources needed
- Tablet with ODK questionnaire.
- 30 pebbles to appraise production and losses (crops and livestock).

## Methods
- Interviewees were randomly selected during field work in the communities.
- One or two team members administered the questionnaire, conducted as privately as possible.

## Digital data produced
- a) CSV file of the questionnaire (ready for conversion to ODK format) — 1 CSV, in Portuguese.
- b) Summary CSV file with all data — 1 CSV, in English.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates how to collect and structure field data to quantify conflict-related losses and relate them to environmental factors.
- Shows practical data collection setup (mobile questionnaire, simple appraisal tool) suitable for monitoring programs.
- Indicates bilingual dissemination of outputs (Portuguese questionnaire, English summary) to support broader use and sharing of findings.
