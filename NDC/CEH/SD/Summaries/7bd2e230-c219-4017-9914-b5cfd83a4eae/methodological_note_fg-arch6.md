# Focus groups discussions

- Objective: Understand community-scale conflict with wildlife, its seasonality, trends over time, and perceptions/actions regarding conflict and wildlife.

- Sample
  - One focus group per each of 10 communities
  - Duration: 2 hours
  - Group size: 6–8 participants
  - Participants representative of different community groups; leaders select participants; ideally two facilitators (animator and note-taker)

- Resources needed
  - 30 pebbles
  - Field script and notebook
  - Pen or pencil

- Methods
  - Use a field script to guide questions about the occurrence of conflict with vertebrates and invertebrates (considered separately), impacted activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts
  - Conducted by an animator (preferably local language) and a second person recording notes
  - All participants contribute and discussions are documented in the field sheet

- Seasonality of conflict
  - Use 30 small rocks to create a yearly timeline on sand with 12 monthly boxes
  - Group distributes stones by months to reflect presence/impact of each problematic species
  - A representative places the stones on the ground; input from all participants is encouraged
  - Repeat sequentially for all species (vertebrates and invertebrates)

- Trend analysis
  - Draw a line in the sand representing years from the community’s formation to present
  - Identify reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, wealth periods, etc.) and note fauna presence and changes in conflict over time
  - Record contributions in the field sheet

- Digital data produced
  - a) Field script for the focus group (Word format, 1 file, Portuguese)
  - b) Transcriptions of field sheets for each community (Word format, 10 files, Portuguese)
  - c) Summary data file (Excel/CSV) with all data (1 file, English)

- Data scope and content
  - Topics covered: occurrence of conflict, activities affected, species involved, mitigation efforts
  - Species considered: vertebrates and invertebrates
  - Outputs designed to support analysis of seasonality and long-term trends across communities

- Relevance for data use
  - Produces structured, comparable data across multiple communities
  - Facilitates creation of data products (e.g., dashboards, reports) to explore conflict patterns and inform mitigation strategies
  - Provides ready-to-share outputs (transcriptions, summaries) to support broader data use and policy discussions
