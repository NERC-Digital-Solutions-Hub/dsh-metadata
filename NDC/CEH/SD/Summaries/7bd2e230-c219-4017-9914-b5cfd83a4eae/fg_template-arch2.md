# Human-wildlife focus groups

## Purpose and use for environmental monitoring
- Collect and organize community-level data on human-wildlife conflict and pest impacts to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Produce standardized outputs (reports, maps, charts) and store datasets in appropriate data portals to support monitoring.

## Data collection framework (structure of the instrument)
- A. Participants and general description
  - Collect demographics and roles (age, gender, position in community, main occupation, etc) for up to six participants.
- B. Characterization of problems with vertebrates
  - Assess whether fauna affect agricultural production (Yes/No/Sometimes).
  - Identify main vertebrate species present.
  - Document types of damage to fields (machamba) and crops affected.
  - Record any human-wildlife attacks, timing, and species involved.
  - Capture community actions to reduce conflicts and communication with local authorities.
  - Gauge community contentment with interventions and perceived impact on production.
  - Gather ideas for additional actions to reduce conflicts.
  - Note other livelihood impacts related to vertebrate encounters.
- C. Characterization of problems with invertebrates (pests)
  - Assess whether pests affect agriculture (Yes/No/Sometimes).
  - Identify main pest species and damage types to fields and crops.
  - Document community actions to manage pests and satisfaction with interventions.
  - Explore perceived productivity gains if pests were controlled and desired measures to reduce pest impact.
  - Capture other pest-related impacts on livelihoods.
- D. Seasonal calendar of conflict
  - Create a seasonal calendar for the main fauna species (vertebrates and invertebrates) and photograph the result.
- E. Temporal trends
  - Draw a timeline from the community foundation to highlight periods with larger or smaller conflicts, with photographic documentation.

## Key data elements and content expectations
- Viable verbs and indicators include: presence and abundance of species, types of damage, crops affected, frequency and severity of conflicts, human-animal interactions, and community responses.
- Qualitative insights about interventions, effectiveness, satisfaction, and suggested measures.
- Visual outputs through participatory tools (seasonal calendar, timeline) to support temporal trend analyses.

## Data management and outputs
- Photographic documentation of participatory results (D and E activities) to supplement datasets.
- Collation of responses into standardized formats suitable for mapping and charting.
- Data should be organized for uploading to appropriate portals to support ongoing monitoring.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring goals
- Provides time-series potential by capturing seasonal and historical patterns of human-wildlife conflicts and pest pressures.
- Enables comparison across communities and time, supporting evaluation of policy interventions and mitigation strategies.
- Bridges local observations with higher-level environmental health indicators through standardized data collection and reporting.
