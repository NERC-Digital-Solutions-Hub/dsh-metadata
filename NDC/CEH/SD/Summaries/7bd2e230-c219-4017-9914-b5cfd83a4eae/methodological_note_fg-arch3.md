# Focus groups discussions Methodological note of data produced

## Objectives
- Understand the community-scale of conflict with wildlife
- Assess seasonality of conflict
- Track trends through time
- Explore perceptions and actions towards conflict and wildlife

## Sample
- One focus group for each of the 10 communities surveyed within the ACES scope
- Session duration: 2 hours

## Resources needed
- 30 pebbles
- Field script and notebook
- Pen or pencil

## Methods
- Use a field script to conduct the focus group, covering occurrence of conflict with wild species (vertebrates and invertebrates, separated) and activities to depict seasonality and trends
- Group of 6–8 participants, representative of different community segments
- Two facilitators: an animator (preferably speaking the local language) and a note-taker
- Process: introductions; discuss occurrence of conflict, affected activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; record contributions on the field sheet

## Seasonality of conflict
- Participants use 30 small rocks/pebbles to create a yearly timeline on sand with 12 months
- Distribute stones to reflect the impact/occurrence of conflicts by species (vertebrates and invertebrates separately)
- A representative places the stones; all participants are encouraged to contribute
- Repeat for all species and record results on the field sheet

## Trend analysis
- Draw a line in the sand representing years from community formation to the present
- Mark reference dates (e.g., climatic events, hunger, diseases, economic periods)
- Note the presence of fauna and evolution of conflict over time
- Record all contributions on the field sheet
