# Focus groups discussions

- Objective: Understand the community-scale of conflict with wildlife, its seasonality, trends over time, and perceptions and actions towards conflict.

- Scope and sample:
  - 10 communities surveyed; one focus group per community.
  - Each session lasts 2 hours.
  - Participants: 6–8 individuals representative of different community groups, selected by the Leader or Secretary.
  - Location: quiet place; two facilitators (an animator who preferably speaks the local language and a second person to take notes).

- Resources needed:
  - 30 pebbles
  - Field script and notebook
  - Pen or pencil

- Methodology:
  - Field script administered to discuss occurrence of conflict with wild species (vertebrates and invertebrates, treated separately), affected activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; all contributions are recorded.
  - Seasonality activity:
    - Participants use 30 pebbles to map annual seasonality on a sand timeline (12 months) indicating the presence/impact of each problematic species.
    - A representative places the stones, but input from all participants is encouraged.
  - Trend analysis:
    - Draw a line in the sand representing years from community formation to present.
    - Identify reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, economic periods, etc.) and note fauna presence and conflict evolution, recording all contributions.

- Digital data produced:
  - a) Field script for the focus group in Word format (rtf) – in Portuguese
  - b) Transcription of the field sheet for each community (10 rtf) – in Portuguese
  - c) Summary Excel file with all data (csv) – in English

- Data governance considerations for Data Stewards:
  - Clear, instrumented data collection with defined outputs supports discoverability and reuse.
  - Mixed-language outputs (Portuguese field materials and English summary data) require multilingual metadata.
  - Documentation of processes (field script, transcripts, and summary data) aids provenance and auditability.
  - Standards for qualitative data across communities support consistency and interoperability, including consistent treatment of species categories (vertebrates vs. invertebrates) and timelines.
