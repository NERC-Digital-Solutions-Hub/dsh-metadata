# Human-wildlife focus groups

- A structured data sheet for capturing community experiences of human-wildlife conflict, focusing on vertebrates and invertebrates (pests), their impacts on agriculture, and community responses.
- Includes participatory activities (seasonal calendar and timeline) to be copied and photographed.

## Purpose and scope
- Collect qualitative and contextual data on how wildlife (vertebrates) and pests (invertebrates) affect agricultural production and livelihoods.
- Document types of animals, damages, crops affected, human-wildlife encounters, community actions, and interactions with authorities.
- Capture community perceptions of interventions and satisfaction with measures taken.
- Use participatory visualization to supplement narrative data.

## Section A: Participants and general description
- Fields to record date, interviewers, community, and a list of participants with basic descriptors (age, gender, position, occupation, etc).

## Section B: Characterization of problems with vertebrates
- Assesses whether fauna affects agriculture (Yes/No/Sometimes).
- Identifies main animals present; describes types and damages to fields.
- Identifies main crops affected.
- Captures human-wildlife conflict events (e.g., human attacks) and their timing.
- Records actions taken by the community to reduce conflicts.
- Captures whether problems have been communicated to local authorities.
- Gauges community satisfaction with interventions.
- Probes perceived impact on agricultural production and potential actions deemed important to reduce conflicts.
- Notes any other livelihood impacts related to vertebrate conflicts.

## Section C: Characterization of problems with invertebrates (Pests)
- Assesses presence of pests affecting agriculture (Yes/No/Sometimes).
- Identifies main pest species and the damages they cause to fields.
- Identifies main crops affected.
- Documents actions taken to avoid or reduce pest impact and community satisfaction with interventions.
- Asks whether pest impacts would likely increase productivity if mitigated.
- Seeks preferred measures to reduce pest impact.
- Notes other livelihood impacts related to pest issues.

## Section D: Activity — Seasonal calendar of conflict
- Draw (and later copy/photo) a seasonal calendar showing conflicts for the main fauna species identified.

## Section E: Activity — Temporal timeline
- Draw (and copy/photo) a timeline from the community foundation highlighting periods when conflicts were larger or smaller, with notes explaining possible reasons.
