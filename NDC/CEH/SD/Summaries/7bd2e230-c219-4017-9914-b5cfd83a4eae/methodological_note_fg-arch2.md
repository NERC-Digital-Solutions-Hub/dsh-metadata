# Focus groups discussions: Methodological note of data produced

## Objectives
- Understand the community-scale of conflict between humans and wildlife.
- Assess seasonality of conflict.
- Analyze trends through time.
- Explore perceptions and actions towards conflict and wildlife.

## Sample
- One focus group for each of 10 communities surveyed in the ACES scope.
- Duration: 2 hours.

## Resources needed
- 30 pebbles
- Field script and notebook
- Pen or pencil

## Methods
- A field script guides the focus group, including questions on occurrence of conflict with wild species (separating vertebrates and invertebrates) and activities to represent seasonality and trends (attached).
- Group of 6–8 participants, representative of different community groups, gathered in a quiet place.
- Two facilitators recommended: an animator (preferably speaking the local language) and a second person to take notes and support activities.
- Discussion covers occurrence of conflict, affected activities, species involved, and mitigation efforts; all contributions are recorded.

## Seasonality of conflict
- Participants use 30 small rocks or pebbles to create a yearly timeline on sand with 12 boxes (months).
- Stones are distributed by months to reflect the presence/impact of each problematic species (vertebrates and invertebrates considered separately).
- A representative places the stones, but all participants contribute to the final decision.
- Process is repeated for all species and recorded in the field sheet.

## Trend analysis
- A line is drawn in the sand to represent years from the community’s formation to the present.
- Reference dates (climatic events, hunger, diseases, economic periods, etc.) are identified and discussed.
- The evolution of fauna presence and conflict over time is noted and recorded in the field sheet.
