# Human-wildlife focus groups

- This document is a data collection instrument to study human-wildlife conflict in agricultural communities, capturing experiences with both vertebrates and invertebrates that affect farming and livelihoods.
- It combines a structured interview/data sheet with participatory activities to document patterns of conflict and responses over time.

## What is being collected

- A. Participants and general description
  - Demographics and roles (age, gender, position in the community, main occupation, etc.)
- B. Problems with vertebrates
  - Whether fauna affect agriculture (yes/no/sometimes)
  - Main animal species present
  - Types of damage to fields or crops
  - Main crops affected
  - Instances of human attacks by wild animals
  - Actions taken by the community to reduce conflicts
  - Communication with local authorities about problems
  - Community satisfaction with interventions
  - Perceived impact on agricultural production
  - Desired measures to reduce/mitigate conflicts
  - Additional problems related to wild animals for other livelihoods
- C. Problems with invertebrates (pests)
  - Existence of pests affecting agriculture
  - Main pest species
  - Types of damage caused by pests
  - Main crops affected
  - Community actions to mitigate pest impact
  - Community satisfaction with actions
  - Belief about whether pests limit productivity
  - Desired measures to reduce pest impact
  - Additional pest-related issues for other livelihoods
- D. Activity: Seasonal calendar of conflict
  - Draw a seasonal calendar for the main species (ver­tebrates and invertebrates) and copy/photograph the results
- E. Activity: Temporal trends
  - Draw a timeline from the community’s foundation highlighting periods of higher/lower conflict and reasons, and photograph the results

## Data collection approach and outputs

- Qualitative descriptions of animal species, damages, crops, and community responses.
- Attitudinal and perceptual data on interventions and their effectiveness.
- Visual artifacts (seasonal calendar and historical timeline) captured via copy/photo for archival and analysis.
- Data intended to support understanding of when and where conflicts occur, what mitigations are perceived as effective, and how communities communicate with authorities.

## Data governance and quality considerations for Data Stewards

- Metadata and consent
  - Capture context: date, community, interviewer, participants (as appropriate) and any consent/ethical considerations.
  - Consider anonymization or aggregation if sensitive personal information is involved.
- Standardization and interoperability
  - Use consistent terminology for species, damages, crops, and interventions to enable cross-site comparisons.
  - Ensure clear coding for yes/no/sometimes responses and for qualitative descriptions.
- Data quality and completeness
  - Be aware of potentially incomplete sections due to recall bias or non-response; plan for follow-up or imputation where appropriate.
  - Preserve original artifacts (calendars, timelines) as images linked to the dataset for richer context.
- Data lifecycle and sharing
  - Define how outputs (survey responses and visual artifacts) will be stored, stored formats, and who can access them.
  - Document any data processing steps (transcription, translation, coding) to maintain auditability.
- Practical considerations
  - Anticipate challenges such as variability in local systems, diverse species and crops across communities, and the need to integrate this qualitative data with other datasets (e.g., pest reports, agricultural yields, conflict incidents).
  - Ensure data collection tools and outputs are portable and can be uploaded to portals or catalogs with appropriate metadata.

## Relevance to Data Steward objectives

- Supports governance of community-level data on human-wildlife conflict, ensuring datasets are discoverable, well-described, and usable for planning interventions and policy discussions.
- Provides a structured, repeatable method to capture user needs, behaviors, and outcomes, aligning with good data management, metadata standards, and accountability across large numbers of datasets.
