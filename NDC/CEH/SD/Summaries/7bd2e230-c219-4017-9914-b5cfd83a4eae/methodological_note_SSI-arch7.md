# Semi-structured interviews

## Objectives
- Characterize and quantify production losses due to conflict
- Assess the relation between areas of conflict and environmental variables/landscape features
- Identify mitigation measures used

## Sample
- 29 participants from 3 communities (planned larger sample, but logistics limited)
- Interview duration: 25–50 minutes

## Resources needed
- Tablet with ODK questionnaire
- 30 pebbles for appraisal of production and losses (crops and livestock)

## Methods
- Interviewees randomly selected during field work in the communities
- One or two team members applied the questionnaire, as privately as possible

## Digital data produced
- a) CSV format file with the questionnaire (ready for conversion to ODK format) – 1 CSV, in Portuguese
- b) Summary CSV file with all the data – 1 CSV, in English

## GIS implications and usage
- Data supports mapping production losses and their spatial relationships with environmental/landscape features
- Outputs can be integrated with GIS layers to analyze spatial patterns of conflict impact
- Provides bilingual (Portuguese/English) data structures suitable for downstream GIS processing and visualization
- Highlights considerations for data quality, standardization, and preparation for geospatial analysis (e.g., linking survey responses to location or area identifiers)
