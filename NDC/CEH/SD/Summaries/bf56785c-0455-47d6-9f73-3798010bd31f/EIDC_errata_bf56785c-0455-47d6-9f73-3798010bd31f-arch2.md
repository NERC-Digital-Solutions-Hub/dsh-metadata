# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Overview
- Erratum note for the United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2015 dataset.
- The dataset has been replaced with version 2 due to a precision error in reported figures.

## What changed
- Nature of error: values were provided as rounded figures when they should have included decimal places.
- Replacement: the UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset cited above has been updated to version 2.

## Implications for analysis and use
- Analyses that depended on precise decimal values may be affected; re-analyses may be needed using version 2.
- Emphasizes the importance of data provenance, version control, and transparency in monitoring datasets.

## Data stewardship and access
- Maintains standard practices: publish corrections, ensure access to the corrected dataset, and store/track dataset versions.
- Original citation remains, with the updated version available through the same dataset record (NERC Environmental Information Data Centre).
