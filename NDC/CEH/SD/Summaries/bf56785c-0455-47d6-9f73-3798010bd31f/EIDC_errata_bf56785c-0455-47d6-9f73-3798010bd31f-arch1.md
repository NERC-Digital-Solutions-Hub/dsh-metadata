# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Summary
- The United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) collated indices 2015 dataset has been replaced with version 2 by the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Reason: an error in the precision of reported figures; values were provided as rounded figures when decimals were required.

## What changed
- Replacement of the dataset with version 2 to correct decimal precision.
- The corrected data now include the appropriate decimal places rather than rounded values.

## Implications for analysis
- Analyses that used the previous version may be affected due to the precision error.
- Reanalysis with version 2 is recommended to ensure conclusions and any derived statistics reflect the corrected decimal values.

## Actions for users
- Adopt version 2 of the UKBMS collated indices 2015 for all current analyses.
- Update data provenance and metadata to reflect the correction and dataset version.
- If prior results were published or used in decision-making, consider re-running analyses and reporting any differences.
