- What happened
  - The cited UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset has been replaced with version 2.
  - The replacement was made due to an error in the precision of the reported figures.

- Nature of the error
  - Values were provided as rounded figures when they should have shown decimal places.

- Implications for monitoring practice
  - Ensure analyses, dashboards, and reports use the corrected version (version 2).
  - Reassess any conclusions or trends derived from the rounded data where decimal precision could matter.
  - Maintain clear version control and provenance to avoid use of outdated or inaccurate figures.

- Data governance and accessibility considerations
  - Highlights the importance of data quality checks on precision and metadata.
  - Emphasizes the need to communicate corrections transparently and link to updated datasets.
