# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/0.5285/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Overview
- Applies to United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2015, authored by Botham, M.; Roy, D.; Brereton, T.; Middlebrook, I.; Randle, Z. (2016), published by the NERC Environmental Information Data Centre.
- This errata notes that the dataset has been replaced with version 2 due to a precision error: values were provided as rounded figures when they should have included decimal places.

## Data Governance and Stewardship Implications
- Highlights the need for precise numerical values in ecological indices and robust versioning.
- Requires updating provenance and metadata to reflect the correction and to distinguish between version 1 and version 2.
- Users relying on the previous version may need to reassess analyses; change notices should be communicated and documented.

## Actions for Data Stewards
- Replace all references and holdings of the dataset with version 2 in relevant portals and catalogs.
- Update metadata to document the correction, specifying that decimal precision was missing and that the values now reflect proper decimal places.
- Maintain a changelog and version history for the dataset.
- Notify data users about the erratum and potential impact on analyses that used the rounding in version 1.
- Ensure downstream workflows and analyses reference version 2 to maintain reproducibility.
