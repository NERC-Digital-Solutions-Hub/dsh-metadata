# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Overview
- This is an erratum notice for the UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset, indicating a precision issue in the reported figures.

## Change implemented
- The dataset has been replaced with version 2 to correct the error.
- Original values were reported as rounded figures when decimal places were required; version 2 restores decimal precision.

## Implications for data use
- Analyses using the old version may be inaccurate due to reduced numeric precision.
- Re-analysis with the updated dataset is recommended to ensure valid results.

## Actions for data users
- Download and apply the UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset version 2.
- Update data provenance and any dependent analyses or reports.
- Compare results between versions if needed to assess impact of the changes.

## Data governance and best practice notes
- Emphasize versioned data releases and prompt communication of corrections.
- Update data dictionaries and user guides to reflect the corrected precision.
- Encourage re-running analyses and informing stakeholders of changes.
