# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Overview
- Dataset: United Kingdom Butterfly Monitoring Scheme: collated indices 2015 (NERC Environmental Information Data Centre)
- Issue: Precision error in reported figures; values were provided as rounded figures instead of showing decimal places.
- Action: The dataset has been replaced with version 2.

## What changed
- Replacing the previous version with version 2 to correct decimal precision.
- More precise numerical values now available for the collated indices 2015 dataset.

## Implications for GIS analyses
- Maps and analyses that relied on the previous rounded values may differ when using version 2.
- Potential impacts on derived metrics and trend interpretations due to updated decimal precision.

## Guidance for GIS practitioners
- Update to version 2 of the UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset (use the provided DOI link).
- Re-run analyses and regenerate map products to reflect the corrected values.
- When comparing against historical outputs, ensure consistency by using the same dataset version (version 2).
