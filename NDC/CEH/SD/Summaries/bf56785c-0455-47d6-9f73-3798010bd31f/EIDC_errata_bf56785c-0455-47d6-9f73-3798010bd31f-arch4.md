# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/bf56785c-0455-47d6-9f733798010bd31f

## Overview
- The UKBMS collated indices 2015 dataset has been updated due to a precision error in the reported figures.
- The original version reported rounded values; the corrected figures require decimal places.
- The dataset has been replaced with version 2.

## What changed
- Precision: values that should have decimal places are now correctly represented in version 2.
- Replacement: version 2 supersedes the previous version of the dataset.

## Implications for data quality and reuse
- Analyses using the previous rounded values may be affected; re-analysis with version 2 is recommended if precision matters.
- Data quality and accuracy are improved through proper decimal precision.

## Versioning, provenance, and metadata
- An erratum led to replacing the dataset with version 2; maintain traceability of this change.
- Metadata should reflect the correction, including explicit notes on precision and the version history.

## Access, discoverability, and references
- The corrected dataset (version 2) should be accessed via the same DOI/link.
- Update data catalogs, references, and downstream workflows to point to version 2.

## Actions for data leaders and users
- Notify stakeholders and data consumers about the replacement and its implications.
- Re-run analyses or downstream processes that relied on the previous precision.
- Review and update data quality checks, provenance records, and user documentation to reflect the correction.
- Ensure discoverability and proper attribution of the updated dataset version.
