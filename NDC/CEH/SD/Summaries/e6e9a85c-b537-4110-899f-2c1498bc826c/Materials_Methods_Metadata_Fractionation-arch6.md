# Materials and methods, and metadata for Phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen concentrations in UK soil mineral fractions, 2013-2014. Data taken from 'An investigation of the distribution of phosphorus between free and mineral associated soil organic matter, using density fractionation', Adams et al 2018, Plant & Soil

## Purpose and data scope
- Presents methods and metadata for concentrations of phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) in UK soil mineral fractions (light and heavy fractions) and bulk fractions from samples collected during 2013–2014 as part of LTLS (soil survey in England, Scotland and Wales).
- Data support analysis of how C, N, and P are distributed between free/organic matter and mineral-associated pools across diverse vegetation types and land uses.

## Fractionation methods (density fractionation)
- One fraction per soil sample using sodium polytungstate density of 1.6 g cm-3.
- 25 g soil subsamples placed in 400 mL bottles with 250 mL NaPT; centrifuged at 5500 rpm for 30 min.
- Light fraction (NLF) separated; for higher NLF, material collected via nylon mesh bags; remaining suspension used to recover residual light fraction.
- Fresh NaPT volume restored and processing repeated until all NLF accounted for.
- LF (light fraction) material rinsed, dried, weighed; OLF separated by sonication; HF material recovered after sequential centrifugation and rinsing until conductivity thresholds met (<50 or <200 μS cm-1; carbonate dissolution accounted for by threshold adjustments in calcareous soils).
- HF dried and ground; inorganic carbonate removal for samples with pH > 5.5 using 0.1 M HCl; samples re-dried before analysis.

## Analytical measurements
- Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) measured on milled sub-samples with a Vario EL elemental analyser.
- Total phosphorus (TP) by ignition-extraction method (Olsen & Sommers, 1982); inorganic P (IP) extracted with 0.5 M H2SO4 and analysed with molybdate; organic P (OP) derived as TP minus IP.
- Measurements replicated four-fold.
- Bulk soil analyses for C, N, and IP reported by Toberman et al. (2016) using the same C/N/IP methods but with a different TP method (aqua regia digestion with microwave digestion).

## Data structure and tables (metadata)
- Table S1: Information about soil samples (sample IDs, vegetation type, catchment, land use, date, lat/long, MAP, MAT, database IDs, depth, etc).
- Table S2: Recovery of soil mass in density fractionation (collection date, location coordinates, climate variables, land use, starting mass, soil type, depths, and mass recovery of fractions).
- Table S3: OC and TN concentration data (bulk, light fraction, heavy fraction; with corresponding units).
- Table S4: TP, IP and OP concentration data (bulk, LF, HF fractions; units in mg g-1).
- Table S5: Recoveries of OC and TN (bulk and LF+HF; percent recoveries).
- Table S6: Recoveries of TP, IP and OP (bulk and LF+HF; percent recoveries).
- All column headings and units are defined in corresponding table explanations (e.g., sample IDs, fractions, depths, units like mg g-1, %, g cm-3, pH, conductivity).

## Data quality, replication and references
- Four-fold replication for chemical analyses to ensure reliability.
- Quality checks include conductivity thresholds to confirm NaPT removal, microscopic verification of OLF disruption, and CO2 release checks for carbonate removal.
- Key references informing methods and interpretation: Cerli et al. (2012), Olsen & Sommers (1982), Schrumpf et al. (2013), Toberman et al. (2016), and Adams et al. (2018).
