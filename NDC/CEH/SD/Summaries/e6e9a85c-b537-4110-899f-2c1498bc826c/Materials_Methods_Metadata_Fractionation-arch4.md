# Materials and methods, and metadata for Phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen concentrations in UK soil mineral fractions, 2013-2014. Data taken from 'An investigation of the distribution of phosphorus between free and mineral associated soil organic matter, using density fractionation', Adams et al 2018, Plant & Soil

## Overview
- Describes density fractionation and subsequent chemical analyses to determine carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in soil fractions (light and heavy), as well as bulk analyses.
- Data underpin supplementary tables with detailed sample metadata and concentration results.

## Experimental methods and workflow
- One density fractionation per soil sample using 25 g of sieved soil in 400 mL bottles with 250 mL sodium polytungstate (NaPT) at density 1.6 g cm-3.
- Centrifugation at 5500 rpm for 30 min; floating material (NLF) removed and captured in 60 μm nylon mesh bags; procedure repeated for higher NLF in heathland/forest soils.
- Remaining suspension brought to initial volume with fresh NaPT; repeat centrifugation and separation until all NLF accounted (no more than twice).
- Mesh bag contents rinsed with deionised water; leachate checked for conductivity; target conductivity thresholds: <50 μs cm-1 (and <200 μs cm-1 for calcareous soils).
- Samples oven dried at 40 °C, weighed, stored in desiccator.
- Light fraction organic matter (OLF) extracted by sonication; disruption checked microscopically; OLF added to NLF to form LF; rinsed to target conductivity, dried and ground.
- Heavy fraction (HF) processed by refilling with water, centrifuging, and repeated rinses until waste conductivity <50 or <200 μs-1; HF dried and weighed.
- Carbonate removal in samples with bulk pH > 5.5 using 0.1 M HCl; re-dried before analyses.

## Analytical procedures
- Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) measured on milled sub-samples with a Vario EL elemental analyser.
- Total phosphorus (TP) by ignition-extraction (Olsen & Sommers 1982); inorganic phosphorus (IP) extracted with 0.5 M sulfuric acid and analyzed with molybdate; organic phosphorus (OP) = TP − IP; analyses replicated four times.
- Additional bulk soil analyses for C, N, and IP reported elsewhere (Toberman et al. 2016) with a different TP method (aqua regia/microwave).

## Data structure and metadata
- Tables S1–S6 provide structured metadata and concentration data for OC, TN, TP, IP, OP across bulk, light fraction (LF), heavy fraction (HF), and combined fractions; include recoveries.
- Column heading explanations detail:
  - Sample IDs (vegetation type, sample number, depth), location data (catchment, MAP, MAT), soil properties (pH, bulk density, mass of fractions), and fraction masses.
  - Concentration data for OC, TN (bulk, LF, HF), TP, IP, OP (bulk, LF, HF) in appropriate units (percent for OC/TN; mg g−1 for TP/IP/OP; table-specific).
  - Recovery metrics (% recovery) for OC, TN, TP, IP, OP.

## Quality assurance, reproducibility, and standards
- Rigorous rinsing to defined conductivity thresholds ensures removal of NaPT and integrity of fractions.
- Microscopic verification of complete aggregate disruption for OLF extraction.
- Fourfold replication for many analyses to ensure robustness.
- Carbonate removal step (HCl treatment) applied where appropriate to avoid carbonate interference.
- References for methods and context included (Cerli 2012; Olsen & Sommers 1982; Schrumpf 2013; Toberman et al. 2016).

## Data governance, access, and reuse considerations for data leaders
- Data are organized by soil fraction (bulk, LF, HF) with clear provenance and associated metadata, enabling cross-study comparability.
- Explicit unit definitions and fraction definitions support discoverability and correct interpretation across networks.
- The dataset supports governance needs: data lineage, reproducibility, and potential integration with wider soil data platforms (e.g., LTLS data for 2013–2014 England, Scotland, Wales).
- Potential reuse includes analyzing carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus partitioning among soil fractions, comparative studies across ecosystems, and informing data-driven soil health indicators.
