# Materials and methods, and metadata for Phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen concentrations in UK soil mineral fractions, 2013-2014. Data taken from 'An investigation of the distribution of phosphorus between free and mineral associated soil organic matter, using density fractionation', Adams et al 2018, Plant & Soil

## Overview
- Describes procedures and metadata for quantifying carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus concentrations in UK soil mineral fractions collected during 2013–2014.
- Data derived from density fractionation to separate soil into light and heavy mineral-associated fractions, plus organic components, with analyses on bulk soils and separated fractions.

## Methods in brief
- Density fractionation
  - Use 25 g soil subsamples placed in 400 mL bottles with 250 mL density-adjusted sodium polytungstate (NaPT) at 1.6 g cm-3.
  - Centrifuge at 5500 rpm for 30 min; separate floating material (NLF) and, when abundant, process through 60 μm mesh bags.
  - Refill to initial volume with NaPT and repeat until all NLF is accounted for (no more than twice).
  - Rinse, weigh, dry (40 °C), and store samples.
  - Monitor NaPT removal by conductivity; thresholds: <50 μS cm-1 (general) or <200 μS cm-1 for calcareous soils.
- Organic fraction separation
  - Extract OLF by sonication; disrupt aggregates while avoiding HF disruption; verify complete disruption microscopically.
  - Combine OLF with NLF in LF bags; wash until conductivity <50 or <200 μS cm-1.
- Fraction processing
  - Dry HF and LF fractions; re-dissolve and re-run separation until desired fractions are isolated; weigh and dry samples.
- Carbon and nitrogen analyses
  - Pre-treat samples with 0.1 M HCl for carbonates in samples with bulk soil pH > 5.5; re-dry.
  - Measure TOC and TN with a Vario EL elemental analyzer.
- Phosphorus analyses
  - Total P (TP) by ignition-extraction method (Olsen & Sommers, 1982).
  - Inorganic P (IP) by extracting 0.5 g soil with 25 mL of 0.5 M H2SO4 and analyzing extract with molybdate.
  - Organic P (OP) = TP − IP.
  - All analyses replicated four times.
- Bulk analyses
  - For comparison, bulk C, N, and IP follow Toberman et al. (2016) methods; TP analyzed with aqua regia/microwave digestion.
- Data handling
  - Conductivity checks after each centrifugation step; microscopic verification of OLF disruption; secure drying and storage of dried fractions.

## Measurements and outputs
- Concentrations reported for:
  - Organic and total carbon (OC, TOC) and nitrogen (TN, total N) in bulk and in LF/HF fractions.
  - Phosphorus fractions: total P (TP), inorganic P (IP), organic P (OP) in bulk, LF, HF, and combined LF+HF.
- Units and table structure
  - Tables S3–S6 provide OC, TN, TP, IP, OP data by sample and fraction; Tables S1–S2 provide sample metadata and recovery details.
  - Column headings capture sample origin, depth, vegetation type, catchment, land use, geographic coordinates, environmental parameters (MAP, MAT), and mass balances.
- Data quality and recoveries
  - Four-fold replication for all analyses.
  - Tables S5–S6 report OC/TN and TP/IP/OP recoveries to assess fractionation efficiency.

## Data quality, metadata, and accessibility
- Metadata richness
  - Sample IDs encode vegetation type, sample number, depth (s/d), catchment, land use, database ID, and depth.
  - Location and climate context include latitude, longitude, mean annual precipitation (MAP), and mean annual temperature (MAT).
- Standardisation and provenance
  - Protocols reference Cerli et al. (2012), Olsen & Sommers (1982), Schrumpf et al. (2013), and Toberman et al. (2016) to ensure comparability.
- Data sharing
  - Data and accompanying metadata are designed for storage in appropriate data portals and easy access for reuse and cross-study comparison.

## Relevance for environment monitoring
- Provides a consistent, standards-based dataset to assess soil carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus pools and their partitioning among mineral fractions.
- Facilitates regional and temporal comparisons of soil health and nutrient dynamics, supporting environmental health and policy performance evaluations.
- Metadata-rich tables enable dataset integration with other soil monitoring programs and environmental datasets.
