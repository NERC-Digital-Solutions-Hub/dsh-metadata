# Materials and methods, and metadata for Phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen concentrations in UK soil mineral fractions, 2013-2014

## Overview
- Describes the detailed methods and metadata for concentrations of phosphorus (P), carbon (C), and nitrogen (N) in UK soil mineral fractions (light, heavy, and non-labile fractions) from soils across England, Scotland, and Wales during 2013–2014, based on Adams et al. 2018 (Plant & Soil).
- Builds on LTLS (Soil survey in England, Scotland and Wales) data; includes procedures to separate soil organic matter by density and to quantify C, N, and P pools by fraction.

## Density fractionation and fraction separation (LF, HF, NLF, OLF)
- Each soil sample (25 g) is subjected to density fractionation using sodium polytungstate (NaPT) at density 1.6 g cm-3.
- Process:
  - Mix soil with NaPT, centrifuge at 5500 rpm for 30 min to separate fractions.
  - Non-labile fraction (NLF) is collected if present; for low NLF, removed with a pipette; for higher NLF (heathland/forest soils), collected with a spatula into 60 μm mesh bags.
  - Re-suspend and re-centrifuge to re-establish initial volume; repeat until all NLF is accounted for.
  - Rinse mesh bags with deionised water; monitor conductivity to ensure removal of NaPT (below 50 μs cm-1; <200 μs cm-1 acceptable for calcareous soils due to carbonate dissolution).
  - Weigh rinsed samples; dry at 40 °C; store in desiccator.
- Light fraction (LF) and heavy fraction (HF) handling:
  - Oxidized/light organic matter (OLF) is extracted using sonication; monitor aggregate disruption by microscopy (100×); disruption considered complete when no further OLF remains attached to minerals.
  - Post-SONICATION, stand 1 h, then centrifuge; extract OLF by pipette; combine with NLF in 60 μm bags to form LF; rinse until conductivity <50 or <200 μs-1; dry at 40 °C, weigh, and grind to fine powder.
  - HF material is re-filled with ultra-pure water, centrifuged, and supernatant measured for conductivity until <50 or <200 μs-1; HF is oven-dried at 40 °C, weighed, and ground.

## Carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus analyses
- Carbon and nitrogen:
  - For samples containing inorganic carbonate (bulk soil pH > 5.5), treat with 0.1 M HCl and re-dry after CO2 release is complete (verified by microscopy).
  - Total organic carbon (TOC) and total nitrogen (TN) measured in milled subsamples with a Vario EL elemental analyzer.
- Phosphorus analyses:
  - Total phosphorus (TP) determined by the ignition-extraction method (Olsen & Sommers 1982).
  - Inorganic phosphorus (IP) extracted by 0.5 g soil with 25 mL of 0.5 M sulfuric acid; IP quantified by molybdate method.
  - Organic phosphorus (OP) calculated as TP minus IP.
  - All C, N, and P analyses replicated four times.
- Bulk soil analyses:
  - Bulk C, N, and IP analyses follow the same methods; TP in bulk samples uses a different digestion method (aqua regia with microwave digestion) as reported by Toberman et al. 2016.
- References for methods:

## Metadata, tables, and data structure
- Data are accompanied by extensive metadata and table documentation (Tables S1–S6) detailing:
  - Sample identifiers encoding vegetation type, depth (shallow/deep), catchment, land use, etc.
  - Provenance information: catchment, land use, sample date, database IDs, and depth.
  - Table S2: Recovery of soil mass in density fractionation; table S3: OC & TN concentration data; table S4: TP, IP & OP concentration data; table S5: Recoveries of OC & TN; table S6: Recoveries of TP, IP & OP.
  - Column explanations cover units, definitions (e.g., Bulk vs LF/HF fractions; OC, TN, TP, IP, OP), and recovery metrics.
- Units and sampling details:
  - OC and TN reported as percentages for fractions; TP, IP, OP reported in mg g-1 (and related recovery percentages for fractions and bulk).
  - Sample metadata includes vegetation type codes, catchment abbreviations, land-use codes, sample numbers, depths, latitude/longitude, MAP (mean annual precipitation), MAT (mean annual temperature), bulk mass, soil type, and region-specific identifiers.

## Data provenance and related datasets
- Data aligned with LTLS soil surveys conducted in 2013–2014; bulk C, N, IP analyses follow the same protocols across fractions.
- Related datasets and methods are accessible through the LTLS data centre and the external references cited (e.g., Adams et al. 2018; Toberman et al. 2016; Cerli et al. 2012).

## Relevance for monitoring and policy decision-making
- Provides rigorous, standardized protocols for partitioning soil organic matter and associated nutrient pools by mineral fraction, enabling comparable monitoring of soil health, carbon storage, and nutrient dynamics across sites and over time.
- Rich metadata supports reproducibility, traceability, and transparent data governance, addressing key monitoring framework concerns about data provenance, metadata completeness, and data sharing.
- The detailed methods and documentation help stakeholders assess data quality, interpret fraction-specific C, N, and P dynamics, and inform policy decisions on soil management, carbon accounting, and nutrient cycling.

## Key challenges and considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Data availability and accessibility: extensive laboratory requirements and data-sharing considerations (e.g., conductivity monitoring, sample handling, and documentation) may pose barriers.
- Metadata completeness: the comprehensive table metadata is essential for data usability and cross-site comparability.
- Data transformation and standardization: complex fractionation and analysis require careful standardization to maintain consistency across monitoring programs.
- Governance and transparency: explicit data provenance, replication records, and method references support data governance and open science goals.
