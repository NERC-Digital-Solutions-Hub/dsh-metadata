# The seed set of Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats comprising different floral cover

- Overview
  - Dataset of seed counts (seed set) for Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats with varying floral cover.
  - Collected in June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
  - Experimental arrays comprised of three E. californica plants, 1 m apart, arranged in a triangular formation.
  - 16 arrays across four 100 ha replicate blocks, each >500 m apart.
  - At block centers, four arrays positioned along a 150 m transect across the boundary between an established wildflower patch and bare/fallow ground or grazed grassland; two arrays in florally rich habitat and two in florally poor habitat.

- Experimental design
  - Plants grown from seed and introduced to form experimental arrays (three plants per array).
  - Four replicate blocks; arrays within each block organized along a transect with 50 m spacing between arrays.
  - Habitat context defined as florally rich vs florally poor.

- Collection methods
  - All open flowers removed before placement; one bud per plant covered with muslin to represent a pollinator-excluded flower.
  - Field exposure lasted 16 days to ensure full anthesis and multiple pollination events.
  - Fruits tagged to ensure analyses include only fruit developed during the field period.
  - Plants collected and stored under controlled glasshouse conditions (day 20°C / night 15°C; 12:12 light:dark) until fruit maturation.
  - Upon maturation, tagged fruits were counted for the number of filled seeds per fruit.

- Data structure
  - Single CSV file: Eschscholzia_californica_seed_set.csv.
  - Key columns and meanings:
    - Block: replication block identifier.
    - Experimental array: identifier for each of the four arrays per block (three plants per array).
    - Plant identification number: pre-field plant ID (relevant for the wider project).
    - Sample type: whether the flower was exposed to pollinators or excluded.
    - Fruit number: identifier for each analyzed fruit per plant.
    - Habitat: location context of the array ( florally rich/poor).
    - Treatment: contextual treatment related to exposure status.

- Provenance and documentation
  - Part of a larger experiment examining the effect of floral resources on pollination services to isolated plants.
  - Dataset is described as complete and was collected and interpreted by Evans, T.M.
