# The seed set of Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats comprising different floral cover

## Purpose and context
- Dataset documents seed counts (seed set) of Eschscholzia californica introduced to experimental arrays across habitats with different floral cover.
- Part of a larger study on how floral resources affect pollination services to isolated plants.
- Collected in June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK; plants grown from seed and arranged in standardized arrays.

## Experimental design
- Each array: three E. californica plants, 1 m apart in a triangular arrangement.
- 16 arrays across four replicate blocks (each 100 ha) separated by more than 500 m.
- Within each block center, four arrays positioned along a 150 m transect crossing the boundary between florally rich habitat (wildflower patch) and florally poor habitat (bare/fallow or grazed grassland).
- In each block, two arrays in florally rich habitat and two in florally poor habitat.

## Collection methods
- Prior to placement, all open flowers were removed.
- One bud per plant was enclosed with muslin to create a pollinator-excluded flower.
- Field exposure lasted 16 days to ensure full anthesis and multiple pollination events.
- After exposure, all fruit were tagged to link fruit development to the experimental period.
- Plants were collected and stored in controlled glasshouse conditions (day 20°C / night 15°C; 12:12 light:dark) until fruit maturation.
- Upon maturation, the number of filled seeds per fruit was counted to quantify seed set.

## Data structure and content
- Data stored in a single CSV file: Eschscholzia_californica_seed_set.csv.
- Key columns:
  - Block: replicate block identifier.
  - Experimental array: array identifier within each block.
  - Plant identification number: pre-field plant ID.
  - Sample type: whether flowers were exposed to pollinators or excluded.
  - Fruit number: identifier for each fruit analyzed per plant.
  - Habitat: location context ( florally rich vs florally poor).
  - Treatment: exposure status related to pollination (exposed vs excluded).

## Provenance and documentation
- Dataset described as complete and collected/interpreted by Evans, T.M.
- Supported by documentation titled “The seed set of Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats comprising different floral cover.”
- Part of a broader experiment examining how floral resources influence pollination services to isolated plants.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and governance
- Provides a standardized, replicate-based design to monitor how habitat context and pollinator availability affect plant reproduction.
- Data structure supports comparative analyses across habitat contexts, facilitating monitoring of pollination service delivery and the outcomes of floral-resource management.
- Highlights the importance of detailed metadata (plots, arrays, treatments, habitats) for transparency, reproducibility, and governance in environmental monitoring datasets.
