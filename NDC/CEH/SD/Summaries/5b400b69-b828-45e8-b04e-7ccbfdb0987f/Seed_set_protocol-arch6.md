# The seed set of Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats comprising different floral cover

- Dataset of seed counts for Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into experimental arrays across habitats with varying floral cover.
- Collected in June 2015 at the Hillesden estate, Buckinghamshire, UK.
- Experimental design: arrays of three E. californica plants (1 m apart) arranged in a triangular formation.
- 16 arrays across four 100 ha replicate blocks, each >500 m apart.
- In each block, four arrays placed at 50 m intervals along a 150 m transect across the boundary between a wildflower patch and bare fallow ground or grazed grassland; two arrays in florally rich habitat and two in florally poor habitat.
- For each plant, seed set was measured for flowers exposed to pollinators and for flowers excluded from pollinators to assess habitat context effects on reproduction.
- Part of a larger experiment investigating the effect of floral resources on pollination services to isolated plants.
- Dataset is complete and was collected and interpreted by Evans, T.M.
- Supporting documentation: The seed set of Eschscholzia californica plants introduced into habitats comprising different floral cover.
- Related to a broader study on how floral resources influence pollination services.

Experimental design details

- Plants grown from seed and introduced in June 2015 to form experimental arrays.
- Each array contains three plants, 1 m apart, in a triangular arrangement.
- Four replicate blocks (each ~100 ha) with arrays >500 m apart.
- Central transect arrangement: four arrays per block, positioned along a 150 m transect crossing the boundary between florally rich and florally poor habitats; two arrays in each habitat type.

Collection methods

- Prior to placement, all open flowers removed from 48 plants.
- One bud per plant covered with muslin to create pollinator-excluded flowers.
- Field period of 16 days to ensure full anthesis and multiple pollination events.
- Fruits tagged to ensure only those developing during the field period are analyzed.
- Plants transported to controlled glasshouse conditions (day:night 20°C:15°C; light:dark 12:12) until fruit maturation.
- Upon maturation, tagged fruits collected; the number of filled seeds per fruit counted to quantify seed set.

Data structure

- All data contained in a single CSV file: Eschscholzia_californica_seed_set.csv.
- Key columns:
  - Block: replicate block ID
  - Experimental array: array ID within each block
  - Plant identification number: pre-field plant ID
  - Sample type: exposed vs pollinator-excluded
  - Fruit number: identifier for each fruit analyzed per plant
  - Habitat: florally rich vs florally poor location
  - Treatment: pollinator exposure condition
- Clear labeling to enable self-serve analyses of habitat effects on seed set and pollination context.
