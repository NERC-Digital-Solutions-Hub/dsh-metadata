# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME VEGETATION AND SOIL FIELD HANDBOOK

## Overview and Aim
- Field protocol for Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (GMEP) to quantify changes in Welsh habitats and landscape over time.
- Provides repeatable, fixed-point photographic and vegetation/soil data to support WP4 Landscape analysis and objective monitoring of Glastir effects.
- Data collected supports a fixed-time series across 1km squares, enabling habitat- and landscape-level insights.

## Data Capture Framework and Tools
- Data capture via VegPlots forms-based software on tablets; ArcMap integration with VegPlotsWelsh.mxd for plot mapping.
- For each plot: header data, plot photos, and a sketch map; most data captured digitally; paper plot maps may also be used.
- Plot relocation aids: plot photographs, plot sketch maps, and GPS points to re-find exact locations in subsequent surveys.
- GPS and location accuracy: differential Trimble GPS used for high accuracy; tablet GPS as backup; snapping and GPS log management to aid re-finding plots.
- Outputs and accessibility: data products include dashboards, reports, and visualisations to enable self-serve access and feedback loops; outputs may be promoted and iterated.

## Plot Location, Allocation, and Mapping
- Randomised X plots: in each square, five X plots placed at predefined random points; used as the primary reference for locating other plots.
- Countryside Survey squares (CS) revisited in 2016 to extend a globally unique time series; approach documented in Additional Note 5.
- Plot-layer access: ArcMap and VegPlots are integrated; new plots added as ArcMap features, then data entered in VegPlots.
- Plot allocation to Glastir option groups: from 2015 onward, plots are allocated to in-/out-of-option land using a GIS-based approach and the Plot Calculator. Both are used to derive numbers and locations of plots by habitat type and linear feature.
- Objects and feature types: plots include a variety of types (X, Y, U, A, M, H, D, S, W, P, B, R/V) placed based on habitat type, linear features, and option status.

## Plot Types and Core Sampling Designs
- X Plots (X1–X5): 4 m² plots (2x2 m) in most habitats; 200 m² in woodland; five random positions per square; used to project other plots (B, H, D, P) and to sample within woodland where applicable.
- Y Plots (Y1–Y5): 2x2 m plots in enclosed habitats and Priority Habitats (PH); aim to sample PH and enclosed habitat areas (in- and out-of-option).
- U Plots (U1–U10): 2x2 m plots in unenclosed Broad Habitats; number per square based on proportion of unenclosed habitat; compulsory 1 plot per unenclosed BH; distribution between in-option and out-of-option land.
- A Plots (A1–A5): Arable field margins; 100 m long x 1 m wide; positioned adjacent to B plots or along arable margins; only 1 A plot per in-option arable field.
- M Plots (M1–Mx): 2x2 m margins plots; used to sample margin types associated with agri-environment schemes; positioned relative to A plots and field margins.
- H Plots (H1–H2): Hedgerow plots (10x1 m); placed on hedges near X plots (two per square); may be uncoupled or reassigned depending on WLF shape and option status.
- D Plots (D1–D10): Hedgerow diversity plots; 30x1 m along woody Linear Features (WLFs); central to H plots; assess tree/shrub layers, gaps, and habitat structure.
- S/W Plots (S1–S2, W1–W3): Streamside/waterside plots; S plots on watercourses nearest to the two farthest apart X plots; W plots add sampling along other watercourses; RHS integration implied for 2015+.
- P Plots (P1–P5): Perpendicular plots; up to 5 per square; project upslope from S/W plots to capture riparian buffer effects; nested divides up the slope with species recorded by nest.
- B Plots (B1–B5): Boundary plots along field boundaries; position near X plots; record along the 1 m strip outward from the boundary.
- R/V Plots (R/V): Roadside verge plots; along roadsides near X plots; older CS-type plots retained for comparability; sampling is cautious due to land-use constraints.
- Integration and sampling balance: Plot Calculator used to allocate plots to option groups; plots are proportionally sampled to reflect plot-able land area and option uptake; multiple plot types may be projected from X plots but uncoupled if necessary to maintain proportional sampling.

## Data Collection Details by Plot Type
- Size and layout: detailed per plot type (e.g., X: 4 m² or 200 m² woodland, Y: 4 m², U: 4 m², A: long margins, M: 2x2 m, etc.).
- Habitat and options: classification into enclosed/unenclosed habitats; option in/out status; mosaic handling; proportional sampling with Plot Calculator.
- Headers and data: comprehensive header data for each plot type (slope, aspect, shade, photos, plot map status, etc.); generic and plot-specific header fields (e.g., B plots include boundary type).
- Listed and Selected species: species recorded via tablet with multiple groups (Common, Grasses, Sedges/Rushes, Ferns, Forbs/Woody, Mosses/Lichens); nesting approach (nest 0–5) to enable multi-scale recording; percent cover recorded in 5% steps; unidentified species allowed (A-C and D-Z) for later identification.
- Coverage and validation: total cover accounting with nested quadrats where applicable; validation workflow highlighted with red fields for missing data; careful avoidance of double counting.
- Special notes: controlled combinations for difficult taxa; bryophyte and lichen lists constrained to prescribed taxa; guidance against uprooting invasive species.

## Data Management, QA, and Repeats
- QA workflow: Save frequently; Validate before exiting; red-highlighted missing fields; ensure data integrity across nesting and cover fields.
- Plot relocation and repeat measurements: “Plot Recorded” status (Found, Not Found, New Plot Replacement, New Plot (New feature/Land cover), Not appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous); documentation supports repeat surveys and replacement strategies.
- Relocation logistics: use of metal plates or stakes to mark earlier plots; metal detector tools provided; if plates cannot be located within time, use best available evidence (sketch maps/photos) or create a new plot.
- Prior survey data integration: references to previous survey locations (CS 1978/1990/1998/2007) and eventual alignment with current VegPlots records; decisions on relocation influence data comparability.

## Landscape Photography and Outputs
- Photography objective: fixed-point landscape imagery to quantify enclosure, openness, texture, and visual experience; used to validate spatial analyses and monitor landscape change.
- Method: photography from four X-plot centers per square quadrant; four directions (N, E, S, W); optional 360-degree panorama; standardized orientation markers and compass-based alignment.

## Field Equipment, Soil Sampling, and Transport
- Equipment set: electric cooler box; field tool pack including soil corer, gouge auger, spades, rulers, etc.; curated sample bags and envelopes for X plots.
- Soil sampling layout (X plots): three cores (Chemistry, Physics, Fauna) at 15 cm from the south corner of the 2 m grid; five Gouge auger samples placed in a tin for DNA analysis; fauna core stored refrigerated.
- Sample handling and dispatch: cores labeled C (Chemistry, black cap), P (Physics, white), B (Biology, tin with holes), F (Fauna, short white); samples stored in cool boxes and mailed to Bangor/Lancaster with careful packaging to prevent leaks; shipping rules explicit about timing (avoid weekend/posting on Thursdays/Fridays).

## Additional Notes, Updates, and Guidance
- 2016 updates: incorporation of repeat Countryside Survey squares; enhanced allocation logic for Glastir options via Plot Calculator and habitat mapping.
- Software and workflow notes: VegPlots software updates and issues tracked (e.g., GPS log handling, dropdown responsiveness, D/P plot validation guidance, improved snapping to GPS points); ongoing training and handbook refinements.
- Aggregations and bryophytes: emphasis on recording at the species level where possible; use of amalgamated taxa when necessary; bryophyte and lichen lists constrained to prescribed taxa with priority on vascular plants.
- Appendix-style operational details: centre-map centering, landscape photography workflow, and 13.1–13.4 guidance for locating, updating, and finding previous plot locations.
