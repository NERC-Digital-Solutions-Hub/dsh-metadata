# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME VEGETATION AND SOIL FIELD HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise policy (Glastir) and inform future decisions.
  - Provide repeatable, fixed-point vegetation and soil data to quantify changes in the Welsh countryside and assess Glastir option uptake.

- Aims and monitoring framework context
  - Create a robust, time-series dataset linking habitat change to Glastir options.
  - Produce outputs (reports, charts, dashboards) and ensure accessible, well-governed underlying data.

- Data collection framework and governance
  - Field data collected via fixed vegetation and soil plots across 1 km squares; emphasis on repeatability and precise relocation.
  - Core data handled through VegPlots (forms-based tablet software) and ArcMap-based VegPlots layers; plot photos stored and linked to plots; paper plot maps retained for relocation aid.
  - Emphasis on metadata, data cleaning, quality assurance, clear presentation of results, and data governance for sharing.

- Plot allocation, design and sampling framework
  - Plots are allocated to Glastir option groups (six groups defined by habitat and linear feature type) using a Plot Calculator.
  - Sampling design covers multiple plot types (see below) with proportional sampling to available plot-able land in each 1 km square.
  - Location and layout combine random placement (where appropriate) and option-based targeting, with explicit rules to avoid overlap and ensure representative coverage.

- Plot types and their purposes (summary)
  - X plots (X1–X5): Main random plots; vary by habitat and woodland; sub-plots and nesting structure; used to capture broad vegetation across the square.
  - Y plots (Y1–Y5): 2x2 m plots for enclosed habitats and Priority Habitats (PH); targeted to capture floristic representation and PH diversity.
  - U plots (U1–U10): Unenclosed broad habitats; up to 10 plots per square; proportionally allocated to in-option and out-of-option land.
  - B plots (B1–B5): Boundary plots along field boundaries; 10x1 m; placed to sample linear features at boundaries.
  - A plots (A1–A5): Arable field margin plots; 100x1 m; placed adjacent to arable margins; alignment with B plots.
  - M plots (M1–Mx): Margin plots (2x2 m) sampling arable margins and margin types under Glastir.
  - H plots (H1–H2): Hedgerow plots; 10x1 m along hedgerows with emphasis on hedgerow features and their management.
  - D plots (D1–D10): Hedgerow diversity plots; 30x1 m along hedgerows; detailed measurements of canopy structure, gaps, trees, and diversity.
  - S/W plots (S1–S2, W1–W3): Streamside/waterside plots; 10x1 m; sample along watercourses with in-option and out-of-option allocations.
  - P plots (P1–P5): Perpendicular plots; nested within S/W plots; up to 5 per square; sample upslope vegetation to capture gradient effects; complex layout with nesting.
  - R/V plots: Roadside verge plots; historical CS references; sampling along roadsides; generally not a primary focus for Glastir-intervention sampling in newer GMEP work.
  - Notes: X plots can be 4 m2 (or 2x2 m in certain contexts); woodlands may use larger X plots (200 m2) for nested sampling.

- Data capture workflow and field protocols
  - Vegetation data captured via VegPlots with fields for: header (plot relocation status, slope, aspect, shade, photos, plot map status), vegetation height strata (canopy, shrub, ground), admin (surveyor initials, plot completion, validation).
  - Listed species: presence/absence and 5% cover categories across nested plots; nest structure defines which species are recorded where.
  - Selected species: aggregated into a species list per plot with nest IDs and total cover estimates; red/green validation cues guide data entry.
  - Plot relocation and repeat visits: emphasis on re-finding plots using GPS (differential where possible), sketch maps, and photos; in Countryside Survey squares (CS) precise relocation is especially critical due to long-running time series.
  - Data quality control: validation highlights missing fields; plots must be saved regularly; final validation required before changing plots or exiting.

- Repeat surveys, time-series and historical linkage
  - Repeated measurements in Countryside Survey squares (CS) to extend the globally unique time series (began 1978, with follow-ups in 1990, 1998, 2007, and planned repeats).
  - 2016 re-visits and cross-year data integration emphasized; Additional Note 5 provides guidance on tackling repeat CS squares.
  - Techniques to locate, replace, or relocate plots when access changes; emphasis on maximizing repeatability while adapting to land-use changes.

- Landscape photography and landscape metrics
  - Landscape photography used to monitor landscape change, enclosure/openness/texture from fixed viewpoints near X plots; standardized directions and markers to aid repeat photography.
  - Four X plots per square (nearest to square centre) are used as staging points for landscape photography; panoramas encouraged when available.

- Soil and ancillary sampling (Section 14)
  - Field equipment and sampling protocol for soil cores and Gouge auger samples included (Chemistry, Physics, Biology, Fauna cores).
  - Core collection layout and labeling; sample storage in cool conditions; postal dispatch to designated labs (Bangor for chemistry/phys/biology; Lancaster for fauna).
  - Detailed handling guidance for soil types (mineral, organic) and for maintaining sample integrity and chain-of-custody.

- Data documentation, storage, and dissemination
  - Data are stored with explicit square and plot identifiers, nested plots, and plot IDs; photos and sketch maps are linked to the corresponding plot records.
  - Emphasis on transparent metadata, repeatable relocation, and clear documentation to support QA and future analyses.
  - Guidance for updating or redrawing maps when prior records are revised; use of GPS snapping to improve repeatability.

- Challenges, barriers, and governance considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - The handbook presumes robust data governance and metadata standards to enable data sharing and long-term analyses.
  - Practical challenges include data accessibility, metadata completeness, cross-year standardization, and ensuring consistent data capture across teams and years.
  - The framework relies on integration with GIS tools (ArcMap, VegPlots), standardized data schemas, and well-documented procedures to minimize duplication and maximize utility for policy evaluation.

- Implications for authors of monitoring frameworks
  - Emphasizes the need for clear, repeatable protocols, explicit data-sharing considerations, and governance structures that enable timely data availability.
  - Demonstrates how to align field sampling design with policy-relevant objectives (Glastir option uptake and habitat change) while maintaining rigorous QA and documentation.
  - Provides a concrete case study of balancing detailed ecological sampling with practical field constraints, and of embedding data management within the monitoring workflow.
