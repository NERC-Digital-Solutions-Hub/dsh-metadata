# Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme Vegetation Monitoring

## Purpose and policy relevance
- Establishes a comprehensive vegetation monitoring program to assess the effects of the Glastir agri-environment schemes on Wales’ environment.
- Provides evidence to track progress toward reversing native biodiversity decline and meeting obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) 2020.

## Monitoring design and scope
- Adopts a 4-year rolling survey cycle (2013–2016 in the described period) to maximise site coverage while enabling year-to-year monitoring of spatial and temporal trends.
- Two components:
  - Wider Wales component: baseline estimation, national trends, national reporting for Glastir.
  - Targeted component: links to Glastir priority areas.
- Uses a common spatial unit of 1 km² to enable integration with other surveys (e.g., Countryside Survey GB).
- Total of 300 1 km squares sampled over the four-year cycle.
- Sampling plan:
  - Half of squares randomly sampled within Land Classification strata to minimize environmental heterogeneity within strata.
  - Half of squares targeted at Glastir priority areas.
  - Exclusions: squares with >75% urban land or >90% sea.
- Design aims to provide robust national and sub-national indicators with cost-effective monitoring.

## Data collection methods and plot design
- Vegetation survey records plant species presence and abundance across diverse plot types (nests within plots) to capture multi-scale vegetation data and habitat features.
- Plot types (examples):
  - X plots: Random/Main, large and small sizes; dispersed random points.
  - Y plots: Small, targeted/enclosed habitats; focused on priority habitats.
  - U plots: Unenclosed broad habitats.
  - B plots: Boundaries along field edges.
  - A plots: Arable field edges; paired with X plots when not in Glastir option.
  - M plots: Field margins.
  - H plots: Hedgerows.
  - D plots: Hedgerow diversity.
  - S/W, P plots: Streamside and upslope habitats; include P plots that extend upslope perpendicular to watercourses.
  - R/V plots: Roadside verge plots.
- Plot sizes and counts per square vary by type (e.g., 4 m² to 200 m² for most, up to 10 m x 1 m for roadside verges).
- Data collection practices:
  - Complete vascular plant lists plus selected bryophytes and macro-lichens; some aggregates recorded for difficult taxa.
  - Canopy and habitat information recorded; plots trained in species identification; samples sent to experts when needed.
  - Core field handbook governs methods; predicated on GB Countryside Survey protocols with some deviations to reflect Glastir priorities.
- Data capture includes detailed plot metadata (location, environmental variables, plot year, etc.) and species-level abundance data by nest.

## Data files and metadata
- Three main vegetation-related files (2013–2016) documenting plots, species per plot, and perpendicular nest measurements:
  - GMEP_VEGETATION_PLOTS_2013_16.csv: plot-level metadata and biodiversity observations; includes coordinates, plot type, year, and various habitat/vegetation characteristics.
  - GMEP_VEGETATION_PLOTS_SPECIES_2013_16.csv: species occurrences and cover within plots; includes species codes, scientific and common names, nest level, and cover metrics.
  - GMEP_VEGETATION_PLOTS_PNESTS_2013_16.csv: details of P plots nests, including nest counts and extents.
- Data follow standardized recording methods; location design based on ITE Land Classification (2007); nomenclature aligned with Stace (1997) for flora.
- Data quality and governance:
  - Rigorous field training, field handbooks, and ongoing management oversight.
  - Quality Assurance (QA) exercise to assess consistency and reliability; about 10% of the total sample resurveyed by botanical experts.
  - QA plots re-recorded in the southeast of 1 km squares; use of photographs and sketch maps to verify plots and species.
  - Data management aligned with UKCEH Quality Management System; ISO 9001:2015 certified; formal QA policies and procedures.

## Quality control and assurance
- Consistency ensured through comprehensive training, standard methodologies, and field handbooks.
- QA exercises conducted to quantify reliability and check sampling appropriateness; resurvey of a representative subset of squares.
- Across years, the field surveyors captured roughly 85–91% of the species recorded by QA assessors, indicating generally high data quality.
- UKCEH maintains formal quality policies and a certified Quality Management System.

## Relevance, outputs, and integration
- Data contribute to biodiversity indicators at national and regional scales and support policy evaluation of Glastir's environmental outcomes.
- Methodology designed to be compatible with Countryside Survey protocols to facilitate integration and potential future data synthesis at GB level.

## Appendices: governance and field teams
- Appendix 1 outlines roles, tasks, and responsibilities (e.g., database management, field team management, lead scientists, statistical and vegetation experts, QA, project management).
- Field Survey Teams listing includes numerous named participants who conduct data collection across Wales.

## Challenges and practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Resource constraints necessitated adjustments (e.g., reducing plot sizes from larger to smaller during 2015–2016 due to capacity).
- Balancing representation of Glastir options within squares while maintaining random sampling integrity.
- Adhering to and integrating with GB Countryside Survey protocols, while accommodating Glastir-specific targeting.
- Ensuring timely access to data and metadata, and maintaining data openness and governance to facilitate wide use and reproducibility.
