# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Purpose and Scope
- Governs research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and BBSRC/NERC in their institutes.
- Applies to all types of research; overriding principle is fitness for purpose.
- Aims to ensure quality of research process (QP) and quality of science (QS); promotes best scientific practice from the start.
- Emphasises that outputs should be credible, repeatable, auditable, and well governed, including map-based data products used by GIS professionals.

## Principles
- Commitment to QP (robust processes, auditability) and QS (clear aims, sound methods, valid conclusions).
- Top-level and organisational commitment to quality and competency.
- Fitness for purpose guides all provisions; researchers should be competent and adequately trained.

## Compliance
- Proposals to Funding Bodies must indicate acceptance of the Code; discussions on inappropriate clauses may occur and become part of terms and conditions.
- Contractors are responsible for compliance and for ensuring subcontractors adhere to JCoPR.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director is required.

## Monitoring
- Organisations should have formal, auditable systems to assure compliance, ideally against an international standard fit for purpose.
- Funding Bodies reserve the right to request evidence or conduct independent audits of a contractor’s research system (e.g., via UKAS).

## Responsibilities
- The contractor organization is responsible for overall research quality and adherence to in-house policies.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skills development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including subcontractors; clear responsibilities must be defined and communicated.

## Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training must be supervised to prevent compromising results.
- Documented evidence of capabilities and training is required; records must show awareness of JCoPR provisions.

## Project Planning
- Conduct appropriate risk assessment to identify factors affecting success and objective attainment.
- Produce a clear, written project plan agreed with the Funding Body, considering ethical approvals and licences as applicable.
- Schedule regular timetable/project plan reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

## Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes; conduct regular reviews.
- Output authorisation must be approved by the Funding Body and senior management where required.
- Notify the Funding Body of errors post-publication and implement corrective actions promptly.
- Continual improvement of processes and procedures.

## Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

## Handling of Samples and Materials
- Labeling must be clear, accurate, unique, and durable; retention periods agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage/handling plans must be appropriate; critical storage conditions must be monitored and recorded.
- Samples/materials should be traceable through all stages and have defined disposal routes.

## Facilities and Equipment
- Work environment must support safe operation, sample integrity, and good practice.
- Equipment must be appropriate, calibrated, and well-maintained; contingency plans for disruption.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) must exist for critical equipment.

## Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented with a clear audit trail, including version control and links from processed data to primary data.
- Procedures for validating methods as fit-for-purpose; traceable modifications through development stages.

## Research / Work Records
- Records must be detailed enough to allow replication; project leader ensures validity through regular reviews.
- Location and integrity of critical data must be recorded and retained securely for an agreed period.

## Field-based Research
- Fieldwork must comply with environmental laws; laboratories must manage discharges/emissions to minimize pollution.
- All provisions of JCoPR apply to field-based work.

## Annex – Documentary Evidence (Examples)
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists, sub-contractor agreements, roles and responsibilities.
- Personnel Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of JCoPR obligations.
- Project Planning: risk assessments, updated project plans, milestone records, validated procedures, ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal audit records, fit-for-purpose reviews, publication authorisation procedures.
- Health & Safety: training/compliance documents (e.g., Health & Safety Plan), specialist measures as needed.
- Handling of Samples & Materials: standardized labeling/tracking, storage logs, procedures.
- Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of Procedures & Methods: documentation/version control processes, validated SOPs.
- Research/Work Records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files, consistent archiving.
- Field-based Research: documented risk assessments for field activities.
