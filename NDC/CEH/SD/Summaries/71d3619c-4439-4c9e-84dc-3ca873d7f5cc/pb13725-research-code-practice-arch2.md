# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- A framework for the proper conduct of research funded by UK environmental and science bodies.
- Distinguishes between quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS); emphasizes fitness-for-purpose as the overriding principle.
- Applies to all research funded by Defra, the FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their institutes.
- Endorsed by multiple government and related agencies; launched in 2003 and effective from 2004.
- Includes an audit program (UKAS) and ongoing revision based on audit findings and stakeholder input.

## Principles behind the Code
- Contractors should commit to QP (process quality) and QS (scientific quality).
- QS focuses on project aims, approaches, and knowledge extraction; QP ensures rigorous, repeatable, auditable processes.
- Promotes best scientific practice from project start; top-level commitment within funded organisations.
- Contractors must be competent and adequately trained; governance should ensure diligence and fitness-for-purpose.

## Compliance with the Code
- Proposals to funding bodies require acceptance of the Code; discussions about inappropriate clauses may be recorded and become part of funding terms.
- Contractors responsible for project compliance and for ensuring subcontractors comply with the Code.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, Institute Director’s annual acceptance is required.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies and processes to ensure Code compliance, applied consistently.
- Funding Bodies expect assurance through formal quality systems, ideally audited by an impartial third party against international standards.
- The Funding Bodies reserve the right to verify compliance, including independent audits.

## 4. Specific requirements of the Code

### 4.1. Responsibilities
- The contractor organisation holds overall research quality responsibility, including policy compliance.
- Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice and ongoing skill development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work, including subcontractors; clear roles and responsibilities must be documented.

### 4.2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training must be supervised to maintain quality.
- Contractors must provide evidence of capability and maintain training records; personnel aware of Code obligations.

### 4.3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessment to identify factors affecting success and objective attainment.
- Maintain a written project plan addressing research design, statistics, etc., agreed with the Funding Body.
- Schedule regular timetable reviews; major amendments require pre-approval by the Funding Body.

### 4.4. Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequency.
- Output authorization as agreed with the Funding Body; post-publication errors must be reported and corrected promptly.
- Continual improvement through regular review of processes and procedures.

### 4.5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant Health and Safety regulations.

### 4.6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention period agreed with the Funding Body.
- Storage and handling described in project plan; monitor critical storage conditions.
- Track samples through analysis/use with defined disposal routes and dates.

### 4.7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe working environment; proper maintenance of facilities (e.g., fume cupboards).
- Equipment appropriate for measurements; regular calibration; contingency plans for disruptions.
- Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for critical equipment.

### 4.8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- Document all procedures and methods, creating an audit trail with document/version control.
- Include analytical and statistical procedures; ensure methods are validated as fit for purpose and trace modifications.

### 4.9. Research / work records
- Records must be thorough to enable repeatability; regular reviews by the Project Leader.
- Locate and retain critical data securely and in a way that prevents unauthorized modification; retention period agreed with the Funding Body.

### 4.10. Field-based research
- Comply with all relevant environmental legislation.
- Manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risk.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field-based work.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Responsibilities: organisation chart; list of personnel (including subcontractors); agreements with subcontractors; roles/responsibilities for all staff.
- Personnel competence: CVs; up-to-date training records; awareness of Code obligations.
- Project planning: risk assessments; records of timetable reviews; approved project plan; statistical validation; procedural sampling documents; ethical approvals and licenses.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose review procedures; records of audits and corrective actions; publication authorization procedures.
- Health & safety: training/compliance documentation; specific safety measures for high-risk contexts.
- Handling of samples & materials: standardized labeling/tracking; procedures; storage logs.
- Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records; regular facility maintenance; SOPs for critical equipment.
- Documentation of procedures & methods: robust document/version control; validated SOPs.
- Research/work records: consistent storage (hard copy/electronic); archiving procedures.
- Field-based research: documented risk assessments for field activities.

## Implications for Environmental Data Analysts
- Ensure data workflows align with QP and QS—document methods, controls, and validation steps.
- Embed fitness-for-purpose focus: design data collection and analysis plans that address objectives and standards.
- Build robust data management: clear version control, audit trails, and secure retention of datasets and analysis outputs.
- Plan for risk and compliance: incorporate risk assessments, ethical approvals where relevant, and adherence to environmental regulations in fieldwork.
- Prepare for audits: maintain documentary evidence (training, competencies, SOPs, quality reviews) to support third-party audits.
- Manage subcontractors and data provenance: ensure all collaborators follow the JCoPR provisions and that data lineage is traceable from primary data to outputs.
- Facilitate data reuse and sharing: maintain standardized formats and metadata to enable integration with other datasets and portals.
- Ensure continuity of quality control: regular reviews of data processes, not just final outputs, to support continual improvement and reliability of environmental monitoring datasets.
