# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A governance framework for funded research across UK government and research bodies to ensure quality and fitness-for-purpose in both research processes and scientific outputs.
- Applies to research funded by Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, UK Devolved Administrations, and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work; emphasises detainee-like responsibility, competence, and auditability.

## Background
- Originally developed by BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC; endorsed and extended to devolved administrations and other agencies.
- Launched May 2003; effective June 2004; subject to periodic audits (e.g., UKAS) to ensure compliance.
- Intended to apply to all research types funded under the participating bodies; guiding principle is fitness of purpose.

## Principles behind the Code
- Focus on two quality dimensions:
  - Quality of the research process (QP): rigorous, auditable, repeatable, and well-managed procedures.
  - Quality of the science (QS): aims, methods, and knowledge extraction are sound.
- Emphasises best scientific practice from project start; compliance should be driven from senior levels.
- Research should be conducted diligently by competent, adequately trained researchers.

## Compliance with the Code
- Contractors indicate acceptance via project proposals; discussions about inappropriate clauses may occur and become part of terms and conditions.
- Contractors are responsible for project compliance and for ensuring subcontractors adhere to JCoPR.
- For some funders (BBSRC/NERC), Institute Director acceptance is required annually.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have policies/processes to ensure compliance; ideally verified by formal third-party audits against international standards.
- Funding bodies may audit a contractor’s research system or request evidence of compliance.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organization: overall quality and policy compliance.
- Managers/supervisors: foster good scientific practice and ongoing skill development.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader: responsibility for all project work, including subcontractors; clear roles assigned to all staff.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training supervised to protect quality.
- Documented evidence of capability and training; maintain up-to-date training records.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessment; develop a written project plan addressing design, statistics, and other factors.
- Plans must be agreed with the Funding Body; align with ethical approvals/licences if relevant.
- Schedule regular reviews; major amendments require pre-approval.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
- Outputs require appropriate senior-level approval; notify Funding Body of post-publication errors and take corrective action.
- Continuous improvement through regular process reviews.

## 5. Health and Safety
- Compliance with all relevant health and safety regulations.

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods agreed with Funding Body.
- Storage conditions monitored and recorded; tracking of samples through analysis; defined disposal routes.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe working environment; regular calibration and maintenance of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures/methods documented with audit trails, document/version control, and linkage to primary data.
- Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose; traceable modifications.

## 9. Research / work records
- High-quality, repeatable records; regular reviews by Project Leader.
- Clear retention and secure storage of critical data; define location and access controls; ensure integrity against unauthorised modification.

## 10. Field-based research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges/emissions to minimise pollution.
- All provisions of JCoPR apply to field-based work.

## Annex – Examples of documentary evidence
- Practical evidence across areas, including:
  - Organisation structure and personnel lists; sub-contractor agreements.
  - Competence records: CVs, training records, awareness of JCoPR obligations.
  - Project planning: risk assessments, approved plans, milestone records, ethical approvals.
  - Quality control: internal audit records, publication authorisation procedures.
  - Health & safety: training/compliance documentation, safety plans.
  - Handling of samples: standardized tracking procedures, procedures for handling/storage.
  - Facilities & equipment: maintenance/calibration records; SOPs; contingency measures.
  - Documentation & methods: version-controlled procedures; validated SOPs.
  - Research records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed digital data; archiving procedures.
  - Field-based research: documented risk assessments.
