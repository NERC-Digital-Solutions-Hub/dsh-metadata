# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

- A joint framework setting expectations for the conduct and management of research funded by UK government and devolved bodies.
- Aims to ensure fitness for purpose by balancing quality of process (QP) and quality of science (QS), with emphasis on competent, well-trained researchers and rigorous, auditable procedures.

## Background and Scope

- Originated from representatives of BBSRC, Defra, FSA, and NERC; later endorsed by NI, Scottish, and Welsh Governments, and other bodies (APHA, Fera, FC, MMO, NE, VMD).
- Launched May 2003; effective June 1, 2004; subject to joint audit programmes (UKAS) starting 2006 to verify compliance in Defra/FSA-funded projects.
- Applies to all research funded by the listed bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations) and to BBSRC/NERC-funded work in their own institutes; intent is broad but prioritizes fitness for purpose.

## Principles Behind the Code

- Contractors must demonstrate commitment to:
  - Quality of the research process (QP)
  - Quality of the science (QS)
- QS covers project aims, approaches, and generation of new knowledge.
- QP underpins appropriate, rigorous, repeatable, and auditable research processes.
- The overarching principle is fitness for purpose; researchers should be competent and adequately trained.

## Compliance and Monitoring

- Contractors indicate acceptance of the Code when submitting proposals; may discuss clauses with funding bodies; discussions and risk assessments become part of funding terms.
- Contractors must ensure all subcontractors adhere to JCoPR provisions.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, Institute Director must annually confirm acceptance.
- Monitoring aims to ensure existence and application of policies and processes; organisations are encouraged to use formal, externally audited quality systems (third-party audits) against internationally recognized standards.
- Funding Bodies reserve the right to request evidence or conduct independent audits of a contractor’s research system (underpinning the UKAS programme).

## Specific Requirements

1. Responsibilities
   - Contractor organisation owns overall research quality; managers/supervisors promote good scientific practice; PI/Project Leader accountable for all work and subcontractors; clear responsibilities for all staff.

2. Competence
   - All personnel must be competent; training overseen to prevent compromising results; contractors must provide evidence of capability and training records.

3. Project Planning
   - Risk assessment to identify key success factors; clear written project plan addressing design, statistics, etc.; plans agreed with funding body; regular timetable reviews; significant amendments pre-approved.

4. Quality Control
   - Planned processes to assure research quality; formal fit-for-purpose reviews; outputs authorized by funding body; post-publication errors require corrective action; continual improvement.

5. Health and Safety
   - Full compliance with applicable health and safety regulations.

6. Handling of Samples and Materials
   - Clear, durable labeling; agreed storage and disposal procedures; tracking of samples through analysis; storage conditions monitored if critical.

7. Facilities and Equipment
   - Safe working environment; regular maintenance of facilities/equipment; appropriate equipment with calibration; contingency plans; SOPs for critical equipment.

8. Documentation of Procedures and Methods
   - Document all procedures and methods; audit trails, document/version control; validation of methods as fit for purpose; traceable development history.

9. Research / Work Records
   - High-quality, retrievable records enabling replication; regular reviews by Project Leader; secure, traceable storage of records for agreed retention period.

10. Field-based Research
   - Compliance with environmental legislation; risk management for discharges/emissions; JCoPR provisions apply to fieldwork as applicable.
