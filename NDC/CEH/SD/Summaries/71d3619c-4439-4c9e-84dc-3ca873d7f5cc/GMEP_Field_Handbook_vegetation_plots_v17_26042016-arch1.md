# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME VEGETATION AND SOIL FIELD HANDBOOK

- Purpose and context
  - Aims to quantify landscape quality changes in Welsh habitats due to the Glastir scheme.
  - Provides repeatable, fixed-point vegetation and soil data across 1 km squares to assess habitat change, scheme uptake, and landscape features.
  - Includes standardized landscape photography for time-series validation and landscape character assessment.

- Data capture framework
  - Digital data tools: Vegplots forms-based data entry; ArcMap GIS integration (VegPlotsWelsh.mxd); plot photos stored in a structured folder system; sketch maps accompany plots to aid relocation.
  - Plot relocation and repeat surveying: emphasis on precise relocation of plots across years; use of GPS (Trimble) plus tablet GPS; photos and sketch maps support re-finding plots; procedures for “Found,” “Not Found,” “New Plot,” or “Not Appropriate.”
  - Nest-based sampling: plots employ nested components (e.g., X, Y, U, B, A, M, H, D, S/W, P plots) with nest schemes (e.g., Nest 0–5 for X; Nest 0–5 for P; central 4 m2 in A plots; etc.) to structure species recording and cover estimation.
  - Species data: listing and selecting species via tablet with separate groups (Common species; Grasses; Sedges/Rushes; Ferns; Forbs/Woody; Mosses/Lichens); estimated % cover in 5% bands; avoidance of double-counting overlapping canopies; allowance for unidentified taxa with later identification.
  - Vegetation and soil components: includes vascular plants (and a restricted bryophyte/lichen set), bryophyte species lists where possible, and targeted invasive species checklists for D plots; emphasis on recording, not uprooting, to preserve comparability over time.

- Plot types and objectives (location, size, and targeting)
  - X Plots (X1–X5): random 4 m2 plots (woodland priority plots may use full X plot of 200 m2 diagonally oriented) for broad habitat sampling; used to project other plot types; precise GPS at south corner; in woodland, full nest progression from nest 0 outward to nest 5.
  - Y Plots (Y1–Y5): 2x2 m plots in enclosed habitats and Priority Habitats to sample enclosed habitats and PH not covered by other plots.
  - U Plots (U1–U10): 2x2 m plots in unenclosed broad habitats; sampling proportionate to unenclosed habitat area and option status (in/out of Glastir options).
  - B Plots (B1–B5): Boundary plots 10x1 m located at field boundaries adjacent to X plots.
  - A Plots (A1–A5): Arable field margin plots 100x1 m along field margins; placed adjacently to B plots; sampling central 4x1 m for species and nest 0.
  - M Plots (M1–Mx): Margin plots (2x2 m) associated with arable margins; up to 3 per field depending on margin presence and option location.
  - H Plots (H1–H2): Hedgerow plots 10x1 m on hedgerows; sampling hedgerows with consideration of hedgerow shape and in-/out-of-option placement.
  - D Plots (D1–D10): Hedgerow diversity plots 30x1 m along WLF with natural or cultivated hedgerows; detailed woody composition and structural metrics; central alignment with H plots when feasible.
  - S/W Plots (S1–S2, W1–W3): Streamside plots 10x1 m along watercourses; S plots sample primary watercourses; W plots sample additional watercourse types; in-option sampling prioritized when possible.
  - P Plots (P1–P5): Perpendicular plots upslope from S/W plots to capture riparian buffer effects; subdivided into nests (0–5) to describe vegetation zones upslope; designed to be highly species-rich due to cross-habitat traversal.
  - R/V and other legacy plot types (Roadside R plots, Verge V plots): described for historical comparability, not primary GMEP sampling.

- Sampling design and option allocation
  - Plot Calculator and option mapping: plots allocated to six option groups defined by habitat and linear feature types; requires square habitat map (uniquely identifying unenclosed vs enclosed habitats and the proportion in-option vs out-of-option).
  - Proportional sampling: numbers of X, U, Y, B, A, M, H, D, S/W, P plots allocated based on plot-able land area and measured lengths of linear features, using GIS overlays and aerial/photo data.
  - Handling of land status: if in-option length is insufficient, sampling emphasis adjusts to ensure representative coverage without oversampling any single feature type.
  - ArcMap and VegPlots integration: ArcMap used for plot geometry; VegPlots for data capture; GPS stamping links field data to precise locations.

- Data quality, QA, and workflow
  - Data validation: Vegplots validates header and selected species data; red-highlighted missing fields prompt validation before exiting a plot.
  - Documentation and traceability: plotting maps, sketch maps, and photographs accompany data entries; GPS logs maintained for repeat relocations.
  - Data stewardship: sources logged; datasets prepared for discoverability (metadata and portal uploads).
  - Handling of difficult identifications: practice of combining certain taxa into aggregated taxa to maintain consistency.
  - Repeats and 2016 updates: 2016 changes include extra information on repeat Countryside Survey squares; extra notes on X plot handling in mosaics and land-cover changes; additional notes on plot allocation in option groups.

- Landscape photography protocol
  - Purpose: fixed-point landscape photography to quantify landscape openness, enclosure, texture, and visibility from public rights of way; four X plot locations per square used to standardize imagery.
  - Protocol: standardized camera angles (N, E, S, W) from southern corner posts; orientation confirmed with compass; optional 360-degree panoramas; strict focus and lighting checks; landscape marker color-coding for direction; photos linked to plot and square metadata.

- Field procedures and equipment
  - Equipment: Vegplots tablets; GPS logging tools; landscape photography gear; soil sampling gear (plastic cores, gouge auger, tins); cold box for sample storage; field envelopes and labelling system.
  - Soil sampling (X plots): three plastic cores (chemistry, physics, fauna) laid out at 15 cm from the south corner of the 2 m square; a fauna core (short white, 8 cm) placed 15 cm further from the center; five Gouge auger samples collected for biology in a screw-lid tin; samples stored and dispatched to appropriate labs (Bangor for chemistry, physics; Lancaster for fauna).
  - Sample handling: strict cold-chain storage; post on designated days; packing instructions to ensure leak-proof transport.

- Documentation and reference materials
  - Detailed protocols for plot layout, nesting, and coordinates; species lists; bryophyte lists; invasive species checklists; plot-specific headers and data-entry fields.
  - Additional notes and troubleshooting guidance on software updates, GPS integration, and field logistics.
  - The handbook includes a series of appendices and notes on plot relocation, updating existing plots, and random-number-generation for sampling decisions.

- Analyst-facing implications and potential data uses
  - The GMEP dataset enables correlations between Glastir option uptake (in/out of option) and habitat/landscape change over time.
  - The standardized, nested plot structure supports fine-grained time-series analyses by habitat type, landscape location, and management option category.
  - Spatially explicit data (ArcMap VegPlots, GPS stamps, sketch maps) facilitate spatial analytics, habitat mapping, and change detection at 1 km-square and plot scales.
  - The protocol emphasizes data provenance, repeatability, and metadata completeness to support robust comparisons across survey years.

- Important cautions and caveats for analysts
  - 2014–2016 protocol changes: X plots simplified in 2014 (4 m2; full X plots reinstated in woodland/priority habitats in some cases); 2016 regime involves RHS/ Countryside Survey squares with additional repeat considerations.
  - Practical field challenges: relocation accuracy, access permissions, and varying land-use can affect plot placement and replication; decisions may require expert judgment when exact relocation is uncertain.
  The dataset is designed to balance rigorous sampling with field feasibility, and analysts should be aware of these practicalities when modeling long-term change.
