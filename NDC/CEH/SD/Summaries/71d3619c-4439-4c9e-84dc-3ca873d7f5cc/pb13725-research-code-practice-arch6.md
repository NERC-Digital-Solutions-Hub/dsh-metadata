# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Background
- A framework to ensure fitness of purpose and high standards in research funded by multiple UK bodies.
- Applies to most types of research and emphasizes quality of process (QP) and quality of science (QS).
- Overarching aim: best scientific practice from the start; senior leadership responsibility for compliance.
- Implemented through approvals, audits (including joint Defra/FSA and UKAS experiences), and ongoing revision.

Data Support relevance:
- Establishes expectations for data integrity, traceability, and auditability across funded research.
- Supports formal QA/audit processes and documentation requirements for data handling.

## Principles behind the Code
- QP: rigor, repeatability, auditability of how data and results are gathered and interpreted.
- QS: aims, approaches, and extraction of new knowledge from scientific work.
- Fitness for purpose as the core criterion; researchers must be competent and adequately trained.
- Contractors must demonstrate commitment to quality from the outset; top-level governance matters.

Data Support relevance:
- Encourages robust data practices, including proper data collection design, methods, and analysis aligned with project aims.
- Highlights need for competent personnel and documented data procedures.

## Compliance with the Code
- Contractors indicate acceptance when submitting research proposals; terms may include discussions on clauses or risks.
- Contractors (and subcontractors) must adhere to the JCoPR provisions.
- For some funders, annual acceptance by Institute Director is required.
- Risk assessment may be requested; outputs may be restricted or governed by funding bodies.

Data Support relevance:
- Compliance framing affects data management plans, access controls, and data sharing expectations.
- Contracts may require evidence of data handling alignment with the Code.

## Monitoring of compliance with the Code
- Organisations should have formal, auditable systems ensuring compliance.
- Third-party audits against appropriate international standards may be used to assure quality.
- Funding bodies may request evidence or audit funded projects’ systems.

Data Support relevance:
- Data management systems and records are often subject to formal audits; need for maintained data integrity documentation.

## 1. Responsibilities
- Contractor organisations own overall research quality and policy compliance.
- Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice and skills development.
- The Principal Investigator/Project Leader is accountable for all project work, including subcontractors; clear responsibilities for all staff and students.

Data Support relevance:
- Clear data ownership, responsibilities for data creation, cleaning, and sharing, and accountability for data quality.

## 2. Competence
- All personnel must be competent for their tasks; training must be supervised to protect result quality.
- Documented evidence of capability and training is required.

Data Support relevance:
- Training records and competency evidence for data handling, analysis methods, and data security practices.

## 3. Project planning
- Conduct risk assessments to identify factors affecting success.
- Produce a clear, written project plan addressing design, statistics, and other key factors.
- Plans should be agreed with the Funding Body; align with ethical approvals or licences as needed.
- Schedule regular plan reviews; significant changes require pre-approval.

Data Support relevance:
- Data management plan should be part of the project plan; specify data sources, quality checks, analysis methods, and versioning.
- Regularly review data workflows and update as project evolves.

## 4. Quality Control
- Implement planned quality assurance processes; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews at appropriate frequency.
- Output authorisation by the Funding Body and senior approvals; post-publication errors must be reported and corrected promptly.
- Seek continual improvement through regular process reviews.

Data Support relevance:
- Data quality controls, audit trails, version control, and validation of data and analysis pipelines.
- Clear procedures for data corrections and reproducibility.

## 5. Health and Safety
- All research must comply with relevant health and safety regulations.

Data Support relevance:
- Safe handling of data environments and any physical materials used in data collection (e.g., lab instruments, fieldwork data collection).

## 6. Handling of samples and materials
- Clear labeling, tracking, and durable retention of samples/materials.
- Storage conditions specified and monitored; tracking through analysis to disposal.

Data Support relevance:
- Data provenance and linking of samples to data records; tracking data sources and material provenance.

## 7. Facilities and equipment
- Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
- Contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

Data Support relevance:
- Calibration and validation of data acquisition equipment; SOPs for data capture devices; backup systems.

## 8. Documentation of procedures and methods
- All procedures and methods must be documented with traceable audit trails, version control, and links between primary data and processed information.
- Validate methods as fit for purpose; trace modifications through development.

Data Support relevance:
- Central to data governance: documented data collection, processing, analysis methods; validation of statistical procedures; data processing pipelines.

## 9. Research / work records
- records must be detailed enough to reproduce work; project leader ensures record validity.
- Locate and securely store critical data and records for an agreed retention period.

Data Support relevance:
- Emphasizes data repositories, secure storage, data integrity, and traceability of data lineage.

## 10. Field-based research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution risk.
- Apply all JCoPR provisions to field activities.

Data Support relevance:
- Documentation of field data collection protocols, ethical approvals, and field safety/data collection practices.
