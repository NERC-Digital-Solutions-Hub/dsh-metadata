# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- Provides a framework for proper conduct of funded research, balancing quality of the research process (QP) with the quality of the science (QS).
- Emphasises fitness-for-purpose, diligent work by competent, trained researchers.
- Applies to research funded by UK bodies (Defra, FSA, NE, VMD, APHA, MMO, Fera, FC, Devolved Administrations) and to work conducted within BBSRC/NERC institutes.
- Compliance is expected from contractors and subcontractors; may involve risk assessments and formal audits; annual acceptance may be required for some funders.

## Relevance to Data Stewards
- Aligns with data governance by stressing documented processes, audit trails, versioning, data integrity, and traceability from primary data to processed outputs.
- Encourages metadata, standard procedures, and formal documentation that support dataset usability, discovery, and reuse.
- Supports responsible data handling across planning, execution, and reporting phases, including data-related risks and compliance.

## Compliance and Monitoring
- Contractors must acknowledge the Code when submitting proposals; discussions on inapplicable clauses may occur.
- Project plans, risk assessments, and ethical/licensing considerations should be aligned with funding bodies.
- Contractors are responsible for subcontractor adherence; organisations may be audited by third parties (e.g., UKAS) to verify systems meet standards.

## Key Requirements (Section Highlights)

- Responsibilities
  - The contractor organisation is accountable for overall research quality.
  - Managers, group leaders, and supervisors foster good scientific practice.
  - Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all project work, including subcontractors.

- Competence
  - All personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training and supervision are essential.
  - Documented evidence of capability and training must be maintained.

- Project Planning
  - Conduct risk assessments to identify factors affecting success and objectives.
  - Maintain a clear written project plan with agreed milestones; coordinate with Funding Body.
  - Regularly review plans; significant amendments require pre-approval.

- Quality Control
  - Establish planned, fit-for-purpose quality assurance processes.
  - Output authorisation as agreed with the Funding Body; post-publication errors must be addressed with the Funding Body.
  - Continuous improvement through regular review of processes.

- Health and Safety
  - Full compliance with applicable health and safety regulations.

- Handling of Samples and Materials
  - Clear, durable labeling and tracking; specify storage, retention periods, and disposal routes.
  - Trace samples through analysis stages; document storage conditions and critical factors.

- Facilities and Equipment
  - Safe, appropriate working environment; regular maintenance and calibration of equipment.
  - Contingency plans for disruptions; SOPs for critical equipment.

- Documentation of Procedures and Methods
  - All procedures must be documented with clear audit trails, version control, and traceability to primary data.
  - Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose; changes must be traceable.

- Research / Work Records
  - Records must be detailed enough to replicate work; regular reviews by Project Leader.
  - Secure retention and clear location of critical data and records.

- Field-Based Research
  - Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions; apply JCoPR provisions to field activities.

## Annex: Documentary Evidence (Examples)
- Responsibilities: organisation chart, personnel lists, sub-contractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- Personnel Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of Code provisions.
- Project Planning: risk assessments, project timetable reviews, approved plans, statistical validation, sampling procedures, ethical approvals.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits and corrective actions, publication policies.
- Health & Safety: training records, health and safety plans, risk controls for hazardous work.
- Handling of Samples & Materials: standardized labelling/tracking, handling procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration logs, SOPs for critical equipment, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of Procedures & Methods: version-controlled documentation, validated SOPs.
- Research/Work Records: counter-signed lab notebooks or indexed digital files, archiving procedures.
- Field-Based Research: risk assessments for fieldwork.

## Practical Takeaways for Data Stewards
- Ensure datasets produced within funded projects have robust documentation, including metadata, provenance, and version history aligned with the Code’s emphasis on audit trails.
- Advocate for explicit data management plans, clear roles, and responsibilities, and compliance checks that mirror the Code’s requirements for competence, planning, and quality control.
- Promote secure, well-maintained data records and storage solutions, with defined retention periods and access controls in line with the documented evidence expectations (e.g., data and method validation, recordkeeping, and handling procedures).
- Prepare for potential audits by maintaining comprehensive documentary evidence (structure, personnel, training, risk assessments, SOPs, and data handling logs) as outlined in the Annex.
- Embed field- and lab-based data integrity practices, ensuring that data linked to samples, experiments, and analyses are traceable from primary data to processed outputs.
