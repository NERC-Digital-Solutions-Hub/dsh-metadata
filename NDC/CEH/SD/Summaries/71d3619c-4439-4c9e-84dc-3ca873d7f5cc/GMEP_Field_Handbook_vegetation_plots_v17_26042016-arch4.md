# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME VEGETATION AND SOIL FIELD HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized field protocol to monitor vegetation and soil across Glastir sites.
  - Supports a repeatable, fixed-point time series to quantify landscape changes and policy impacts.
  - Data underpin analysis of Glastir option uptake on habitat types and linear features.

- Data capture systems and infrastructure
  - Forms-based data capture using VegPlots on tablets; ArcMap integration via VegPlotsWelsh.mxd; data stored in VegPlots.mdb.
  - Plot photos stored on tablets (New_Photos folder) and linked to plot records; paper plot maps accompany digital records.
  - GPS stamping with differential GPS (Trimble) prioritized for precise re-finding; internal tablet GPS as fallback.
  - Metadata and data provenance embedded in the workflow (plot type, location, nest, cover estimates, etc.).
  - Landscape photography protocol to document landscape context and support spatial analyses.

- Plot location, types, and data model
  - 1 km square framework with five X plots per square (random points) for initial plotting; Countryside Survey squares revisited in 2016 to extend a time series.
  - Plot types (each with specific size, location rules, and data collected): X, Y, U, B, A, M, H, D, S/W, P.
  - Nesting structure per plot type (e.g., nests 0–5 for X, Y; varied nesting for other plot types) to organize species data and habitat sampling.
  - Plot location and relocation protocols emphasize precise sketch maps, GPS points, and photographic evidence to enable repeatability.

- Data entry, validation, and quality control
  - VegPlots recording screen includes: Header data, Listed Species, Selected Species, and nesting details; live validation and error highlighting.
  - Validation step required before closing a plot entry; missing fields flagged; ability to delete erroneous rows.
  - Emphasis on accurate percentage cover (5% categories) and avoiding double counting; note on incomplete identifications (Unidentified species) with downstream identification planned.
  - Special handling for long-term trends, invasive species (do not uproot), and taxonomic combinations when identifications are uncertain.

- Plot relocation, repeat recording, and data lineage
  - Procedures for “Plot Recorded” statuses: Found, Not Found, New Plot (Replacement), New Plot (New feature), Not Appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous.
  - Use of prior plots/maps/photos to relocate; when relocation uncertainty is high, judgments determine whether a plot is a valid repeat.
  - For Countryside Survey repeats, metal plates or stakes mark previous plots; where plates are unrecoverable, relocation guided by sketch maps and photos.
  - Documentation of changes to plots, maps (Edited/Redrawn), and GPS snapping to improve repeat accuracy.

- Plot photos, sketch maps, and landscape documentation
  - Plot photos (2–3 per plot) to aid relocation and illustrate vegetation change; direction and features documented on sketch maps.
  - Sketch maps drawn with measured references, including GPS reference points and north arrow; multiple plots can share maps if co-located.
  - Landscape photography protocol standardized to capture four cardinal directions from X-plot centers; optional 360-degree panoramas.

- Plot types: overview of data implications
  - X plots: 4 m² (2x2 m) in most habitats; woodland X plots are larger (200 m²) with nested structure; arable adaptations described.
  - Y plots: 2x2 m; sample enclosed habitats and Priority Habitats not covered by other plots.
  - U plots: 2x2 m; sample unenclosed broad habitats; allocation based on habitat proportion and Glastir options.
  - B plots: boundary plots (10x1 m) along field boundaries; core data collected; GPS positioning relative to X plots.
  - A plots: arable field margins (100x1 m); margins sampled where present; nests provide focused sampling zones.
  - M plots: margins in arable fields (2x2 m); coupled to A plots when margins exist.
  - H plots: hedgerows (10x1 m); sample along hedges with considerations for in-option vs out-of-option sampling and D plots.
  - D plots: hedgerow diversity (30x1 m); extensive metadata on tree/shrub structure, gaps, historic management, and invasive species presence.
  - S/W plots: streamside (10x1 m) along watercourses; S plots sample main watercourses, W plots sample additional watercourses; option-based allocation to in- or out-of-option streams.
  - P plots: perpendicular plots (up to 5 per square); sampled upslope from S/W plots to capture transition zones; nesting aids data collection across habitat types along slope.

- Data stewardship, standards, and governance
  - Data are collected to support cross-partner data sharing, with a strong emphasis on data quality, traceability, and repeatability.
  - Taxonomic references and grouped taxa (combinations) are specified to maintain consistency in difficult identifications.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are limited to predefined lists to ensure comparability across surveys.
  - Documentation and guidance for data handling, storage, and transfer are integrated (e.g., soil and plant samples shipped to designated laboratories and labs with chain-of-custody procedures).

- Challenges and considerations for data leaders
  - Data fragmentation and the need for robust standards across multiple plot types, habitats, and option groups.
  - Ensuring data discoverability, discoverable metadata, and updates across years and partner networks.
  - Managing access, privacy, and governance considerations in a sector with varied permissions and land access constraints.
  - Coordinating GIS layers, plot calculators, and field workflows to minimize bias and maximize comparability across time.

- Practical takeaway for data strategy
  - The handbook demonstrates a comprehensive, protocol-driven approach to building a long-term, multi-partner ecological time series.
  - It emphasizes data lineage, standardized data capture, and integration with GIS and metadata to enable robust analysis of policy interventions (Glastir options) on habitat quality and landscape structure.
  - It highlights the importance of repeatability, calibration across survey years, and clear data governance to support data-driven decision-making and policy assessment.
