# GLASTIR MONITORING & EVALUATION PROGRAMME VEGETATION AND SOIL FIELD HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Field protocol for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Programme (GMEP) to quantify environmental condition and changes in the Welsh countryside.
  - Enables tying vegetation and soil data to Glastir options, with a fixed, repeatable time-series across 1 km squares.
  - Supports analysis of habitat change by habitat type, landscape location, and Glastir participation; aims to extend Countryside Survey time series.

- Data collection framework and outputs
  - Standardised data capture designed for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Outputs include plot-level data, habitat classifications, species lists and cover, and landscape photographs for repeatable refinding and trend assessment.
  - Datasets managed through VegPlots (forms-based tablet app) and ArcMap VegPlotsWelsh.mxd; data stored/uploaded to project portals for accessibility.

- Plot identification, locations and sampling design
  - Plots located and recorded to enable precise future refinding; combination of GPS, sketch maps, and photos ensures repeatability.
  - Areal and linear plots cover diverse habitat types and Glastir option groups; plots allocated to option groups using the Plot Calculator.
  - Plot types described and projected across square areas to achieve proportional sampling relative to plot-able land and Glastir option uptake.

- Plot types and how they are used
  - X plots (X1–X5): main random points; 4 m² in most habitats, 200 m² in woodland; used to project other plot types.
  - Y plots (Y1–Y5): 4 m²; target enclosed habitats and Priority Habitats not well represented by other plots.
  - U plots (U1–U10): 4 m² (2 m × 2 m); sample unenclosed Broad Habitats; allocation based on proportion of unenclosed habitat and Glastir option uptake.
  - Linear plots: B (Boundary, 10 m × 1 m), A (Arable field margin, 100 m × 1 m), M (Margin, 2 m × 2 m), H (Hedgerow, 10 m × 1 m), D (Hedgerow diversity, 30 m × 1 m), S/W (Streamside, 10 m × 1 m; includes S and W subtypes), P (Perpendicular plots, up to 5; 10 m × 1 m), R/V (Roadside verge and related plots; largely tied to historical contexts and in CS squares).
  - P plots: perpendicular to S/W plots; nested divisions (up to 6 nests) to capture vegetation diversity along upslope gradients; linked to W plots when applicable.
  - The Plot Calculator: central tool to determine the number and placement of plots in and out of option land; uses square-level habitat maps and linear feature lengths, ensuring proportional, unbiased sampling.

- Locating and laying out plots
  - X plots: located near five random points per square; if crossing features, position to keep linear features clear; B plots located at the X plot boundaries.
  - Y plots: allocated after habitat mapping; placed randomly within enclosed habitats or near Priority Habitats as representative patches.
  - U plots: number determined by unenclosed habitat proportion; placed randomly within each unenclosed habitat type, with in-option/out-of-option allocation guided by the Plot Calculator.
  - Linear plots (B, H, D, S/W, P, A, M): placed to avoid overlap and to sample in-option features; minimum separation rules (e.g., 10 m between plots on same feature); specific placement rules described for hedgerows, boundaries, margins, and streams.
  - Special cases for RHS (River Habitat Survey) sites and in-stream sampling coordination with separate river teams; clear communication of RHS reach location and sampling points is required.

- Data collection and field procedures
  - VegPlots data capture: hierarchical data entry with headers (plot metadata), listed species (grouped lists), and Selected Species with nest-based recording and % cover in 5% bands.
  - Plot relocation and description: includes slope, aspect, shading, photos, plot map status, and administrative data (surveyor initials, plot completeness, validation status).
  - Species recording: nested plots allow partial re-sampling within larger plots; total cover estimates entered for nested quadrats; trees/shrubs overlapping plots counted as present with appropriate cover; avoid double counting.
  - Bryophytes and Lichens: restricted to listed mosses and taxa per VegPlots lists; emphasis on vascular plants though, with priority on broadleaf/grass taxa and key bryophyte groups.
  - Invasive species: specific presence/cover fields maintained for key invasive species within D plots.

- Plot photographs and landscape monitoring
  - Plot photos taken to aid relocation and to illustrate vegetation trends; typical practice includes 2–3 photos per plot, plus a landscape photography protocol to assess enclosure, openness, and landscape texture over time.
  - Landscape photography follows a standardized sequence around X-plot centers, with direction markers and compass orientation to enable repeatable captures; 360-degree panoramas attempted if possible.

- Relocation, repeat surveys and data continuity
  - 2016 Countryside Survey squares revisited; emphasis on extending globally unique time series while re-finding previous plots.
  - Procedures for locating, updating, or replacing plots that cannot be found; “Found,” “Not Found,” “New Plot (Replacement),” or “New Plot (New feature/Land cover)” statuses used to document changes.
  - Guidance for updating or redrawing plot maps, snapping to newly recorded GPS locations, and ensuring repeatability of future surveys.

- Equipment, soil sampling and specimen handling
  - Field equipment includes: electric cool box, soil cores, gouge auger, screw-top tins for DNA samples, labeled bags, and corresponding envelopes for X-plot cores and fauna samples.
  - Soil sampling plan for X plots: three cores (C, P, F) and one biology tin sample collected at specified distances from the south corner of the 2 m square; detailed handling and labeling procedures to preserve sample integrity.
  - Storage and dispatch: cores refrigerated and mailed with appropriate containment; timing guidance to ensure sample integrity (avoid Thursdays/Fridays and weekends).

- Data management, QA and accessibility
  - Emphasis on standardised data formats, QA checks, and timely data uploads to central portals; emphasis on transparency and traceability of plot locations, nest allocations, and species identifications.
  - Documentation and training notes included to support consistent data capture across survey teams; clarifications for GPS troubleshooting, data entry validation, and landscape photography protocols.

- End notes and governance
  - The handbook includes extensive notes on plot calculation methods (Additional Note 4), targeted allocation of plots to Glastir option groups, and cross-referencing with Countryside Survey methodologies.
  - RHS coordination guidance and important caveats about 2016 in-stream surveys being conducted separately.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation
  - Provides a comprehensive, repeatable, data-rich framework for tracking habitat change and Glastir option impacts over time.
  - Aligns standardized field protocols with GIS-based allocation and a central data capture system, enabling robust assessment of policy effects and landscape change.
  - Emphasizes data value through repeatable plots, accessible underlying data, and integration with landscape photography as corroborating evidence.
