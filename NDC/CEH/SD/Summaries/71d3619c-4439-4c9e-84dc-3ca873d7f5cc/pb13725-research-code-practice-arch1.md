# Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCoPR)

## Overview
- A framework for proper conduct of funded research across UK bodies (e.g., Defra, FSA, NERC, BBSRC, etc.).
- Focuses on quality of the research process (QP) and quality of the science (QS).
- Emphasises “fitness for purpose,” competence, and best scientific practice from project inception.
- Applies to all types of research funded by the participating bodies; launched in 2003, effective 2004.

## Compliance and Monitoring
- Contractors must indicate acceptance of the Code during funding proposals; discussions on inapplicable clauses may occur and become part of Terms and Conditions.
- A formal risk assessment may be required; subcontractors must comply.
- For BBSRC/NERC-funded work, annual acceptance by the Institute Director.
- Monitoring may involve formal systems audited by third parties; potential independent audits of contractor research systems (e.g., UKAS).

## Core Requirements

### 1) Responsibilities
- The contractor is responsible for overall research quality and compliance with policies.
- Managers and supervisors foster good scientific practice; clearly defined roles for all staff, including subcontractors.
- Principal Investigator/Project Leader oversees all work and subcontractors.

### 2) Competence
- Personnel must be competent to perform required tasks; training and supervision ensure quality.
- Documented evidence of capability; training records show awareness of JCoPR obligations.

### 3) Project Planning
- Conduct risk assessment for factors affecting success.
- Provide a clear, written project plan including design, statistics, ethical/licence considerations; plan agreed with Funding Body.
- Schedule regular reviews; significant amendments require pre-approval.

### 4) Quality Control
- Implement planned processes to assure research quality; conduct fit-for-purpose reviews.
- Outputs authorized as agreed with Funding Body; post-publication errors must be reported and corrected.
- Continuous improvement through periodic reviews of processes.

### 5) Health and Safety
- Compliance with relevant health and safety regulations is mandatory.

### 6) Handling of Samples and Materials
- Clear, durable labeling; retention periods agreed with Funding Body.
- Storage/handling plans aligned with project plan; track samples through analysis; defined disposal routes.

### 7) Facilities and Equipment
- Safe working environment; routine maintenance of facilities/equipment.
- Equipment calibrated appropriately; contingency plans for disruptions; standard operating procedures for critical equipment.

### 8) Documentation of Procedures and Methods
- All procedures and methods documented; clear audit trails with version control.
- Validation of methods as fit-for-purpose; traceable development and modifications.

### 9) Research / Work Records
- Detailed records to enable replication; regular reviews by Project Leader.
- Clear location and secure retention of records for an agreed period.

### 10) Field-based Research
- Compliance with environmental legislation; manage discharges and emissions to minimize pollution.
- All JCoPR provisions apply to field-based work.

## Annex — Examples of Documentary Evidence
- Responsibilities: organogram, personnel lists, subcontractor agreements, roles/responsibilities.
- Personnel Competence: CVs, up-to-date training records, awareness of JCoPR obligations.
- Project Planning: risk assessments, timetable reviews, approved project plan, statistical validation, sampling procedures, ethical approvals/licences.
- Quality Control: internal fit-for-purpose reviews, audits, corrective actions, publication policy.
- Health & Safety: training/compliance documentation, safety plans, specific measures for hazardous substances.
- Handling of Samples & Materials: standardized labeling/tracking, procedures, storage logs.
- Facilities & Equipment: maintenance/calibration records, SOPs, emergency procedures.
- Documentation of Procedures & Methods: robust document/version control, validated SOPs.
- Research/Work Records: counter-signed notebooks or indexed data files, archiving procedures.
- Field-based Research: documented risk assessments and mitigation steps.

## Implications for Analysts Answering Questions with Data
- Ensures data provenance, traceability, and auditability through rigorous documentation, version control, and retention policies.
- Encourages formal risk assessment and project planning to contextualize data analyses and model results.
- Requires clear data management plans, including standards for labeling, storage, and disposal of samples/materials used in studies.
- Promotes independent validation, quality control reviews, and transparent reporting of methods and outputs.
- Supports third-party auditing and verification of data quality and methodological rigour.
