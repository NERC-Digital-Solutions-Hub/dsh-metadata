# Methods for site descriptions, CO 2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko

- Overview
  - Describes a girdling experiment at the forest-tundra ecotone near Abisko, Sweden, measuring soil CO2 efflux, root ingrowth, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) hyphal production.
  - Data are used in Parker et al. (2020) and stored in two CSV data files: Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv and Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv.

- Site context and experimental design
  - Location: 3–4 km south of Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°18 N, 18°49 E, ~600 m a.s.l.).
  - Ecosystem: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum) across a 0.88 km2 area.
  - Soils: well-drained spodosols over glacial till; no permafrost.
  - Understorey: diverse ericaceous shrubs and mosses; willow understory differs (forbs and mosses).
  - Plot design: 5 willow plots (W) and 6 mountain birch plots (B), each split into paired sub-plots (B1-6; W1-5). Birches are planted in larger plots (radius ~10 m) with 3–4 trees per central 3 m radius; willows in smaller plots (radius ~2 m) with high stem density.
  - Pairing criteria: pairs chosen to match tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, and understorey composition; outer perimeters separated by 10–20 m; pairs separated by 300–1100 m (birch) or 300–900 m (willow).
  - Edge treatment: willow plots required trenching and plastic root barriers due to dense canopy; birch plots did not require trenching.

- Treatments and plot setup
  - Pre-treatment: soil CO2 efflux measured twice in June 2017 to establish baseline; no significant pre-girdling differences between sub-plots (paired t-tests).
  - Girdling: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; treated plots designated G (girdled) and C (control).
  - Girdling specifics:
    - Birch: all stems >1 cm diameter girdled within 10 m radius; 4–8 cm of bark removed around each stem down to the xylem, ~30 cm above ground to sever phloem connection.
    - Willow: every willow stem girdled ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouting shoots at girdle line removed as needed.
  - Experimental buffering: central measurement area within each plot shielded from adjacent roots via collars; edge effects minimized by plot design.

- CO2 efflux measurement methods
  - Collars: three 5 cm tall, 15 cm inner-diameter PVC collars installed within 1 m of one central tree per birch plot and within central 1 m of willow plots; sealed with plumber’s putty to prevent soil disturbance.
  - Measurement timing: after snow-melt, on 9–12 June 2017 (pre-girdling) and multiple dates post-girdling (birch 10 dates in 2017; willow 9 dates in 2017; 10 dates in 2018 for both).
  - Equipment and protocol: EGM-5 infrared gas analyzer with CPY-5 darkened chamber; CO2 efflux calculated from the linear rise in CO2 concentration over 90 seconds; measurements conducted 09:00–18:00 local time; plot and collar order randomized/alternated daily to minimize bias.
  - Replication: mean of three collars per plot used as the plot’s true replicate flux.

- Root and hyphae ingrowth assessments
  - Root ingrowth (below-ground root production):
    - In-growth bags: cylindroid fiberglass mesh (6 cm deep; 2.5 x 1.5 cm; mesh size 2 mm) filled with ericaceous peat.
    - Deployment: bags inserted vertically into top 6 cm of organic soil, 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar, within central central area of each plot.
    - Incubation: 96 days (2017) and 102 days (2018); retrieved with careful sampling.
    - Lab processing: roots washed and dried at 60 °C for 72 h; dry mass measured; carbon content analyzed with Flash Smart elemental analyzer.
  - Hyphal ingrowth (ectomycorrhizal fungi):
    - Sand-filled ingrowth bags: 5 x 5 cm nylon mesh, 37 μm, containing 18 g Lake Torneträsk sand (0.125–1 mm particles), autoclaved and dried.
    - Deployment: angled bags placed 30 cm from each CO2 collar, on the opposite side from root bags, under litter/moss layer.
    - Incubation: same dates as root bags.
    - Lab processing: sand extracted after retrieval, hyphae released by sonication, hyphae-containing solution dried and weighed for carbon content with Flash Smart analyzer.
    - Quality control: eight blank samples (not deployed) analyzed; blank values subtracted from field samples.

- Data products and quality control
  - Primary data files:
    - Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv (soil CO2 efflux data by plot, treatment, date).
    - Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv (root and ECM hyphal ingrowth data, including dry mass and carbon content).
  - Quality assurance:
    - Pre-treatment comparisons confirmed no significant initial differences between sub-plots.
    - Experimental design used paired sub-plots to control for variability.
    - Collar sealing method validated by CO2 concentration increase when chamber attached.
    - Data collection spread across dates to capture growing-season dynamics.
