# Methods for site descriptions, CO2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko.

## Overview
- Study investigating soil CO2 efflux, root ingrowth, and fungal (ectomycorrhizal) hyphal ingrowth at a subarctic treeline near Abisko Scientific Research Station, Sweden.
- Data focus includes CO2 efflux rates and biomass/Carbon content of roots and hyphae; linked to a girdling experiment.
- Data files referenced: Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv and Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv.

## Site selection and experimental design
- Location: forest-tundra ecotone ~3–4 km south of Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°18' N, 18°49' E), ~600 m above sea level.
- Ecosystem: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum).
- Study area: 0.88 km² with paired plots for girdling (Birch: B1–B6; Willow: W1–W5).
- Pre-treatment conditions: plots matched for tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, and understorey composition.
- Birch plots: circular central measurement area with a 10 m radius (avg 586 trees ha⁻¹).
- Willow plots: central radius 2 m with high stem density (5–6 stems m⁻²); largest plots with willow-canopy.
- Spatial layout: outer perimeters between sub-plots separated by 10–20 m (birch) or 2–16 m (willow); different inter-pair distances (300–1100 m birch; 300–900 m willow).
- Experimental setup: central 3 m radius within birch plots contains 3–4 trees; willow plots required trenching along perimeters and plastic sheet to depth 10–30 cm to prevent root ingress from adjacent plants; trenching not used for birch plots.
- Data collection readiness: three collars placed per plot to measure soil CO2 efflux; collars positioned to minimize edge effects.

## Plot layout and girdling treatments
- Girdling: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; care coded as 'G' vs 'C' for girdled/control.
- Birch girdling: all stems >1 cm diameter girdled within the 10 m radius plot; bark 4–8 cm wide girdled to xylem ~30 cm above soil, removing phloem connection.
- Willow girdling: every willow stem girdled ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouts removed if observed.
- Seasonal leaves: birch retained leaves into 2018; girdled willows failed to leaf in 2018.
- Treatment replication: design ensured balanced comparison between girdled and control sub-plots.

## CO2 efflux measurement protocol
- Pre-treatment baseline: CO2 efflux measured twice per plot in 2017 after snow-melt (9–12 June) but before girdling; paired T-tests confirmed no significant pre-girdling differences.
- Collar setup: three 5 cm tall, 15 cm inner-diameter PVC collars installed within 1 m of one central tree per birch plot (and within central 1 m of willow plots); collars sealed with plumber’s putty to prevent soil disturbance.
- Measurement schedule: CO2 efflux measured on 10 dates for birch plots and 9 dates for willow plots in 2017; 10 dates per plot during 2018 growing season.
- Instrumentation: EGM-5 infrared gas analyser with CPY-5 darkened chamber; flux calculated from linear increase in CO2 concentration over 90 seconds.
- Replicates: three collars per plot; plot replicate flux is the average of the three collars; sampling order randomized to minimize bias.
- Data alignment: all plots visited the same day; measurements occurred between 09:00–18:00.

## Growing season root production (ingrowth bags)
- In-growth bags: cylindroid fibre-glass mesh bags (6 cm deep; 2.5 × 1.5 cm; mesh size 2 mm).
- Substrate: ericaceous peat collected locally, dried, sieved (4 mm), with roots removed; bags filled to contact native soil and placed 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar.
- Deployment: 96 bags in 2017 (1 bag per central tree area per plot), 102 bags in 2018; field incubation periods were 96 and 102 days respectively.
- Retrieval and processing: bags retrieved by cutting around edges; roots trimmed to bag interior, dried at 60°C for 72 h, and weighed (dry mass). Subsamples analyzed for carbon content via elemental analysis.

## Hyphal production (sand ingrowth bags)
- Bags: nylon mesh bags (5 × 5 cm) with 37 µm mesh, filled with 18 g Lake Torneträsk sand; sand particle size 0.125–1 mm; autoclaved and dried.
- Design: thinner than typical practice (0.5 cm thick) to favor colonization by fungi and enable colonization by fungi that might not grow in sand.
- Deployment: bags placed at a 45° angle beneath the litter layer, 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar but on the opposite side to root bags.
- Incubation: same dates as root bags (2017 and 2018 growing seasons).
- Retrieval and processing: sand removed and frozen at -80 °C, then freeze-dried; 1.5 g of sand from each bag ultrasonicated to release hyphae; hyphae separated from sand, dried, weighed, and analyzed for carbon content via elemental analysis.
- Quality control: eight blank samples (unused bags) analyzed; average carbon content from blanks subtracted from field samples.
