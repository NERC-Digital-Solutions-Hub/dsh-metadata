# Methods for site descriptions, CO 2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko.

## Overview
- Describes data collection methods for soil CO2 efflux, root production, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) hyphal production at Abisko, Sweden, used in Parker et al. (2020).
- Data are available in two CSV files: Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv and Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv.

## Site selection and experimental design
- Location: forest-tundra ecotone near Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°18 N, 18°49 E, ~600 m a.s.l.), Sweden.
- Habitat: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum) across 0.88 km2.
- Plots: 5 willow (W) and 6 mountain birch (B) plots established in June 2017; each plot subdivided into paired sub-plots (B1-6, W1-5).
- Pair selection: pairs matched for similar tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, and understorey composition.
- Plot geometry: birch plots circular, radius ~10 m, average birch density ~586 trees ha-1; willow plots smaller, higher density, with trenching in perimeter to prevent root intrusion.
- Pre-girdling measurements: two soil CO2 efflux measurements taken after snow-melt but before girdling.
- Girdling treatment: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; birch stems >1 cm girdled around the circumference at ~30 cm height; 4–8 cm bark removed to sever phloem; willow stems girdled ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouts removed if observed.
- Central measurement area: focused within a 3 m radius for birch (3–4 trees per central area) and a 1 m radius for willows.

## Data collection and measurements

- CO2 efflux collars:
  - Three collars per plot placed within 1 m of central trees (birch) or central 1 m radius (willow).
  - Collar dimensions: 5 cm tall, 15 cm inner diameter; sealed with plumber’s putty to soil to prevent root intrusion.
  - Measurement method: EGM-5 infrared gas analyser with CPY-5 dark chamber; CO2 efflux calculated from linear increase in concentration over 90 seconds.
  - Replication: three collars per plot averaged to yield per-plot flux.
  - Sampling schedule: 20 dates total—birch 10 dates (2017) and willow 9 dates (2017) plus 10 dates for both in 2018.
  - Temporal order: plots and collars sampled in alternating order to reduce bias; sampling window 09:00–18:00.

- Data quality checks:
  - Paired t-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences between sub-plots, supporting valid comparisons of girdled vs. control treatments.

## Root production (ingrowth bags)

- In-growth bags:
  - Bags: cylindroid fiberglass mesh, 6 cm deep, 2 mm mesh, 2 cm x 1.5 cm cross-section.
  - Substrate: ericaceous peat collected locally, dried and sieved; roots removed before deployment.
  - Deployment: vertically inserted into top 6 cm of organic soil, 30 cm from every CO2 efflux collar, within central areas of each plot.
  - Incubation periods: 96 days in 2017 and 102 days in 2018.
  - Retrieval and processing: bags excavated, outside portions of roots trimmed, roots washed and dried at 60 °C for 72 h; dry mass weighed; carbon content measured with Flash Smart elemental analyzer.

## Hyphal production (ECM hyphae ingrowth)

- Sand-filled ingrowth bags:
  - Bags: 5 x 5 cm nylon mesh, 37 µm mesh size, filled with 18 g of Lake Torneträsk sand.
  - Sand preparation: particle size 0.125–1 mm, autoclaved, dried.
  - Bag design: thinner than typical (0.5 cm thick when filled) to encourage colonisation by diverse mycorrhizal fungi.
  - Deployment: inserted at a 45° angle, directly below the litter layer, 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar but on the opposite side from root bags.
  - Incubation: same period as root bags (June–Sept 2017; June–Sept 2018).
  - Recovery and processing: sand extracted, frozen, freeze-dried; 1.5 g sand processed to extract hyphae via sonication; hyphae-containing solution measured for C content.
  - Blanks: eight field blanks and subtraction of average blank C content from all samples.
  - Analysis: C content of hyphae determined with Flash Smart elemental analyzer.

## Data considerations and caveats
- Site-specific challenges include patchy, multi-format data and need to understand girdling effects on below-ground processes.
- Willow plots required trenching and plastic-sheet barriers to prevent root intrusion, unlike birch plots.
- Girdling effects: willow canopy did not produce leaves in 2018, which may influence CO2 flux interpretation in that treatment group.
