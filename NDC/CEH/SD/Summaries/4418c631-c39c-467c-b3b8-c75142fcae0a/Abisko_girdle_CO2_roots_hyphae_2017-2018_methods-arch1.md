# Methods for site descriptions, CO 2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko.

## Overview
- Field study near Abisko Scientific Research Station, Sweden, investigating below-ground respiration and below-ground production in a girdling experiment.
- Target systems: mountain birch forest and willow thickets across a 0.88 km² area.
- Focus areas: soil CO2 efflux (root-associated and heterotrophic), root production, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) hyphal production.
- Data files referenced: Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv (CO2 efflux) and Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv (roots and hyphae).

## Site selection and experimental design
- Location: forest-tundra ecotone ~3–4 km south of Abisko Station; birch plots on well-drained spodosols, willow plots on poorly drained sites.
- Plots: 5 willow (W) and 6 mountain birch (B) plots established in June 2017; each plot divided into paired sub-plots (Birch: B1-6; Willow: W1-5).
- Pairing criteria: similar tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N ratio, and understorey composition to minimize baseline differences.
- Plot geometry: birch plots have a central 3 m radius with ~3–4 trees; birch plots require larger buffering area (outer perimeters ~10–20 m apart; 300–1100 m between pairs). Willow plots have a 2 m radius central area with high stem density (5–6 stems m⁻²); pairs separated by 300–900 m.
- Willow trenching: perimeter trenching and plastic sheet inserted to the soil to prevent root ingress from adjacent plants; not applied to birch plots.
- Pre-treatment checks: soil CO2 efflux measured twice in June 2017; paired t-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences between sub-plots.

## Girdling treatment
- Design: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; coded G (girdled) vs C (control) in data files.
- Birch girdling: all stems >1 cm diameter girdled within the 10 m radius plot; bark removed 4–8 cm width down to xylem about 30 cm above ground to sever phloem connections.
- Willow girdling: all willow stems girdled ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouting shoots removed by hand as observed.
- Phenology notes: birch leaves persisted into 2018; willow canopies failed to leaf in 2018.
- Post-girdling setup: three 5 cm tall PVC collars (15 cm inner diameter) installed within 1 m of one central tree per birch plot (and within central 1 m radius of willow plots) to measure soil CO2 efflux.

## Soil CO2 efflux measurements
- Collars: three collars per plot placed between understory stems and moss mats; sealed with plumber’s putty to ensure airtightness.
- Equipment: EGM-5 infrared gas analyser with CPY-5 darkened chamber.
- Method: CO2 efflux calculated from the linear increase in CO2 concentration over 90 seconds.
- Sampling: measurements conducted on all plots on the same day, 09:00–18:00; order of plots and collars alternated to reduce bias.
- Replication: for each measurement date, the average of the three collars within a plot is treated as the plot-level flux.
- Temporal coverage: 10 measurement dates in 2017 and 10 in 2018 per plot.

## Growing season root production
- Method: ingrowth bags to estimate new root production.
- Bags: cylindroid fibre-glass mesh (6 cm deep, 2 mm mesh) filled with ericaceous peat collected from the study area; bags inserted vertically into the top 6 cm of organic soil, 30 cm from every CO2 efflux collar.
- Deployment: bags placed on 14 June 2017 and retrieved 18 September 2017 (96 days); second deployment 2 June 2018 to 12 September 2018 (102 days).
- Lab processing: roots extracted, dried at 60°C for 72 hours, and dry mass recorded; carbon content measured with a Flash Smart elemental analyser.

## Hyphal production
- Method: ECM hyphal production estimated with sand-filled ingrowth bags.
- Bags: 5 × 5 cm nylon mesh, 37 μm mesh, containing 18 g Lake Torneträsk sand; sand autoclaved and dried.
- Design considerations: bags are thinner (0.5 cm) to reduce travel distance for fungi and to favor fungi that colonize sand; installed below the litter layer, 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar but on the opposite side of root ingrowth bags.
- Deployment: same timing as root bags.
- Processing: sand extracted within 4–6 hours of field recovery, frozen at -80°C, then freeze-dried; 1.5 g sand from each bag was sonicated to release hyphae, then dried and weighed; carbon content measured with a Flash Smart elemental analyser.
- Baseline corrections: eight blank samples (not deployed in the field) used to correct for background hyphal carbon; blank mean subtracted from all samples.
