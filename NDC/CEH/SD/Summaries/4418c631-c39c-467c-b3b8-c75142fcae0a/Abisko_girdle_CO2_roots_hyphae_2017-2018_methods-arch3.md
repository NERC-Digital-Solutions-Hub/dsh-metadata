# Methods for site descriptions, CO 2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko

- This document describes the experimental design and measurement methods used to quantify soil CO2 efflux, root ingrowth, and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) hyphal production in girdling experiments conducted around the Abisko Scientific Research Station, Sweden, with data referenced in Parker et al. (2020).
- Data referenced include: Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_CO2efflux.csv (soil CO2 efflux) and Primetime_Abisko_2017_2018_NP2020_roots_hyphae.csv (root and hyphae masses and carbon content).

## Site selection and experimental design

- Location: forest-tundra ecotone 3–4 km south of the Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°18 N, 18°49 E, ~600 m a.s.l.), Sweden.
- Habitat: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum), across a 0.88 km² area.
- Pre-treatment plot setup (June 2017): 5 willow and 6 mountain birch plots, each subdivided into paired sub-plots (B1-6 for birch; W1-5 for willow) selected to match tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, and understorey composition.
- Plot dimensions and spacing: birch plots with ~10 m radius central areas (3–4 trees per plot) and larger spacing between birch sub-plots (outer perimeters 10–20 m apart; pairs 300–1100 m from other pairs); willow plots with ~2 m radius central areas (dense willow canopy; 300–900 m between pairs). Willow plots required trenching and plastic-sheet barriers to prevent root intrusion; birch plots did not.
- Pre-treatment measurements: soil CO2 efflux measured twice per plot prior to girdling (9–12 June 2017); paired sub-plots tested with paired T-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences.

## Treatments and girdling procedure

- Experimental treatment: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; remaining sub-plot served as control.
- Girdling method:
  - Birch: girdle all stems >1 cm in diameter within the 10 m central plot; remove a 4–8 cm bark ring around the circumference down to xylem, approximately 30 cm above ground to sever phloem connections.
  - Willow: girdle every willow stem ~10–20 cm above ground; monitor and remove any resprouts from below the girdle line.
- Post-treatment observations: birch trees produced full leaves in spring 2018; girdled willow canopies did not produce leaves in 2018. Three collars were installed per plot prior to girdling.

## Collars and measurement protocol for CO2 efflux

- Collar installation: three 5 cm tall, 15 cm inner-diameter PVC collars placed within 1 m of central trees in birch plots and within the central 1 m radius in willow plots; collars sealed to the soil with plumber’s putty to ensure airtight chambers.
- Measurement technique: CO2 efflux using an EGM-5 infrared gas analyser with a CPY-5 darkened chamber; rate calculated from linear increase in CO2 concentration over 90 seconds.
- Sampling schedule: CO2 efflux measured on 10 dates for birch and 9 dates for willow in the 2017 growing season, and 10 dates per season in 2018 (across girdled and control plots).
- Replication and bias control: all plots visited on the same day; sampling order alternated to minimize temporal bias; true replicate flux per plot = average of the three collars.

## Root ingrowth bags and root production

- Purpose: estimate growing-season root production.
- Bag design and deployment: cylindroid fibre-glass mesh bags (6 cm deep; 2 mm mesh) filled with ericaceous peat; bags inserted vertically into the top 6 cm of organic soil, 30 cm from every CO2 efflux collar, within central areas of each plot.
- Deployment periods: 14 June 2017 – 18 September 2017 (96 days) and 2 June 2018 – 12 September 2018 (102 days).
- Retrieval and processing: bags retrieved, in-growth roots cleaned, dried at 60°C for 72 h, and weighed for dry mass; carbon content measured with a Flash Smart elemental analyser after drying.

## Hyphal production (ectomycorrhizal) ingrowth

- Purpose: estimate ECM hyphal production over the same growing seasons as root bags.
- Bag design and deployment: 5 × 5 cm nylon mesh bags with 37 μm mesh filled with 18 g autoclaved Lake Torneträsk sand; bags inserted below the litter layer at a 45° angle, 30 cm from each CO2 efflux collar but on the opposite side to root ingrowth cores.
- Hyphal sampling and processing: bags remained in the field for the same durations as root bags; sand extracted within 4–6 hours of field recovery, frozen at -80°C, and freeze-dried; hyphae extracted by washing, then 1.5 g subsamples analyzed for carbon content via elemental analysis; averaged blank controls subtracted.
- Data handling: average ECM hyphal carbon content corrected by subtracting average blank samples; aligned with root ingrowth sampling periods.

## Data handling, outputs, and references

- Data outputs intended for integration with NP2020 datasets: soil CO2 efflux rates and root/hyphae carbon content/mass data (as captured in the referenced CSV files).
- Cross-reference: measurement design and data align with Parker et al. (2020) methods (link provided in the original document).
- Data governance considerations for monitoring frameworks:
  - Clear data naming and linking to specific datasets (CO2 efflux, roots, hyphae).
  - Documentation of experimental design, treatment allocation, and replication to support traceability.
  - Evidence of pre-treatment benchmarking and standardized measurement windows to enable comparability.
  - Potential data governance barriers highlighted in monitoring frameworks (e.g., metadata completeness, data-sharing constraints, timeliness of data access) and the need for transparent data management to ensure data can be validated and reused.
