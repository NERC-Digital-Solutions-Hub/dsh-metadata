# Methods for site descriptions, CO 2 efflux, root and hyphae ingrowth at a subarctic treeline, Abisko.

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the girdling experiment conducted near Abisko, Sweden, to study soil CO2 efflux and below-ground production (root and hyphae ingrowth) in subarctic forest-tundra ecotone.
  - Data referenced for a paper by Parker et al. (2020); data files include CO2 efflux and root/hyphae masses.

- Site description and experimental design
  - Location: forest-tundra ecotone about 3–4 km south of the Abisko Scientific Research Station (68°18′N, 18°49′E, ~600 m a.s.l.), Sweden.
  - Habitat: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum); area ~0.88 km².
  - Pre-treatment plots: 5 willow (W) and 6 mountain birch (B) plots established June 2017; each plot subdivided into paired sub-plots (e.g., B1-6, W1-5) matched for tree density, soil C, C:N, and understorey composition.
  - Plot geometry: birch plots ~10 m radius central area (3–4 trees within 3 m), willow plots ~2 m radius; edges separated by 10–20 m (birch) or 2–16 m (willow); larger birch plots to ensure girdling encompassed all contributing trees.
  - Experimental manipulation: one sub-plot per pair girdled between June 12–15, 2017; controls remained unf girdled.

- Girdling and plant response
  - Birch girdling: 4–8 cm bark ring cut down to xylem ~30 cm above ground to sever phloem; all stems >1 cm diameter girdled within the central 10 m radius.
  - Willow girdling: all willow stems girdled ~10–20 cm above ground.
  - Post-girdling management: re-sprouting shoots from below girdle removed manually as observed.
  - Plant response notes: birch retained leaves in 2018; girdled willow canopy failed to produce leaves in 2018.

- CO2 efflux measurement protocol
  - Collars: three 5 cm tall, 15 cm inner-diameter PVC collars installed within 1 m of central trees (birch) or central 1 m radius (willow); collars sealed with plumber’s putty to ensure soil contact without root damage.
  - Sampling schedule: measurements conducted twice per plot after snow-melt (early June 2017) and then across the growing seasons (2017: 10 dates; 2018: 10 dates per plot).
  - Measurement method: EGM-5 infrared gas analyzer with a CPY-5 darkened chamber; CO2 efflux calculated from the linear increase in CO2 concentration over 90 seconds.
  - Replication: three collars per plot; true replicate flux per plot = average of the three collar measurements.
  - Experimental controls: measurement order randomized daily to minimize temporal bias.
  - Pre-treatment checks: paired t-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences between sub-plots.

- Root ingrowth (production) methodology
  - Ingrowth bags: cylindroid fiberglass mesh bags (6 cm deep; 2 mm mesh) filled with ericaceous peat; deployed vertically in the top 6 cm of organic soil, 30 cm from every CO2 collar.
  - Deployment periods: June 14–Sept 18, 2017 (96-day incubation) and June 2–Sept 12, 2018 (102-day incubation).
  - Retrieval and processing: roots extracted, dried at 60°C for 72 h, weighed for dry mass; carbon content analyzed with a Flash Smart elemental analyzer.
  - Sampling context: bags placed within central areas of central trees to target root ingrowth related to below-ground activity.

- Hyphal production (ectomycorrhizal) methodology
  - Ingrowth bags: sand-filled bags (5 × 5 cm; 37 μm mesh) containing 18 g Lake Torneträsk sand; sand sieved to 0.125–1 mm and autoclaved.
  - Bag characteristics: designed to be thin (0.5 cm) to reduce colonization distance and encourage diverse mycorrhizal hyphae growth.
  - Deployment: bags inserted at a 45° angle beneath litter, 30 cm from each CO2 collar but on the opposite side from root bags.
  - Incubation and processing: same field dates as root bags; upon retrieval, sand is washed to extract hyphae, dried, and weighed for carbon content; blanks (unfielded bags) used to correct for background carbon; hyphal carbon values corrected by subtracting average blank C.

- Data quality, standards and governance
  - Consistency across years (2017 and 2018) and plot types (birch and willow) with standardized protocols for girdling, collar installation, and sampling.
  - Clear documentation of plot-level identifiers (e.g., B1-6, W1-5) and central-area sampling radii to support data discoverability and comparability.
  - Explicit data outputs and methods enabling replication of CO2 flux calculations and below-ground biomass carbon assessments.
