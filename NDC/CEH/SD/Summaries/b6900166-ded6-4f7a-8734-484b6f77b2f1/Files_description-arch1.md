# COMPARATIVE TRANSCRIPTOMICS OF A COMPLEX OF FOUR EUROPEAN PINE SPECIES

## Overview
- Comparative transcriptomics study across four European pine species.
- Reference transcriptome for Scots pine from Glen Tanar (Scotland) used as baseline.
- Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing with 100 base paired-end reads; TruSeq RNA kit for library preparation.
- Reference sequence contains 40,798 contigs (Reference_PS2_trinity.fna).
- Raw transcriptome data for the reference plus 16 samples from four species deposited in European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) under accession PRJEB6877.

## Sequencing and reference context
- Reference and samples involve Scots pine 2_GT_31 from Glen Tanar as the reference sequence.
- Sequencing platform: Illumina HiSeq 2000; read length: 100 bp; paired-end.
- Data collectively cover samples from four species: Pinus sylvestris (S), Pinus mugo (M), Pinus uncinata (UN), Pinus uliginosa (UG) across Europe.

## Access and provenance
- Raw data for all transcriptome samples (reference + 16 samples) deposited in ENA; accession PRJEB6877.
- Reference transcriptome file: Reference_PS2_trinity.fna; SNP datasets are named to reflect species, population, and region.

## Potential analyses and applications for analysts
- Cross-species and cross-population SNP comparisons relative to a common reference transcriptome.
- Investigations of population structure, allele frequency differences, and potential local adaptation signals.
- Linkage of SNP variation to transcript-level context or gene function (transcriptome-derived SNPs).
- Integration of these data with expression data to explore genotype-phenotype associations across geographic ranges.
