# Survey Overview

## Summary
- Precise levelling surveys were conducted at two blanket peatland sites in the Flow Country to provide peat surface motion data for validating the ISBAS DInSAR technique over peatland.
- Aimed to capture motion variation within 14 × 90 m × 90 m pixels across peat microtopography features (hummocks, hollows, high/low ridges, bare peat, hags).
- Data collection occurred approximately monthly from 30/07/2017 to 22/02/2019, with gaps due to thick snow (Dec 2017–Apr 2018) and occasional weather-related benchmark issues.

## Site Description
- Sites: RSPB Forsinard, Knockfin Heights (NC94958), Sutherland, Scotland and Plantlife Munsary (ND21677 46186), Caithness, Scotland; part of the Flow Country, Europe’s largest blanket bog.
- Knockfin Heights: upland bog (>300 m.a.s.l.) with erosive features (peat hags, drained/undrained pools, lochans) and vegetation mosaic.
- Munsary: lowland bog (~100 m.a.s.l.) with Dubh Lochans, high water tables, rare plants; margins are shrubby peat; historic grazing and peat extraction with recent restoration; near-natural condition at survey site.

## Survey design
- Two benchmark types: Permanent benchmarks connected to the substrate and Floating benchmarks anchored to the peat surface.
- Permanent benchmarks: 6 mm galvanised rods (1 m) assembled with bolts; ground surface marked for traditional peat surface motion measurements; protruding rods trimmed to 100–150 mm above peat; used to anchor measurement against underlying substrate.
- Floating benchmarks: 0.5 m flat-headed ground anchors; barbed rods embedded in the top peat surface; designed for easy levelling; anchored to measure bulk motion of the top 0.5 m.
- Benchmark layout: ~1 km² area per site; seven subsites per site representing range of InSAR subsidence rates and peat morphologies; within each site, seven floating benchmark locations corresponding to microtopography and vegetation types.
- Deer interference noted; B5 lost at Knockfin Heights due to deer damage; some marks placed to improve long-range visibility.

## Benchmark Locations
- Permanent benchmarks installed at substrate level (Knockfin Heights: eroded upper bedrock; Munsary: glacial clay).
- Floating benchmarks positioned to align with permanent benchmarks and local microtopography (e.g., hummocks, hollows, lawns, pools, drains).
- Marker installation: poles installed by hand when possible to ensure verticality; some locations hammered into firmer substrates; protections to reduce deer interference; vegetation recovery allowed before first levelling.

## Levelling Survey Design
- Instrumentation: Leica LS15 precise level with a 2 m Invar coded staff.
- Procedure: BBFF (backsight, backsight, foresight, foresight) with a single observer; level lines ~50 m from staff; distance balancing, staff limits, and autofocusing; readings averaged from three measurements.
- Quality criteria: measurement threshold STDEV < 0.5 mm (wind conditions allow up to 1 mm); site loops repeated ~5 weeks to align with 6-day InSAR repeat cycles.
- Operational notes: Knockfin Heights inaccessible Dec 2017–Apr 2018 due to snow; level setup aimed to minimize wind and movement-related errors; loops typically achieved <1 mm closure; post-survey height corrections applied for loop closure.

## Quality Control
- Each survey loop repeated three times; closure checked (and recorded in tables A3–A4).
- Measurements with high standard deviation were repeated when possible; otherwise, weather constraints allowed relaxation to 1 mm.
- Fixed benchmarks assumed stable; vertical motion of fixed benchmarks within RTK-GPS survey error.

## Appendix
- Data columns include:
  - Benchmark name; X (OSGB); Y (OSGB); Z (m.a.s.l.); Date; Height (relative to fixed benchmark); STDEV (m).
  - NA indicates measurements not possible due to environmental conditions (wind, glare).
- Tables A1–A4 detail floating benchmark locations, loop closures, and height changes over time for Knockfin Heights and Munsary.
