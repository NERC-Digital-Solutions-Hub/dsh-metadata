# Survey Overview

- Purpose: Precise levelling surveys were conducted at two blanket peatland sites in the Flow Country to provide peat surface motion data for validating the ISBAS DInSAR technique over peatland.
- Data focus: Captures variation of peat surface motion within 14 90x90 m pixels across microtopographic features (hummocks, hollows, ridges, bare peat, hags).
- Timeframe: approximately monthly data collection from 30/07/2017 to 22/02/2019.
- Gaps: December 2017–April 2018 at Knockfin Heights due to thick snow; occasional single benchmark gaps caused by weather.

## Study Sites

- Flow Country peatlands comprising:
  - Knockfin Heights (RSPB Forsinard), Sutherland, Scotland (NC94958) – upland bog (>300 m a.s.l.), with erosive features (peat hags, pools, lochans) and varied vegetation.
  - Munsary (Plantlife) – lowland portion (around 100 m a.s.l.), Caithness, Scotland – pool systems (Dubh Lochans), high water tables, near-natural condition with prior historic grazing and peatland restoration nearby.

## Survey Design and Benchmarking

- Benchmark types:
  - Permanent benchmarks: connected to the substrate (underlying bedrock or glacial clay) to anchor motion measurements.
  - Floating benchmarks: anchored to the peat surface to measure bulk motion of the top 0.5 m.
- Benchmark construction:
  - Permanent: 6 mm galvanised rods assembled to form a stable reference, with surface markers and protective measures to minimize vegetation/deer interference.
  - Floating: 0.5 m ground anchors designed for levelled measurement on the peat surface.
- Spatial layout: approximately 1 km^2 area per site; 7 subsites per site with seven floating benchmark locations at each subsite; permanent benchmarks establish substrate reference at each subsite.
- Microtopography coverage: bench placements reflect site-specific peat morphology (hummocks, lawns, hollows, bare peat, pools, draped vegetation).

## Benchmark Locations and Documentation

- Knockfin Heights: seven subsites with various microtopographies; permanent and floating benchmarks documented; note: benchmark B5 lost due to deer damage.
- Munsary: seven subsite locations with corresponding floating benchmarks; microtopography coded to reflect features such as mud-filled hollows, high/low ridges, and lawns near pools.
- Detailed coordinates and microtopography descriptions are provided in Tables A1 and A2 (floating benchmarks) and Table A3 (Knockfin Heights loop closures).

## Levelling and Measurement Procedure

- Equipment: Leica LS15 precise level with 2 m Invar staff.
- Method: BBFF (backsight, backsight, foresight, foresight) with a single staff operator; level set to line levelling mode; typical measurement distances around 5 m (staff 2 m; limits 25 cm–175 cm).
- Measurement standards: aim for STDEV < 0.5 mm; if higher, perform a second measurement and reassess; wind conditions can reduce threshold to < 1 mm.
- Operational details: level station positioned ~50 m from staff when possible; careful attention to avoid movement and ensure stability; loops generally completed with ~1 mm closure.
- Repeat schedule: measurement loops repeated approximately every 5 weeks to align with 6-day InSAR repeat cycles.
- Snow/weather limiting access: Knockfin Heights inaccessible Dec 2017–Apr 2018 due to snow.

## Quality Control

- Each survey loop is repeated three times; closure of the loop recorded.
- Measurements exceeding 0.5 mm standard deviation are repeated unless weather prevents; in poor conditions, limits may be relaxed to ±1 mm.
- Post-survey height corrections applied to account for loop closure using Leica Infinity software.
- Fixed benchmarks are assumed stable; vertical motion of fixed benchmarks within the survey error margins as verified by RTK-GPS.

## Data and Metadata (Appendix and Data Tables)

- Data structure:
  - Tables A1–A4 contain spatial and measurement details for both sites, including:
    - OSGB X and Y coordinates (British National Grid)
    - Height above sea level (m.a.s.l) and height relative to fixed benchmark (m)
    - Date of survey
    - STDEV of three measurements
    - NA entries indicate data not possible due to environmental conditions
- Data fields example (Table A3–A4 highlights):
  - Benchmark name; X, Y coordinates; Height above sea level; Date; Height relative to fixed benchmark; STDEV
- Data availability: detailed location-specific data and loop closure metrics are provided for Knockfin Heights (Table A3) and Munsary (Table A4), with extensive coordinate and microtopography descriptors (Tables A1–A2).

## Data Gaps, Limitations, and Context

- Gaps in data collection caused by weather (snow cover, wind, glare) and deer interference affecting certain benchmarks.
- Some benchmark data points are NA when measurement was not possible due to environmental constraints.
- The study is designed to support long-term monitoring and validation of remote-sensing peatland motion (ISBAS DInSAR) through in-situ levelling data.

## Use and References

- Purpose within a broader program: provides ground-truth peat surface motion data to validate the ISBAS DInSAR approach and to relate motion to microtopographic features.
