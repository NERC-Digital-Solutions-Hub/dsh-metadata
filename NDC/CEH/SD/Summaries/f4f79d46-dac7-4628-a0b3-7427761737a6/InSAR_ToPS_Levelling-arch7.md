# Survey Overview

- Purpose and scope
  - Precise levelling surveys were conducted at two blanket peatland sites in the Flow Country to provide peat surface motion data for validating the ISBAS DInSAR technique.
  - Aimed to show motion variation within 14 90x90 m pixels, incorporating different microtopographic features (hummocks, hollows, high/low ridges, bare peat, hags).
  - Data collection occurred approximately monthly from 30/07/2017 to 22/02/2019, with gaps due to thick snow (Dec 2017–Apr 2018) and occasional weather-related benchmark measurement gaps.

- Study sites
  - RSPB Forsinard, Knockfin Heights (NC94958), Sutherland, Scotland
    - Large upland blanket bog (>300 m.a.s.l.), owned/managed by multiple landowners including RSPB Forsinard.
    - Features include peat hags, drained/undrained peat pools and lochans, and a mix of sedge, sphagnum, heather, and grasses.
  - Plantlife Munsary (ND21677 46186), Caithness, Scotland
    - Part of Flow Country, lowland area (~100 m.a.s.l.), near natural condition with pool systems (Dubh Lochans) and rare plants.
    - Edges characterized by shrubs and denser peat; history of grazing, peat extraction, and burning with recent restoration (drain blocking).

- Survey design: benchmarks and locations
  - Permanent benchmarks
    - Connected to underlying substrate for relative motion measurement.
    - 6 mm galvanised rods, 1 m long, joined by bolts; surface marked with washers/bolts and kept 100–150 mm above peat to allow for peat growth and vegetation clearance.
    - Top surface includes a cradle for GPS staff; positioned to be stable and visible; prone to deer interference.
  - Floating benchmarks
    - Anchored only to the peat surface (top 0.5 m motion measured).
    - 0.5 m flat-headed ground anchor; barbed rod to integrate with peat; large head surface to reduce compression from the coded staff.
  - Benchmark locations
    - Approximately 1 km² area per site; seven subsites at each site representing the range of subsidence rates and peat microtopography.
    - At Knockfin Heights: microtopography focused on hummocks, lawns, hollows, bare peat in pools and peat hags.
    - At Munsary: hummocks, lawns, hollows.
    - Within each subsite, one permanent benchmark and seven floating benchmark locations to enable relative motion measurements.
    - Note: benchmark B5 was lost early due to deer damage.

- Levelling and measurement methodology
  - Equipment and procedure
    - Leica LS15 precise level with 2 m Invar coded staff.
    - BBFF (backsight, backsight, foresight, foresight) leveling sequence with a single staff operator.
    - Line levelling mode with strict setup to minimize movement; measurement readings are the mean of three measurements.
    - Typical station distance around 50 m; measurement thresholds tailored to conditions (STDEV < 0.5 mm; wind conditions may reduce this to < 1 mm).
    - Loops aimed for ~1 mm closure; repeats roughly every 5 weeks to align with InSAR’s 6-day repeat cycles.
  - Data quality and adjustments
    - Height corrections applied post-survey to account for loop closure using Leica Infinity software.
    - Fixed benchmarks assumed stable; vertical motion of fixed benchmarks within RTK-GPS error.
    - Knockfin Heights experienced snow-related access loss Dec 2017–Apr 2018.

- Quality control and processing
  - Each survey loop repeated three times; closure noted (A3/A4 tables).
  - Measurements with STDEV > 0.5 mm re-measured if weather allowed; otherwise thresholds may be relaxed to ±1 mm.
  - Final heights are corrected for loop closure; fixed benchmarks treated as stable throughout the survey period.

- Data and appendix details
  - Data fields (Table A3/A4 style descriptions)
    - OSGB X and Y: British National Grid coordinates.
    - Height (m a.s.l): Height above sea level, relative to standard datum.
    - Date: Date of survey.
    - Height: Height relative to the fixed benchmark for the subsite, standardized to 100 m where applicable.
    - STDEV (m): Standard deviation from three measurements; generally <= 0.5 mm, with weather-related exceptions.
    - NA entries mark measurements not possible due to environmental conditions.
  - Floating benchmark location descriptions (Knockfin Heights) and Munsary (MT codes) provided to relate microtopography to benchmark positions.
  - Loop closures (Table A3) and loop closure heights (Table A4) recorded across multiple dates to support vertical accuracy assessment.
  - Appendix also includes site-specific coordinate details and microtopography codes for the floating benchmark locations.

- Data use and references
  - Data designed to support long-term monitoring and validation of peat surface motion against InSAR-derived measurements.
