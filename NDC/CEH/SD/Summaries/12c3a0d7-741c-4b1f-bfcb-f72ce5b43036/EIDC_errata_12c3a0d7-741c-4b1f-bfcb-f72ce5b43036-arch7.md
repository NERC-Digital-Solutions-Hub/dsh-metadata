# Errata for dataset https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/12c3a0d7- 741c-4b1f-bfcb-f72ce5b43036

## Summary
- Erratum: NoData values were wrong in the SPI18 and SPI24 data files.

## Implications for GIS Specialists
- Incorrect NoData values can affect raster rendering, masking, and analyses relying on missing data.
- Potential inconsistencies when combining SPI18/SPI24 with other spatial datasets.

## Actions for GIS Workflows
- Look for updated/corrected versions of SPI18 and SPI24 data files.
- Replace affected datasets in projects and re-run analyses that used the NoData values.
- Verify and standardize NoData handling across related layers.

## Data Management Considerations
- Update dataset metadata to reflect the correction.
- Document the erratum in project notes to ensure accurate interpretation and reproducibility.
