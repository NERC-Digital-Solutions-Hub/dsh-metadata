# Errata for dataset https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/12c3a0d7- 741c-4b1f-bfcb-f72ce5b43036

## Summary of issue
- NoData values were wrong in the SPI18 and SPI24 data files.

## Implications for Data Stewards
- Data quality and reliability of analyses may be affected.
- NoData semantics across the affected files require verification and alignment with standards.

## Recommended actions
- Identify and isolate the SPI18 and SPI24 files with incorrect NoData values.
- Correct the NoData values in both SPI18 and SPI24 data files.
- Re-validate data integrity and ensure NoData handling is consistent with metadata and data standards.
- Update dataset metadata and documentation to reflect the correction (including an erratum note); version the dataset as appropriate.
- Re-upload corrected files to relevant portals and ensure the data holdings catalog is updated.
- Inform data users about the correction and any potential impact on prior analyses or results.
- Review data intake and QA processes to implement checks that prevent future incorrect NoData representations.
