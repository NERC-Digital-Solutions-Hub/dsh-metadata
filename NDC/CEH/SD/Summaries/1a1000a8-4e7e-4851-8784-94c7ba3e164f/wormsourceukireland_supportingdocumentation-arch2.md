# A compendium of earthworm data sources and associated information from the UK and Ireland 1891-2021 Supporting Information

## Overview and purpose
- Compendium of field-based earthworm data sources and metadata from the United Kingdom and Ireland (referred to as WormSource).
- Data compiled up to 2021, including sources dating back to 1891.
- Aims: gather quantitative earthworm data (incidence, abundance, biomass, taxa) with associated metadata to develop abundance and niche models and to support a modelling framework for earthworm impacts on soil processes.
- Part of the Soil Organic Carbon Dynamics (SOC-D) project funded by the NERC UK-SCAPE programme (Grant NE/R016429/1).

## Content and metadata included
- Source metadata covers:
  - Data type (incidence, abundance, biomass, taxa)
  - Methodological details (sampling methods, locations, whether plots were natural or experimental, sampling years)
  - Environmental information (habitat/land-use, climate data, basic soil properties)
- 257 data sources compiled.
- Common sampling methods: hand-sorting (55%), chemical extractants (42%), with 16% using both.
- Data types observed: incidence (82%), abundance (68%), taxa (68%), biomass (49%); soil data (e.g., texture, bulk density, pH, organic matter) included in 43%.
- Habitat distribution: grasslands (62%), arable (32%), woodland (22%).
- Geographic distribution of data sources: England (51%), Republic of Ireland (ROI) (21%), Scotland (18%), Wales (13%), Northern Ireland (4%); many sources cover multiple locations.
- For 17 potential data sources, original documents could not be obtained, limiting additional information.

## Data collection methods and scope
- Systematic literature search conducted June–July 2020 using Web of Science and Google Scholar.
- Country-specific searches due to long search terms; extensive screening of results to identify relevant data with location information and earthworm data from field observations.
- Supplementary data acquired through review papers and direct contact with authors/data managers.

## Purpose within environmental monitoring
- Enables cross-study comparisons and long-term monitoring of earthworm populations, contributing to models of soil processes and ecosystem health.
- Demonstrates standardized metadata collection and integration of heterogeneous sources for policy-relevant environmental assessments.

## Relevance to the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype
- Aligns with aims to use data in a consistent format to evaluate environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Provides a structured, quality-controlled compendium of datasets, with metadata designed to facilitate data reuse, integration, and scrutiny.
- Emphasizes data provenance, sampling methods, and environmental context, supporting transparent monitoring and reporting.
- Highlights the importance of data accessibility and storage (dataset structure and metadata readiness for portals or repositories).

## Limitations and challenges
- Not all original documents accessible (17 data sources lacking additional information).
- Geographic bias toward England and uneven sampling density across regions.
- Data heterogeneity across sources (varying data types, methods, and metadata completeness) which can complicate synthesis and modelling.
- Location data availability varies, potentially limiting spatial analyses for some sources.

## Access and potential for further work
- WormSource.UKIreland.csv consolidates the structured metadata for the compiled data sources.
- Continued data sharing and retrieval from original sources could enhance completeness and spatial coverage.
