# What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach

- Purpose: Examine how ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic factors at the property scale influence avian species richness on upland farms in the Peak District; assess implications for Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) and biodiversity policy.
- Context: Biodiversity declines linked to agricultural intensification; policy aims to halt losses but effectiveness of AES is debated.

## Study design and data

- Location and sample: 44 farms within 2 km of moorland in the Peak District National Park; two bird survey visits in Spring–Summer 2007.
- Biodiversity measures: 
  - Total Species Richness
  - Upland Species Richness (upland breeders)
  - Conservation Concern Species Richness (Amber/Red listed or BAP/SPA features)
- Taxa data: 97 species observed across all farms; 21 upland specialists; 43 conservation-concern species.
- Habitat data: On-field habitat variables (e.g., intensive grass, hay/silage cutting, hedgerow/woodland cover, trees, rush cover, wet features).
- Landscape context: Proportions of six habitat types within 500 m (moorland, woodland, arable, water, urban/rural, grassland).
- Farm-level data: Farm management (stocking density, nutrient inputs, land types, AES prescriptions, predator control) and socio-economic factors (ownership, farm workers, on-farm income, net income, AES payments, rental value).
- Data collection method: Face-to-face questionnaires and standardized habitat surveys; transects designed to minimize double-counting; data processed to derive usable explanatory variables.

## Analytical approach

- Four explanatory variable classes: Habitat; Landscape context; Farm management; Socio-economic.
- Response variables modeled with Poisson GLMs; Information Theoretic approach (AIC) used to compare all possible subsets of predictors.
- Model selection: Best model defined by minimum AIC; models within ∆AIC < 2 considered to have substantial support.
- Validation: Included a random variable to gauge predictive power; five best-fitting models per response type; Joint Model combined top predictors from each class.
- Data handling: Analyses conducted at the property level; checked multicollinearity; outlier excluded.

## Key findings

- Habitat effects:
  - Explains 42% of variation in Upland Species Richness; higher richness with more cows and more rush cover; lower richness with more fields cut for silage/hay.
  - Habitat variables showed little to no explanatory power for Total or Conservation Concern richness (R2 ≈ 0).
- Landscape context:
  - Generally weak predictors; null model often best for Total and Conservation Concern richness; modest effect on Upland richness but not robust.
- Farm management:
  - Explains about 23% of variation in Conservation Concern richness; no single management variable outperformed random expectations.
  - Some signals in joint models (e.g., cattle presence linked to higher Conservation Concern richness), but overall effects are weak and not consistently predictive.
- Socio-economic factors:
  - Explains about 24% of variation in Total Species Richness; higher ownership share and greater farm workers associated with changes in richness.
  - On-farm income and AES payments had limited predictive power; ownership and labour variables more influential for Conservation Concern richness (18% variation).
- Joint models:
  - For Upland and Conservation Concern richness, joint models offered limited improvement over single-variable sets; for Total richness, adding vegetated field boundaries provided modest gains.
- Overall interpretation:
  - Property-scale habitat quality matters for upland specialists, but Total and Conservation Concern richness are not well predicted by habitat or landscape context alone.
  - Socio-economic conditions at the property level are important drivers of avian diversity, highlighting the role of ownership, labour, and income structure.
  - AES design and effectiveness are not uniformly predictive of species richness; spatial and property-level heterogeneity matters.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy

- Monitoring should account for heterogeneity at the property level (habitat quality, farm management, ownership, and labour) rather than assuming uniform policy effects across farms.
- AES and subsidy design:
  - One-size-fits-all payments may miss low-cost biodiversity gains or fail to account for property-specific costs and constraints.
  - Spatial coordination and property-specific targeting could enhance ecological gains, especially if designed to reflect regional variation in costs and management barriers.
- Policy design insights from the study:
  - Biodiversity responses are species- and measure-specific; focusing on individual species may yield cheaper gains than aiming for broad community-level gains.
  - The interactions among farm types (e.g., cattle presence) and socio-economic context can influence outcomes; policy should reflect these interactions.
- Monitoring data needs:
  - High-resolution, property-level data on habitat, management, ownership, and labour.
  - Metadata and data governance to enable data sharing while respecting confidentiality.
  - Transparent model-based frameworks (e.g., information-theoretic model selection) to identify robust predictors and avoid over-interpretation.

## Data governance, metadata and sharing considerations (relevant to monitoring frameworks)

- This study demonstrates the value of integrating ecological and socio-economic datasets at the property level for policy-relevant insights.
- Key monitoring practices to adopt:
  - Comprehensive metadata for habitat, management, and socio-economic variables; clear data provenance and transformation records.
  - Data sharing protocols that balance openness with confidentiality, to reduce barriers noted in monitoring work (e.g., concerns about publicly sharing datasets).
  - Quality assurance and documentation of data collection methods to enable reproducibility and cross-study comparability.
  - Governance processes that allow integration of diverse data streams (ecological, economic, ownership) into adaptive monitoring frameworks.

## Limitations and future directions

- Limited predictive power for Total and Conservation Concern richness beyond habitat variables; larger samples or longitudinal data could improve robustness.
- Potential interactions (e.g., between grazing regimes and habitat quality) require further exploration.
- AES design optimization remains complex; future monitoring should test spatially coordinated schemes and region-specific settings.
- Further integration of ecological and economic models could better quantify trade-offs between biodiversity gains and farm profitability across landscapes.

## Conclusion

- Property-level variation in habitat quality, management practices, and socio-economic contexts collectively shape avian diversity, with particularly strong effects on upland specialists.
- Policy and monitoring frameworks should incorporate property-level heterogeneity to design more effective AES and to interpret biodiversity outcomes more accurately.
- The study highlights the value and challenges of inter-disciplinary monitoring approaches that blend ecology, economics, and socio-organization factors to inform upland biodiversity policy.
