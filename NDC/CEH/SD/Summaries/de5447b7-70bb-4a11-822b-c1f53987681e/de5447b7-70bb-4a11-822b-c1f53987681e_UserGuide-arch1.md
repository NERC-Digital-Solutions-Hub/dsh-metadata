# What explains property-level variation in biodiversity? Taking an inter-disciplinary approach

## Overview
- Investigates why avian biodiversity varies across hill farms at the property level in the Peak District (UK uplands).
- Integrates ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic factors to explain three measures of species richness: Total Richness, Upland Richness, and Conservation Concern Richness.
- Uses a 44-farm dataset with bird surveys (two visits in 2007) and extensive habitat, management, and socio-economic data.
- Applies an information-theoretic framework (AIC) to compare multiple generalized linear models (Poisson) across four explanatory-variable classes and a joint model.
- Highlights how policy design (e.g., Agri-Environment Schemes) could better account for property-level heterogeneity to improve biodiversity outcomes.

## Data and Methods

- Study system
  - Peak District uplands; 44 farms within 2 km of moorland; bird surveys on two occasions in 2007; habitat on surveyed fields; landscape context within a 500 m buffer.
  - Bird data categorized into: (i) Total Species Richness, (ii) Upland Species Richness, (iii) Conservation Concern Species Richness.
  - Species lists and conservation status compiled; 97 species observed across farms; 21 upland specialists; 43 Conservation Concern species.
- Explanatory variable classes
  - Habitat: on-field habitat features (e.g., intensive grass, mowed land, vegetated boundaries, trees, livestock numbers, rush cover, wet features).
  - Landscape context: composition within 500 m (moorland, woodland, arable, inland water, urban/rural, grassland).
  - Farm management: management practices and AES-related variables (e.g., farm type, grazing, cutting dates, number of cuts, fertilizer input, predator control).
  - Socio-economic: ownership, farm workers, on-farm income, net farm income, AES payments, rental value.
- Analytical approach
  - Response variables modeled with Poisson GLMs; four variable classes plus Joint Model (combining top predictors from each class).
  - Information-Theoretic model selection (AIC). Best model = lowest AIC; substantial support if ΔAIC < 2.
  - 100 random variables added to assess whether explanatory variables offer predictive power beyond random noise.
  - Analyses performed at the property level; outlier farm excluded; multicollinearity checked (VIFs within acceptable ranges).
- Data scale and outputs
  - Property-level insights for 44 farms; 97 bird species; analysis reports R^2, AIC, 95% confidence sets, and Akaike weights (k) for variable importance.

## Results

- Overall richness patterns
  - Habitat variables explained 42% of variation in upland specialist richness (Upland Richness).
  - Landscape context provided little explanatory power for Total, Upland, or Conservation Concern richness; null model often best for Total and Conservation Concern.
  - Farm management explained 23% of variation in Conservation Concern richness, but no single management variable outperformed random expectations; effects were weaker for Total (7–9%) and Upland (7%).
  - Socio-economic factors explained 24% of variation in Total richness; ownership and labour variables were notable predictors (e.g., more ownership associated with fewer species; more farm workers associated with more species). Conservation Concern richness similarly linked to ownership and farm workers (approx. 18%), but not to on-farm income.
- Variable significance and model performance
  - The random variable was frequently competitive with some real variables, indicating many predictors did not offer predictive power beyond random chance.
  - Joint models (two variables from each class) did not consistently outperform single-class models:
    - For Upland and Conservation Concern, Joint Models had lower R^2 and higher AIC than best single-class models.
    - For Total Richness, the Joint Model slightly improved fit due to a vegetated-boundaries variable, but the improvement was modest and not distinct from random.
- Illustrative relationships
  - Upland specialists: more cows and greater rush cover linked to higher upland richness; more fields cut for silage/hay linked to lower upland richness.
  - Ownership and labour: higher ownership share correlated with lower Total and Conservation Concern richness; more farm workers correlated with higher Total richness.
  - Fertilizer input showed some positive associations in certain models but did not dominate predictive power.
- Implications of scope and metrics
  - Outcomes depend on which biodiversity metric is used (Total vs Upland vs Conservation Concern); habitat quality is crucial for upland specialists but less predictive for broader richness measures.
  - AES payments themselves did not consistently predict overall richness, though they related to densities of some Conservation Concern species in certain contexts.

## Discussion and Policy Implications

- Key takeaways
  - Biodiversity variation across hill farms is driven by a combination of within-property habitat quality, socio-economic conditions, and, to a lesser extent, landscape context.
  - Property-level heterogeneity matters: socio-economic circumstances and management decisions at the farm level can shape avian diversity patterns.
  - The lack of strong, consistent habitat- or landscape-scale predictors for Total and Conservation Concern richness suggests that applying uniform management prescriptions or subsidies may not yield uniform biodiversity gains.
- AES and policy design
  - Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) have mixed ecological outcomes; broad AES prescriptions explain limited variation in bird richness, and farms within AES do not necessarily have more species.
  - Some Conservation Concern species densities are higher on fields within AES, indicating targeted benefits may exist, but effects are not uniform.
  - Policy design could benefit from accounting for property-level heterogeneity in costs and willingness to adopt AES, enabling spatially tailored payments and coordinated actions across neighboring farms to address landscape-scale externalities.
- Practical recommendations
  - Develop spatially explicit AES that vary payments by property characteristics and the expected biodiversity gain, rather than one-size-fits-all payments.
  - Encourage spatial coordination among farms to exploit positive landscape-scale effects and mitigate externalities (e.g., sheep trespass) that limit biodiversity benefits.
  - Consider multiple biodiversity targets separately; optimizing for individual species might yield lower-cost gains than aiming for broad community-level improvements.
- Interdisciplinary insights
  - Integrating ecological and economic analyses provides more nuanced understanding of how farm-scale decisions translate into biodiversity outcomes.
  - The study highlights the complexities of translating policy into ecological gains and the importance of recognizing heterogeneity across farms and regions.

## Conclusions

- Biodiversity variation on upland hill farms is best explained by an interplay of within-field habitat features and farm-level socio-economic factors, with landscape context playing a smaller role for the broader richness measures.
- Property-level heterogeneity should be incorporated into policy design to improve biodiversity outcomes and cost-effectiveness of AES in upland landscapes.
- The findings underscore the value of interdisciplinary approaches that combine ecological data with economic and social data to inform more targeted, feasible conservation policies for dynamic rural landscapes.
