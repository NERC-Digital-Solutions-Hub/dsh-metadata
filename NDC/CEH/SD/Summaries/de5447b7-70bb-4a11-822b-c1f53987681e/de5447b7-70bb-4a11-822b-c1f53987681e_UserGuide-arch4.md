# Sustainability of Hill Farming, 2007-2008 Ecological Data USER GUIDE

- Overview
  - Aimed to understand how ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic factors at the property level shape avian biodiversity in upland Peak District farms.
  - 44 farms studied, focusing on bird species richness across three groups: Total Richness, Upland Species Richness, and Conservation Concern Species Richness.
  - Data collected spanned ecological surveys, habitat characteristics, farm management practices, and socio-economic status, with policy context centering on Agri-Environment Schemes (AES) and hill farming subsidies.

- Study setting and design
  - Location: Peak District National Park, northern England; moorland fringe and upland farmland near moorland boundaries.
  - Farms: 44 properties within 2 km of moorland; bird surveys conducted on two visits in spring-summer 2007.
  - Bird data: compile species lists; classify into Upland Species (upland specialists) and Conservation Concern species (Amber/Red-listed or BAP/SPA features).
  - Habitat context: within-field habitat variables and a 500 m buffer landscape context (moorland, woodland, arable, water, urban, grassland).
  - Socio-economic and farm management data: collected via in-person questionnaire covering ownership, farm workers, on-farm income, AES participation, inputs (stocking, fertilizer), and land types.

- Data and variables
  - Four explanatory classes:
    - Habitat: within-field features (e.g., intensive grass, mowing, vegetated boundaries, trees, rush cover, wet features).
    - Landscape context: surrounding habitat composition in 500 m buffer (proportions of arable, moorland, grassland, woodland, etc.).
    - Farm management: farm type, rough grazing, stocking density (LU/ha), predator control, cutting dates, number of cuts, fertilizer input.
    - Socio-economic: ownership proportion, farm workers, on-farm income, net farm income, AES payments, rental value.
  - Response variables: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, Conservation Concern Species Richness.
  - Data processing: calculations for livestock density, fertilizer input (kg N ha-1), farm workers, net income, AES payments; analyses performed at farm level excluding unenclosed moorland.

- Data analysis approach
  - Model framework: Generalized Linear Models with Poisson errors; multi-model inference via Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
  - Model sets: separate evaluation for each explanatory class; a Joint Model combining top variables from each class.
  - Model selection: best model = lowest AIC; consider models within ΔAIC < 2; use Akaike weights (k) to assess variable importance.
  - Validation: checked for multicollinearity (VIFs within acceptable range); excluded an extreme outlier farm; random variable included to benchmark predictive power.

- Key results
  - Species richness outcomes
    - Total observed species across farms: 97; upland specialists: 21; conservation concern: 43.
    - Habitat variables explained 42% of variation in Upland Species Richness (R2 = 0.42); notable habitat predictors:
      - Fewer upland species where more fields were cut for silage/hay.
      - More upland species with higher numbers of cows and greater rush cover.
      - Habitat measures had predictive power primarily for upland specialists, not Total or Conservation Concern richness (R2 ≈ 0 for those two).
    - Landscape context explained little for all three richness measures; the null model was often best for Total and Conservation Concern richness.
    - Farm management explained 23% of variation in Conservation Concern richness but with little predictive power; the null model was plausible in several assessments.
    - Socio-economic factors explained about 24% of Total Richness variation; key predictors:
      - More ownership and more farm workers tended to reduce Total and Conservation Concern richness, while more on-farm income slightly correlated (varied by model).
  - Joint model findings
    - For Upland and Conservation Concern richness, joint models did not outperform single-variable models overall; landscape context contributed limited value.
    - For Total richness, adding vegetated boundaries and trees improved the joint model’s explanatory power, but gains were modest and still not clearly better than random.
  - AES and policy relevance
    - AES payments did not generally predict higher species richness across farms; some analyses suggested higher densities of certain conservation concern species where more area was under AES, but results were not uniformly robust.
    - Decoupling (Single Farm Payment) showed limited average effect on income but encouraged reductions in stocking densities and labour, with nuanced regional and enterprise-type variation.
  - Ecological and socio-economic interactions
    - Strong within-property habitat effects for upland specialists; socio-economics independently explained substantial variation in total richness.
    - Off-site habitat and landscape-level AES coverage can influence on-site bird densities, indicating cross-property ecological effects and potential benefits of landscape coordination.
    - Interactions like sheep-cattle grazing did not show consistent enhancement of biodiversity in the examined data.

- Implications for data governance and data strategy
  - Property-scale heterogeneity matters: biodiversity outcomes are influenced by a mix of habitat quality, farm management, and socio-economic conditions at the farm level.
  - Data richness and granularity: combining ecological, agricultural, and socioeconomic data at the property scale enables nuanced understanding but requires careful integration, standardization, and metadata.
  - Relevance to policy design: results indicate that one-size-fits-all AES designs may underperform; policies could benefit from spatially varying payments and consideration of farm-level costs and ownership structures.
  - Cross-property coordination: landscape-level coordination and sharing of AES impacts can yield greater biodiversity benefits than isolated, single-farm actions.
  - Modelling approach: interdisciplinary methods (ecology and economics) reveal the value—and complexity—of linking biodiversity outcomes to policy instruments; results underscore the importance of accounting for regional and property-level heterogeneity.

- Data management and accessibility implications for Data Leaders
  - Data assets collected span ecological surveys, habitat metrics, and socio-economic questionnaires; ensure proper integration into a unified data model with clear metadata and variable definitions.
  - Maintain traceability of data provenance: link species richness outcomes to specific habitat measures, landscape context, and farm-management variables.
  - Support reproducibility: document modelling approaches (Poisson GLMs, AIC-based selection, joint models) and provide code or pipelines (R was used) to enable replication.
  - Ensure data discoverability: publish supporting information (Appendices S1–S2) and provide access to underlying data where possible, with clear data-sharing terms.
  - Data quality and governance: monitor for outliers, multicollinearity, and model assumptions; maintain data quality controls given the interdisciplinary analyses.
  - Ethical and stakeholder considerations: ensure governance around socioeconomic data, with appropriate anonymization and ethics approvals for human data.

- Challenges and limitations (relevant to data strategy)
  - Data scattered across habitat types and farm contexts; integrating ecological and socio-economic data requires careful alignment of units, scales, and timing.
  - Habitat and landscape context variables had limited predictive power for some richness measures, highlighting potential unmeasured factors or spatial scales beyond 500 m buffers.
  - AES effectiveness appears mixed; understanding how to design economically efficient, spatially coordinated policies remains a key data-driven challenge.
  - Regional heterogeneity suggests that policy designs should be informed by property-level data, not just aggregate averages.

- Practical takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Build property-scale data grids that combine habitat metrics, farm management, and socio-economic attributes to enable targeted biodiversity analyses and policy design.
  - Develop a robust metadata framework to document variable definitions, data collection methods, spatial scales, and temporal coverage.
  - Create analytics pipelines that support model comparison (AIC-based) and joint modelling while guarding against overfitting and multicollinearity.
  - Facilitate data sharing and collaboration across ecological and economic domains to support interdisciplinary policy design.
  - Use findings to inform data-driven policy design: tailor AES-like programs to account for ownership structure, labour capacity, and regional production mixes to maximize biodiversity gains per unit cost.
  - Leverage off-site and landscape-level data to explore coordinated conservation actions across farms, not just individual-site management.
