What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach

## Overview
- Investigates why bird species richness on upland farms varies at the property scale.
- Combines ecological data (bird surveys, habitat measures) with agricultural management and socio-economic information from 44 Peak District upland farms.
- Tests the relative importance of four explanatory domains: habitat quality, landscape context, farm management, and socio-economic factors; uses an information-theoretic modelling approach (AIC) with multiple model sets and joint models.

## Data and Stocked Measures
- Study design: 44 farms with main landholding within 2 km of moorland; surveys conducted across two visits in 2007.
- Bird metrics:
  - Total Species Richness
  - Upland Species Richness (upland specialists)
  - Conservation Concern Species Richness (Amber/Red listed or UK BAP/SPA features)
- Habitat variables (within surveyed fields): intensive grass, mowed land, vegetated boundaries, trees, sheep, cows, rush cover, wet features.
- Landscape context (500 m around each farm): proportions of arable, moorland, grassland, woodland, water, urban land.
- Farm management: farm type, stocking density (LU ha-1), predator control, cutting dates, number of cuts, fertilizer input.
- Socio-economic: ownership share, number of farm workers, on-farm income share, net farm income, AES payments, rental value.
- Data approach: Explanatory sets grouped into four classes; all analyses at the farm (property) level; models built with Poisson GLMs; Information Theoretic framework (AIC) used to compare all possible subsets within each class and in joint models.

## Analytical Approach
- Four explanatory classes modeled separately per richness measure to avoid overfitting.
- Best-fitting models identified via lowest AIC; substantial support for models within 2 AIC units of the best.
- To guard against spurious predictors, a random variable was added; explanatory variables with selection probability not better than random were considered not predictive.
- Joint Model: two top variables from each class were combined to assess additive predictive power; five best-fitting models (one per class plus Joint Model) were evaluated for each richness measure.

## Key Findings
- Overall species counts:
  - 97 species observed across 44 farms; 21 upland specialists; 43 conservation-concern species.
- Habitat quality and upland specialists:
  - Habitat variables explained 42% of variation in Upland Species Richness.
  - Fewer upland specialists where many fields were cut for silage/hay; more upland specialists with more cows and higher rush cover.
  - Habitat did not predict Total Richness or Conservation Concern Richness.
- Landscape context:
  - Generally explained little variation for any richness measure; the null model was often most supported.
- Farm management:
  - Explained 23% of variation in Conservation Concern Richness, but the null model was often a plausible alternative; no single management variable outperformed random expectations.
  - Within AES-related practices, only limited predictive power emerged; one pattern suggested more diversity on farms with cattle, but effects were not strong across measures.
- Socio-economic factors:
  - Explained 24% of variation in Total Species Richness.
  - Ownership share and number of farm workers were predictive: more ownership (higher ownership share) and more workers tended to associate with lower Total Richness or higher Total Richness (mixed signals), with farm workers showing a positive relation to richness for Total Richness.
  - On-farm income, net farm income, and AES payments did not robustly predict richness.
- Joint models and added value:
  - For Upland and Conservation Concern richness, Joint Models (combining habitat and socio-economic variables) did not outperform single-domain models in predictive power; in some cases, they performed worse.
  - For Total Richness, adding vegetated boundaries (habitat feature) to the joint model offered modest gains, but overall improvements were small and not clearly distinct from random.
- Off-site effects:
  - Some variation in densities on farmland and moorland was better explained by off-site habitat characteristics, indicating cross-habitat and landscape spillover effects.
- Interpretation and policy implications:
  - Property-level variation is driven by a combination of within-field habitat quality and local socio-economic conditions, with landscape context playing a lesser role for these upland systems.
  - Agricultural policy (AES) and broader subsidies impact biodiversity outcomes in nuanced, property-specific ways; simple, uniform policy designs are unlikely to yield uniform biodiversity gains.
  - Biodiversity gains may be more cost-effective when policies account for heterogeneity across farms (costs, incentives, and management capacities) and when potential spatial coordination across farms is leveraged.

## Implications for Monitoring and Policy Design
- Monitoring should capture property-scale heterogeneity in habitat quality, farm practices, and owner/investor socio-economics to predict biodiversity responses accurately.
- Agri-environment schemes (AES) would benefit from designs that:
  - Vary payments by property-specific costs and biodiversity potential.
  - Encourage spatially coordinated actions across neighboring farms to maximize landscape-level benefits.
  - Recognize that different biodiversity metrics (Total vs. upland-specialist vs. Conservation Concern) respond differently to management and socio-economic contexts.
- The study underscores the importance of integrating ecological data with economic and ownership information to inform targeted, cost-effective conservation policies.

## Limitations and Scope for Future Work
- The explanatory power, while meaningful for upland specialists, is limited for total and conservation-concern richness when considering single-domain models.
- Results are region-specific (Peak District) and may vary with landscape, land-use history, and policy context elsewhere.
- Further work could explore more explicit interactions among farm types, landscape-scale coordination, and long-term policy scenarios using coupled ecological-economic models.

## Relevance to Environmental Analytics
- Demonstrates a rigorous, property-level, mixed-methods approach to environmental monitoring:
  - Uses standardized biodiversity metrics aligned with conservation relevance.
  - Integrates habitat, landscape, management, and socio-economic data for comprehensive analysis.
  - Applies information-theoretic model selection to avoid overfitting and to quantify relative importance of diverse drivers.
- Provides actionable insights for designing monitoring programs and policy instruments that reflect heterogeneity across the managed environment.
