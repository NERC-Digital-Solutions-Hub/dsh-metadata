# What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach

## Overview
- Interdisciplinary study investigating how ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic factors at the property level shape avian species richness on upland farms in the Peak District, UK.
- Uses data from 44 farms, collected through ecological surveys and socio-economic questionnaires, to model three measures of richness: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, and Conservation Concern Species Richness.
- Finds habitat quality strongly explains upland specialist richness, while Total and Conservation Concern richness are more influenced by socio-economic factors; landscape context often has limited predictive power.

## Datasets and data descriptions
- Bird survey data
  - Observations on 44 farms, collected during two visits between March 28 and July 5, 2007.
  - Total observed species across farms: 97; upland specialist species: 21; species of Conservation Concern: 43.
  - Response metrics: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, Conservation Concern Species Richness per farm.
- Habitat and environment data (per surveyed fields on each farm)
  - Habitat variables: Intensive grass, Mowed land (silage/hay), Vegetated field boundaries, Tree density, Sheep, Cows, Rush cover, Wet features.
- Landscape context data (500 m around each farm, based on Land Cover Map 2000)
  - Proportions of six habitat types: Moorland, Woodland, Arable, Inland water, Urban/rural developed, Grassland.
- Farm management data (from in-person questionnaires)
  - Farm type (sheep, cattle, or mixed), Rough grazing area, Livestock density (LU/ha), Predator control, Cutting dates, Number of cuts, Fertilizer input (nitrogen per hectare).
- Socio-economic data (from questionnaires)
  - Ownership share, Number of farm workers, On-farm income share, Net farm income, AES payments, Rental value.
- Data processing and derived measures
  - Density of grazing livestock units, nitrogen fertilizer input per hectare (from fertilizer and manure data), number of farm workers (staff plus family), net farm income (income minus variable costs), AES payments, and rental value per hectare.

## Data collection and provenance
- Study area: Peak District National Park uplands; focus on moorland fringe adjacent to moorland blocks.
- Farm selection: 44 farms within 2 km of moorland; 67 farms contacted, 47 visited, 44 included in analyses.
- Methods: standardized bird transects with 200 m spacing from boundaries; two visits per farm; visits timed after sunrise to maximize species encounters.
- Data collection tools: field surveys, farmer interviews, and a structured socio-economic questionnaire.

## Variables and measures
- Four explanatory variable classes used in modeling:
  - Habitat: quantified habitat attributes within surveyed fields (e.g., intensive grass, mowing, hedgerows, trees, rush cover, wet features).
  - Landscape context: external environment around farms (500 m buffer) in terms of habitat composition.
  - Farm management: management practices and inputs (e.g., farm type, grazing intensity, predator control, cutting regime, fertilizer input).
  - Socio-economic: ownership, labour, dependence on farming income, AES uptake, rental values.
- Response variables:
  - Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, Conservation Concern Species Richness.

## Data processing and analysis
- Data transformations
  - Fertilizer input (N per hectare) and livestock densities computed from survey data.
  - Ownership and labour metrics derived from questionnaire responses.
- Modeling approach
  - Generalized linear models (Poisson errors) with multiple variable sets.
  - Information-Theoretic model selection using Akaike Information Criteria (AIC).
  - Model sets built for each response variable with four explanatory classes plus a Joint Model (combining top variables from each class).
  - Random variable added to assess whether explanatory power is significantly different from random noise.
- Key findings from models
  - Habitat variables explain 42% of variation in Upland Species Richness; few upland specialist species as habitat quality increases with more cows and more rush cover, but fewer fields mowed for hay/silage.
  - Habitat variables explain little to none of Total Richness or Conservation Concern Richness (R^2 ≈ 0); many models include random variables, indicating weak predictive power.
  - Landscape context has limited explanatory power for all richness measures.
  - Farm management explains modest variation in Conservation Concern Richness (≈23%), with no single variable outperforming random expectations; overall predictive power remains weak for Total and Upland Richness.
  - Socio-economic factors explain notable variation in Total Richness (≈24%) and Conservation Concern Richness (≈18%), with higher ownership shares and fewer farm workers associated with lower richness; on-farm income alone is not predictive.
  - Joint models (two top variables from each class) offer some gains for Total Richness (notably including vegetated boundaries), but gains are modest and not consistently better than random.
- Interpretation
  - In upland farmland, the presence and richness of upland specialist birds are strongly tied to within-farm habitat quality.
  - Total species richness and species of conservation concern are more strongly linked to socio-economic context and farm-level management not captured by simple habitat measures.
  - Landscape-scale AES uptake and semi-natural surrounding habitats correlate with higher densities of some upland and conservation-concern species, suggesting spatial coordination may matter.

## Data quality, limitations, and uncertainty
- Outliers and data constraints
  - One farm excluded due to extreme size/structure; potential issues with small sample sizes per farm.
- Statistical limitations
  - Some models show weak explanatory power; null models often compete with best models, especially for Total and Conservation Concern richness.
  - Collinearity assessed but not strictly prohibitive; models rely on multiple plausible variable sets.
- Temporal scope
  - Data reflect a two-visit snapshot in 2007; may not capture interannual variability or long-term trends.
- Measurement scope
  - Bird richness as a indicator of biodiversity; some broader biodiversity signals may be missed by focusing on avifauna alone.
- Data confidentiality
  - Farmer identities anonymized in reporting; sensitive socio-economic data require careful handling.

## Data access, ethics, and governance
- Ethics and consent
  - Study approved by university ethics policies; participant anonymity maintained; data anonymization agreed with RELU Data Support Services.
- Data sharing and provenance
  - Supporting Information available (Appendix S1: species lists and statuses; Appendix S2: model parameter estimates).
  - Data archiving referenced with RELU DSS; emphasis on transparent provenance and reproducibility.
- Privacy considerations
  - Farmer-level data are sensitive; anonymization and controlled access recommended for any public data release.

## Implications for data stewardship
- Metadata richness
  - Provide comprehensive metadata detailing farm identifiers (anonymized), survey dates, sampling design, transect methods, and variable definitions.
- Standardized variable definitions
  - Use clear, controlled vocabularies for habitat types, management practices, and socio-economic indicators to enable cross-study interoperability.
- Data versioning and provenance
  - Track data processing steps (derived metrics like LU/ha, nitrogen input) and model configurations to support reproducibility.
- Data access policies
  - Balance openness with privacy; share non-identifiable ecological and aggregated socio-economic data; consider controlled access for sensitive farm-level information.
- Utility for policy and practice
  - Data support evidence that property-scale heterogeneity in socio-economics and habitat management can influence biodiversity outcomes; inform AES design and targeted policy interventions.
- Long-term data strategy
  - Archive data with clear stewardship plans to enable future re-analysis and extension (e.g., coupling ecological and economic models across more regions or time periods).

## Key takeaways for Data Stewards
- Property-scale data combining ecological, habitat, land-use, and socio-economic dimensions are essential to understanding biodiversity responses to management and policy.
- Habitat quality matters for specialist species, while socio-economic context strongly correlates with overall and conservation-concern species richness.
- Comprehensive metadata, transparent data lineage, and careful handling of sensitive socio-economic information are critical for reuse and policy relevance.
- Supporting information (data dictionaries, parameter estimates) greatly enhances reproducibility and secondary analysis opportunities.
