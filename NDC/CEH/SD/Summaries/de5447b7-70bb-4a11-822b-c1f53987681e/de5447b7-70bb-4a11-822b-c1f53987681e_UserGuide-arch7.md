What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach

## Overview
- Investigates factors shaping avian species richness at the property scale on 44 upland farms in the Peak District, UK.
- Uses three richness measures: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, and Species of Conservation Concern (Amber/Red, UK BAP, or SPA features).
- Examines four explanatory variable classes: Habitat, Landscape context, Farm management, and Socio-economic factors; plus a Joint Model aggregating top variables from these classes.
- Applies Information Theoretic model selection (Akaike Information Criteria, AIC) with Poisson Generalized Linear Models; uses 100 randomly generated variables to assess predictive power of variables.
- Data collected from ecological surveys (bird counts on farms and moorland), habitat assessments, and socio-economic questionnaires; landscape context measured within 500 m buffers using Land Cover Map 2000.

## Data and study design
- Study area: Peak District National Park, northern England; 44 farms within 2 km of moorland boundary.
- Bird data: surveys on farms (two visits in spring-summer 2007); species lists compiled; three richness metrics derived.
- Habitat data: farmland fields characterized by intensive grass, mowing for silage/hay, vegetated boundaries, number of trees, rush cover, and wet features.
- Landscape context: proportional cover of six habitat types in a 500 m buffer around each farm (moorland, woodland, arable, inland water, urban/rural, grassland).
- Farm management: farming system, nutrient inputs, livestock numbers, land types, AES-related practices, and predator control.
- Socio-economic: ownership proportion, farm workers, on-farm income, net farm income, AES payments, and rental value.
- Data analysis: GLMs with Poisson errors; separate model sets for Habitat, Landscape context, Farm management, and Socio-economic variables; 5 best-fitting models (one per variable class and a Joint Model) per richness measure; null model and random variable checks to assess significance.

## Key findings by richness type
- Upland Species Richness
  - Habitat variables explain a substantial portion (about 42%) of variation; habitat quality matters.
  - Specific habitat predictors: more cows and higher rush cover associated with more upland specialist species; more fields cut for hay/silage associated with fewer upland specialists.
  - Landscape context provides little explanatory power; null model often best.
- Total Species Richness
  - Habitat variables show limited predictive power; overall R² ~ 0 for Total richness with habitat alone.
  - Landscape context also shows limited predictive power; null model frequently best.
  - Farm management explains modest variation; no single management variable outperforms random expectation; AES-related variables rarely predictive for Total richness.
  - Socio-economic factors explain around 24% of the variation; notable predictors include proportion of farm owned (negative relationship) and number of farm workers (positive relationship). On-farm income and net farm income show weaker or non-significant relationships.
- Conservation Concern Species Richness
  - Habitat effects are weak; habitat variables do not outperform random for this measure.
  - Landscape context provides little explanatory power.
  - Farm management explains some variation (about 23%), but again no individual variable reliably outperforms random; AES-related effects are inconsistent.
  - Socio-economic factors explain some variation (about 18%), with ownership and farm workers among the notable predictors; on-farm income less influential; AES payments not consistently predictive.

## Joint models and relative importance
- Two variables from each class with highest Akaike weights were included in Joint Models.
- Joint Model performance differed by richness type:
  - For Upland Species Richness: Joint Model did not outperform single-class models; best predictions from Habitat alone.
  - For Conservation Concern Richness: Joint Model offered limited improvement and often performed worse than single best models.
  - For Total Species Richness: Joint Model showed some improvement, mainly with habitat variable (proportion of vegetated field boundaries) contributing modestly.
- Overall conclusion: no single variable class dominates; property-scale variation across habitat, management, and socio-economics contributes to biodiversity patterns, but predictive power is sensitive to the richness metric used.

## Implications for policy and management
- Biodiversity outcomes are strongly influenced by property-level variation in habitat quality and socio-economic context, not just landscape-scale factors.
- AES and broader agri-environment policies should account for heterogeneity in property costs, ownership patterns, and management capacities.
- Simple, one-size-fits-all policy design is unlikely to achieve uniform biodiversity gains; targeted, region- and property-specific approaches may be needed.
- Spatial coordination across neighboring farms could enhance biodiversity benefits, but the design must consider potential adverse selection and differing farm incentives.
- When evaluating policy impacts, the choice of biodiversity metric matters; focusing on upland specialists yields different conclusions than focusing on total species richness or conservation-concern species.

## Methodological notes and limitations
- Sample size: 44 farms; results are sensitive to variable definitions and chosen biodiversity metric.
- Some explanatory variables were not stronger than random predictors, indicating uncertainty and the potential influence of unmeasured factors.
- Habitat and socio-economic data were collected contemporaneously; causality cannot be definitively inferred from correlational analyses.
- The use of a random variable as a baseline is a strength for assessing true predictive utility, but also highlights that several associations may be weak or context-specific.

## GIS relevance and practical applications
- Data structure aligns with GIS workflows: parcel-level (farm) units with attached habitat metrics, landscape context within buffers, and socio-economic attributes that can be spatially joined to property polygons.
- Potential GIS uses:
  - Map property-scale habitat quality indicators (e.g., field mowing, vegetated boundaries, tree density, rush cover) to identify upland specialist hotspots.
  - Overlay socio-economic layers (ownership, farm workers) to target conservation incentives where they may be most effective.
  - Visualize landscape-context buffers to evaluate off-site habitat contributions and cross-boundary ecological benefits.
  - Support spatially explicit AES design, balancing biodiversity gains with farm-specific costs and capabilities.
- Caution: interpretation depends on which biodiversity metric is used; policy design should consider multiple indicators to avoid biased conclusions.

## Conclusions
- Property-level variation in habitat quality and socio-economic conditions jointly influence avian diversity on upland farms.
- Habitat quality is a key proximal driver for upland specialists, while total richness and conservation-concern richness are more strongly linked to socio-economic context and variable management effects.
- Landscape-scale context and many farm management variables have limited predictive power when considered in isolation.
- Effective policy design should integrate property-specific habitat and socio-economic factors, allow for spatial coordination where beneficial, and carefully select biodiversity metrics to align with conservation and policy objectives.
