# What explains property-level variation in avian diversity? An inter-disciplinary approach

- Purpose and scope
  - Investigates why avian species richness varies across 44 upland farms in the Peak District by integrating ecological, agricultural, and socio-economic data at the property scale.
  - Distinguishes three richness measures: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, and Conservation Concern Species Richness.

- Data sources and scope
  - Ecological data: bird species observed on each farm (two visits), yielding 97 species across 44 farms; 21 upland specialist species; 43 Conservation Concern species.
  - Habitat data: farmland habitat characteristics (e.g., intensive grass, mowing, vegetated field boundaries, trees, rush cover, wet features) collected within surveyed fields; moorland habitat assessed via 50×50 cm quadrats.
  - Landscape context: proportion of six habitat types (moorland, woodland, arable, inland water, urban/rural developed, grassland) in a 500 m buffer around each farm using Land Cover Map 2000.
  - Farm management and socio-economic data: questionnaire-based data on farm type, stocking, fertilizer, land types, AES prescriptions, predator control, ownership, farm workers, on-farm income, net farm income, AES payments, and rental value.

- Data collection and processing
  - Bird surveys: two visits (Mar–Jul 2007); transects placed 200 m from property boundaries; parallel transects 400 m apart; birds counted when seen/heard within the property (200 m of transect if needed).
  - Habitat surveys: farmland fields characterized for intensive grass, mowing, boundaries, trees, livestock, rush cover, wet features; moorland habitat assessed with standardized quadrats.
  - Curlew behavior: focal observations at five sites during 2008 breeding season.
  - Data transformations: calculated density-based metrics; derived livestock densities (LU/ha), nitrogen fertilizer input per hectare, workforce numbers, net farm income, and AES-related variables; standardization and transformations applied for GLMs.

- Modeling approach
  - Response variables: Total Species Richness, Upland Species Richness, Conservation Concern Species Richness.
  - Explanatory variable classes: Habitat, Landscape context, Farm management, Socio-economic; plus Joint Model combining top predictors from each class.
  - Statistical framework: Generalized Linear Models with Poisson errors; all subsets and Information Theoretic approach (AIC) to identify best-fitting models.
  - Model selection and validation: Akaike weights (k) for variables; inclusion of a random variable to contextualize predictive power; assessment of R^2 and ∆AIC<2 sets; exploration of both individual-class and joint models.

- Key results by richness category
  - Upland Species Richness
    - Habitat variables explained 42% of variation; habitat quality important (fewer upland species where more fields are mowed for silage/hay; more species with more cows; more rush cover).
    - Landscape context had limited explanatory power.
    - Joint models with habitat and other classes improved explanatory power over habitat alone.
  - Total Species Richness
    - Habitat explained little to none of the variation.
    - Landscape context provided minimal predictive power.
    - Socio-economic factors explained about 24% of variation; ownership and proportion of income from farming associated with lower richness; more farm workers associated with higher richness.
    - Farm management explained around 23% but individual variables generally did not outperform random; AES-related variables rarely predicted Total richness.
    - A small improvement in the Joint Model when including vegetated field boundaries, but overall gains were modest.
  - Conservation Concern Species Richness
    - Habitat variables explained about 23% variance; some habitat features related to Conservation Concern species, but not as strongly as for upland specialists.
    - Landscape context offered limited predictive power.
    - Farm management explained about 23% but with strong model uncertainty; no single management variable consistently outperformed random; one signal suggested cattle presence related to higher richness.
    - Socio-economic variables explained about 18% variance (ownership and farm workers important); on-farm income not predictive.
    - Joint models did not outperform single-class models; overall predictive power remained limited.
  - Off-site and landscape-scale effects
    - For some species, off-site habitat characteristics explained portions of their density variation.
    - Proportion of AES-covered, semi-natural landscape surrounding fields tended to be associated with higher densities of some upland specialists.

- Additional insights and nuances
  - The choice of richness metric strongly affects conclusions; results are sensitive to whether Total, Upland, or Conservation Concern richness is analyzed.
  - Many AES-prescribed management actions did not strongly predict overall avian richness, though densities of some Conservation Concern species were higher on fields within AES contexts.
  - Economic and ownership factors (e.g., higher ownership share, more farm workers, on-farm income reliance) showed meaningful associations with biodiversity, indicating socio-economic heterogeneity across farms shapes biodiversity outcomes.
  - Interactions (e.g., between sheep and cattle grazing) did not provide clear support for influencing broad biodiversity patterns.

- Implications for policy, data use, and products
  - Property-level heterogeneity matters: biodiversity outcomes depend on habitat quality, farm management, and the socio-economic context of landowners, not just landscape-scale factors.
  - Agri-environment schemes (AES) design should account for farm-level economic and social variation to improve targeting and effectiveness.
  - More nuanced policy design could include spatially varying payments, cost-conscious incentives, and coordination across neighboring farms to leverage landscape-level benefits.
  - Data products and tools to support data use
    - Property-scale biodiversity dashboards integrating habitat, management, and socio-economic data.
    - Country- or region-specific policy impact dashboards showing trade-offs between farm profitability and biodiversity targets.
    - Model outputs (e.g., predictors and strengths) suitable for informing AES design and targeting.
    - Supporting information (Appendices) with parameter estimates and species lists to enable reuse in subsequent analyses.

- Data quality, limitations, and reproducibility
  - Sample: 44 farms; outlier farm excluded due to size/management differences.
  - Potential limitations: modest sample size for multi-variable modeling; some collinearity among variables; detection biases mitigated by study design (two visits, standardized transects).
  Interpretations depend on the richness metric used; while upland specialist richness showed strong habitat associations, total and Conservation Concern richness were less predictable from measured habitat or landscape variables alone.
