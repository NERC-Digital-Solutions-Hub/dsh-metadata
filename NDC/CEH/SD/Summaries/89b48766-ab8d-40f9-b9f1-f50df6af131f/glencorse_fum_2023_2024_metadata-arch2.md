# Ammonia enhancement data from Glencorse experimental site near UKCEH, Edinburgh (2023-2024)

- Purpose and context
  - Study the effects of high atmospheric ammonia (NH3) on forest vegetation, bryophytes, lichens, and soil.
  - Extension of the 2021–22 study at the Glencorse woodland site (Birch plantation near Edinburgh).

- Location and timeframe
  - Glencorse woodland, near Edinburgh, UK (coordinates 55.8539°N, -3.2151°W; altitude 200 m).
  - Data collected from 1 January 2023 to 31 December 2024, all in GMT.

- Experimental design and NH3 release
  - Ammonia enhancement system controlled by wind conditions below the forest canopy.
  - NH3 released only when wind direction is 275–345 degrees and wind speed is between 0.3–10 m s^-1.
  - NH3 delivered via three parallel 20 m PVC tubes with evenly spaced release holes, fed by a mass flow controller and solenoid valve.
  - Positive pressure airflow is generated by a central fan; NH3 is diluted and released through the tubes.
  - Wind and NH3 release conditions governed by a weather station and the MFC; release reported as 15-minute averages.

- Data collection and parameters
  - Equipment
    - Wind: below-canopy wind speed and direction (WXT536, Vaisala).
    - NH3 release and flow: solenoid valve status, NH3 flow set point, and actual NH3 flow through the MFC.
  - Key measurements (68,396 total measurements)
    - Timestamp (15-minute intervals, GMT)
    - NH3_status (minutes): duration NH3 was released under current conditions
    - NH3_flow_set (slpm): NH3 flow set point for prevailing wind conditions
    - NH3_flow (slpm): actual NH3 flow into release manifold
    - Wind_speed (m s^-1): below-canopy wind speed
    - Wind_direction (degrees)
  - Data structure
    - CSV file with 5 main parameters plus metadata columns (timestamp, instrument, manufacturer, description).

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Visual checks; removal of obvious instrument malfunctions, datalogger issues, and power-cut artifacts.
  - Gaps present due to replacement of faulty gas-control components.

- Data availability and formatting
  - Data provided as a CSV with standardized field descriptions and units.
  - 15-minute timestamping enables consistent temporal analysis and comparability with related datasets.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring analysts
  - Provides a high-resolution, wind-controlled ammonia enhancement dataset suitable for atmospheric deposition and ecosystem impact analyses.
  - Designed for integration with other environmental datasets; supports cross-year comparison (extension of 2021–22 data).
  - Data can support standard monitoring outputs (reports, maps, charts) and be stored within appropriate data portals as part of ongoing monitoring responsibilities.
