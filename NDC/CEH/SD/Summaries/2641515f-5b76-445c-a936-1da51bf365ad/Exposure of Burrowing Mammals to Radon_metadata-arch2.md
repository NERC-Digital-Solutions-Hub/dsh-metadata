# Exposure of Burrowing Mammals to Rn-222 in Northwest England - MATERIALS & METHODS

- Objective and site selection
  - Aim to capture a range of soil gas radon (Rn-222) concentrations using radon potential maps.
  - Seven study sites in northwest England chosen to span radon potential categories from <1% to >30% of homes above the UK radon Action Level (200 Bq m-3).
  - Highest radon potentials located in areas with limestone-type bedrock; site selection based on underlying data from Miles et al. (2007).

- Field site setup and burrow construction
  - Artificial burrows constructed at each site (three replications per site, except Site 1 with one burrow due to shallow soil).
  - Burrow design: ~1.2 m long, 10 cm diameter perforated HDPE pipe buried ~50 cm deep; one end open at ground surface; flap for passive detectors; buried end marked with cane; wire fencing at open end to deter access.
  - Replicates located within ~100 m² area at each site.
  - Field timeline: Sites 1–5 initiated July 2009; Sites 6–7 initiated August–October 2009.
  - Operational issues addressed: one burrow flooded at Site 5 and later relocated at Site 4; rodent damage to detectors mitigated with poultry wire placed either side of the detector.

- Environmental measurements at each site
  - Soil moisture: 0–10 cm soil samples within 2 m of each burrow, dried at 60°C.
  - Soil temperature: Tinytag data loggers placed ~30 cm from the buried end of a burrow, at ~50 cm depth; loggers recorded every 30 seconds and were downloaded during detector changes.

- 222Rn measurements by passive detectors
  - Detectors: Passive solid-state track-etch detectors (PADC/CR-39) from the Health Protection Agency, designed for indoor use but applied here in burrows.
  - Detector design: Diffusion chamber to preferentially measure 222Rn over 220Rn (thoron); moisture-resistant variant with detector sealed in a 200 µm polyethylene bag to limit water ingress while allowing radon diffusion.
  - Handling and QA: Detectors produced from a single batch; stored in ventilated spaces before analysis; some detectors kept as controls.
  - Analysis: Post-exposure detectors scanned with an automated slide-scanner system; results reported as time-integrated radon exposure (kBq 222Rn h m⁻³) and converted to radon concentration (Bq m⁻³) using the known exposure duration.
  - Deployment schedule: Detectors replaced every 4–6 weeks through June 2010.

- 222Rn measurements by instrumentation (active monitoring)
  - Burrow air measurements: 0.8 cm tube inserted ~90 cm into each burrow, connected to AlphaGUARD active radon monitor (flow ~1 L/min); readings taken as repeated one-minute samples and averaged after reaching approximate equilibrium; instrument purged between readings.
  - Additional natural burrows near Site 1 also measured with AlphaGUARD.
  - Soil gas radon measurements around burrows: 0.8 cm tubes driven to ~80 cm depth, soil gas pumped into ZnS-lined Lucas scintillation cells connected to a Pylon AB5 monitor; three one-minute counts per location, background-corrected.
  - Calibration and coordinates: Measurements calibrated via the HPA Fast Radon Exposure Device (FRED) and conducted Oct 2009, around the time of passive detector changes; three sampling locations per artificial burrow (approximately 1 m away, at right angles, and opposite the open end). Some shallower measurements (20–75 cm) due to rock/root obstructions; some sites had limited measurements due to water presence.

- Dosimetric methodology
  - Dose conversion: Adapted whole-body dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) for 222Rn in equilibrium with short-lived daughters (218Po, 218At, 214Pb, 214Bi) using an allometric approach to scale to different wildlife body sizes.
  - Geometries modeled: small rodent (mouse), herbivorous mammal (rabbit), and carnivorous mammal (fox), representing organisms that could inhabit burrows.
  - Equilibrium factor (F): Used an assumed F = 0.8 to account for the non-equilibrium between radon and its progeny; F values for burrows are not empirically established, but literature ranges from outdoor values ~0.4–0.97; rationale and sensitivity discussed.
  - Exposure scenarios: Considered immersion in above-ground air as representative of burrow air exposure; soil immersion and other soil exposure routes were not included in the dose calculations.
  - Calculation approach: Spreadsheet implementation of the Vives i Batlle et al. dosimetric framework, applying parameters for α-energy per Bq (APD), breathing rate allometry, and animal mass to derive dose coefficients.

- Data interpretation and relevance for environmental monitoring
  - Integration of passive and active radon measurements with dosimetric modeling to estimate potential radiation doses to burrowing mammals.
  - Site comparison across a gradient of radon potential enables assessment of environmental health implications and informs monitoring strategies for wildlife exposure in different geological contexts.

- Challenges and mitigation strategies
  - Burrow flooding and relocation of some detectors; repaired with site adjustments.
  - Rodent damage addressed via protective poultry wire around detectors.
  - Terrain obstacles limited depth or number of soil-gas measurements at some burrows.
