# Exposure of Burrowing Mammals to Rn-222 in Northwest England - MATERIALS & METHODS

## Aim and study design
- Investigate radon-222 exposure of burrowing mammals by measuring 222Rn in burrow environments.
- Site selection aimed to cover a wide range of indoor radon potential, using radon potential maps derived from measurements in 460,000 homes.
- Seven northwest England sites chosen to span radon potential from <1% to >30%; high-potential sites located on limestone bedrock.
- At each site (except Site 1), three artificial burrows were constructed to simulate burrow environments; Site 1 had only one burrow due to shallow soil.

## Field sites and burrow construction
- Burrows: about 1.2 m long, 10 cm diameter perforated HDPE pipe buried ~50 cm, with one end open at surface; flap for detector insertion; protected by poultry fencing.
- Replicates: three burrows per site within ~100 m² area.
- Timeline: Sites 1–5 initiated July 2009; Sites 6 and 7 later (Aug and Oct 2009).
- Practical adjustments: one burrow at Site 5 filled with water, later relocated; one burrow at Site 4 relocated due to similar issue.
- On-site soil moisture: 0–10 cm soil samples collected near each burrow at each detector change; soil temperature logged near buried end of a burrow.
- Temperature and moisture logging: Tinytag data loggers placed ~30 cm from a buried end; loggers recorded every 30 seconds.

## 222Rn measurements by passive track-etch detectors
- Detectors: PADC/CR-39 passive detectors from HPA, designed to discriminate 222Rn from thoron; moisture-resistant version used (embedded in 200 µm polyethylene bag).
- Deployment: detectors placed inside buried end of each burrow; stored prior to deployment to limit exposure.
- Analysis: after retrieval, detectors counted with automated slide scanner; results expressed as time-integrated radon exposure (kBq 222Rn h m^-3) and converted to 222Rn concentrations (kBq m^-3) using known exposure times.
- QA: some detectors treated as controls (returned to HPA after storage in field facilities).

## 222Rn measurements by instrumentation (active measurement)
- Direct burrow air measurements with AlphaGUARD active radon monitor (Genitron) using a 0.8 cm diameter sampling tube inserted ~90 cm into each burrow; drift-free readings after equilibration.
- Procedure: repeated 1-minute measurements with purging between readings to return to background.
- Additional measurement at Site 1: three natural burrows measured for comparison.
- Soil gas 222Rn: soil gas drawn from ~80 cm depth using a soil probe and hand pump into Lucas scintillation cells linked to a Pylon AB5 monitor; background-corrected counts converted to Bq m^-3.
- Sampling design: three locations around each artificial burrow (roughly 1 m from detector, at right angles, and opposite the open end); sometimes shallower depths used due to rock/root barriers; some sites had limited measurements (e.g., Site 7 no AlphaGUARD measurements).

## Dosimetric methodologies
- Dose coefficients (DCCs) derived for 222Rn in equilibrium with short-lived daughters (218Po, 218At, 214Pb, 214Bi) using an allometric approach to wildlife breathing and body geometry.
- Geometries modeled: small rodent (mouse), herbivorous mammal (rabbit), carnivorous mammal (fox) to represent underground dwellers.
- Equilibrium factor (F): used to relate measured 222Rn to equilibrium-equivalent concentration; no site-specific F for burrows available. Range of reported outdoor F values (0.4–0.97) informs a chosen F = 0.8 for calculations, with discussion of sensitivity to F.
- Calculations: spreadsheet-based implementation of Vives i Batlle et al. methodology; adjusted α-dose weighting factor to 10 (consistent with wildlife background dose-rate estimates).
- Assumptions: dose assessments based on immersion in above-ground air as representative for burrow air exposure; soil immersion routes not estimated.

## Equilibrium considerations and context
- Acknowledges that indoor human F values differ from outdoor or burrow conditions; no burrow-specific F available.
- Recognizes that radon and daughters may not be in equilibrium in burrow environments; F chosen to reflect relatively higher potential equilibrium in burrow air, with exploration of F’s impact on dose estimates.

## Data collection integration and quality considerations
- Triangulation of methods (passive detectors, active burrow measurements, soil gas) to cross-validate 222Rn levels in burrow environments.
- Regular detector changes every 4–6 weeks; careful logging of dates/times of deployment and retrieval.
- Field challenges documented: rodent damage to detectors, need for protective wire barriers; water intrusion requiring burrow relocation.
- Soil moisture and temperature data accompany radon measurements to enable better interpretation of radon concentration variability.
