# Exposure of Burrowing Mammals to Rn-222 in Northwest England - MATERIALS & METHODS

## Objective and study design
- Select study sites to capture a range of soil gas radon (Rn-222) concentrations using radon potential as a guiding metric.
- Radon potential based on large-scale mapping of indoor radon risk (Miles et al., 2007) from ~460,000 homes.
- Seven sites in northwest England chosen to span radon potential categories from <1% to >30%; higher potentials associated with limestone bedrock at some sites.
- Data intended to understand radon exposure for burrowing mammals and to support dosimetric assessments.

## Field sites and burrow construction
- Three artificial burrows per site (Site 1 exception: only one burrow due to shallow soil).
- Burrow design: about 1.2 m long, 10 cm diameter perforated HDPE pipe buried ~50 cm with one end open at surface; top end flap for detector access; fenced to exclude animals.
- Replicates cluster within ~100 m² area at each site.
- Initiation timing: Sites 1–5 started July 2009; Sites 6–7 later (Aug/Oct 2009).
- Field adjustments: one burrow at Site 5 flooded and relocated; another at Site 4 later relocated due to water.
- Post-construction protocol: detectors inserted ~1 week after burrow construction; soil repacked to original condition after each sampling event.
- Re-sampling: detectors replaced every 4–6 weeks until June 2010.

## Radon measurements by passive detectors (PADC/CR-39)
- Detectors supplied by Health Protection Agency (HPA); diffusion chamber design minimizes thoron entry; moisture-resistant variant used (polyethylene bag enclosing detector).
- Handling: detectors stored in outdoor building or fume cupboard ~3 days before analysis; some acted as controls during storage.
- Analysis: after field deployment, detectors analyzed with automated slide scanner; results expressed as time-integrated radon exposure (kBq 222Rn h m⁻³) and converted to 222Rn concentration (kBq m⁻³) using exposure duration.
- Detector integrity: rodent damage observed in some detectors; mitigated by adding poultry wire around detectors.

## Radon measurements by instrumentation (active monitoring)
- Direct burrow air measurements with AlphaGUARD (Genitron) active instrument for comparison with passive detectors.
- Sampling: 0.8 cm diameter intake tube inserted ~90 cm into burrow; pump at 1 L/min; readings averaged after equilibrium; purged between measurements.
- Site 1 also included measurements in three natural burrows within ~200 m.
- Soil gas radon: additional measurements in interstitial soil pores using 0.8 cm tube to ~80 cm depth; gas pumped into ZnS-coated Lucas scintillation cell linked to Pylon AB5 monitor; counts converted to Bq m⁻³ after background subtraction.
- Depth and site constraints: not all burrows sampled to 80 cm due to rock/root obstruction; some measurements limited by water presence or shallow depths.
- Measurement timing: early October 2009, during detector changeover; some sites not measured with AlphaGUARD due to late establishment (Site 7).

## Ancillary environmental data collected
- Soil moisture: 0–10 cm soil sample near each burrow at each detector change; dried at 60 °C for moisture content.
- Soil temperature: Tinytag data loggers placed ~30 cm from buried end of burrow, at ~50 cm depth; log every 30 seconds; data downloaded in the field.
- Data management: detectors relocated and environmental data linked to corresponding burrows and sampling events.

## Dosimetric methodologies
- Dose calculations adapted from Vives i Batlle et al. (2008): whole-body dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) for 222Rn in equilibrium with short-lived daughters (218Po, 218At, 214Pb, 214Bi) using an allometric approach for breathing rate.
- Formula and parameters: includes α energy per Bq (PDα), unit conversions, radiation weighting for α-rays, animal mass (M), and allometric constants for breathing rate; applied to small rodent (mouse), herbivorous mammal (rabbit), and carnivorous mammal (fox) geometries to represent underground burrow-dwelling organisms.
- Equilibrium factor (F): acknowledges lack of burrow-specific F estimates; outdoor human-related values discussed (typical indoor F ~0.4; outdoor ~0.65–0.97 in varied conditions). For this study, F = 0.8 used in dose calculations; sensitivity discussed.
- Exposure pathways: focused on burrow air exposure; soil immersion and above-ground air immersion considered via existing geometries, with soil exposure routes not explicitly estimated.
- Equilibrium considerations: radon may not be in equilibrium with progeny in burrows; equilibrium factor used to estimate equilibrium-equivalent concentration (EEC) for dose assessment.
- Output: dose estimates for wildlife geometries (mouse-like, rabbit-like, fox-like) using allometric breathing-rate scaling; comparison across species to gauge relative dose implications.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations
- Use of multiple measurement modalities (passive detectors, active monitors, soil gas) to cross-validate radon levels.
- Data gaps due to site-specific issues (flooding, shallow soil, rock/root obstruction) affecting burrow number, depth, and sampling.
- Detector handling and QA: use of control detectors; diffusion design to minimize thoron; moisture-resistant packaging; rodent damage addressed by physical barriers.
- Equilibrium assumptions and F-factor selection introduce uncertainty in wildlife dose estimates; rationale provided and discussed.

## Key outputs and potential data products
- Site- and burrow-level radon concentrations over time from passive detectors.
- Direct burrow air radon concentrations from AlphaGUARD measurements.
- Soil-gas radon concentrations at multiple depths around burrows.
- Complementary environmental variables: soil moisture and soil temperature per sampling event.
- Dose estimates for representative wildlife geometries (mouse, rabbit, fox) to inform risk assessment and ecological implications of burrow radon exposure.
- Datasets enabling exploration of relationships between radon potential categories, measured burrow radon, and resulting dosimetric implications for underground mammals.
