# Exposure of Burrowing Mammals to Rn-222 in Northwest England - MATERIALS & METHODS

- Objective and approach
  - Assess exposure to radon-222 (Rn-222) for burrowing mammals across a range of soil radon potentials.
  - Employ multiple measurement methods (passive detectors, active monitoring, and soil gas measurements) to characterize burrow environments.

- Site selection and radon potential data
  - Seven sites in northwest England chosen to span radon potential from <1% to >30% of homes exceeding the UK Action Level (200 Bq m-3).
  - Radon potential estimates derived from large-scale housing data and mapping work (Miles et al. 2007; Miles & Appleton 2005; Miles et al. 2007).
  - Highest radon potential sites (1, 6, 7) located in limestone-type bedrock areas.
  - Sites selected using the underlying data used to derive radon potential maps.

- Study design and burrow construction
  - At each site, three artificial burrows were constructed (Site 1 had one due to shallow soil).
  - Burrow construction: about 1.2 m long, 10 cm diameter perforated HDPE pipe, buried ~50 cm deep; one end open to surface; flap for detector access; wire fencing to deter animals.
  - Replicates located within ~100 m^2 area per site.
  - Initiation timeline: Sites 1–5 in July 2009; Sites 6–7 in August/October 2009.
  - Burrows disturbed by occasional water ingress; some relocations required; poultry wire added to prevent rodent damage to detectors.

- Data collection cadence and ancillary measurements
  - Passive detectors inserted ~1 week after burrow construction; soil re-packed around burrow after detector placement.
  - Soil moisture sampled near each burrow (0–10 cm) at detector-change times; soil temperature recorded with Tinytag data loggers placed ~30 cm from the burrow end (depth ~50 cm); loggers record every 30 seconds.
  - Detector changes occurred at 4–6 week intervals until June 2010.

- 222Rn measurements by passive detectors
  - Detectors: PADC/CR-39 from Health Protection Agency; diffusion chamber design to selectively measure 222Rn (diffusion half-time ~20 min).
  - Moisture-resistant configuration: detector inside a 200 µm polyethylene bag to permit radon ingress but limit moisture.
  - Post-removal handling: detectors stored in outdoor building or fume cupboard for ~3 days before HPA analysis; some detectors used as controls.
  - Data output: results reported as time-integrated radon exposure (kBq 222Rn h m^-3) and converted to concentrations (kBq m^-3) using exposure duration.

- 222Rn measurements by instrumentation
  - Active radon measurements with AlphaGUARD instrument for burrow air, via 0.8 cm tube inserted ~90 cm into each burrow; air pumped at ~1 L/min; readings averaged after reaching near-equilibrium.
  - Site 1 also measured radon in three natural burrows within ~200 m.
  - Soil-gas radon measurements: 0.8 cm probes driven to ~80 cm depth (sacrificial tip to prevent blockage); soil gas pumped into ZnS-lined Lucas cells connected to a Pylon AB5 portable monitor; background-corrected using standard counts and calibration (FRED).
  - Measurement plan: three locations around each artificial burrow (approx. 1 m away, at right angles, and opposite the burrow opening); depth constraints due to rock/root presence led to variable depths (often 20–75 cm).
  - Completion: measurements conducted in early October 2009 during detector-change days; Site 7 measurements not performed due to late site establishment.

- Data quality, calibration and limitations
  - Detector QA and calibration aligned with HPA standards; several detectors treated as controls.
  - Variability in measurement depth and incomplete soil probe penetration at some burrows due to subsurface conditions.
  - Occasional detector damage from wildlife mitigated with protective wire nets.

- Dosimetric methodology for wildlife dose assessment
  - Dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) adapted for radionuclide exposure of wildlife using Vives i Batlle et al. (2008) allometric approach.
  - Geometries considered: small rodent, herbivorous mammal, and carnivorous mammal (analogous to mouse, rabbit, and fox) representing burrow-dwelling organisms.
  - Equilibrium factor (F) between 222Rn and progeny assessed; F value adopted as 0.8 in dose calculations (range of literature values discussed; sensitivity noted).
  - For dose estimates, above-ground air immersion DCCs were used as representative of burrow air exposure; soil exposure routes were not estimated.
  - Alpha radiation weighting factor updated to 10 (instead of the 20 used in some literature) to align with wildlife dose-rate assessments.
  - Dose rates computed with a spreadsheet implementation of the allometric model, using measured radon concentration, the chosen F, animal geometry, and other constants (e.g., alpha energy per Bq, breathing rate parameters).
