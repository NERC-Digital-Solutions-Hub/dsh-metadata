Exposure of Burrowing Mammals to Rn-222 in Northwest England - MATERIALS & METHODS

## Overview
- Investigates radon-222 exposure of burrowing mammals in northwest England using field measurements and dosimetry.
- Site selection spans a wide range of radon potential, derived from published radon maps to inform monitoring design and interpretation.

## Field Site Selection and Radon Potential
- Seven sites chosen in northwest England to capture variation in indoor radon potential across geology.
- Radon potential categories ranged from <1% to >30% of homes exceeding the UK Action Level (200 Bq m-3); sites 1, 6, and 7 located in limestone bedrock with high potential.
- Radon potential estimates based on data used to derive radon potential maps (Miles et al., 2007).

## Field Methods: Burrow Construction and Sampling Schedule
- Artificial burrows: 1.2 m long, 10 cm diameter perforated HDPE pipe buried ~50 cm; open end at ground surface; a flap at the buried end for detector access; protected with wire fencing.
- Site 1 had only one burrow due to shallow soil; sites 2–7 each had three replicates within ~100 m2.
- Start dates: Sites 1–5 initiated July 2009; Sites 6–7 initiated August/October 2009.
- Detectors installed ~1 week after burrows were constructed; soil repacked to original condition after detector placement.
- Handling challenges: some burrows filled with water requiring relocation; rodent damage to detectors addressed by inserting poultry wire around detectors.

## Radon Measurements: Passive Detectors (PADC/CR-39)
- Use of passive track-etch detectors from HPA, designed for indoor radon but employed here for burrow measurements.
- Moisture-resistant variant with detector inside a 200 µm polyethylene bag; diffusion chamber discriminates against thoron (220Rn).
- Detectors stored publicly in field-building/fume cupboard prior to analysis; processed by automated slide-scanner counting system.
- Results reported as time-integrated radon exposure (kBq 222Rn h m-3) and converted to radon concentration (kBq m-3) using the total exposure time.

## Radon Measurements: Instrumentation (Active Measurements)
- Direct burrow air radon measured with AlphaGUARD active detector; air drawn from ~90 cm depth via 0.8 cm tube at 1 L/min; readings taken repeatedly until approximate equilibrium reached.
- AlphaGUARD measurements purged between readings to reset to background.
- At Site 1, measurements also taken in three natural burrows within ~200 m of artificial burrow(s).
- Soil gas radon concentrations measured around each artificial burrow: 0.8 cm tube to ~80 cm depth; gas pumped to a Lucas scintillation cell connected to a Pylon AB5 monitor; background-corrected counts converted to Bq m-3.
- Three sampling locations per burrow (approximately 1 m from detector, at right angles, and along the burrow axis); depth limitations due to rock/root intrusion; variable sampling depths (often 20–75 cm instead of the full 80 cm).

## Soil Moisture and Temperature Monitoring
- Soil moisture: 0–10 cm soil sample near each burrow, dried at 60°C to determine moisture content.
- Soil temperature: Tinytag data loggers placed within ~30 cm of the buried end of one burrow, recording every 30 seconds; data downloaded during detector changes.

## Dosimetric Methodology
- Dose conversion uses whole-body dose conversion coefficients (DCCs) for 222Rn in equilibrium with short-lived daughters (218Po, 218At, 214Pb, 214Bi) adapted from Vives i Batlle et al. (2008).
- Allometric scaling applied to representative wildlife geometries: small rodent (mouse), herbivorous mammal (rabbit), carnivorous mammal (fox).
- DCCs calculated for three exposure scenarios (immersion in soil, on soil surface, immersion in above-ground air); burrow air exposure is approximated by above-ground air exposure.
- Equilibrium factor F between radon and its short-lived daughters estimated since burrow-specific F is not available; a representative outdoor value set discussed in the text.
- For dose calculations, an equilibrium factor F = 0.8 used; the potential impact of F on dose rates is noted and discussed in the study.

## Data Quality, Governance, and Practical Challenges
- Use of standardized, QA-rated detectors (HPA) with documented calibration and handling procedures.
- Field challenges included water in burrows and rodent damage; mitigated by relocating burrows and adding protective wire.
- Metadata considerations include documenting detector deployment, environmental conditions (moisture, temperature), and sampling locations to support auditability and future reuse of data.

## Policy-Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates a multi-method approach (passive detectors, active measurements, soil gas, environmental data) to monitor wildlife radon exposure, informing risk assessments and management decisions.
- Highlights the importance of data quality, metadata, open reporting, and standardized dosimetric methodology when translating wildlife exposure data into policy-relevant insights.
- Addresses data gaps (e.g., burrow-specific equilibrium factors) and practical field limitations that influence monitoring design and interpretation.
