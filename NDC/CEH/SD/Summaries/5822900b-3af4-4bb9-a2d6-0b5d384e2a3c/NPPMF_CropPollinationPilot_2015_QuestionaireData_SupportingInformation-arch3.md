# NPPMF_CropPollinationPilot_2015_QuestionnaireData

## Overview
- A dataset of responses from 35 recorders about their experiences conducting pollinator surveys on three crops: apples, field beans, and oilseed rape.
- Collectors were based at the University of Reading (RD) and the James Hutton Institute (JHI) in Scotland.
- Respondents included novices, professional researchers, and farmers/agronomists.
- Not all recorders used every method or surveyed all crops.

## Data collection and scope
- Volunteer recorders carried out pollinator survey techniques in flowering crops following detailed written protocols.
- Survey methods implemented: pan trapping, transect walking, hand pollination, and plant bagging.
- Transects: 50-meter length with a moving 1-square-meter observation window beside the recorder.
- Pan traps: three colored water trap arrays along a 50-meter transect; traps assessed at the survey’s end.
- Hand pollination and plant bagging: flowers bagged to exclude visitors, hand pollination performed, and flowers counted/marked (using cable ties).

## Data structure and variables
- Columns include:
  - Crop: crop species surveyed.
  - Site: field site identifiers (RD for Reading, JHI for James Hutton Institute, with a unique field number).
  - Recorder: unique code per recorder (RD or JHI staff).
  - Recorder type:Novice, Research, Farmer/Agronomist.
  - Survey method: specifies the method or “Overall” for the complete survey process.
  - Question: statement being scored.
  - Response: Likert scale options (Strongly agree, Agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Disagree, Strongly disagree).
  - Comments: additional notes supporting the response.
- Notes: Some recorders did not apply all methods or survey all crops.

## Quality and limitations
- Quality Assurance: No explicit QA was performed on the data.
- Implications: Potential issues with data consistency, completeness, and metadata depth; reconciliation of methods across recorders with varying expertise.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks and policy evaluation
- Demonstrates practical challenges in implementing field-based monitoring data collection (varying recorder expertise, protocol adherence, and data documentation).
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Clear, standardized metadata and data governance to enable data sharing and reuse.
  - Metadata completeness to assess data suitability for policy evaluation.
  - Robust QA processes to ensure reliability of environmental health indicators derived from monitoring.
- Provides a framework example for evaluating user experiences and data quality when designing monitoring programs for pollinator and crop health.
