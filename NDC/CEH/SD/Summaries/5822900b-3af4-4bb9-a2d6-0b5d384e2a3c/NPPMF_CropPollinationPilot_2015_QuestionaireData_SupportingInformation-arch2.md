# NPPMF_CropPollinationPilot_2015_QuestionnaireData

- What this dataset represents
  - Responses from recorders about their experience carrying out pollinator surveys on three crops: apples, field beans, and oilseed rape.
  - Data collected from 35 participants based at the University of Reading and the James Hutton Institute in Scotland.
  - Recorders included novice participants, experienced researchers, and farmers/agronomists; not all recorders used all methods or surveyed all crops.

- How the data were collected
  - Volunteer recorders conducted pollinator/pollination service measurement techniques on flowering crops.
  - Recorders were given detailed written protocols for each method and then completed a questionnaire after finishing the methods.

- Survey methods involved
  - Pan trapping: using three coloured water trap arrays along a 50 m transect; recording flying insects caught in traps.
  - Transect walking: a 50 m transect with a 1 m^2 moving observation window to record floral visitors.
  - Hand pollination and plant bagging: placing mesh bags over flowers to exclude visitors, hand pollinating flowers, and counting/marking flowers (using cable ties).

- Data structure and content
  - Key columns include:
    - Crop: crop species surveyed
    - Site: field site; RD (Reading) or JHI (James Hutton Institute) with a unique field number
    - Recorder: unique code for each recorder (RD or JHI)
    - Recorder type: Novice, Research, or Farmer/Agronomist
    - Survey method: indicates the method or whether the question applies to the overall survey process
    - Question: the statement being scored
    - Response: Strongly agree, Agree, Neither agree nor disagree, Disagree, Strongly disagree
    - Comments: additional notes supporting the score
  - Quality Assurance: No specific quality assurance was performed for this dataset.

- Implications for environmental monitoring
  - Provides standardized metadata on who collected data, how it was collected, and the experiential assessments of survey methods.
  - The lack of QA highlights potential data quality considerations when integrating into broader monitoring efforts.
  - Data could be combined with other monitoring datasets to increase value beyond single-use analyses and to improve data transparency and accessibility for broader environmental health assessment and policy evaluation.
  - Outputs from this type of data (reports, maps, charts) can support evaluation of pollination monitoring workflows and method effectiveness across crops. Data management practices would benefit from clear storage and portal upload just as described in standard monitoring workflows.
