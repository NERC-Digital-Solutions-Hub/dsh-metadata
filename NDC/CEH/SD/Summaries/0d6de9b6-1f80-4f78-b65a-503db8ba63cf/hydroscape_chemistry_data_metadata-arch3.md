# Data collection/generation methods

- Study design and sampling scope
  - Targeted freshwater systems: streams and rivers in the English Lake District; lakes/broads sampled in pelagic zones; sampling adapted when boats unavailable (shore sampling 2–5 m from shore).
  - Norfolk Broads: all rivers sampled by boat from well-mixed flow areas.
- Field sampling procedures
  - In-field measurements: water temperature, pH, and electrical conductivity measured on unfiltered samples immediately using handheld probes (WTW 3420 and WTW 340i).
  - Sample filtration: NO3, NO2, NH4, and SRP filtered in the field using 0.45 µm cellulose acetate syringe filters; NO3 isotope samples filtered to 0.2 µm.
  - Sample preservation: all water samples kept on ice during transport; stored at 4°C in the dark (NO3 isotopes frozen at -20°C).
- Laboratory analyses
  - Nutrient concentrations: NO2, NO3, NH4, and SRP analysed colorimetrically with an AQ2 Discrete Analyser.
  - Method specifics:
    - NO2: USEPA 353.2 (sulfanilamide), range 0.01–0.1 mg NO2-N/L.
    - NO3: reduction to NO2 with copperised cadmium coil; range 0.012–2.0 mg NO3-N/L; NO3 calculated by difference.
    - NH4: USEPA Method 350.1, range 0.02–1.0 mg NH4-N/L.
    - SRP: USEPA Method 365.1 (molybdate/ascorbic acid), range 0.005–1.0 mg PO4-P/L.
- Isotope analyses
  - Dual isotope signatures of NO3 (δ15N-NO3 and δ18O-NO3) via the denitrifier method.
  - Interference removal: if NO2 > 0.01 mg NO2-N/L, treated with sulfamic acid.
  - Sample processing: 20 or 10 nmol NO3 converted to N2O depending on concentration; isotopes measured with Isoprime TraceGas system at NEIF, UKCEH Lancaster.
- Quality control and calibration
  - Field blanks included each sampling visit; calibration with externally certified standards.
  - 10% of samples reanalyzed for precision.
  - Isotopic calibrations: δ15N-NO3 with USGS-34 and IAEA-NO-3; δ18O-NO3 with USGS-34, USGS-35, IAEA-NO-3.
  - Standards run in triplicate; environmental samples run in triplicate; target precision: ≤0.2‰ for δ15N-NO3 and ≤0.5‰ for δ18O-NO3.
- Data structure and metadata
  - Datasets comprise 13 headers including: Date_and_time, Sample_ID, Temperature, pH, EC, NO2, NO3, NH4, SRP, δ15N_NO3, δ18O_NO3, Latitude, Longitude (plus other field identifiers).
  - Units:
    - pH: dimensionless (log H+)
    - EC: µS/cm at 25°C
    - Temperature: °C
    - Concentrations (NO2, NO3, NH4, SRP): mg N/L or mg P/L as specified
    - δ15N_NO3: per mil relative to AIR-N2
    - δ18O_NO3: per mil relative to VSMOW
- Data handling and governance notes (implied)
  - Emphasis on sample handling consistency (ice, dark storage) and in-field QC to support data reliability for monitoring frameworks.
  - Detailed methodological documentation facilitates comparability and potential data sharing, with clear unit conventions and calibration standards.
