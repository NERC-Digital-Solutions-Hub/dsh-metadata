# Soil fauna abundance under birch and willow vegetation in girdled and non-girdled plots, subarctic Sweden, 2019

## Overview
- Describes metadata, site description, and methods for a study on soil microarthropod abundances (mesofauna) under birch and willow vegetation in girdled versus non-girdled plots in subarctic Sweden (2019).
- Provides a dataset framework (Primetime_Abisko_2019_Mesofauna.csv) with extensive taxon counts and associated environmental descriptors.
- Focuses on standardized data collection, processing, and identification to enable cross-plot comparisons and monitoring over time.

## Study site and experimental design
- Location: Subarctic Abisko region, Sweden, around the Abisko Scientific Research Station (forest-tundra ecotone).
- Area: 0.88 km² with paired sub-plots for birch forest and willow thickets.
- Target vegetation: Mountain birch (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow (Salix lapponum).
- Plot structure: 5 willow and 6 birch sub-plots, each containing paired sub-plots (identified as B1-6 or W1-5) with similar baseline characteristics (tree/stem density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, understorey).
- Girdling treatment: One sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; girdling specifics differed by species (birch stems girdled around the circumference; willow stems girdled above-ground). Re-sprouts were removed as needed; birch leaves persisted in 2018, willow canopy leaves did not.

## Experimental design and pre-treatment comparability
- Paired-sub-plot design to control for confounding variables.
- Pre-girdling comparisons using paired t-tests showed no significant differences in key characteristics (tree/stem density, canopy height, soil organic carbon stock, soil C:N ratio, soil CO2 efflux) between sub-plots.

## Soil fauna sampling and processing
- Sampling date: July 29, 2019.
- Within each plot: three 4.5 cm diameter soil cores to the depth of the soil horizon (until rock/last clasts) collected from the central 3 × 3 m area for birch plots; willow plots sampled across their area.
- Sample handling: Mineral horizon removed; litter horizon retained and pooled per plot.
- Extraction: Soils and litter were extracted for microarthropods using a Tullgren funnel over 10 days with heat lamps; extracts preserved in 70% ethanol.
- Post-extraction processing: Samples oven-dried at 70°C for 24 hours to determine dry weight; specimens counted and identified.

## Taxonomic identification and data structure
- Identification:
  - Collembola identified to species level using Hopkin (2007) key.
  - Acari identified to order level (Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata).
  - Other invertebrates categorized at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., Diptera, Coleoptera, Araneae).
- Data variables (metadata and counts) include:
  - plot: Pair ID for adjacent plots.
  - vegetation: Dominant vegetation per plot (birch or willow).
  - treatment: Experimental treatment (girdled 'g' or control 'c').
  - layer: Soil layer (litter or organic soil).
  - soil: Dry weight of soil sample (g).
  - taxa counts: Oribatida, Prostigmata, Mesostigmata detritivores, Rhagidiidae, Bdellidae, Trombidae, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Entomobrya nivalis, Isotoma viridis, Isotomidae sp1/sp2, Folsomia quadrioculata (and juveniles), Isotomiella minor, Ceratophysella denticulata, Hypogastrura sp, Parisotoma notabilis, Protaphorura armata, Poduromorpha sp and juveniles, Mesaphorura sp, Anurida sp, Megalothorax minimus, Dycirtoma fusca, Arrhopalithes sp, Sminthurus nigromaculatus, Diptera, Diptera larvae, Coleoptera larvae, Arachnida, Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Coccidae, Annelid, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Psocoptera.

## Data use and monitoring relevance
- Framework supports consistent environmental health assessment by comparing girdled versus control conditions under different vegetation types.
- Standardized sampling, processing, and taxonomic resolution facilitate integration with other environmental monitoring datasets.
- Data collection aligns with monitoring objectives to improve data value and enable broader access to underlying data for policy and research use.
