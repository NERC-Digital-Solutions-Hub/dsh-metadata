# Soil fauna abundance under birch and willow vegetation in girdled and non-girdled plots, subarctic Sweden, 2019

## Metadata overview
- Data file: Primetime_Abisko_2019_Mesofauna.csv
- Key fields: plot (Pair ID for adjacent plots), vegetation (birch or willow), treatment (girdled “g” or control “c”), layer (litter or organic soil), soil (dry weight in grams)
- Taxa counts captured for soil microarthropods and related invertebrates, including Oribatida, Prostigmata, Mesostigmata detritivores, Rhagidiidae, Bdellidae, Trombidae, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Entomobrya nivalis, Isotoma viridis, Isotomidae sp1/sp2, Folsomia quadrioculata (and juveniles), Isotomiella minor, Ceratophysella denticulata, Hypogastrura sp., Parisotoma notabilis, Protaphorura armata, Poduromorpha sp/juveniles, Mesaphorura sp., Anurida sp., Megalothorax minimus, Dycirtoma fusca, Arrhopalithes sp., Sminthurus nigromaculatus, Diptera and Diptera larvae, Coleoptera larvae, Arachnida, and broader groups (Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Coccidae, Annelid, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Psocoptera) among others
- Data describe abundance counts across multiple taxa in two horizons (litter and organic soil) and can be linked to plot, vegetation type, and girdling treatment

## Study site and experimental design
- Location: Subarctic Sweden, around the Abisko Scientific Research Station (coordinates ~68°18′N, 18°49′E; ~600 m a.s.l.)
- Vegetation and habitat: Mountain birch forest and willow thickets, with birch plots larger than willow plots to accommodate girdling
- Plot setup: 5 willow and 6 mountain birch plots established in early June 2017, each with paired sub-plots (B1-6 and W1-5)
- Pairing criteria: Pairs selected to balance tree/stem density, canopy height, soil organic carbon stock, soil C:N, and understorey characteristics
- Girdling treatment: One sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; birch girdling removed 4–8 cm of bark around the circumference down to xylem, ~30 cm above ground; willow girdling performed ~10–20 cm above ground
- Post-treatment canopy response: Birch leaves remained through 2017 and fully leafed out in 2018; girdled willow canopies failed to produce leaves in 2018
- Edge and spacing considerations: Birch sub-plots circular with 10 m radius; willow sub-plots 2 m radius with trenching and plastic sheet to prevent root intrusion from adjacent plants; plots separated by 10–20 m (within pairs) and 300–1100 m (between pairs)
- Pre-treatment comparability: Paired T-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences in plot characteristics such as tree density, canopy height, soil C stocks, soil C:N, or CO2 efflux

## Soil fauna sampling and laboratory identification
- Sampling date: July 29, 2019
- Sampling design: Within each plot, three 4.5 cm diameter soil cores collected from the central 3 × 3 m area of birch plots and across willow plots; cores were extracted down to the soil horizon until rock or last clasts encountered
- Sample processing: Mineral horizon removed; litter horizon pooled per plot; cores placed in plastic rings to preserve soil structure; samples processed with a Tullgren funnel extractor
- Extraction and preservation: 22 soil and 22 litter samples were extracted for 10 days under heat lamps; material dried at 70°C for 24 hours and weighed; fauna preserved in 70% ethanol
- Identification: Collembola identified to species level using Hopkin (2007) key; Acari (Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata) identified to order level; other invertebrates identified to higher taxonomic levels (e.g., Diptera, Coleoptera, Araneae)
- Outcome: Quantitative counts of soil fauna linked to plot, vegetation, layer, and soil weight, enabling comparisons across girdling treatment and vegetation type

## Data structure and potential products
- Data structure supports analyses of how girdling and vegetation type affect soil microarthropod abundance across litter and organic soil horizons
- Potential products for end users:
  - Interactive dashboards and self-service reports showing taxa abundance by plot, treatment, vegetation, and soil layer
  - Summary charts of key taxa across girdled vs. control within birch and willow contexts
  - Data provenance visuals linking sampling dates, plot design, and laboratory workflow
  - Data quality notes and metadata documentation to facilitate reuse and integration with related Abisko study datasets

## Notes and considerations
- The girdling experiment aimed to decouple below-ground carbon processes from above-ground responses, with evidence of differential canopy recovery between birch and willow
- Sampling design includes measures to minimize bias (central sampling area, randomization in extraction, and pre-treatment comparability checks)
- The dataset provides rich cross-taxa counts and detailed metadata to support data-intensive analyses and product development for data exploration and sharing
