  - soil: Dry weight of soil sample (g)
  - taxa counts: oribatida, prostigmata, mesostigmata_detritivores, rhagidiidae, bdellidae, trombidae, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Entomobrya nivalis, Isotoma viridis, Isotomidae sp1/sp2, Folsomia quadrioculata (and juveniles), Isotomiella minor, Ceratophysella denticulata, Hypogastrura sp, Parisotoma notabilis, Protaphorura armata, Poduromorpha sp/juveniles, Mesaphorura sp, Anurida sp, Megalothorax minimus, Dycirtoma fusca, Arrhopalithes sp, Sminthurus nigromaculatus, Diptera, Diptera larvae, Coleoptera larvae, Arachnida, Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Coccidae, Annelid, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Psocoptera.
- Taxonomic resolution notes: Collembola identified to species level using Hopkin (2007); Acari to order level; other invertebrates to higher taxonomic levels.

## Site selection and experimental design
- Location: Around the Abisko Scientific Research Station, Sweden (forest–tundra ecotone; ~68°18′ N, 18°49′ E; ~600 m a.s.l.).
- Plots and pairing: 5 willow and 6 mountain birch plots (0.88 km² area), with paired sub-plots (B1–B6, W1–W5) matched for similar tree density, soil C stocks, soil C:N, and understorey characteristics.
- Plot geometry: Birch plots around 10 m radius; willow plots around 2 m radius; central measurement area within each pair.
- Edge management: Willow plots trench-cleared with plastic sheet to depth until rocks to prevent root intrusion; birch plots not trenched due to buffering sufficiency.
- Girdling treatment: One sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; girdling details:
  - Birch: girdled all stems >1 cm diameter within central 10 m radius; 4–8 cm bark removed to xylem ~30 cm above ground.
  - Willow: girdled all stems ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouts removed.
  - Leaves: birch re-leafed in spring 2018; girdled willow did not produce leaves in 2018.
- Experimental unit and pre-treatment equivalence: Paired t-tests showed no significant pre-girdling differences in canopy height, tree density, soil organic carbon stocks, soil C:N, or soil CO2 efflux between sub-plots.

## Data collection and processing (soil fauna)
- Sampling: July 29, 2019; three 4.5 cm diameter soil cores per plot down to horizon (central 3 × 3 m area for birch; across willow plots).
- Sample handling: Mineral horizon removed; litter horizon retained and pooled per plot; cores placed in rings to preserve soil structure.
- Extraction: Tullgren funnel fauna extraction; 22 soil and 22 litter samples run for 10 days under heat lamps; fauna collected in ethanol.
- Post-processing: Samples oven-dried for 24 hours at 70 °C and weighed; fauna preserved in 70% ethanol.
- Identification: Collembola identified to species level (Hopkin 2007); Acari identified to order level; other invertebrates identified to higher taxonomic levels as applicable.

## Data quality, provenance and documentation
- Documentation supports reproducibility: explicit methods, dates, and locations enable replication of sampling and processing.
- Taxonomic references and keys specified for identifications.
- Data processing steps include drying weights and standardized extraction procedures; potential for downstream QA/QC as part of data sharing.

## Data governance, sharing and availability
- Data stewardship practices referenced:
  - Consideration of data availability and sharing limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes).
  - Uploads to relevant portals and catalogues; documentation of work performed on datasets.
  - Emphasis on ensuring data provenance and metadata quality to enable discovery and reuse.
- Taxonomic and methodological metadata enhance interoperability and reuse across datasets and platforms.

## Challenges and considerations for data stewards
- Aligning user needs with dataset design to ensure usability (potentially adopting a publishing mindset).
- Ensuring standardization across datasets with diverse systems/formats and large volumes.
- Managing updates and ongoing data governance, including metadata accuracy and versioning.
- Handling incomplete information about user requirements and ensuring timely data delivery.
- Navigating potential edge cases from edge-effect mitigation (e.g., trenching in willow plots) and maintaining consistency in documentation.

## Reproducibility and intended use
- Detailed experimental design, girdling methodology, sampling scheme, and taxonomic identification approach documented to support reuse in related ecological and soil-fauna studies.
