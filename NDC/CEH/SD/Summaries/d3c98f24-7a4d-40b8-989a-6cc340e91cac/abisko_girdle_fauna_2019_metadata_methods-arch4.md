# Metadata, site descriptions and methods for 'Soil fauna abundance under birch and willow vegetation in girdled and non-girdled plots, subarctic Sweden, 2019'

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes metadata and methods for a study comparing soil microarthropod abundance (mesofauna) in girdled versus non-girdled plots within birch and willow vegetation types in subarctic Sweden.
  - Provides dataset structure (Primetime_Abisko_2019_Mesofauna.csv) and associated taxonomy and measurement details.

- Datasets and variables
  - Primary data file: Primetime_Abisko_2019_Mesofauna.csv.
  - Core fields (examples): plot, vegetation, treatment (girdled or control), layer (litter or organic soil), soil (dry weight in grams).
  - Taxa counts captured per plot and layer, including but not limited to: Oribatida, Prostigmata, Mesostigmata detritivores, Rhagidiidae, Bdellidae, Trombidae, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Entomobrya nivalis, Isotoma viridis, Isotomidae sp1/sp2, Folsomia quadrioculata (and juveniles), Isotomiella minor, Ceratophysella denticulata, Hypogastrura sp, Parisotoma notabilis, Protaphorura armata, Poduromorpha sp/juveniles, Mesaphorura sp, Anurida sp, Megalothorax minimus, Dycirtoma fusca, Arrhopalithes sp, Sminthurus nigromaculatus, Diptera, Diptera larvae, Coleoptera larvae, Arachnida and higher taxonomic groupings (e.g., Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Coccidae, Annelid, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Psocoptera).
  - Taxonomic resolution: Collembola identified to species level using Hopkin (2007) key; Acari to order level; other invertebrates to higher taxonomic levels.
  - Sampling and measurement details tied to each plot, including soil/core weights, and counts of multiple taxa.

- Experimental design and site context
  - Location: girdling experiment near the Abisko Scientific Research Station, Sweden (68°18 N, 18°49 E; ~600 m asl) in a forest–tundra ecotone.
  - Vegetation types: mountain birch forest (Betula pubescens ssp czerepanovii) and willow thickets (Salix lapponum).
  - Plot structure: 0.88 km² area with 5 willow and 6 birch plots; each plot subdivided into paired sub-plots (B1-6, W1-5).
  - Pre-treatment matching: pairs chosen for similarity in tree/stem density, soil carbon stocks, soil C:N, and understory composition.
  - Girdling treatment: one sub-plot per pair girdled between 12–15 June 2017; girdled birch stems >1 cm diameter with bark removed down to xylem; girdled willow stems ~10–20 cm above ground. Re-sprouting shoots removed as observed.
  - Edges and buffering: birch plots allowed larger central measurement area with a 10 m radius; willow plots required trenching and plastic sheets to prevent root ingress from adjacent plants.
  - Pre-girdling checks: paired t-tests showed no significant pre-treatment differences between sub-plots.

- Soil fauna sampling and laboratory methods
  - Sampling date: 29 July 2019.
  - Sampling design: three soil cores (4.5 cm diameter) per plot, reaching depth to soil horizon until rock/last clasts; central 3 x 3 m area used for birch plots.
  - Sample processing: litter and mineral horizons separated; cores placed in tight rings to preserve structure; samples extracted using a Tullgren funnel for 10 days under heat lamps.
  - Post-processing: samples dried (70 °C) for 24 hours, weighed to determine soil dry weight; fauna preserved in 70% ethanol; counted and identified under a dissecting microscope.
  - Identification scope: Collembola to species level (Hopkin 2007 key); Acari to order level; other invertebrates identified to higher taxonomic levels (e.g., Diptera, Coleoptera, Araneae).

- Data management, standards, and discoverability
  - Metadata accompanies the dataset to document plot characteristics, treatments, vegetation, soil layer, and sampling protocol.
  - Clear coding in data files: girdled (g) and control (c) designations for treatment.
  - Documentation supports reproducibility of the study design, sampling, extraction methods, and taxonomic identification workflow.

- Implications for data strategy and governance
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data capture from field design through laboratory processing to taxonomic quantification.
  - Highlights the importance of paired experimental design and pre-treatment equivalence for evaluating treatment effects on soil biota.
  - Emphasizes comprehensive metadata and standardized identification keys to enhance data discoverability, interoperability, and reuse across networks studying soil fauna responses in subarctic ecosystems.
