# Soil fauna abundance under birch and willow vegetation in girdled and non-girdled plots, subarctic Sweden, 2019

## Objective and scope
- Evaluate how girdling (removal of phloem connection) affects soil microarthropod communities under birch and willow vegetation.
- Provide a data-rich basis for monitoring ecosystem responses to tree/vegetation manipulation and associated below-ground processes in a subarctic context.

## Study design and site description
- Location: Abisko region, Sweden, near the Abisko Scientific Research Station (forest-tundra ecotone), 68°18 N, 18°49 E, ~600 m asl.
- Plots: 11 total—6 mountain birch (Betula pubescens) plots and 5 willow (Salix lapponum) plots within a 0.88 km² area.
- Pairing and baselines: Each plot had paired sub-plots (Birch: B1–B6; Willow: W1–W5) matched for tree density, soil carbon stocks, soil C:N, and understorey composition; pre-girdling differences tested with paired t-tests showing no significant differences.
- Treatments: One sub-plot per pair girdled (g) between 12–15 June 2017; control (c) sub-plots remained intact.
- Girdling details: Birch stems >1 cm diameter girdled around the circumference to interrupt phloem; willow stems girdled ~10–20 cm above ground; resprouts removed as observed; birch retains leaves in 2018, willow canopy leaves failed to develop after girdling.

## Sampling and laboratory methods
- Soil fauna sampling: 29 July 2019 across all plots.
- Soil cores: Three 4.5 cm diameter cores per plot down to horizon depth; central 3 m × 3 m area for birch; litter and mineral horizon separated and pooled per plot.
- Extraction and processing: Tullgren funnels used for 10 days to extract fauna into ethanol; samples dried (70 °C, 24 h) and weighed; preserved in 70% ethanol.
- Identification and counts: 
  - Collembola identified to species level using Hopkin (2007) key.
  - Acari (mites) identified to order level (Oribatida, Mesostigmata, Prostigmata).
  - Other invertebrates grouped at higher taxonomic levels (e.g., Diptera, Coleoptera, Araneae).
- Dataset: Metadata describes variables; primary data file labeled Primetime_Abisko_2019_Mesofauna.csv.

## Metadata structure and data governance
- Variables include: plot, vegetation, treatment, layer (litter vs organic soil), soil (dry weight), and counts for numerous taxa (e.g., Oribatida, Prostigmata, Mesostigmata detritivores, Rhagidiidae, Bdellidae, Trombidae, Lepidocyrtus lignorum, Entomobrya nivalis, Isotoma viridis, Isotomidae sp1/sp2, Folsomia quadrioculata and juveniles, Isotomiella minor, Ceratophysella denticulata, Hypogastrura sp., Parisotoma notabilis, Protaphorura armata, Poduromorpha sp/juveniles, Mesaphorura sp., Anurida sp., Megalothorax minimus, Dycirtoma fusca, Arrhopalithes sp., Sminthurus nigromaculatus, Diptera and Diptera larvae, Coleoptera larvae, Arachnida, Thysanoptera, Staphylinidae, Coccidae, Annelid, Hymenoptera, Homoptera, Psocoptera).
- Metadata availability and definitions are explicitly provided to facilitate data reuse, comparability, and transparency in monitoring contexts.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured approach to monitoring ecological responses to a management-like manipulation (girdling) across vegetation types, including:
  - Clear experimental design (paired sub-plots, pre- and post-treatment considerations).
  - Robust sampling protocol (replicated cores, central measurement area, litter vs soil horizons).
  - Comprehensive taxonomic resolution for key microarthropod groups, enabling indicator-based assessments.
  - Quantitative data useful for assessing policy-relevant outcomes such as below-ground biodiversity responses and potential implications for soil processes.
- Aligns with monitoring challenges by providing metadata and standardized methods to facilitate data sharing, integration, and governance, while highlighting practical barriers like data access, metadata quality, and data transformation needs.

## Key data gaps and practical considerations
- While the study provides detailed methods and metadata, combining these data with other sites or time points would require harmonized metadata and consistent measurement units.
- Data sharing and governance considerations are addressed through explicit metadata descriptions and dataset structure, illustrating steps necessary to ensure openness while maintaining data quality.
- Translating taxa counts into policy-relevant indicators will require clear aggregation rules and baseline comparisons across vegetation types and girdling treatments.
