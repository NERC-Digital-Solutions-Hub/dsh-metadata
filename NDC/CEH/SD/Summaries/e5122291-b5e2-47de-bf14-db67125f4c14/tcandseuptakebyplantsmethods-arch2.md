# Tc and Se Uptake By Higher Plants - Meta Data

## Objective and Scope
- Describes a study to measure uptake of technetium-99 (Tc) and selenium-75 (Se) by higher plants.
- Involves 61 species, each with 5 replicate plants, grown in randomized blocks.
- Species chosen to represent three major clades of the APGIII angiosperm phylogeny (labeled a, b, and c in accompanying materials).

## Experimental Setup
- Pots: 12 cm with saucers.
- Medium: Levington's F2S compost (peat-based) with lime (dolomite) and ammonium sulfate (~3%).
- Growth conditions: supplementary lighting and heating; watered to field capacity.
- Plant growth stage: batches grown until the exponential phase.

## Sampling and Growth Design
- Hierarchical sampling: species represented in blocks; randomised block design.
- The study aims to standardise data collection across multiple species and replicates.

## Radiolabeling and Measurement
- Radiolabeling: 25 mL solution containing 107 kBq 99Tc/L and 95 kBq 75Se/L spread onto the compost surface.
- Mean activity in compost: 99Tc = 17.8 kBq/kg; Se = 15.8 kBq/kg.
- Harvest: after 48 hours, above-ground shoot material collected and dried.
- Sample processing: 0.1 g digested in 5 mL nitric acid and 5 mL H2O2 until reaction ceased.
- Counting: gamma emissions for 75Se and beta emissions for 99Tc counted after digestion.
- Decay correction: counts for 75Se gamma emissions decay-corrected to the labeling date.

## Data and Metadata
- Data file: TcAndSeUptakeByPlantsData.
- Key columns and meanings:
  - Block: species grown together in random block design.
  - CPM1 beta: counts per minute of beta emissions from Tc-99.
  - CPM1 gamma: counts per minute of gamma emissions from Se-75.
  - Decay corrected: counts per minute of Se-75 decay-corrected to the time of labeling.

## Data Quality and Accessibility
- Data collection uses standardized methods and a clear, replicable protocol.
- Outputs are presented in clear formats (e.g., counts, decay corrections) and designed to be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, facilitating reuse and cross-study comparisons.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring
- Provides a structured, quantifiable approach to assessing how plants uptake radioactive tracers, informing environmental health assessments and policy performance.
- Enables comparisons across a wide range of species and phylogenetic groups, contributing to monitoring datasets and environmental risk evaluations.
