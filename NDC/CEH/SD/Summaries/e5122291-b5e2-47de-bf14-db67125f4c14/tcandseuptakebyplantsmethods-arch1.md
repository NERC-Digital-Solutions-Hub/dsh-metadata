# Tc and Se Uptake By Higher Plants - Meta Data

- 61 species, each with 5 replicate 12 cm pots in randomized blocks.
- Growth medium: Levington's F2S compost (Sphagnum peat-based) with lime and ammonium sulphate; pH ~6.2; inorganic nutrients (P ~50 mg/L, K ~50 mg/L, nitrate ~10 mg/L).
- Experimental design focused on three major APGIII angiosperm clades, labeled a, b, and c in a reference file TcAndSeUptakeByPlantsSpeciesSampling.
- Plants grown in batches until exponential growth phase.

- Radiolabelling: 25 mL solution containing 107 kBq/L Tc-99 and 95 kBq/L Se-75 applied on the compost surface; mean activity concentrations in compost were 17.8 kBq/kg for Tc-99 and 15.8 kBq/kg for Se-75.
- After 48 hours, above-ground shoots were harvested, dried, and digested (0.1 g of tissue in 5 mL HNO3 and 5 mL H2O2).

- Measurement: gamma emissions counted for Se-75 and beta emissions counted for Tc-99 using scintillation; counts decay-corrected to the labelling date for Se-75 data.

- Data file: TcAndSeUptakeByPlantsData
  - Key columns explained:
    - Block: the random block in which species were grown together.
    - CPM1 beta: counts per minute from Tc-99 beta emissions.
    - CPM1 gamma: counts per minute from Se-75 gamma emissions.
    - Decay corrected: counts per minute for Se-75 decay-corrected to the labelling date.

- Purpose: facilitate analysis of Tc and Se uptake by higher plants, enabling correlation checks and potential modeling of uptake patterns across species and clades.
