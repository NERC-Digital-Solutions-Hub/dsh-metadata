# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and framework
  - A collaborative program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data to monitor annual butterfly population status across the UK since 1976.
  - Provides data to understand biodiversity trends and inform policy questions; currently involves over 2,500 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to produce national indicators.

- Data collection methods
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m width, weekly counts (up to 26 per year) from April to September; ~2,000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–3 visits per year (July/August emphasized) to sample common habitats; ~750 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) derived from counts rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with site-year weighting based on survey effort relative to species flight periods.
  - All season counts (Pollard walks, WCBS, reduced surveys) are used to model seasonal count patterns and extrapolate gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.
  - Data are retained and updated to support long-term trend assessments and policy analysis.

- Quality control and validation
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalous counts and out-of-season records; regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
  - Additional validation checks address species distribution (against known ranges), fly periods, first records at sites, and unusual abundances.
  - Data corrections are made through queries and coordination with coordinators/recorders when needed.

- Data download and data fields
  - The download provides long- and short-term trends for all species with sufficient data, in CSV format.
  - Key columns include COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS; F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P (overall trends); F_TRENDETAIL; F_FULL_R; and 10/20-year trend metrics (T10/LIN_B, etc.) with corresponding SE, P-values, trend detail, and R-change.
  - Trends cover the full series from 1976 (or later start years where data are insufficient initially) and include last 10-, 20-year perspectives.
  - Descriptions accompany slope metrics to classify trends (rapid decline/increase, stable) based on P-values.

- Licence and attribution

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Uses standardized, quality-controlled data from multiple sampling schemes to produce comparable trend indicators.
  - Supports cross-method integration for robust environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
  - Provides clear metadata and documentation on data fields, trends, and licensing to facilitate reuse and collaboration.
