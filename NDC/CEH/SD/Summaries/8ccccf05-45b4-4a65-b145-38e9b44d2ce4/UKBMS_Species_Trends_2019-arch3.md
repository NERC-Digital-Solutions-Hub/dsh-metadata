# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and context
  - Provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform policy questions related to biodiversity status and trends.
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Recognizes volunteers’ contributions as essential to data collection.
  - Data underpin understanding of insect population changes and support policy evaluation and future decisions.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts from April to September (up to 26 counts/year), ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel 1 km transects with 2–3 visits per year, samples common habitats; ~750 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
  - Data cover all methods and are analyzed together to produce comprehensive trend indicators.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
  - Trends across species calculated using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting that accounts for how much of the flight period was surveyed at each site/year.
  - Seasonal patterns are estimated from all counts, including gaps, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker software, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks identify potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, flights outside known periods); regional coordinators perform validation.
  - Further automated and manual validation checks include range/distribution checks against BNMs data, flight-period alignment, new site records, and abnormal abundances.
  - Corrections and edits performed through queries and coordination with coordinators or recorders.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for all species with sufficient data, in a CSV file.
  - Long-term trends span from 1976 to the present (start year varies by species due to data availability).
  - Columns include:
    - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS
    - F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDETAIL, F_FULL_R
