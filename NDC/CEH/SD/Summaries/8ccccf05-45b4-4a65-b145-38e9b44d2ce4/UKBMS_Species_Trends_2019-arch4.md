# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, forming a long-running, site-based monitoring program that informs biodiversity status and trend policy questions.
- Data cover annual butterfly population status across the UK, using a multi-method sampling framework and over 2,500 active sites per year.
- The scheme integrates data from:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route counts 2–4 km long, weekly 26 counts per year, ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1 km squares, two parallel transects per square, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits), ~750 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
- Data, methods, and outputs are designed to support understanding changes in butterfly populations and biodiversity policy-relevant questions.

## Nature of data collected and trend analysis

- UKBMS produces abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes. Indices reflect a consistent proportion of butterflies present at a site, with detection varying by species.
- Trend calculation uses the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- All sampling methods contribute to collated species indices, balancing observed data against extrapolated data to address gaps.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag data issues (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods). Regional transect coordinators review data for questionable records, supported by ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Additional automated and manual validation checks assess distribution ranges, flight periods, first-site records, extreme abundances, and year-to-year differences. Corrections are made via queries and coordinator/record keeper input.
