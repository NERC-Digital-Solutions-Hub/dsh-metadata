# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Organisers and funding: Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC); extensive voluntary data contribution.
- Purpose and scope: annual population status of butterflies across the UK via a large-scale, site-based monitoring program; currently 2,500+ actively recorded sites each year; data from multiple sampling methods are analyzed together to inform biodiversity policy and status assessments.

## Data collection methods

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide belt, all species recorded weekly (up to 26 counts/year) from April to September; ~2,000 sites sampled annually.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year (plus encouraged spring visits); ~750 squares sampled annually.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and other methods (eggs/larval webs) focusing on specific species or life stages.
- Integrated data: all sampling methods contribute to a unified UKBMS dataset used for trend analyses.

## Nature of data and trend analysis

- Abundance indices: relative measures (not absolute counts) derived from transect counts; indices reflect proportion observed and relate to independent population measures.
- Trend construction: Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed to emphasize observed data over extrapolated data; uses all seasonal counts to model expected patterns and fill gaps.
- Output: long-term and recent trends (e.g., last 10, 20 years) for species with sufficient data; data presented as a CSV download with detailed statistical columns.

## Quality control

- In-field data capture: standard forms; online entry via UKBMS portal or Transect Walker; automatic and manual validation.
- Regional checks: regional transect coordinators review records for plausibility and consistency; continuous season-long validation.
- Automated/ manual validation: queries detect out-of-range records, flights outside known periods, first-time site records, extreme or unusual abundances; edits made as needed to ensure data integrity.

## Details of this data download

- Contents: long-term and short-term trends for species with adequate data, provided as a CSV (.csv).
- Timeframe: from 1976 to the year indicated in the file name (some species start later due to data availability).
- Column descriptions include common/scientific names, years of series, slope estimates (linear changes per year) with standard errors and p-values, trend narrative, and percentage change metrics for the full series, last 20, and last 10 years (with corresponding descriptive trend fields).
