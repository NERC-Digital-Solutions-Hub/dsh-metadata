# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and governance
  - A large-scale, funding-partnered scheme (Butterfly Conservation, UKCEH, British Trust for Ornithology, Joint Nature Conservation Committee) organized to monitor butterfly populations across the UK.
  - Relies on voluntary data contributions; aims to support biodiversity status and trend policy questions.
  - Data are managed to enable discovery, use, and governance across multiple datasets and sites (over 2,500 active sites annually).

- Data coverage and structure
  - Annual, site-based monitoring with multiple sampling components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) across habitats.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits/year.
    - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
  - Data are combined across methods to produce species-level abundance indices (relative measures of population size).
  - Long-running dataset dating back to 1976, with governance for data updates and ongoing site participation.

- Data collection and methods
  - Field data collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker software; uploaded to central database.
  - Weather conditions and habitat/management units recorded to support comparability.
  - Indices are derived from counts within transects/sites; used to model seasonal patterns and estimate annual and multi-year trends.

- Data quality and governance
  - Multi-layered validation:
    - Automated checks in data entry and Transect Walker.
    - Regional transect coordinators review and validate records.
    - Additional automated and manual validation to flag out-of-range records, records outside flight periods, new site records, and unusual abundances.
  - Data integrity maintained through corrections and coordinated discussions with coordinators or recorders.
  - Data provenance includes site, method, and survey timing to support reproducibility and governance.

- Access, format, and usage
  - Data downloads provided as comma-separated value (.csv) files containing long- and short-term trends for species with sufficient data.
  - Columns include species name (common and scientific), years, slope and error metrics, trend details, and percentage changes over various time windows (all years, last 20, 10 years).
  - Data are stored in a centralized UKBMS database with web access for data entry and extraction.

- Licensing and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for data use and reuse.
  - Requires proper citation (including DOI) in publications using the data.
  - Attribution statement to be included with outputs: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, UKCEH, BTO, JNCC.

- Collaboration and contact
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset interpretation and potential co-authorship.

- Relevance for data governance
  - Demonstrates structured data lifecycle: collection, quality control, integration across methods, and formal licensing.
  - Highlights the importance of standardized workflows, metadata clarity, and clear attribution for discoverability and reuse.
  - Provides a model for managing large, multi-method biodiversity datasets with ongoing updates and collaboration opportunities.
