# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- It provides annual, site-based butterfly population status data across the UK since 1976, currently monitoring over 2,500 active sites each year.
- Data from multiple sampling methods are analysed together to understand changes in butterfly populations and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Purpose and scope

- Produces abundance indices (relative measures) to track population trends rather than absolute counts.
- Indices are designed to reflect a constant proportion of the population, though detectability varies by species.
- Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with weighting that emphasizes observed data according to the surveyed flight period at each site.
- The scheme combines counts from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and the WCBS to estimate seasonal patterns and account for gaps in recording.

## Data collection methods

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (ideally 26 per year) across 2000 sites.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1-km squares, two parallel 1-km transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August), around 750 squares per year.
- Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods such as timed counts and egg/larval web counts focused on particular species or life stages.
- Transects record all butterfly species within a 5 m band along the route; surveys run during suitable weather for butterfly activity.

## Data processing and trend analysis

- Population trends are derived from abundance indices (relative abundance) rather than absolute numbers.
- The collated indices for each species use the Generalised Abundance Index approach with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed.
- All seasonal counts across methods are used to model the annual seasonal pattern and to extrapolate for gaps, with weighting favoring observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online or via a bespoke program (Transect Walker) into a central database.
- Automated checks flag unusual counts or records outside known flight periods; regional transect coordinators review data.
- Ongoing validation includes automated and manual checks for out-of-range records, records outside known distribution, rare events, new site records, or atypical abundances; corrections are made via queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders.
