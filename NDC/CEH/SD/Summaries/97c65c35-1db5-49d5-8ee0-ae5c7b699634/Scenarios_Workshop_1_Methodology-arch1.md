ACES PROJECT: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE
WP 1 AND WP5

## Overview
- Objective: construct future land-use change scenarios for rural Mozambique using a participatory approach, linking wellbeing, miombo woodland, ecosystem services, and livelihoods.
- Partners and funding: University of Edinburgh (lead), with Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; ESPA program (NERC, ESRC, DfID).

## Data structure
- Qualitative data from five workshops stored in five .rtf files:
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai-Xai, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)
- Data collection methods varied: note-taking by 1–3 people, post-discussion recordings after consent, and photos of materials.

## Quality control
- Two writers prepared each document; both attended the workshops and performed final reviews.
- Aimed to capture main ideas and discussion processes rather than verbatim repetition.
- Acknowledged constraints: incomplete note-taking due to concurrent fieldwork; recommended improvements for future sessions.

## Development and implementation
- Based on two initial workshops in 2014 (Maputo and Xai-Xai) to bootstrap the scenario-building process.
- Structure: two parts per workshop
  - Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) discussion
  - Scenarios construction
- Participants divided into three groups by region (Maputo) or randomly (Xai-Xai).
- Recording practices differed by site (Maputo non-audio-recorded; Xai-Xai recorded).
- Key methodological recommendations: assign a dedicated full-day note-taker trained to capture main ideas, participant roles, and discussion flow.

## Objective of the workshops
- Identify how wellbeing, ecosystem services, and land-use interact; understand relationships to biodiversity and miombo woodland.
- Elicit ideas for actions that could alleviate poverty while conserving biodiversity.
- Ensure inclusion of as many variables as possible, then prioritise the most important ones.
- Generate new knowledge, stimulate stakeholder reflection, and ensure participants’ voices are heard.

## Outputs
- Identification of the most important and most uncertain drivers for scenario construction.
- Documentation of drivers across five categories (see below) and their relative importance via group voting.
- Plans for communicating findings to stakeholders and using results to inform BBN and scenario work.

## Methodology and key activities
- Focus areas for variables: rural wellbeing (how to measure at district/village/family/person level), woodland cover/biodiversity, ecosystem services; define physical boundaries and timescales.
- Five driver types used in exercises: social, technological, economic, environmental, political.
- Activities included
  - Group work to identify drivers (KETSO method; slide-based explanation)
  - Individual contributions to driver lists (then aggregated)
  - Voting on importance and uncertainty using red/white sticks
  - Plenary reporting back and Q&A
- Time allocation varied by site, but core sequence remained: agenda/participation, presentation of research questions, scenario aims, driver identification, prioritisation, reporting back, and closing remarks.

## Detailed timetable (Maputo)
- 8:30–16:45 schedule with two main sessions:
  - Morning: agenda, participants, research questions, variables, timescales (3–5 slides of proposed indicators and boundaries)
  - Afternoon: scenario aims, driver identification (3 groups), voting on importance, tea break, group reporting, plenary discussion, and closing summary with steps forward (leaflets to stakeholders every 2 months)
- Notes on process: highlight need for more participatory engagement in early activities; time pressures impacted consensus on top drivers.

## Detailed timetable (Xai-Xai)
- 9:30–12:05, plus continuation to next day due to duration of BBN activity:
  - Similar structure to Maputo: agenda, participants, research questions, variables, and scenario aims
  - Scenario development (BBN focus) followed by driver identification (3 provinces/groups)
  - Voting on important and uncertain drivers; reporting back; questions from other groups
  - Closing summary by Isilda with steps forward and stakeholder leaflets every two months
- Note: BBN/scenario activities extended into the next day; participants agreed to continue.

## Key methods and tools used
- KETSO voting system to identify and prioritise drivers
- Five driver-type framework (social, technological, economic, environmental, political)
- Scenarios and BBN concepts guiding the participatory process
- Visuals and slides to present research questions, indicators, and timelines
- Documentation via notes, photos, and, where possible, audio recordings

## Challenges and recommendations for analysts
- Data accessibility across formats and scales; heterogeneity of data sources
- Incomplete or uneven note-taking; need for a dedicated, well-trained note-taker
- Time management: consensus-building on top drivers was limited by schedule
- Ensure comprehensive recording (audio/video) where culturally appropriate
- Improve transparency of discussion processes and move toward making datasets and methods readily usable for subsequent analysis and replication

## Next steps and usability
- Translate workshop outputs into BBN construction and scenario development
- Maintain stakeholder engagement through bi-monthly leaflets with updates
- Open channels for feedback to refine models and future participatory steps
- Ensure clear documentation to support replication and data discoverability (metadata, data portals)
