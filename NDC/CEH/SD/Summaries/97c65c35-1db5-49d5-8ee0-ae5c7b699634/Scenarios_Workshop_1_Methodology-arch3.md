# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai-Xai, 2014

- Project context
  - ACES project: Livelihoods and land-use change in Mozambique, led by University of Edinburgh with Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and IIED, funded by ESPA (UK government funders: NERC, ESRC, DfID).
  - Objective: construct scenarios of future land-use change in rural Mozambique using a participatory approach, focusing on wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and poverty alleviation.

- Data structure and quality control
  - Data consisted of five .rtf workshop reports: Maputo national (2014), Xai-Xai provincial (2014), Maputo national (2015), Lichinga provincial (2015), Quelimane provincial (2015).
  - Data collection varied: notes by 1–3 people, post-workshop transcripts with participant consent, and photography of materials.
  - Quality assurance: two researchers authored each report with cross-checking; both were present at the workshops and approved final results.
  - Recording practice: Maputo sessions largely not audio-recorded; Xai-Xai sessions were recorded with consent; acknowledgement of incomplete note-taking and staffing constraints.

- Methodology and workshop design
  - Two sets of workshops in Maputo (2014) and Xai-Xai (2014) to initiate the process of developing scenarios for land-use change.
  - Structure: workshops comprised two parts—BBN (Bayesian Belief Network) exercise and scenarios construction.
  - Participant arrangement: groups formed by province (Maputo: Manica, Niassa, and National policies; Xai-Xai: three mixed provincial groups).
  - Activities included:
    - Presenting research questions and defining indicators for rural well-being, woodland cover/biodiversity, and ecosystem services; establishing physical boundaries and timescales (5, 10, 15, 20 years).
    - Explaining aims of the scenarios exercise: not to predict the future but to construct plausible futures and a desired future to steer actions.
    - Five-step scenarios construction focused on alleviating rural poverty through landscape management to support ecosystem services and wellbeing.
    - Key driver identification across five driver types: social, technological, economic, environmental, political (via KETSO slides).
    - Individual contribution encouraged (one factor per driver type per participant).
    - Prioritization using red/white sticks: identifying two most important and two less important drivers, then tallying votes.
    - Plenary report-backs, followed by Q&A from other groups; aim to reach consensus on the two most important and two most uncertain drivers (though consensus was not reached within the available time).
    - End-of-day wrap-up with steps forward, stakeholder leaflets every two months, and openness to feedback.

- Outputs and what they inform monitoring
  - Identified most important and most uncertain drivers for the scenarios, linked to rural wellbeing, forest degradation, and land-use change.
  - Outputs aimed to illustrate how rural poverty could be alleviated through optimal landscape management to support ecosystem services and human wellbeing.
  - Emphasized ongoing stakeholder engagement and communication to ensure the participatory process informs policy and monitoring efforts (leaflets every two months; ongoing feedback).

- Timetable and workflow highlights
  - Maputo detailed timetable featured morning/plenary activities, BBN/scenario development, driver identification, voting, and plenary reporting, with notes on early delays and the desire for more participatory data-gathering.
  - Xai-Xai timetable mirrored Maputo but indicated longer BBN activity; decision to continue the BBN work the following day due to time constraints; similar structure of presentation, driver work, voting, and reporting.

- Challenges and lessons learned
  - Resource constraints affected data capture: inconsistent note-taking, competing fieldwork activities, and limited dedicated note-takers.
  - Audio recording capacity varied by location, impacting data richness (recording approved in Xai-Xai but not in Maputo).
  - Need for trained note-takers present for each group; suggests embedding recording responsibilities within the ACES team and ensuring thorough preparation.
  - Time management sometimes prevented full consensus on drivers; suggested improvements include more structured participatory activities and clearer documentation of discussion processes.

- Implications for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to building a monitoring-informing evidence base through participatory methods.
  - Highlights the importance of data provenance, quality control, and transparency in workshop-derived data (multiple sources, cross-checking, and explicit approvals).
  - Shows integration of stakeholder engagement, transparent communication, and iterative feedback (leaflets; open to stakeholder input) as core governance elements.
  - Provides a model for capturing drivers, indicators, and scenarios to inform adaptive monitoring frameworks and policy decisions.
