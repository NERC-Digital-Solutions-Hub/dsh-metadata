# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

- This document describes the participatory process used to develop future land use change scenarios in rural Mozambique, organized by ACES project WP1 and WP5, led by the University of Edinburgh and funded by ESPA. It focuses on qualitative data collected across five workshops (Maputo 2014; Xai-Xai 2014; Maputo 2015; Lichinga 2015; Quelimane 2015).

- Purpose and outputs of the workshops
  - Aim to incorporate wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, biodiversity, and poverty alleviation considerations into future land use scenarios.
  - Produce actionable inputs: proposed scenario changes, key driver definitions, agreed scenario narratives, potential interventions, and how these interventions affect land use.
  - Generate data to inform broader policy and stakeholder understanding, including discussions of concerns and viewpoints from diverse stakeholders.

- Data structure and sources
  - Qualitative data from five workshops, stored in five .rtf files:
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai Xai, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)
  - Data collection methods included: notes by 1–3 facilitators, selective audio recordings (with consent), and photographs of workshop materials.
  - Data are descriptive and narrative rather than a structured database.

- Quality control and provenance
  - Two researchers authored the results: initial draft and subsequent review by a second participant who attended the workshops.
  - Final documents underwent a concluding review and official approval as project results.
  - Multiple data formats and capture methods were harmonized through cross-checks during finalization.

- Methodology and timeline
  - Iterative development building on two 2014 ACES workshops (Maputo and Xai-Xai) to inform 2015 workshops.
  - Workshops conducted in:
    - Maputo: 12/08/2015
    - Lichinga: 04/08/2015
    - Quelimane: 28–29/10/2015
  - Structure included preparation, pilot, regional workshops, and a mix of scenario development and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) activities (reframed as causal diagrams).

- Workshop sessions and approach
  - 2.1 Session on Scenarios refinement
    - Presentation of the ACEs scenario process and three storylines.
    - Five thematic groups (social, environmental, political, economic, technological) used A0 canvases with scenario assumptions and guiding questions.
    - Groups evaluated plausibility, identified missing drivers, and proposed updates; results shared across groups with plenary discussion.
    - Emphasis on oral explanation in plenary and facilitator clarification to address questions.
  - 2.2 Session on Effects of each scenario on land use change
    - Participants formed six groups, divided into three for one method each and three for another method.
    - First three groups used A0 documents to assess how land use categories might change under Scenarios A, B, and C; included drivers and regulatory mechanisms; produced estimated percent changes.
    - Second three groups reviewed proposed evolutions of land use, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing per scenario; discussed agreement/disagreement and proposed changes.
  - 2.3 Session on the effect of different spatial data on land use change in 2035
    - Presenter introduced the impact of spatial datasets (slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads/rail/river/villages) on land use.
    - Three groups used A0 working documents to evaluate which spatial data are most important for establishing each land use category in 2035 and proposed additional relevant data.
    - Plenary discussions aimed to reach consensus on the key spatial data for land use change.

- Outputs and data products
  - Comprehensive lists and definitions:
    - Proposed changes to scenarios
    - Key drivers by group and in plenary
    - Agreed “big picture” scenarios
    - Interventions under each scenario, with voting on relevance
    - Common important interventions if time permitted
  - Quantitative-like deliverables:
    - Tables of land use changes under each scenario
    - Matrix linking interventions to land use categories and their probable impacts
  - Qualitative stakeholder reflections:
    - Collected discussions to capture stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse views for incorporation into the scenario outputs.

- Participating institutions
  - Maputo, Lichinga, and Quelimane workshops included a range of Mozambican institutions (e.g., DNP, IIAM, UEM faculties, SPFFB, DPA, DIC, IIAM Zambezia, ORAM, and others) that contributed to data collection and scenario development.

- Relevance for data support and reuse
  - Demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to generating qualitative scenario data that can be transformed into data products (drivers, land use change estimates, and intervention impacts).
  - Highlights practical data handling: multi-source qualitative data, standardized documentation (RTF files), and cross-validated authoring process.
  - Useful as a model for organizing and documenting scenario-focused qualitative datasets, including decisions about data formats, provenance, and stakeholder-inclusive outputs.
