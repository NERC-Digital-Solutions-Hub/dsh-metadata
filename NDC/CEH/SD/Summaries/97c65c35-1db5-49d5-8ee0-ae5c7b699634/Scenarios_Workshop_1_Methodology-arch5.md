# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai-Xai, 2014

- Overview
  - Dataset created by ACES project WP5 and WP1 focusing on qualitative data from five participatory workshops on future land use change in rural Mozambique.
  - Project led by University of Edinburgh with collaboration from Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
  - Objective of the workshops: capture wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land-use variables; explore actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation; aim to build a broad variable set and identify key drivers for scenario construction.

- Data Structure and Formats
  - five .rtf files containing workshop results:
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf
  - Each file corresponds to a workshop's main results; filenames include location and year.
  - Descriptions provided for each file; uncompressed sizes listed (KB).

- Quality Control, Provenance, and Documentation
  - Data collected via multiple methods: participant notes (1–3 people), post-discussion recording with participant consent, and photographic captures of generated materials.
  - Writing and validation process: one author drafted results, a second author reviewed; both authors attended the workshops; final documents approved as official results.
  - Quality considerations noted: audio recording decisions differed by site (Maputo not recorded to avoid inhibiting discussion; Xai-Xai recorded with consent). Training and note-taking reliability issues observed (need for a dedicated, full-day note-taker per group).

- Methodology and Implementation
  - Initial two workshops in Maputo (National) and Xai-Xai (Provincial) in 2014 to pilot the methodology.
  - Focus areas: identify drivers of change affecting human wellbeing, forest degradation, and land-use changes; discuss 5-step scenario construction to link landscape management with ecosystem services and wellbeing.
  - Key activities included participatory identification of drivers across five types (social, technological, economic, environmental, political) using KETSO for voting.

- Objectives and Outputs
  - Primary objective: identify important variables and drivers that influence rural wellbeing, biodiversity, and ecosystem services; define boundaries and timescales (e.g., 1–20 years).
  - Main outputs: determination of the most important and most uncertain drivers for scenario construction; results used to frame scenarios aimed at poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.

- Detailed Timetables and Operational Notes (Maputo and Xai-Xai)
  - Structure: two-part sessions per day (BBN activity followed by scenario construction); participants organized into groups by region.
  - Key activities:
    - Presentation of agenda and participatory process; clarification that scenarios are for exploring plausible futures, not strict predictions.
    - Identification of drivers through group work and visual aids (KETSO slides); each participant contributed factors across driver types.
    - Voting to determine the two most important and two most uncertain drivers.
    - Group reports, plenary Q&A, and closing summaries with steps forward.
  - Operational challenges documented:
    - Delays and scheduling adjustments; BBN activity extended beyond planned times, with the option to continue the next day in Xai-Xai.
    - Recording decisions influenced by site norms and practical considerations.
    - Recognition that implementation would benefit from more consistent note-taking, greater participant involvement in initial stages, and better pre-workshop preparation.

- Dissemination and Follow-up
  - Commitment to ongoing stakeholder communication: a leaflet outlining changes to be sent every two months by email/website/mail.
  - Emphasis on openness to feedback and ongoing refinement of the participatory process and BBN/scenario structures.

- Implications for Data Stewardship
  - Data heterogeneity (notes, recordings, photos, and transcriptions) underscores the need for standardized metadata and provenance tracking.
  - Best practices highlighted include: consistent consent management for recordings, explicit documentation of data collection methods per workshop, and clear versioning of workshop outputs.
  - Recommendations for future data governance:
    - Establish a uniform data capture and transcription protocol, with a designated note-taker for each group.
    - Develop a metadata schema for qualitative workshop data (participants, groups, methods, consent status, data formats, and processing steps).
    - Ensure clear documentation of data processing steps (drafting, review, approval) and maintain audit trails.
    - Plan for consistent data sharing and update mechanisms with stakeholders, including structured dissemination materials.
