# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Overview
- A methodological report detailing how participatory workshops were conducted to build scenarios of future land use change in rural Mozambique.
- Led by University of Edinburgh for the ACES project (LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE) with collaboration from Mozambican partners and other organizations.
- Focus on integrating wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland and land use, and exploring interventions to reduce forest loss and improve poverty alleviation.

## Objective
- Capture the main factors influencing wellbeing and their relationships with ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Elicit ideas for actions that could contribute to poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
- Include as many relevant variables as possible, then refine to the most important drivers.
- Generate inputs for definitive future scenarios and interventions under different scenarios.

## Outputs
- List of proposed changes to scenarios and key definitions.
- Selected drivers by groups and in plenary; agreed scenario narratives (big pictures).
- Interventions under each scenario, including votes and consensus on important interventions.
- Tables detailing land use changes under each scenario and the relationships between interventions and land use categories.
- Documentation of stakeholder discussions and concerns for broader understanding.

## Data structure and quality control
- Data comprised of qualitative results from five workshops (maps, notes, and photos).
- Files include multiple .rtf workshop reports (National and Province-level for 2014–2015).
- Quality controls:
  - Notes taken by 1–3 people per workshop; discussions recorded with participant consent; photos of materials captured.
  - Two authors prepared the written results, with a secondary review by the other and final approval as official results.

## Methodology and Agenda (high-level)
- Preparatory phases: pilot in Edinburgh (June 2015), preparation meeting in Maputo (July 2015), pilot workshop in Maputo (July 2015).
- Provincial workshop: August 4–5, 2015 (Maputo province structure: scenarios first, then Bayesian network-style analysis called “causal diagrams”).
- The process emphasized broad representation across stakeholder groups, with audio recordings where participants consented.
- Final three workshops in 2015: Maputo (Aug 12, 2015), Lichinga (Aug 4, 2015), Quelimane (Oct 28–29, 2015).

## Workshop methodology followed

### 2.1 Session on Scenarios refinement
- Initiated with an explanation of the ACEs scenario process and the three storylines.
- Participants divided into five groups by thematic area: social, environmental, political, economic, and technological.
- Each group reviewed A0-sized assumption materials for their theme and responded to guiding questions about plausibility, missing drivers, and potential changes for 2035.
- Emphasis on oral plenary explanations and facilitator-led clarification questions.
- Possibility to add new drivers; groups later shared results with all participants and engaged in brief discussions.

### 2.2 Session on Effects of each scenario on land use change
- Introduction to land use change followed by six groups (three groups for one method per scenario A, B, and C; three groups using a different method).
- First three groups used A0 documents listing current land-use categories, current area, and District-level changes; discussed drivers and mechanisms regulating changes; estimated percentage changes per land-use category under each scenario.
- Second set of three groups reviewed A0 documents outlining evolution of land use changes, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing for the three scenarios; discussed and adjusted proposed evolutions, though results tended to reflect the most probable states rather than scenario-specific suppositions.
- Findings presented in plenary discussions.

### 2.3 Session on Effect of different spatial data on land use change in rural Mozambique in 2035
- Presentation of how spatial data influence land use change using maps of slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads, railways, rivers, and villages (prepared by researchers).
- Participants divided into three groups; each group assessed the importance of spatial data for enabling each land use category to establish itself in 2035.
- Groups invited to propose additional spatial data considered influential.
- Plenary session to reach consensus on the most important spatial data for land use change.

## Participating organizations and institutions
- Maputo workshop participants included a range of institutions (examples listed in the document, including governmental, research, and NGO partners).
- Quelimane workshop participants included institutions such as DP Ciência e Tecnologia Zambézia, IIAM, DPAZ/SPFFB, AMADAZA, OXFAM, and others.
- The collaboration encompassed multiple Mozambican institutions and international partners to ensure diverse representation.

## Relevance for GIS Specialists
- Demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to building map-based scenarios of land use change.
- Integrates qualitative scenario storytelling with quantitative land-use change assessments and spatial data analysis.
- Uses spatial-data-driven discussions (slope, distance to roads/railways/rivers/villages) to anchor scenario plausibility and land-use transitions.
- Produces concrete GIS-ready outputs: land-use change tables, driver lists, intervention mappings, and spatial data requirements for scenario installation.
- Highlights common challenges in GIS-informed scenario work: aligning diverse data sources, ensuring stakeholder engagement, and translating qualitative drivers into spatially explicit outcomes.
