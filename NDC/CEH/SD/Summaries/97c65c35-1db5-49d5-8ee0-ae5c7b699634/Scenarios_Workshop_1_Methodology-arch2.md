# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai-Xai, 2014

## Overview and objective
- Part of ACES PROJECT: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE (WP1 and WP5).
- Led by the University of Edinburgh with Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
- Objective: construct future land-use change scenarios in rural Mozambique through participatory workshops; include qualitative data from five workshops (2014–2015).

## Data structure and contents
- Five .rtf files reporting main results of the five workshops:
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai-Xai, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)
- Qualitative content includes main results, drivers, and scenario development outputs.

## Quality control and data collection practices
- Data collected via:
  - Notes by 1–3 people during workshops.
  - Post-discussion recordings (with participant consent) and photos of materials.
- Documentation process:
  - One writer prepared an initial version, then a second writer (present at workshops) reviewed.
  - Final documents approved as official project results.
- Quality-control challenges:
  - Mixed data collection formats; incomplete note-taking due to fieldwork demands.
  - In Maputo, some groups had less complete note-taking; in Xai-Xai, conversations were audio-recorded.
- Recommendations for improvement:
  - Assign a dedicated note-taker for each group, trained to capture main ideas, who said what, and the discussion process (not just content).
  - Ensure note-takers are integrated into workshop preparations.

## Methodology and workflow
- Initial implementation: twoScenarios workshops in 2014 (Maputo and Xai-Xai) to begin the process of constructing land-use change scenarios.
- Core objective of workshops:
  - Capture wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land-use interactions.
  - Elicit ideas for actions contributing to poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Incorporate as many relevant variables as possible, then prioritise the most important ones.
  - Generate knowledge, stimulate reflection, and amplify participant voices.
- Outputs:
  - Identification of the most important and most uncertain drivers for scenario construction.

## Detailed workshop design and timetable (highlights)
- Maputo (National workshop and provincial session in Maputo area):
  - Two-part structure: BBN (Bayesian Belief Network) activity followed by scenario construction.
  - Participants divided into three groups (Manica, Niassa, and National policies) for Maputo; Xai-Xai used mixed provincial groupings.
  - Debate about recording: audio recording not used in Maputo initially, but used in Xai-Xai after consent; later concluded recording was not problematic.
  - Key activities:
    - Present research questions and variables (rural well-being, woodland cover/biodiversity, ecosystem services).
    - Define boundaries and timescales (1–20 years) and propose initial indicators.
    - Introduce the five-step scenarios construction process.
    - Identify drivers of change using a KETSO-style approach (five driver types: social, technological, economic, environmental, political).
    - Group activity where participants suggest drivers; drivers coded collectively rather than individually.
    - Voting to identify two most important and two least important drivers (color-coded sticks or marks).
    - Plenary reporting of group findings; questions from other groups.
    - Time constraints prevented full consensus on the two most important and two most uncertain drivers.
  - End-of-day wrap: brief summary, steps forward, and commitment to share leaflets with stakeholders every two months.
- Xai-Xai (Province workshop):
  - Similar structure and content as Maputo with adaptations for local context.
  - BBN activity extended due to duration; proposal to continue into the next day was accepted.
  - Key activities mirrored Maputo: agenda presentation, variable definitions, five-step scenarios, driver identification and voting, group reports, plenary questions, and closing remarks.
  - Emphasis on ongoing stakeholder communication (leaflets and feedback) and openness to adapt the process.

## Core outputs and findings
- Drive analysis: identification of the main drivers that influence human wellbeing, forest degradation, and land-use changes across study areas.
- Driver prioritisation: determination of the two most important and two most uncertain drivers per group, albeit some time constraints limited full plenary consensus.

## Next steps and dissemination
- Stakeholder communication: commitment to a bi-monthly leaflet outlining changes and updates to the participatory process and BBN/scenarios structure.
- Data sharing and access: notes on the importance of enabling access to underlying data used to produce outputs; data storage and portal management suggested as a future consideration (data stored as .rtf files within the project deliverables).

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and data practice
- Demonstrates a structured, participatory data collection approach that yields qualitative drivers and scenario outputs useful for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Combines QA-conscious data handling (dual-review drafting, consent-based audio recording) with transparent methodology and explicit recommendations for data capture improvements.
- Produces standardised outputs (identified drivers, scenario constructs) that can support cross-time comparisons and policy evaluation.
- Highlights ongoing data accessibility challenges and the importance of disseminating underlying data to enable broader reuse and scrutiny.
