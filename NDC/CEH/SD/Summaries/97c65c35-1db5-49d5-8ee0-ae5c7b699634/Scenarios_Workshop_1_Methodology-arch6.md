# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai-Xai, 2014

- Data structure
  - The database comprises five .rtf files reporting the main results of five workshops:
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai-Xai, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)

- Data quality, provenance and control
  - Data collected in multiple formats: notes (1–3 people), most discussions recorded with participant consent, and photos of materials.
  - Two authors wrote the results: a first draft and a second reviewer; both attended the workshops; final versions approved as official outputs.

- Methodology development
  - Implemented two initial Scenarios workshops in 2014 (Maputo and Xai-Xai) to start the process of constructing future land-use change scenarios.

- Objective of the workshops
  - Capture key factors influencing wellbeing, their relationships with ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit ideas for actions to alleviate poverty and conserve biodiversity.
  - Include as many relevant variables as possible, then select the most important ones; generate new knowledge and empower participant voices.

- Output
  - Identification of the most important and the most uncertain drivers for scenario construction.

- Implementation details (Maputo and Xai-Xai)
  - Structure: workshops split into two parts (BBN and scenario construction); participants organized into three groups.
  - Grouping: Maputo used regional groupings (Manica, Niassa, National policies); Xai-Xai grouped participants randomly.
  - Recording approach: Maputo not audio-recorded to avoid inhibiting discussion; Xai-Xai recorded with consent.
  - Note-taking challenges: fieldwork demands limited complete note-taking; recommendation to assign a full-time note-taker from the ACES team, with training on capturing main ideas, attribution, and discussion flow.

- Detailed timetable highlights
  - Maputo (13 Aug 2014) and Xai-Xai (14 Aug 2014) structured around:
    - Agenda and participatory process briefing (BBN and scenarios)
    - Presentation of research questions and variables (rural wellbeing, woodland cover/biodiversity, ecosystem services) and proposed timescales (e.g., 1–20 years)
    - Scenario development (5 steps) and identification of drivers
    - Drivers analysis using KETSO (five driver types: social, technological, economic, environmental, political)
    - Individual contribution to driver lists and group voting (two red sticks for most important; two white sticks for less important)
    - Group report-backs and plenary questions
    - Summary, closing remarks, and steps forward (including a pledge to send stakeholder leaflets every two months)

- Data governance and reuse implications
  - Clear documentation of who contributed data, what format, and the sequence of activities supports transparency and future data reuse.
  - The structure allows qualitative data to be transformed into data products (e.g., driver importance rankings, scenario narratives) for end-user exploration.

- Learnings and recommendations for future data work
  - Ensure dedicated, trained note-takers are present for each group to capture discussion flow and attribution.
  - Consider audio recording with participant consent to enrich data fidelity.
  - Standardize data capture templates (variables, drivers, group decisions) to facilitate later analysis and integration across workshops.
  - Maintain a transparent communications plan (e.g., leaflets every two months) to support data-driven stakeholder engagement and feedback loops.
