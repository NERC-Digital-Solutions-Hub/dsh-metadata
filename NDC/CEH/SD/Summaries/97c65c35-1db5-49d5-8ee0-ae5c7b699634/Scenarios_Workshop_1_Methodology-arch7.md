## Overview
- Part of the ACES project (LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE), led by the University of Edinburgh with partners including Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and IIED; funded by ESPA (NERC/ESRC/DfID).
- Objective: construct future land-use change scenarios in rural Mozambique through participatory workshops in Maputo (2014) and Xai-Xai (2014).
- Deliverables are qualitative data from five workshops, stored as five .rtf files; data collection involved notes, photos, and some audio recordings.
- Emphasis on linking wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land-use changes to identify actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.

## Data structure and quality control
- Data files: Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf; Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (description); Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf; Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf; Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf; Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (five .rtf files with workshop results).
- Quality control: mixed data collection methods (notes by 1–3 people; some discussions recorded with participant consent; photos of materials); two writers prepared and reviewed the final documents; both writers were present at the workshops.
- Documentation caveats: Maputo workshops were not audio-recorded (to avoid inhibiting discussion) though later reflections suggested recordings would have been acceptable; Xai-Xai workshop was recorded. Note-taking was challenging due to concurrent fieldwork activity; recommendation to have dedicated note-taker for each group and thorough training on what to capture.

## Methodology and workshop objectives
- Foundational goal: capture the main factors influencing wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land-use changes; generate ideas for actions to alleviate poverty and conserve biodiversity; attempt to include as many relevant variables as possible, then prioritise.
- Workshops conducted in two phases:
  - Maputo (13 Aug 2014) and Xai-Xai (14 Aug 2014) with groups covering Manica, Niassa, and national policies (Maputo) or provinces (Xai-Xai).
  - Split sessions into BBN (Bayesian Belief Network) activity and scenarios construction; use of participatory methods to identify drivers and variables.
- Outputs aim to articulate how rural poverty could be alleviated through landscape management to support ecosystem services and wellbeing; also to create a desirable future and plan steps to achieve it.

## Outputs
- Key output: identification of the most important and most uncertain drivers for scenarios construction.
- Drivers categorized into five types: social, technological, economic, environmental, and political.
- Sessions used KETSO (a visual voting/consensus method) to surface drivers and to capture participant rankings; participants contributed one factor per driver type.

## Detailed timetable (highlights)
- Maputo (two days):
  - Opening agenda, participant introductions, description of the participatory process (BBN and scenarios).
  - Present research questions and proposed indicators for rural wellbeing, woodland biodiversity, and ecosystem services; define boundaries and time horizons (3 districts; 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 15, 20 years).
  - Scenario aims: not to predict the future, but to construct plausible futures and identify actions to increase success; five-step scenarios approach to articulate poverty-alleviating pathways.
  - Scenario development: identify key drivers across three areas; five driver types; individual factors per type.
  - Group voting: each participant places red/white sticks to mark most/least important drivers; groups converge on two top drivers.
  - Reporting back: plenary presentations from groups, followed by Q&A; limited time to reach plenary consensus on top two drivers.
  - Closing: summary and steps forward; leaflets to stakeholders every two months; openness to feedback.
- Xai-Xai (two days):
  - Similar structure; extended BBN activity; scheduling adjustments due to pace (proposed continuation the next day, accepted by participants).
  - Emphasis on clarifying the aims of the scenario exercise and ensuring time for scenario development and driving-factor identification.
  - Detailed timetable mirrors Maputo with translations/adjustments for provincial context; similar use of KETSO for driver identification and voting; closing with commitments to stakeholder communications.

## Lessons learned and recommendations
- Need for a dedicated, fully present note-taker for each group to ensure complete capture of discussions; better preparation and training for note-takers on key ideas and contributions.
- Audio recording proved acceptable in Xai-Xai and could be considered in Maputo to preserve discussion detail.
- Time management: insufficient time to reach plenary consensus on top drivers; consider longer sessions or tighter facilitation to achieve agreement.
- Post-workshop communications: plan for ongoing stakeholder leaflets every two months; multiple channels recommended (email, website, mail).
- Data integration considerations: qualitative workshop outputs are valuable for scenario logic but require careful structuring for GIS-ready data products (see GIS implications below).

## Implications for GIS specialists and data products
- The project yields qualitative, driver-based data that can inform map-based scenario visualizations (e.g., mapping where top drivers are strongest, or where scenarios project changes in wellbeing, biodiversity, and ecosystem services).
- For GIS use, translate the five driver categories and identified variables into spatial layers or thematic dashboards, aligned with the three study areas and time horizons.
- Data challenges highlighted in the document (scattered sources, varying formats, data at different resolutions, need for standardization) underscore the importance of:
  - Creating standardized data schemas to capture drivers, indicators, and scenario outcomes.
  - Linking qualitative outputs (from .rtf narrative results) to spatial datasets and to future projections.
  - Planning for data at multiple resolutions and ensuring consistent vocabulary across datasets.
- The participatory approach (BBN, drivers, prioritization) provides a framework for GIS-enabled scenario planning, enabling policymakers, clients, and the public to explore plausible futures through map-based storytelling and spatially explicit indicators.
