# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS

- Project and context
  - ACES project: Livelihoods and land use change in Mozambique; led by University of Edinburgh with collaborators including Universidade Eduardo Mondlane and IIED.
  - Objective: construct future land-use change scenarios for rural Mozambique through a participatory process.
  - Data outputs: qualitative data from five workshops; stored as five .rtf files (scenarios and results from national and provincial workshops in Maputo, Xai-Xai, Lichinga, and Quelimane, 2014–2015).
  - Quality control: multiple authors documented results, cross-checked by others; some discussions recorded with participant consent; photos taken of materials for readability.

- Objective of the workshops
  - Main aim: explore how wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses interact; gather ideas for actions that aid poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Process goal: include as many relevant variables as possible, then identify the most important drivers.
  - Specific objectives: evaluate and refine proposed scenarios, input into definitive future scenarios, assess how scenarios would alter land use, and identify interventions under different scenarios to reduce land-use change and support poverty alleviation.

- Outputs
  - Documents produced: lists of proposed changes to scenarios; key definitions; selected drivers by groups and in plenary; agreed big-picture scenarios.
  - Interventions: compiled under each scenario with votes from individuals and groups; identification of common important interventions if time allows.
  - Land-use implications: tables showing land-use changes under each scenario; a matrix linking interventions to land-use categories and their probable impacts.
  - Stakeholder perspectives: captured discussions to reflect concerns, understandings, and diverse views.

- Methodology and agenda
  - Timeline and setup: pilot in Edinburgh (2014); preparation and pilot in Maputo (2015); provincial workshops in Maputo, Lichinga, and Quelimane (August–October 2015).
  - Participant organization: groups formed to ensure broad representation; sessions often recorded (presentations and plenary debates; some group discussions not recorded).
  - Terminology: Bayesian belief networks referred to as “causal diagrams” or models for clarity with participants.
  - Agenda structure: defined sequence of scenario development, assessment of effects on land use, and consideration of spatial data; two-day provincial workshops with separate but linked components (scenarios and BBN).

- Workshop methodology followed
  - Core issues addressed across sessions: development and refinement of scenarios, evaluation of land-use impacts, and integration of spatial data into scenario analysis.
  - Emphasis on participatory critique: explanations of scenarios in plenary; facilitator-led clarification; identification of missing drivers; ensuring scenarios are treated as plausible explorations rather than predictions.

- 2.1 Session on Scenarios refinement
  - Process: explanation of ACEs scenario process and the three storylines; five thematic groups (social, environmental, political, economic, technological) analyze scenarios using A0 posters and guiding questions.
  - Activities: groups discuss plausibility, identify missing drivers, and propose changes; oral plenary explanations and cross-group discussions to reach shared understanding.
  - Outcome: consolidation of scenario refinements and documented feedback.

- 2.2 Session on Effects of each scenario on land use change
  - Structure: six groups in total; three groups focus on land-use categories and drivers per scenario using A0 documents; the other three groups assess proposed evolution of land use, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing.
  - Approach: assess changes and drivers for each land-use category, consider regulatory mechanisms; participants vote on the expected magnitude of change and mechanisms to regulate drivers.
  - Observations: results tended to converge toward similar “most probable” futures across scenarios; groups presented findings and engaged in plenary discussion.

- 2.3 Session on Effect of different spatial data on land use change in 2035
  - Presentation: maps and data on slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads/rails/rivers/villages; significance of spatial data for land-use installation discussed.
  - Group work: three groups evaluate the importance of various spatial data for land-use categories and propose additional data that could improve future analyses.
  - Plenary: groups share results and attempt to agree on the most important spatial data for 2035 land-use change.
  - Participating institutions: list of organizations involved in Maputo and Quelimane workshops.
