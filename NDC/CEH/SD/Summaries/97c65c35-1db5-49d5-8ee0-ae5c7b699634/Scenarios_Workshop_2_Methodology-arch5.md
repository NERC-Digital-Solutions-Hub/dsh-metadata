# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Overview
- Documentation of the methodology used to develop and refine scenarios of future land use change in rural Mozambique through five participatory workshops (Maputo, Xai-Xai, Lichinga, Quelimane) as part of the ACES project.
- Project led by the University of Edinburgh with collaborators; funded by ESPA (UK agencies).
- Objective: incorporate wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, poverty alleviation considerations; derive input for scenario definitions, interventions, and potential policy implications.

## Data Structure
- Dataset consists of five .rtf files reporting workshop results:
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai Xai, 2014)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)
- Content captures qualitative results from workshops, including proposed changes, drivers, scenario definitions, land-use implications, and interventions.
- Data collection also included supplementary materials (photos of generated materials) to aid interpretation.

## Data Collection and Quality Control
- Mixed data collection methods:
  - Note-taking by 1–3 participants during workshops.
  - Post-workshop discussions recorded with participant consent.
  - Photographs of materials produced during sessions.
- Quality control process:
  - Two writers documented results; both present at workshops.
  - Independent review by both writers; final approval as official results.

## Methodology and Agenda
- Methodology evolved from two workshops in 2014 to support construction of future land-use scenarios; subsequent workshops conducted in 2015.
- Workshop sequence and dates:
  - Pilot in Edinburgh (late June–July 2015) and Maputo preparation (July 2015)
  - Provincial workshops in Maputo (August 2015), including scenario and Bayesian Belief Network (BBN) activities
  - Provincial workshops in Lichinga (August 2015) and Quelimane (October 2015)
- Participants and representation:
  - Workshops organized to ensure broad representation of interests; groups divided to cover diverse perspectives.

## Workshop Methodology

### 2.1 Session on Scenarios Refinement
- Start with plenary briefing on the ACEs scenario process, review of three storylines, drivers, and differences.
- Participants split into five groups by thematic area: social, environmental, political, economic, technological.
- Use A0 sheets with scenario assumptions and guiding questions to assess plausibility, missing drivers, and needed adjustments.
- Key practices:
  - Oral plenary explanations complemented by facilitator clarifications.
  - Participants record comments and suggestions; possibility to add new drivers (and define their 2035 states).
  - Groups present results; followed by plenary discussion.

### 2.2 Session on Effects of Each Scenario on Land Use Change
- Introduction to land-use change; participants organized into six groups.
- Three groups used a working document (A0) outlining current land-use categories, district-level changes, and drivers per scenario; discussion focused on mechanisms regulating drivers and estimated percentage changes per land-use category.
- Other three groups assessed a document outlining proposed evolutions of land use, ecosystem services, and rural well-being for the three scenarios; plenary discussions to approve or adjust the proposed evolutions.
- Note: early results tended to assign most probable outcomes rather than scenariodependent variations; groups later aligned results with scenario narratives.

### 2.3 Session on Effect of Different Spatial Data on Land Use Change in 2035
- Presentation of how spatial data (slope, aspect, altitude, proximity to roads/railways/rivers/villages) influence land-use installation.
- Participants divided into three groups; each received an A0 matrix linking land-use categories with spatial data.
- Groups debated which spatial data are most important and suggested additional data sources.
- Plenary sessions aimed to reach consensus on the most impactful spatial predictors for 2035.

## Outputs
- Comprehensive lists including:
  - Proposed changes to scenarios and key driver definitions.
  - Agreed big-picture scenario narratives and driver selections.
  - Interventions under each scenario, with votes on relevance.
  - Tables relating interventions to land-use changes and their probable impacts.
  - Documentation of stakeholder concerns, understandings, and varying viewpoints.
- Additional outputs include methods for documenting discussions to capture stakeholder perspectives.

## Governance, Access, and Limitations
- Data compiled in multiple formats; primarily qualitative narrative data from workshops.
- Recording and documentation practices depend on participant consent and group willingness to be recorded.
- Some limitations noted regarding data consistency across groups and the tendency to project most probable outcomes rather than scenario-specific variations.
- Data structure uses .rtf files, which has preservation and interoperability implications for long-term data sharing.

## Participating Institutions (Indicative)
- Maputo Workshop participants included institutions such as FAEF-UEM, DINAF-DF, DPAZ/SPFFB, IIAM/CESE, Fundação MICAIA, MITADER, ORAM, UNIZAMBEZE, and others.
- Quelimane Workshop participants included DP Ciência e Tecnologia Zambézia, ITC-Zambézia, DPA-SPFFB, AMZA, FONGA, SDAE-Gurué, IIAM Zambézia, and additional regional actors.
- The document lists multiple institutions from Zambézia and broader Mozambican governance and research networks.

## Relevance for Data Stewards
- Demonstrates a structured approach to capturing qualitative, workshop-based data with explicit methodological transparency.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Clear data structure and file naming for multi-session projects.
  - Rigorous quality control and triage of data into official outputs.
  - Documentation of data provenance, collection methods, and consent for recordings.
  - Metadata on drivers, scenarios, land-use categories, and spatial data used in analyses.
  - Transparent articulation of limitations and potential biases (e.g., preference for “most probable” outcomes).
  - Planning for data sharing and interoperability by acknowledging formats and future needs for standardization.
- Provides a concrete example of aligning data collection with research objectives while capturing stakeholder input and contextual knowledge.
