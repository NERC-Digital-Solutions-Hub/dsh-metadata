# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

- Objective
  - Construct future land-use change scenarios for rural Mozambique using a participatory approach, capturing wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
  - Elicit ideas for actions to support poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Include as many relevant variables as possible, then identify the most important drivers.
  - Additional objectives: generate new knowledge, stimulate reflection among participants, and capture diverse stakeholder perspectives.
  - Specific outputs include: evaluation of proposed scenarios, input for definitive scenarios, anticipated land-use changes under scenarios, possible interventions to reduce forest loss and improve poverty alleviation, and knowledge of stakeholder concerns.

- Output
  - List of proposed changes to scenarios and key driver definitions.
  - Agreed big-picture scenarios and selected drivers (group and plenary input).
  - List of interventions under each scenario, with votes on relevance and any common important interventions.
  - Tables showing land-use changes under each scenario and interventions versus land-use categories with likely impacts.
  - Recorded workshop discussions to reflect stakeholder concerns and viewpoints.

- Data structure and quality control
  - Data collected from five workshops and reported in five .rtf files.
  - Data collection methods included notes by 1–3 participants, post-session discussions with participant consent, and photographs of materials.
  - Two researchers authored and reviewed the workshop reports; both were present at the workshops; final approval obtained as official project results.

- Methodology and Agenda
  - The methodology was developed after two Scenarios workshops in 2014 (Maputo and Xai-Xai) within the ACES project; applied in subsequent workshops to develop future land-use scenarios.
  - Workshops held in Maputo (12 Aug 2015), Lichinga (04 Aug 2015), and Quelimane (28 Oct 2015).
  - Timeline included a pilot in Edinburgh, a Maputo preparation meeting, a Maputo pilot, and provincial workshops with scenario and Bayesian/BBN-like exercises (referred to as causal diagrams to improve understanding).
  - Most sessions were audio-recorded (plenary and group presentations); some group discussions were not recorded upon participant request.

- Workshop methodology followed

  2.1 Session on Scenarios refinement
  - Facilitator-led explanation of the ACEs scenario process and the three proposed storylines.
  - Participants divided into five groups by thematic area (social, environmental, political, economic, technological).
  - Each group used an A0 sheet with scenario assumptions for their theme and answered guiding questions on plausibility, missing drivers, and changes needed for 2035.
  - Groups presented results to others; clarification and discussion followed; new drivers could be added if deemed important.
  - Emphasis on oral plenary explanations and facilitator responses to questions.

  2.2 Session on Effects of each scenario on land use change
  - Introduction to land use change followed by six groups (three groups used one method; three used another).
  - First three groups used an A0 document mapping current land-use categories, current area, and district-level changes; discussed drivers and mechanisms regulating those drivers; completed a table with expected percentage change per land-use category under each scenario, including drivers and regulatory mechanisms.
  - Second three groups used documents outlining expected evolution of land use, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing for the three scenarios; discussed, compared, and adjusted proposed evolutions. Noted tendency to assign most probable states rather than exploring scenario-specific possibilities; differences between scenarios were often small. Each group presented and plenary discussion followed.

  2.3 Session on Effect of different spatial data on land use change in rural Mozambique in 2035
  - Presentation of how spatial data influence land-use change (maps of slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads, railways, rivers, villages; prepared by Mansour).
  - Participants split into three groups; each group used an A0 working document with land-use categories and spatial-data-driven considerations.
  - Groups discussed and proposed the importance of various spatial data for the "installation" of land-use categories and suggested additional data.
  - Plenary presentations led to an agreed set of the most important spatial data for informing land-use change in 2035.

- Participating institutions
  - Maputo workshop included a range of Mozambican stakeholders from universities, government departments, NGOs, and research institutes; notably: FAEF-UEM, DINAF-DF, DPAZ/SPFFB, IIAM/CESE, Fundação MICAIA, MITADER-DINAB, ORAM, INGC, and others.
  - Quelimane workshop similarly involved provincial institutions and partners from Zambézia, including universities and local agencies.
  - Overall, participation spanned national and provincial government bodies, academia, and civil society to inform scenario development and data interpretation.
