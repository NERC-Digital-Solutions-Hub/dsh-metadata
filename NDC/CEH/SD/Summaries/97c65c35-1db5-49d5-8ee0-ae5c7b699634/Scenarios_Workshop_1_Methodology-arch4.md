# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo and Xai-Xai, 2014

## Overview
- Project: ACES (LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE) led by the University of Edinburgh, with Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and other partners.
- Funded by ESPA (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
- Objective: develop scenarios of future rural land-use change in Mozambique using participatory methods; the database contains qualitative data from five workshops.

## Data Structure
- Data stored as five .rtf files reporting workshop results:
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf
  - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf
  - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf
- File sizes and descriptions indicate national and provincial workshop results across Maputo, Xai-Xai, Lichinga, Quelimane.

## Quality Control and Data Collection
- Data gathered through:
  - Notes by 1–3 participants during workshops.
  - Post-discussion recordings after participant consent.
  - Photographs of materials for readability.
- Two people documented results: initial draft by one, second writer reviewed; both attended the workshops.
- Final results validated as official project outputs.

## Methodology
- Implemented in two initial workshops (2014) in Maputo and Xai-Xai to seed the process of building land-use scenarios.
- Structure of sessions:
  - Part 1: Building Blocks Network (BBN) activities.
  - Part 2: Scenarios construction.
- Group organization:
  - Maputo: three groups (Manica, Niassa, National policies).
  - Xai-Xai: three mixed provincial groups.
- Recording practices:
  - Maputo: no audio recording due to concerns about discussion openness (later judged unnecessary for major issues); Xai-Xai: audio recording permitted.
- Data collection challenges:
  - Note-taking not fully consistent; recommendations to assign dedicated, well-trained note-takers for full-day coverage in future workshops.
- Data capture and analysis approach:
  - Identification of key drivers of change across five categories (social, technological, economic, environmental, political) using KETSO.
  - Ranking of drivers using voting with colored sticks (red for most important, white for less important).
  - Distinction between most important and most uncertain drivers to guide scenario development.

## Workshop Objectives
- Aimed to incorporate:
  - Variables affecting rural wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land use.
  - Possible actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - A comprehensive set of variables to avoid missing important factors.
- Outputs intended to inform practice and policy, with insights for a broader data and stakeholder community.

## Outputs
- Focus on identifying the most important and most uncertain drivers to structure scenario construction and policy planning.

## Detailed Timetable (Summary)
- Maputo (13 August 2014):
  - Agenda presentation; introduction to participatory process (BBN and scenarios); participant introductions.
  - Present research questions and variables (rural wellbeing indicators, woodland cover, ecosystem services); discussion of timescales (years 1–20).
  - Scenario aims clarified: not predicting the future but constructing plausible futures and desired futures to inform actions.
  - Scenario development: 3 provincial groups identify drivers across five categories; use KETSO slides; initial group work and voting; plenary reporting and questions.
  - Final summary and closing remarks; commitment to stakeholder leaflets every two months.
- Xai-Xai (14 August 2014):
  - Similar structure with adjustments due to BBN activity extending into the next day (contingent agreement to continue).
  - Emphasis on scenario aims, driver identification, and group reporting; similar voting and prioritization process; closing with steps forward and stakeholder communications.

## Data Governance, Access, and Sharing
- Plan to keep stakeholders informed via leaflets every two months (email, website, or mail) and to remain open to feedback.
- Deliverables include concise updates on changes and ongoing BBN/scenario structures.

## Key Lessons for Data Leaders
- Ensure consistent, comprehensive data capture across sites and sessions (dedicated, trained note-takers; consider full-day coverage).
- Balance qualitative data collection methods (notes, recordings, photos) with participant comfort and consent considerations.
- Maintain clear data governance around file naming, descriptions, and storage of workshop outputs (e.g., multiple .rtf files representing discrete workshop results).
- Document context and decisions clearly (why certain activities were or were not recorded; rationale for recording choices).
- Plan for stakeholder communications and iterative updates to maintain engagement and data transparency.
- Use structured, transparent methods for prioritizing data points (e.g., driver categories, voting schemes) to support reproducibility and future reuse.
