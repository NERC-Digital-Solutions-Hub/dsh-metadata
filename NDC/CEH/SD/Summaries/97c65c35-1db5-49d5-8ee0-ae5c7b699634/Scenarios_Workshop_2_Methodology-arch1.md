METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015 Pedro Zorrilla-Miras 2015 ACES PROJECT: LIVELIHOODS AND LAND USE CHANGE IN MOZAMBIQUE WP 1 AND WP5

- Overview
  - Document describes a database of qualitative data from five participatory workshops aimed at constructing scenarios of future land use change in rural Mozambique.
  - Led by University of Edinburgh; collaboration with Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and others; funded by ESPA (UK government funders NERC, ESRC, DfID).
  - Objectives: capture a wide range of variables affecting wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses; generate ideas for interventions to reduce forest loss and alleviate poverty; translate inputs into scenarios and outputs to inform future land use planning.

- Data structure
  - Five .rtf workshop reports containing qualitative results:
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_National_2014.rtf (Maputo, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_1_Province_2014_XaiXai.rtf (Xai Xai, 2014)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_National_2015.rtf (Maputo, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Lichinga.rtf (Lichinga, 2015)
    - Scenarios_Workshop_2_Province_2015_Quelimane.rtf (Quelimane, 2015)
  - File sizes indicate varying depths of content and detail.

- Quality control and data collection
  - Data gathered via notes by 1–3 participants; discussions sometimes audio-recorded with participant consent; photographs of materials.
  - Dual authorship for written results: first draft by a participant, reviewed by a second person; final approval by both, and official project validation.
  - Record-keeping included presentations, plenaries, and group work; some group discussions were not recorded.

- Development and implementation of the methodology
  - Methodology refined from two 2014 Scenarios workshops in Maputo and Xai-Xai.
  - Workshops conducted in Maputo (12 Aug 2015), Lichinga (4 Aug 2015), Quelimane (28–29 Oct 2015).
  - Participants included a broad range of stakeholders; full participant details provided at document end.
  - Context: aim to build robust inputs for future land use scenario construction, incorporating diverse viewpoints and local knowledge.

- Objectives of the workshops
  - Main: identify factors influencing wellbeing and their relationships to ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses; solicit feasible actions for poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
  - Secondary: ensure comprehensive variable coverage, later distill into key drivers; promote knowledge, stakeholder reflection, and voices of diverse stakeholders.
  - Specific aims:
    - Evaluate proposed scenarios from prior workshops.
    - Gather input to construct definitive future scenarios.
    - Collect perceptions of how scenarios could change land use.
    - Gather potential interventions under different scenarios to reduce land use change (forest loss) and support poverty alleviation.

- Outputs
  - Lists of proposed scenario changes; definitions of new scenarios.
  - Identified key drivers by groups and in plenary; agreed scenario outlines.
  - Inputs on drivers beyond the key set; list of interventions per scenario with stakeholder votes; potential common interventions across scenarios.
  - Tables detailing land use changes under each scenario; tables linking interventions to land use categories and their probable impacts.
  - Captured workshop discussions to reflect stakeholder concerns, understandings, and varying perspectives.

- Methodology and agenda
  - Timeline and workflow:
    - 29 June: Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh.
    - 25 July: Preparation in Maputo; 27 July: Pilot in Maputo.
    - 4–5 August: Provincial workshop (two parts: scenarios development and Bayesian Belief Network workshop).
  - Structure:
    - Participants divided into groups to ensure broad representation; recording of plenaries and presentations; some groups opted out of recording.
    - Terminology note: Bayesian networks referred to as “causal diagrams” or models for clarity with participants.

- Workshop methodology details
  - 2.1 Session: Scenarios refinement
    - Facilitator-led explanation of ACEs scenario process; presentation of three storylines and their drivers.
    - Five groups focused on thematic areas (social, environmental, political, economic, technological) using A0 sheets with scenario assumptions.
    - Guiding questions to assess plausibility, missing drivers, and potential adjustments.
    - Emphasis on explanatory plenary discussion; new drivers added if identified; group results shared and debated.

  - 2.2 Session: Effects of each scenario on land use change
    - Introduction to land use change; six groups divided into two methodological tracks (three groups per method).
    - First three groups: A0 sheet mapping land use categories, current area, and district-level change; discuss changes per land use under Scenarios A, B, and C; identify drivers and regulatory mechanisms; quantify percentage changes.
    - Second three groups: A0 sheet projecting evolution of land use, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing under the three scenarios; discuss, adjust, or challenge proposed evolutions; results tended to reflect most probable states, with limited inter-scenario differentiation; presentations followed by plenary discussion.

  - 2.3 Session: Effect of different spatial data on land use change in rural Mozambique in 2035
    - Presentation of spatial data maps (slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads/rails/rivers/villages) prepared by Mansour.
    - Three groups evaluated importance of spatial data for “installation” of each land use category; opportunities to propose additional relevant data.
    - Plenary discussion to reach agreement on the most important spatial data for 2035 land-use change.

- Participating institutions (Maputo and Quelimane)
  - Maputo participants included institutions such as FAEF-UEM, DINAF-DF, DPAZ/SPFFB, IIAM, CESE, Fundação MICAIA, MITADER-DINAB, ORAM, INGC, Oxfam, among others.
  - Quelimane participants included DPTADR-Zambézia, SPFFB, DPAZ, IIAM Zambezia, SPPP-DPAZ, and other local technical and academic partners.

- Relevance for analysts
  - Demonstrates a structured, participatory data collection process for qualitative scenario development.
  - Produces tangible outputs (scenario definitions, drivers, land-use change tables, intervention options) suitable for subsequent quantitative modelling and policy analysis.
  - Highlights data quality controls and the importance of transparent documentation, stakeholder engagement, and cross-checking through plenary reviews.
  - Provides insight into integrating diverse data types (qualitative narratives, A0 workshop artifacts, maps) to inform land-use planning and biodiversity conservation strategies.
