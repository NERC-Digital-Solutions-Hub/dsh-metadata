# METHOD FOLLOWED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SCENARIOS WORKSHOPS Mozambique: Maputo, Lichinga and Quelimane, 2015

## Introduction
- Describes the ACES project objective to construct scenarios of future rural land use change in Mozambique using a participatory approach.
- The database contains qualitative data from five workshops reporting on wellbeing, ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses.
- Project structure and collaboration: led by the University of Edinburgh with Universidad Eduardo Mondlane, IIED, and other partners; funded by the ESPA programme (NERC, ESRC, DfID).
- Data structure: five .rtf files capturing results from five workshops (national and provincial): Maputo 2014 (national), Xai-Xai 2014 (province), Maputo 2015 (national), Lichinga 2015 (province), Quelimane 2015 (province).
- Quality control: data collected via notes (1–3 people), post-workshop recordings with participant consent, photographs of materials; two researchers drafted and reviewed results; final approval by participants present.
- Methodology basis: built on two 2014 ACES workshops; follow-up workshops conducted in Maputo (12 Aug 2015), Lichinga (04 Aug 2015), and Quelimane (28 Oct 2015).

## Objective of the workshops
- Main aim: capture variables influencing wellbeing and their relationships with ecosystem services, miombo woodland, and land uses; identify actions to support poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation.
- Broader aims: ensure comprehensive inclusion of variables, refine and select the most important drivers, and generate insights for future scenarios.
- Specific objectives:
  - Evaluate proposed scenarios using input from previous workshops.
  - Gather input to construct definitive future scenarios.
  - Collect insights on how scenarios would alter land use.
  - Identify interventions under different scenarios to reduce land use change (forest loss) and improve poverty alleviation.

## Output
- List of proposed changes to scenarios.
- Key definitions for new scenarios.
- Selected drivers by groups and in plenary.
- Agreed overarching narratives (“big pictures”) for the scenarios.
- Input on drivers beyond the key ones.
- List of interventions under each scenario, with votes on relevance by individuals and groups; potential common interventions if time allows.
- Tables showing land use changes under each scenario.
- Tables linking interventions to land use categories and their probable impacts.
- Documentation of workshop discussions to capture stakeholder concerns, understandings, and diverse viewpoints.

## Methodology and Agenda

### 29th June: Pilot Workshop in Edinburgh
### 25th July: Preparation meeting with facilitator team in Maputo
### 27th July: Pilot workshop in Maputo
### 4th–5th August: Provincial workshop (two days)
- Day 1: Scenarios workshop
- Day 2: Bayesian networks (BBN) workshop
- Participants divided into three groups per workshop to ensure broad representation of interests
- Most parts audio-recorded (participants allowed recording for group work; some groups declined); all plenary presentations and debates were recorded
- Terminology: Bayesian belief networks were presented as “causal diagrams” or models to improve comprehension

Table 1: Agenda highlights included
- Opening and aims; quick participant introductions
- Introduction to ACEs and scenarios; presentation of three storylines
- Group work on refining scenarios across five thematic areas (social, environmental, political, economic, technological)
- Group reports and plenary discussion
- Session on effects of each scenario on land use change; group analyses and reporting
- Final conclusions and closing

## Workshop methodology followed

### 2.1 Session on Scenarios refinement
- Facilitator-led plenary explanation of ACEs scenario process and three storylines.
- Participants split into five thematic groups (social, environmental, political, economic, technological) using A0 sheets with scenario assumptions and guiding questions (plausibility, missing drivers, necessary adjustments).
- Groups discussed, commented, and suggested changes; encouraged oral plenary explanations and facilitator clarifications.
- Post-session procedure allowed addition of new drivers if any were missing; groups then presented results to others and engaged in brief discussion.

### 2.2 Session on Effects of each scenario on land use change
- Land use change introduction followed by six groups.
- Three groups used one method per scenario (A, B, C) on A0 working documents showing current land use categories, district-level changes, and drivers; discussed drivers and regulatory mechanisms; estimated percentage change per land use class under each scenario.
- Three additional groups examined the evolution of land use changes, ecosystem services, and rural wellbeing under the three scenarios; group reviews and proposed adjustments.
- Outcomes: results tended to converge on the most probable future states rather than distinct scenario-specific futures; plenary presentations followed by discussion.
- Key takeaway: participants treated scenarios as plausible narratives, not predictions.

### 2.3 Session on Effect of different spatial data on land use change in rural Mozambique in 2035
- Presentation of how spatial data influence land use change (maps of slope, aspect, altitude, distance to roads/railways/rivers).
- Data prepared by researchers; participants divided into three groups to assess the importance of spatial data for establishing land use categories; groups were invited to suggest additional relevant data.
- Plenary session to reach agreement on the most important spatial data for 2035 land use change.
- Participating institutions and collaborators listed for Maputo and Quelimane workshops (abbreviated in the document).

## Additional notes
- The document emphasizes that the workshops sought broad stakeholder engagement to inform a data-rich, scenario-based understanding of land use change, with an explicit focus on policy-relevant interventions and monitoring of data quality and relevance.
- The outputs are designed to support iterative refinement of scenarios and to capture diverse stakeholder concerns for future landscape planning in Mozambique.
