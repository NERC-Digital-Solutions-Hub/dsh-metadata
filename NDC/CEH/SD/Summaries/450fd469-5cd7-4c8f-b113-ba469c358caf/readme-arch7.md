# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021.

## Overview
- A multi-country, expert-based initiative to map stakeholders related to six invasive non-native species (INNS) case studies across Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
- Aims to identify stakeholder influence and interest to tailor engagement strategies.

## Methods
- 19 experts completed individual stakeholder spreadsheets using the template INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv and guidance from INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx.
- Two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) to discuss and revise results, followed by two rounds of updates to produce consensus stakeholder spreadsheets.
- Stakeholders were classified into four types based on influence and interest: context settlers, crowd, key players, and subjects.
- Anonymised data were produced for sharing; final consensus datasets and strategies were published.

## Datasets and Content
- INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv
  - Contains one row per stakeholder per case study/species/country.
  - Key columns include: GeneralID, ID, Name of the stakeholder (anonymised), Stakeholder category (10 broad categories), Target species, Country, Region, Stakeholder's scale (International, National, Regional, Local), primary/secondary areas of interest, Land ownership (1–5), Perceived influence (1–5), negative/positive impacts (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) (1–5) with descriptive text fields, relationships with other stakeholders (anonymised), NEGATIVE IMPACTS, POSITIVE IMPACTS, LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL, LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL, Stakeholder classification.
  - Data are anonymised to protect privacy.
- INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx
  - Instructions for completing the stakeholder spreadsheet; explains column meanings (pages 4–6 of the document).
- INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv
  - CSV version of the example stakeholder spreadsheet used by participants.
  - CSV includes only the Data Base sheet (originally also contained an Influence-Interest Matrix sheet in Excel).
- Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv
  - Contains final, agreed engagement strategies by target species and stakeholder classification.
  - Columns: Target species, Stakeholder classification, Strategy description, Method/class (Active involvement, co-planning, communication, education, networking, policy).
- Example-EngagementStrategies.pdf
  - PDF template illustrating a completed engagement strategies matrix for the four stakeholder types, plus an empty matrix example and a completed Brazil case example.

## Stakeholder Types and Classification
- Four stakeholder types used for engagement planning:
  - Context settlers
  - Crowd
  - Key players
  - Subjects
- Classification is based on LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL and LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL, calculated from positive/negative impacts and other indicators per the guidance document.

## Engagement Strategies
- Strategies are tailored to each stakeholder type and target INNS.
- Strategies described in Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv, with category assignments in the corresponding stakeholder type column.
- The accompanying Example-EngagementStrategies.pdf provides a template and example of how strategies are structured and applied.

## Data Privacy and Accessibility
- All data anonymised to preserve stakeholder privacy.
- Data and accompanying guidance files are freely available for sharing and reuse.

## Implications for GIS and Data Visualization
- The dataset structure aligns with GIS-style attribute mapping (categories, scales, interests, influence, and impact scores) allowing integration with spatial layers (regions, countries, scales).
- Enables spatially informed engagement planning by linking stakeholder influence/interests to regional INNS management needs and policy contexts.
- Supports creation of map-based visualizations and dashboards to illustrate stakeholder distributions, potential engagement hotspots, and strategy coverage across case studies.
