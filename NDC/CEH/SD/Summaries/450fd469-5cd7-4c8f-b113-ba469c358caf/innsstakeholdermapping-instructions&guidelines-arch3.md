# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose
  - To evaluate stakeholders’ knowledge, perceptions, practices, awareness, and needs relating to invasive alien species (IAS) to inform shared goals and effective IAS management.
  - To engage multiple stakeholder groups early, identify who is affected or can affect IAS decisions, and prioritize involvement.

- Key approach
  - Categorize stakeholders by influence and interest to guide engagement (Key players, Context setters, Subjects, Crowd).
  - Use a standardized, transparent process that can be applied across case studies and countries to support cross-case learning and co-design of management strategies.

## 1. Background information

- IAS management benefits from understanding stakeholder knowledge, perceptions, practices, awareness, and needs.
- Stakeholder engagement is emphasized by international and regional frameworks (e.g., Convention on Biological Diversity).
- A systematic stakeholder analysis identifies affected and influential groups and prioritizes involvement to shape policy and actions.

## 2. Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project (objectives)

- A: Provide a standardized platform for CONTAIN researchers to develop stakeholder mappings for case studies.
- B: Deliver an instrument to enable cross-country comparisons of IAS contexts and identify commonalities/differences in management needs.
- C: Support Work Package 4 (co-design management strategies with stakeholders and researchers for emerging, data-sparse IAS).

## 3. Step 1: Stakeholder brainstorming

- Researchers identify all organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in their case studies.
- Stakeholders are defined as organizations or groups affected by or able to affect decisions or actions.
- Researchers should be thorough, using literature, institutional publications, websites, and other sources. If necessary, key informants may be consulted.
- Example stakeholder categories include: Government bodies, industry/producers groups, media, landowners/managers, national advisory groups, research organizations, professional bodies, NGOs, and community groups.

## 3.1 Step 1 – Stakeholder identification prompts

- Questions to identify stakeholders:
  - Who will be affected by the project or target IAS?
  - Who has power to influence outcomes?
  - Who are potential allies or opponents?
  - Are there voices that may be underheard?
  - Who can facilitate or impede outcomes through participation, non-participation, or opposition?
  - Who can contribute financial, technical, or other resources?
- When listing stakeholders, categorize individuals into broader groups (e.g., smallholders vs. large landowners).

## 3.2 Step 2: Building a stakeholder database and variables

- Researchers compile a main Excel database with data from secondary sources or their knowledge.
- Key dimensions and variables to capture (examples):
  - Name of organization
  - Target IAS species
  - Country
  - Eco-region
  - Area of interest (environmental sustainability, social development, natural resource management, governance/policy, academia, agriculture/forestry, tourism, etc.)
  - Conception of nature (based on Kellert’s eight-factor model: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
  - Management experience (previous IAS management experience)
  - Level of influence (proxy: land ownership; and perceived influence)
  - Perceived level of influence on IAS decisions (5-point scale from not at all influential to extremely influential)
  - Impacts of IAS (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) – perceived impacts on stakeholders, each rated on a 5-point scale (Extreme to Minor)
  - Level of interest (stakeholders’ perceived interest, 5-point scale)
  - Relationships among stakeholders (record three groups/institutions each stakeholder has interacted with)
- Attitudinal and impact data draw on prior work (e.g., Bariloche 2019) to gauge stakeholder predispositions and potential concerns.

## 3.3 Step 3: Measuring influence and interest; creating the matrix

- How to measure Level of Influence:
  - Level of Influence = average of (Land ownership) and (Perceived level of influence)
- How to measure Level of Interest:
  - Level of Interest = maximum score across all impact types (ecological, economic, socio-cultural, positive and negative)
- Output: an interest/influence matrix to guide engagement prioritization and collaboration efforts.

## 4. Outputs and applications

- Provides a standardized platform for documenting and comparing stakeholder landscapes across case studies and countries.
- Produces a practical instrument to support cross-case learning and alignment of management strategies.
- Supports Work Package 4 by enabling co-design of IAS management strategies with stakeholders and researchers, especially where data are sparse.
- Emphasizes secondary data use, with an option to collect primary data via questionnaires if deeper insight is needed.
