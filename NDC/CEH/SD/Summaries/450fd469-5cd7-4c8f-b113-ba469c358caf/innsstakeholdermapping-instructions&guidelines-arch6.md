# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose: Identify, categorize, and prioritize stakeholders with an interest or influence on invasive alien species (IAS) management to support co-designed strategies and cross-country comparisons.

- Context: Engaging multiple stakeholder groups is essential for IAS management; early stakeholder analysis helps understand knowledge, perceptions, practices, and needs, guiding shared goals and effective governance.

- Outputs and aims of the analysis platform:
  - Standardized platform for researchers to develop stakeholder maps for case studies.
  - Instrument to compare countries and IAS contexts to find commonalities and differences.
  - Support for co-designing management strategies with stakeholders and researchers, especially for data-sparse, high-demand IAS contexts.

- Step 1: Stakeholder brainstorming
  - Researchers list all organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in their case studies.
  - Stakeholders are defined as organizations or groups affected by or able to affect decisions or actions.
  - Encourage broad identification across social, productive, and institutional groups; categorize individual actors into larger groups if needed.
  - Use prompts to identify stakeholders (who is affected, who can influence, allies/opponents, voices underheard, resources contributed).

- Step 1: Potential stakeholder categories (examples)
  - Government departments, agencies, politicians
  - Industry/producers associations
  - Media
  - Landowners and managers
  - National representative/advisory groups
  - Research organizations
  - Professional groups and associations
  - NGOs
  - Community groups

- Step 2: Central stakeholder database and variables
  - Build an Excel-based database to store stakeholder information (based on secondary data or researchers’ knowledge).
  - Key data fields include:
    - Name and basic stakeholder data
    - Target IAS/species
    - Country and eco-region
    - Stakeholder area of interest (e.g., environmental conservation, governance, agriculture, tourism, etc.)
    - Conception of nature (eight-factor model variants inspired by Kellert’s typology: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
    - Management experience (previous IAS management experience; yes/no/NA)
    - Level of influence (proxy from land ownership and perceived influence)
    - Impacts of IAS (ecological, economic, socio-cultural; negative/positive, with subtypes)
    - Level of interest (perceived stakeholder interest across impact types)
    - Relationships with other stakeholders (three example groups)
  - Data scales:
    - Land ownership: scale reflecting ownership size (e.g., large to none)
    - Perceived influence: 5-point scale (not at all influential to extremely influential)
    - Impacts: 5-point scale (extreme to minor) across ecological, economic, socio-cultural dimensions
    - Level of interest: 5-point scale (very interested to not interested)
  - Step 2 Note: Fields are designed to capture a comprehensive, multi-dimensional view of stakeholders to support robust analysis.

- Step 3: Influence and interest scoring
  - Level of Influence = average of Land Ownership and Perceived Level of Influence
  - Level of Interest = maximum score across impact types (ecological, economic, socio-cultural), reflecting overall stake
  - Result: An interest/influence matrix to prioritize engagement and co-design opportunities

- Outputs and data products
  - An organized stakeholder database (Excel) for each case study
  - Stakeholder mapping categorized by influence and interest (Key players, Context setters, Subjects, Crowd)
  - An interest/influence matrix to guide engagement strategies and co-design activities
  - A framework enabling cross-country comparisons and WP4 co-design planning
  - Potential for primary data collection via questionnaires to deepen understanding

- Data collection sources and quality considerations
  - Primary approach: secondary data (researcher knowledge, websites, publications, institutional reports)
  - Optional: questionnaire to collect first-hand data
  - Emphasis on thoroughness in Step 1 to ensure a comprehensive stakeholder list
  - Guidance and prompts provided to aid stakeholder identification

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - Time required to thoroughly understand who counts as a stakeholder
  - Data gaps due to patchy information across contexts
  - Accessing information from diverse systems and sources
  - Communicating complex stakeholder data simply and effectively
  - Ensuring outputs are used and promoted for impact

- References and background context
  - Foundational work on stakeholder analysis and engagement in IAS management (e.g., Reed, Shackleton, Novoa; Kreuter et al.)
  - Frameworks for evaluating stakeholder influence, interest, and relationships to support governance of IAS management

- Relevance for data practice
  - Demonstrates a structured, data-driven approach to stakeholder analysis that yields actionable data products (maps, matrices, databases)
  - Aligns with Data Support aims by enabling non-specialist users to access, interpret, and act on stakeholder data for IAS management
  - Encourages data quality, provenance, and standardization to support reuse across case studies and time.
