# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021

## Overview
- A multi-case study project (six invasive non-native species case studies across Argentina, Brazil, and Chile) conducted in 2021 to map stakeholders and develop tailored engagement strategies.
- Data and outputs are anonymised to preserve privacy and enable data sharing; all data are freely available.

## Methodology
- Participants: 19 experts who mapped stakeholders for the six case studies.
- Process:
  - Each expert completed independent stakeholder spreadsheets based on INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv following guidance in INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx.
  - Two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) to discuss and revise results, followed by two rounds of updates.
  - Consensus stakeholder spreadsheets produced for each case study.
- Stakeholder classification:
  - Four categories based on influence and interest: context settlers, crowd, key players, and subjects.
- Outputs:
  - Consensus stakeholder dataset per case study (INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv).
  - Stakeholder engagement strategies tailored to the four categories (Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv) using guidance from ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf.

## Data structure and contents
- File: INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv
  - Each row represents a stakeholder for a specific invasive non-native species in a given country.
  - Key columns (examples):
    - GeneralID, ID, Stakeholder name (anonymised), Stakeholder category (e.g., government, NGOs, research, landowners, etc.).
    - Target species, Country, Region, Stakeholder's scale (international to local).
    - Primary and secondary areas of interest (academic, agriculture, governance, natural resources, social development, tourism, etc.).
    - Land ownership, perceived level of influence, and levels of negative/positive ecological, economic, and socio-cultural impacts (1–5 scales).
    - Open fields for describing negative and positive impacts and relationships with other stakeholders (anonymised).
    - Calculated fields: NEGATIVE IMPACTS, POSITIVE IMPACTS, LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL, LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL, Stakeholder classification (context settlers, crowd, key players, subjects).
- File: INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx
  - Instructions and meanings for the dataset columns.
- File: INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv
  - Template used by experts (data base only; original Excel included an additional “Influence Interest Matrix” sheet in the template).
- File: Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv
  - Engagement strategies by target species and stakeholder classification.
  - Columns: Target species, Stakeholder classification, Strategy description, Method/class (e.g., Active involvement, co-planning, communication, education, networking, policy).
- File: Example-EngagementStrategies.pdf
  - Provides an empty engagement-matrix template and a completed example (for Brazil case study on invasive plants).
- File: INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv (final dataset)
  - Aggregates results across all six case studies, with anonymised stakeholder information and standardized fields to support cross-case analysis.

## Engagement framework and outputs
- Stakeholder engagement strategies are organism- and category-specific, derived from consensus mappings.
- Outputs include: 
  - Final lists of stakeholder engagement strategies (Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv).
  - An anonymised, shareable dataset (INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv) for transparency and replication.

## Data governance and sharing
- All data anonymised to protect privacy.
- Data described as freely available for sharing and reuse.
- Documentation provided to enable replication (instructions, templates, and example matrices).

## Implications for data leadership
- Demonstrates a structured, participatory approach to mapping stakeholders across multi-country, multi-case data.
- Highlights the importance of clear data governance: anonymisation, metadata consistency, and documented workflows to enable cross-case comparability and reuse.
- Provides a ready-made template and workflow for similar stakeholder mapping and engagement planning in other domains, supporting scalable data-driven engagement strategies.
