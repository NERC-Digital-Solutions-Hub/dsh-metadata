# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021.

- Overview
  - Study engaging 19 experts across six case studies of invasive non-native species (INNS) in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile (2021).
  - Objective: map stakeholders, categorize by influence and interest, and develop tailored engagement strategies to support INNS management and policy performance.
  - All data anonymised to preserve stakeholder privacy; freely available for sharing and reuse.

- Methods and process
  - Stakeholder data collection
    - Each expert completed individual stakeholder spreadsheets based on INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv and guidance in INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx.
  - Consensus-building
    - Two facilitated virtual workshops to discuss and revise results.
    - Two rounds of updating individual spreadsheets, culminating in consensus stakeholder spreadsheets for all six case studies.
  - Stakeholder categorisation
    - Stakeholders classified into four categories: context settlers, crowd, key players, and subjects, based on level of influence and level of interest.
  - Engagement strategies
    - Developed stakeholder engagement strategies tailored to each of the four types, following guidance from ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf.
    - Final engagement strategies compiled in Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv.

- Data products and contents

- Outputs and how they support monitoring
  - Standardised stakeholder map aligned with INNS management aims to monitor environmental health and policy performance through stakeholder dynamics.
  - Tailored engagement strategies by stakeholder type to support governance, policy uptake, and collaboration in INNS control across Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
  - Anonymised datasets suitable for integration with other environmental datasets while protecting privacy.
  - Clear documentation and templates to enable replication in future environmental monitoring initiatives.

- Data governance and accessibility
  - All stakeholder data anonymised to preserve privacy.
  - Datasets described as freely available to support broader environmental monitoring and stakeholder engagement efforts.

- Relevance to the archetype (Analysts Monitoring the Environment)
  - Demonstrates a rigorous, data-driven approach to monitoring the social-and-policy dimension of environmental health by mapping stakeholders and designing engagement strategies.
  - Provides a replicable framework for collecting, validating, and aggregating stakeholder data, then transforming it into actionable outputs (consensus datasets and engagement plans).
  - Addresses key monitoring challenges: ensuring data quality and standardisation, enabling access to underlying data, and increasing the value of monitoring datasets through structured synthesis and governance outputs.
