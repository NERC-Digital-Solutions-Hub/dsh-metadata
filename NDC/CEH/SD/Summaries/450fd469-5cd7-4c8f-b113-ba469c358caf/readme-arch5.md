# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021.

## Overview
- A study mapping stakeholders across six case studies of invasive non-native species (INNS) in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
- Aimed to inform tailored engagement strategies and strengthen stakeholder governance around INNS management.
- Data and analyses were produced through an expert-driven, iterative process and are anonymised for sharing.

## Data and structure
- Core dataset: INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv
  - Rows correspond to individual stakeholders for a given INNS, species, and country.
  - Key fields include: GeneralID, ID, anonymised Name, Stakeholder category, Target species, Country, Region, Stakeholder's scale, primary and secondary areas of interest, land ownership, perceived influence, various negative/positive impact ratings (ecological, economic, socio-cultural), open-text descriptions of impacts, relationships with other stakeholders, and final classifications.
  - Calculated fields: NEGATIVE IMPACTS, POSITIVE IMPACTS, LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL, LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL, Stakeholder classification (context settlers, crowd, key players, subjects).
- Engagement strategies dataset: Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv
  - Columns include: Target species, Stakeholder classification, Strategy description, and Method/class (e.g., Active involvement, co-planning, communication, education, networking, policy).
- Documentation and templates referenced for data collection and interpretation:
  - INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx
  - INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv (template)
  - ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf (empty matrix example and a completed example)

## Data collection and curation process
- Participants: 19 experts working on six case studies.
- Method: Individual stakeholder spreadsheets completed independently following provided guidelines.
- Iterative refinement: two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) plus two rounds of spreadsheet updates after discussions, leading to consensus stakeholder spreadsheets per case study.
- Output: Final consensus datasets and engagement strategies, anonymised to protect privacy.

## Stakeholder classification and engagement
- Stakeholder categorisation in the final dataset uses four classes based on influence and interest: context settlers, crowd, key players, and subjects.
- Engagement strategies are tailored to these four stakeholder types, following the example matrices provided in the project files.

## Privacy, ethics and data sharing
- All stakeholder data are anonymised to preserve privacy and facilitate data sharing.
- Data are freely available for use, with accompanying guidance to understand column meanings and classification schemes.

## Files and documentation (summary)
- INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv: anonymised stakeholder-level mapping for six INNS case studies.
- Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv: final engagement strategies by stakeholder type and target species.
- INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx: guidance on completing the dataset and interpreting columns.
- INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv: template used by experts to collect data.
- ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf: empty and example matrix for engagement strategies.

## Relevance for Data Stewards
- Demonstrates a structured, governance-focused approach to collecting, standardising, and sharing stakeholder data across multiple case studies.
- Emphasises metadata clarity, standardised classifications (influence, interest, stakeholder types), and explicit open data practices (anonymisation, anonymised identifiers, and documented procedures).
- Provides a reproducible workflow for stakeholder mapping and engagement planning, including templates and guidelines to ensure consistency and interoperability.
- Highlights the importance of aligning data collection with clear downstream use (targeted engagement strategies) while safeguarding privacy and enabling reuse.
