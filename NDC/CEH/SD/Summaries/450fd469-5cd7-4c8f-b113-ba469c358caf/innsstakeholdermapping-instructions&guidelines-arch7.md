# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose: Establish a standardized, organized methodology to identify, map, and prioritize stakeholders for IAS management across case studies; enable cross-country comparisons and support co-design of management strategies with stakeholders.
- Audience and outcomes: Aids CONTAIN researchers in stakeholder mapping, prioritization, and engagement planning; aims to facilitate cross-country learning and data sharing.

## Key concepts and stakeholder categories

- Four stakeholder categories:
  - Key players: high influence and high interest
  - Context setters: high influence but low interest
  - Subjects: high interest but low influence
  - Crowd: low influence and low interest
- Stakeholders can be organizations or groups; individual actors should be linked to broader groups where appropriate (e.g., landowners, industry bodies).

## Overall approach

- Use secondary data (researcher knowledge, websites, publications) for the initial round; questionnaires may be used later to collect primary data.
- Deliverables:
  - A standardized platform for stakeholder mapping per case study
  - An instrument to compare countries and IAS situations
  - Support for co-design work packages with stakeholders and researchers

## Step 1: Stakeholder identification (brainstorm)

- Conduct a thorough brainstorming to list all organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in the case studies.
- Include broad groups and encourage mapping individuals to larger organizations (e.g., smallholders, associations).
- Use prompts to identify stakeholders:
  - Who is affected or can affect the IAS project?
  - Who has power to influence outcomes?
  - Allies, opponents, voices that may be unheard?
  - Who can facilitate or impede outcomes through participation or opposition?
  - Who can contribute resources (financial, technical, etc.)?
- Example stakeholder categories:
  - Government departments, agencies, politicians
  - Industry/producers associations
  - Media
  - Land owners and managers
  - National representative/advisory groups
  - Research organizations
  - Professional groups and their bodies
  - NGOs
  - Community groups

## Step 2: Building the stakeholder database

- Use an Excel spreadsheet as the main database to store and analyze stakeholder information (based on secondary sources or prior knowledge).
- Core variables and data fields:
  - Name of the organization
  - Target species
  - Country
  - Eco-region
  - Stakeholder area of interest (categories such as environmental sustainability, social development, resource management, governance, research, agriculture, tourism, etc.)
  - Conception of nature (eight-factor model inspired by Kellert’s typology: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
  - Management experience (previous IAS management experience)
  - Level of influence (proxy combining land ownership and perceived influence)
  - Land ownership category (scale from large landowners to no land)
  - Perceived level of influence on IAS decisions (5-point scale)
  - Impacts of IAS (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) on stakeholders (perceived, 5-point scale for each type)
  - Level of interest (5-point scale; maximum across impact types)
  - Relationships with other stakeholders (list three groups or institutions)
- Data collection relies on secondary sources or researchers’ knowledge; primary data via a questionnaire can be added if needed.

## Step 3: Measuring influence and interest

- Level of Influence (L): average of
  - V8: Land ownership category (proxy for influence)
  - V9: Perceived level of influence of stakeholders
  - L = (V8 + V9) / 2
- Level of Interest (I): maximum value across all impact types (V10–V15)
- Output: An interest/influence matrix to prioritize engagement and co-design efforts

## Outputs and application

- Produce an interest/influence matrix to identify which stakeholders to prioritize in engagement and co-design activities.
- The framework supports cross-country comparisons of stakeholder landscapes and helps identify commonalities/differences in IAS management approaches.

## References and framing

- Foundations for stakeholder analysis and engagement in IAS management draw on works by Shackleton et al., Reed et al., Novoa et al., and related governance literature.
- Specific methodological prompts and categories are provided to structure stakeholder identification, data collection, and influence/interest assessment.
