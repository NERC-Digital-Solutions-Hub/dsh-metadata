# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021

## Overview
- Study engaging 19 experts to map stakeholders across six invasive non-native species (INNS) case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
- Aim to produce consensus stakeholder maps and tailored engagement strategies to support INNS management.

## Data collection and workflow
- Each expert completed individual stakeholder spreadsheets using the template INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv, guided by INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx.
- Two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) to discuss and revise results.
- Two rounds of updating stakeholder spreadsheets post-workshops.
- Deliverables:
  - Six consensus stakeholder spreadsheets (one per case study).
  - Final aggregated dataset: INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv (anonymised).

## Stakeholder classification and outputs
- Stakeholders classified by influence and interest into four categories: context settlers, crowd, key players, and subjects.
- Engagement strategies developed for each stakeholder type based on the consensus datasets.
- Final engagement strategies list: Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv.
- Engagement strategies framework and examples provided in ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf.

## Data privacy and sharing
- All data anonymised to protect stakeholder privacy and enable data sharing.

## Contents and structure of key files
- INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv
  - Rows: one stakeholder per target INNS species per country.
  - Key columns (examples): GeneralID, ID, anonymised "Name of the stakeholder", stakeholder category (10 broad categories), target species, country, region, stakeholder scale, primary/secondary areas of interest, land ownership, perceived influence, negative/positive impacts (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) across negative and positive dimensions, relationship indicators, and final scores (LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL, LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL) plus Stakeholder classification.
  - Includes both impact assessments and anonymised descriptive fields.
- INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx
  - Provides detailed guidance on column meanings and scoring.
- INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv
  - Template used by participants; CSV version contains only the Data Base sheet (originally with two sheets: Data Base and Influence-Interest Matrix).
- Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv
  - Columns include: Target species, Stakeholder classification, Strategy description, and Method/class (e.g., Active involvement, co-planning, communication, education, networking, policy).
- Example-EngagementStrategies.pdf
  - Contains an empty matrix template for four stakeholder types and an example completed matrix (Brazil INNS case).

## Practical implications for data support
- Demonstrates end-to-end data workflow: data collection, cleaning, anonymisation, stakeholder classification, and linkage to actionable engagement strategies.
- Provides a repeatable model for stakeholder data management in biodiversity and INNS projects.
- Supports organisations in mapping stakeholders and designing engagement plans while enabling anonymised data sharing.
