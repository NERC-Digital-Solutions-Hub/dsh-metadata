# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021.

- Study scope: Stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies across six case studies of invasive non-native species (INNS) in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
- Objective for analysts: Identify stakeholders, assess influence and interest, and develop data-driven engagement strategies to support INNS management.

## Data and contents

- Primary dataset: INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv
  - Rows: one stakeholder per INNS case-study-country combination.
  - Key columns:
    - GeneralID, ID (case-study level)
    - Anonymised "Name of the stakeholder"
    - Stakeholder category (e.g., government, NGOs, landowners, researchers, etc.)
    - Target species (INNS)
    - Country and Region
    - Stakeholder's scale (International to Local)
    - Stakeholder's primary and secondary areas of interest (e.g., academic, governance, environment, natural resource management, tourism)
    - Land ownership (1–5)
    - Perceived level of influence (1–5)
    - Magnitude of negative impacts (ecological, economic, socio-cultural; 1–5)
    - Magnitude of positive impacts (ecological, economic, socio-cultural; 1–5)
    - Further description fields (open text; anonymised)
    - Relationships with other stakeholders (anonymised; 3 fields)
    - NEGATIVE IMPACTS and POSITIVE IMPACTS: aggregate indicators
    - LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL and LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL
    - Stakeholder classification: context settlers, crowd, key players, subjects
- Supporting guidelines and templates:
  - INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx: Detailed meaning and interpretation of each column; instructions for scoring and classification.
  - INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv: CSV version of the example stakeholder spreadsheet used by participants (Data Base and Influence-Interest Matrix sheets in the original Excel file; the CSV version includes only Data Base).
  - ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf: Example matrix showing engagement strategies by stakeholder type (four categories) and by target species.
  - Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv: Final, agreed engagement strategies by target species, stakeholder classification, strategy description, and method/class.
- Output files:
  - INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv: Final anonymised stakeholder dataset for six INNS case-studies.
  - Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv: Final engagement strategies by stakeholder type per target species.
- Accessibility: All data are anonymised and freely available.

## Methods and workflow

- Participant base: Nineteen experts across six INNS case studies contributed data.
- Data collection:
  - Used individual stakeholder spreadsheets (based on INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv).
  - Experts completed independently following provided guidelines.
- Validation and consensus:
  - Two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) to discuss and revise results.
  - Two rounds of updating stakeholder spreadsheets after workshops.
  - Produced consensus stakeholder spreadsheets and final stakeholder classifications.
- Stakeholder classification:
  - Four categories based on LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL and LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL:
    - Context settlers
    - Crowd
    - Key players
    - Subjects
- Engagement planning:
  - Developed stakeholder engagement strategies tailored to each of the four categories using a standardized approach (ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf as reference).
  - Final engagement strategies compiled in Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv.

## Analytical approach for analysts

- Data structure and scoring:
  - Quantitative scores for negative and positive impacts (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) scale 1–5.
  - Aggregate NEGATIVE IMPACTS and POSITIVE IMPACTS columns to inform LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL.
  - LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL computed per the instructions in the guidelines.
- Derived outputs:
  - Level of interest and influence used to classify stakeholders into the four categories.
  - Anonymised stakeholder names allow cross-case synthesis without revealing identities.
- Intended use:
  - Inform and tailor engagement and policy/management actions for INNS across different stakeholder groups.
  - Enable comparability across countries, regions, and species.

## Outputs and how to use them

- Datasets:
  - INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv: Core data for analysis and reporting; use to map stakeholder networks, priorities, and potential leverage points.
  - Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv: Practical engagement actions by stakeholder type and target species; supports planning and implementation.
- Templates and guidance:
  - INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx: Reference for interpreting columns and scoring.
  - INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv and ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf: Templates and example formats to replicate or adapt.
- Practical application:
  - Analysts can identify high-influence, high-interest stakeholders for targeted engagement.
  - Use engagement strategies to design outreach, co-planning, education, and policy initiatives aligned with stakeholder priorities.
  - Anonymised data support sharing and reproducibility while protecting privacy.
