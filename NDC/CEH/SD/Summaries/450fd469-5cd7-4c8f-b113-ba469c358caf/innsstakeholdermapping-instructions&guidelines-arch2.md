# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose: To evaluate stakeholders' knowledge, perceptions, practices, awareness, and needs related to invasive alien species (IAS) to inform shared goals and effective IAS management. Emphasizes early engagement and systematic identification of groups affected by or capable of influencing IAS decisions.

- Key concepts:
  - Stakeholder analysis is a process to identify affected or influential groups and prioritize involvement.
  - Stakeholders are categorized by influence and interest: Key players (high influence, high interest), Context setters (high influence, low interest), Subjects (high interest, low influence), and the Crowd (low influence, low interest).

- Aims of the CONTAIN stakeholder analysis:
  - A) Provide a standardized platform for researchers to map and prioritize stakeholders across case studies.
  - B) Deliver a cross-country instrument to compare IAS situations and management overlaps.
  - C) Support Work Package 4 (co-design management strategies with stakeholders and researchers) for current and emerging IAS.

- Data and methods:
  - Primary approach relies on secondary data (researcher knowledge, websites, papers, institutional publications), with a questionnaire available for additional first-hand data if needed.

- Step 1: Stakeholder identification
  - Conduct thorough brainstorming to create a comprehensive stakeholder list, including organizations, groups, and individuals affected by IAS or who can influence outcomes.
  - Consider categorization into larger groups (e.g., government, industry, landowners, researchers, NGOs, community groups).
  - Use prompts to identify stakeholders: who is affected, who can influence outcomes, allies/opponents, voices that may be unheard, facilitators or barriers to outcomes, and potential resource contributors.
  - Example stakeholder categories: Government bodies, industry associations, media, landowners, national advisory groups, research organizations, professional bodies, NGOs, and community groups.

- Step 2: Data collection and variable framework
  - Build a central Excel database to store stakeholder information, primarily from secondary sources (or researcher knowledge) and optionally enhanced with first-hand data.
  - Key variables include:
    - Name and basic data
    - Target IAS species
    - Country and eco-region
    - Area of interest (environmental sustainability, social development, natural resource management, governance/policy, academic/research, agriculture/forestry, tourism, etc.)
    - Conception of nature (based on Kellert’s eight-factor model: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
    - Management experience (previous IAS management experience: Yes/No/NA)
    - Level of influence (proxied by land ownership category and perceived influence)
      - Land ownership categories (e.g., large landowners/companies, large/small, etc.)
      - Perceived level of influence on IAS decision-making (5-point scale)
    - Impacts of IAS (per stakeholder): negative ecological, negative economic, negative socio-cultural; positive ecological, positive economic, positive socio-cultural (each rated on a 5-point scale)
    - Level of interest: overall perceived stakeholder interest (5-point scale)
    - Relationships with other stakeholders: up to 3 groups/institutions each stakeholder has had a relationship with

- Step 3: Measuring influence and interest; constructing the matrix
  - Level of Influence: average of Land ownership (V8) and Perceived level of influence (V9).
  - Level of Interest: maximum score across impact types (V10–V15).
  - Output: an interest/influence matrix to guide engagement and co-design activities.
  - Rationale: combines ownership power and perceived influence with stakeholder stakes (impacts) to prioritize involvement and resource allocation.

- Practical outcomes and usage
  - Provides a standardized, comparable platform to identify and prioritize actors across case studies and countries.
  - Enables cross-country comparisons of IAS management needs and stakeholder dynamics.
  - Supports strategies for engaging stakeholders in IAS management and in developing potential, data-informed management actions (WP4).
