# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose: Identify, categorize, and map stakeholders with influence and interest to inform IAS (invasive alien species) management and co-design strategies. Emphasizes engaging multiple stakeholder groups as required by global biodiversity strategies.

## Key concepts for Data Stewards

- Standardized data collection: Uses an Excel-based database to store stakeholder information consistently for cross-case comparability.
- Stakeholder categorization: Four categories to prioritize engagement — Key players (high influence, high interest), Context setters (high influence, low interest), Subjects (low influence, high interest), and the Crowd (low influence, low interest).
- Data provenance and governance: Primary data can be supplemented with secondary sources; potential for a questionnaire to gather primary data; clear definitions and metadata for each variable to ensure reproducibility.

## Objectives of the stakeholder analysis

- Provide a standardized platform for researchers to map stakeholders per case study.
- Enable country-level comparisons across IAS situations to identify commonalities and differences.
- Support co-design of management strategies with stakeholders and researchers, especially for data-sparse situations with high societal demand.

## Methodology overview

- Approach: Primarily secondary data plus researcher knowledge; optional direct data collection via questionnaires.
- Output: An instrument to compare stakeholders across countries and inform stakeholder engagement and management strategies.

## Step 1: Stakeholder brainstorming and identification

- Conduct a thorough brainstorming exercise to list all organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in the case study.
- Stakeholders are any group affected by or capable of affecting the project, at various scales (local to national).
- Use prompts to identify stakeholders:
  - Who is affected by the project or IAS?
  - Who can influence outcomes?
  - Who are potential allies or opponents?
  - Who might be unheard or marginalized?
  - Who can facilitate or impede outcomes through participation or opposition?
  - Who can contribute resources (financial, technical, etc.)?
- Example stakeholder categories:
  - Government departments, agencies, politicians
  - Industry/producers bodies
  - Media
  - Land owners and managers
  - National advisory groups
  - Research organizations
  - Professional bodies
  - NGOs
  - Community groups

## Step 2: Data collection and database structure

- Build a central Excel spreadsheet as the main stakeholder database.
- Variables and data dimensions to capture (examples):
  - Name of organization
  - Target species
  - Country
  - Eco-region
  - Stakeholder area of interest (categories: environmental sustainability, social development, governance, academia, agriculture, tourism, etc.)
  - Conception of nature (based on Kellert’s eight-factor model: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
  - Management experience (previous IAS management experience: Yes/No/NA)
  - Land ownership (to gauge level of influence; categories from large to none)
  - Perceived level of influence (1–5 scale)
  - Impacts of IAS (ecological, economic, socio-cultural; each on 5-point scale)
  - Level of interest (proxy derived from impact types; 1–5 scale)
  - Relationships with other stakeholders (list up to 3 groups/institutions)
- The data captures both attitudinal and relational dimensions to support a nuanced influence-interest profile.

## Step 3: Measuring influence and interest; constructing the matrix

- Level of Influence
  - Calculated as the mean of Land ownership (V8) and Perceived level of influence (V9).
  - Formula example: Level of Influence = (V8 + V9) / 2
- Level of Interest
  - Derived as the maximum score across all impact types (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) (V10–V15).
- Output
  - Build an interest/influence matrix to visualize stakeholder priorities and guide engagement efforts.

## Data sources and data quality

- Primary data: Optional questionnaire to supplement secondary data and fill gaps.
- Secondary data: Researcher knowledge, websites, papers, institutional publications, etc.
- Emphasis on thoroughness in Step 1 to ensure a comprehensive stakeholder list; use prompts and broad categories to avoid missing stakeholders.

## Relevance to Data Governance and Stewardship

- Ensures discoverable, reusable stakeholder data through standardized metadata and a centralized database.
- Supports auditing of data provenance (sources, date of collection, methods) and update workflows for stakeholder information.
- Facilitates cross-project sharing of stakeholder analyses while maintaining clarity on data limits (embargoes, sensitivity) and accessibility.
