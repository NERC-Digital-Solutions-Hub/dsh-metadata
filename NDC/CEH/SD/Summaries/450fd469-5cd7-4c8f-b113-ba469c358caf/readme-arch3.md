# Expert-based stakeholder mapping and engagement strategies for six invasive non-native species case studies in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 2021.

- Purpose and scope
  - Develop stakeholder mapping and tailored engagement strategies to support monitoring and management of six invasive non-native species (INNS) case studies across Argentina, Brazil, and Chile.
  - Aimed to inform policy, decision-making, and future monitoring efforts through expert-driven stakeholder analysis.

- Methods and workflow
  - 19 experts conducted the mapping across six case studies.
  - Used the templates: INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv and INNS Stakeholder Mapping Instructions.
  - Two facilitated virtual workshops (2021) plus two rounds of updates to produce consensus stakeholder spreadsheets per case study.
  - Stakeholders classified into four categories by influence and interest: context settlers, crowd, key players, subjects.
  - Final consensus datasets and engagement strategies documented in anonymised formats.

- Data and structure
  - Datasets are anonymised to preserve privacy; each row represents a stakeholder for a specific INNS, country, and region.
  - Key data columns (examples):
    - GeneralID, ID, anonymised "Name of the stakeholder"
    - Stakeholder category (e.g., Government, NGOs, Academia, Landowners, etc.)
    - Target species, Country, Region
    - Stakeholder's scale (International, National, Regional, Local)
    - Primary and secondary areas of interest (e.g., Governance & policy, Academic research, Natural resource management)
    - Land ownership, perceived level of influence, negative/positive impacts across ecological, economic, and socio-cultural dimensions
    - Open text fields for additional descriptions of impacts and stakeholder relationships
    - Derived metrics: NEGATIVE IMPACTS, POSITIVE IMPACTS, LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL, LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL, Stakeholder classification
  - Data governance terms: all data are anonymised; freely available data.

- Stakeholder mapping outputs
  - INNS-StakeholderDatasetComplete.csv: comprehensive, anonymised stakeholder data across six case studies.
  - Stakeholder classification: context settlers, crowd, key players, subjects based on interest and influence.
  - LEVEL OF INTEREST FINAL and LEVEL OF INFLUENCE FINAL used to determine stakeholder category.

- Engagement strategies
  - Consensus-EngagementStrategies.csv: tailored engagement strategies for each stakeholder category and target species.
  - Strategy descriptions linked to stakeholder classification and method/class (Active involvement, co-planning, communication, education, networking, policy).
  - ExampleEngagementStrategies.pdf provides templates: an empty matrix for four stakeholder types and an example completed matrix (Brazil INNS case).

- Practical workflow and templates
  - INNSStakeholderMapping-Instructions&Guidelines.docx: guidance on completing the data sheet and interpreting columns.
  - INNS-ExampleStakeholderSpreadsheet.csv: template used by experts for data entry and matrix generation.
  - Files collectively support reproducibility, data governance, and integration into monitoring frameworks.

- Data governance and openness
  - Anonymisation safeguards stakeholder privacy while enabling data sharing.
  - Datasets provided to support transparency in monitoring framework development, governance, and stakeholder engagement.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates how stakeholder analysis informs monitoring design, governance, and data sharing requirements.
  - Addresses typical monitoring challenges (data access, silos, metadata gaps) by providing structured data, clear definitions, and explicit engagement strategies.
  - Provides a replicable process for integrating expert stakeholder insights into environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation across regions.
