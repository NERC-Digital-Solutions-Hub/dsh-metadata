# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Purpose: Identify and prioritize stakeholders for IAS (invasive alien species) management to support shared goals, cross-country comparisons, and co-design of management strategies (WP4) within the CONTAIN Programme.
- Approach: Use a standardized, data-driven platform to map stakeholders by influence and interest, primarily from secondary sources, with optional primary data collection.

## What data and outputs are produced

- An organized stakeholder list with basic attributes (organization, target species, country, eco-region).
- Stakeholder attributes across areas of interest (environmental, social, governance, research, etc.) and attitudes toward nature (eight-factor model).
- Measures of influence and interest to build an interest–influence matrix.
- A scalable dataset to compare countries and IAS contexts and to inform engagement and co-design activities.

## Methods and data sources

- Primary method: Stakeholder analysis conducted largely with secondary data (researcher knowledge, websites, papers, institutional publications).
- Potential enhancement: A questionnaire for first-hand data collection to deepen understanding.
- Mapping framework follows established stakeholder mapping approaches (categories: Key players, Context setters, Subjects, Crowd).

## Step 1: Stakeholder identification (brainstorming)

- Generate a comprehensive initial list of organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in the IAS issue.
- Include broad categories and consider broader groups if specific individuals are identified (e.g., landowners).
- Use prompts to identify stakeholders (affected groups, those who can influence outcomes, allies/opponents, under-heard voices, resource providers).

### Example stakeholder categories
- Government departments, agencies, politicians
- Industry/producers associations
- Media
- Land owners and managers
- National representative/advisory groups
- Research organizations
- Professional bodies
- NGOs
- Community groups

## Step 2: Build a main stakeholder database (Excel)

- Create a structured database to store stakeholder data (secondary sources plus researcher knowledge).
- Variables to capture:
  - Name of organization; target species; country; eco-region
  - Stakeholder area of interest (environmental sustainability, social development, NRM, governance/policy, academia, agriculture/forestry, tourism, etc.)
  - Conception of nature (eight-factor model: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
  - Management experience (previous IAS management)
  - Level of land ownership (proxy for influence; categories from large owners to none)
  - Perceived level of influence on IAS decisions (5-point scale)
  - Impacts of IAS (ecological, economic, socio-cultural) on stakeholders (5-point scales across multiple impact types)
  - Level of interest (5-point scale)
  - Relationships with other stakeholders (up to 3 groups/institutions)
- Data collection is based on secondary information, with a questionnaire available for primary data if needed.

## Step 3: Measure influence and interest; build the matrix

- Level of Influence
  - Calculated as the mean of Land ownership (V8) and Perceived level of influence (V9).
  - Formula: (V8 + V9) / 2
- Level of Interest
  - Based on the maximum impact score across all impact types (V10–V15).
- Output
  - An interest/influence matrix to categorize stakeholders and guide engagement prioritization.

## Practical considerations

- The analysis aims to standardize stakeholder mapping across case studies to enable cross-country comparisons and identify commonalities in IAS management.
- The process supports co-design of management strategies by identifying influential and interested actors and clarifying potential collaboration pathways.
- Iterative refinement is encouraged through feedback and potential primary data collection via a questionnaire.

## References and context

- Frameworks and prior work on stakeholder engagement and mapping are used to structure the approach (e.g., Reed et al.; Shackleton et al.; Novoa et al.).
- The stakeholder categorization and the eight-factor model for attitudes toward nature provide a basis for assessing predispositions toward IAS management.
- The initiative aligns with the CONTAIN Programme’s goals for standardized stakeholder analysis, cross-country comparability, and co-design of management actions.
