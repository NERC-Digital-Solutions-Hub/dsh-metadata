# Stakeholder analysis for CONTAIN Project

- Background
  - Effective IAS (invasive alien species) management relies on evaluating stakeholders' knowledge, perceptions, practices, awareness, and needs.
  - Early stakeholder engagement helps reveal factors shaping perceptions and guide shared goals.
  - Stakeholder analysis identifies who is affected or can affect the issue and prioritizes involvement; categories include Key players, Context setters, Subjects, and Crowd.

- Objectives of the CONTAIN stakeholder analysis
  - A) Provide a standardized platform for researchers to map and prioritize main actors/institutions in each case study.
  - B) Deliver an instrument to compare countries and IAS situations to find commonalities and differences in management overlaps.
  - C) Support Work Package 4 (co-design management strategies with stakeholders) for emerging and future IAS with sparse data and high societal demand.

- Step 1: Stakeholder brainstorming
  - Begin with a thorough brainstorm to list all organizations, actors, and institutions with a stake in the case studies.
  - Stakeholders are entities affected by or able to affect decisions or actions; include broad groups (government, industry, NGOs, landowners, research bodies, etc.).
  - If knowledge is lacking, conduct light research (papers, institutional publications, websites, news) or consult key informants.
  - Example stakeholder categories: government bodies, industry associations, media, landowners/managers, national advisory groups, research organizations, professional groups, NGOs, community groups.

- Step 2: Core data collection and variables
  - Researchers compile information in an Excel database (primarily from secondary sources; a questionnaire can be used for primary data).
  - Key fields (dimensions and variables) to capture:
    - 1. Name of the organization
    - 2. Target species
    - 3. Country
    - 4. Eco-region
    - 5. Stakeholders’ area of interest (e.g., environmental conservation, governance, agriculture, tourism, etc.)
    - 6. Conception of nature (based on Kellert’s eight-factor model: Naturalism, Humanism, Moralism, Dominionism, Utilitarianism, Negativism, Ecologism, Scientism)
    - 7. Management experience (previous IAS management experience)
    - 8. Level of land ownership (categories from large landowners to no land)
    9. Perceived level of influence on IAS decision-making (5-point scale)
    10–15. Perceived impacts of IAS (negative ecological, negative economic, negative socio-cultural, positive ecological, positive economic, positive socio-cultural) on a 5-point scale
    16. Perceived level of interest (5-point scale)
    17. Relationships with other stakeholders (list three groups or institutions)
  - This structure creates a standardized basis for cross-case comparison and integration with the later matrix.

- Step 3: Measuring influence, measuring interest, and building the matrix
  - How to measure Level of Influence:
    - Level of Influence = (Land ownership value + Perceived level of influence value) / 2
    - Inputs: V8 (Land ownership) and V9 (Perceived influence)
  - How to measure Level of Interest:
    - Level of Interest = maximum score across all impact types (V10–V15) and the perceived level of interest (V16)
  - Output: an interest/influence matrix to identify where stakeholders sit (e.g., high influence/high interest vs. low influence/low interest) to guide engagement.
