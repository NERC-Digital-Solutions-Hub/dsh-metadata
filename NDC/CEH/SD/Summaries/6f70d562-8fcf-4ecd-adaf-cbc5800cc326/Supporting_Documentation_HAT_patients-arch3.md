# Abstract

- Purpose and scope
  - Reporting on two related data collections (quantitative and qualitative) aimed at determining the economic and social consequences of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Eastern Zambia (2004–2014).
  - Data contributed to the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC) and funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with ESPA support.

- Datasets at a glance
  - Dataset 1: Economic and social impact of HAT
    - 64 cases; structured questionnaires administered to patients or their caregivers.
    - Anonymised by removing village names; verbal consent obtained.
    - File: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv.
    - Variables cover demographics, culture, treatment-seeking behavior, economic costs, productivity, schooling, disability, mortality, and recovery.
  - Dataset 2: Qualitative focus group transcripts
    - Anonymised transcripts from eight focus group discussions with health workers, HAT patients, and relatives/friends.
    - Seven to ten participants per group; inductive thematic coding by two independent researchers.
    - Transcripts stored as Word documents, anonymised and converted to Rich Text Format (RTF).

- Data collection and lineage
  - Population and recruitment
    - Previous and current HAT patients diagnosed 2004–2014 from Lusaka, Eastern, and Muchinga Provinces; active cases confirmed with PCR/LAMP; old cases via hospital/community records.
  - Data collection methods
    - Quantitative: Households were interviewed using a detailed questionnaire developed and administered by University of Zambia researchers; data collated into Excel and exported as CSV.
    - Qualitative: Focus group discussions conducted by experienced researchers; transcripts anonymised and analyzed to extract themes.
  - Data management
    - Data anonymisation included removal of village names and personal identifiers; data stored at the University of Zambia; alignment with Environmental Information Data Centre requirements (RTF version of transcripts).

    - Average exchange rate during data collection: US$1 = ZMW 6.3.

- Structure and content of the qualitative dataset
  - Dataset 2: Focus group transcripts
  - Format: Rich Text Format (RTF) transcripts (originally Word documents) with personal identifiers removed.

- Household questionnaire (example structure)
  - Section One: Demographic information (age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size and employment by category, estimated household income)
  - Section Two: Knowledge about HAT (awareness, transmission, person-to-person transmission, presence of an HAT patient in the family)
  - Section Three: Economic and social impact (care-seeking costs such as transport, medication, meals; time spent; coping strategies like selling items or incurring debt; impact on productive work, schooling, hospitalization; discharge status and disabilities; follow-up and mortality outcomes)
  - Reported clinical outcomes (fully recovered, minor/major disabilities, death, unreported death, late-stage abortion, suicide)
  - Completion and submission details

- Funding, provenance, and ethics
  - Part of the DDDAC research program.
  - Funded by NERC project NE/J000701/1 with ESPA support.
  - Ethical considerations: verbal consent obtained; anonymisation of participants; data stored securely; alignment with environmental data stewardship practices (environmental information data centre requirements).

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides empirical measures of economic burden and social impact of a vector-borne disease
  - Enables monitoring of key indicators for policy evaluation and resource allocation:
    - Direct and indirect costs (transport, medication, meals, debt)
    - Productivity losses (absences from work and school)
    - Educational disruption (absenteeism, dropout, grade repetition)
    - Disability and recovery trajectories post-treatment
    - Mortality and mortality reporting (including unreported cases)
  - Supports development of dashboards and policy briefs by aggregating household-level economic outcomes with health experiences.
  - Highlights data governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks:
    - Data quality and metadata needs
    - Anonymisation and data sharing challenges
    - Silos and coordination across institutions
    - Transformation and standardization of data for policy use

- Practical considerations for monitoring framework authors
  - Leverage the two-tier data design (quantitative plus qualitative) to capture both measurable costs and experiential perspectives
  - Ensure robust metadata and clear variable definitions to facilitate cross-study comparability
  - Address barriers to data sharing and governance to enable timely, transparent reporting
  - Translate complex findings into policy-relevant indicators and dashboards for decision-makers
