# Abstract

- Two data sets from Eastern Zambia (2004–2014) on economic, social, demographic, cultural, and treatment-seeking behavior of current and former human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients.
- Dataset 1: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv (64 cases) containing structured questionnaire data on demographics, culture, treatment seeking, and the economic and social impact of HAT; includes detailed cost components and productivity/education impacts.
- Dataset 2: Anonymised transcripts of eight focus group discussions with health workers, people affected by HAT, and their relatives/friends; transcripts analysed using inductive thematic coding by two independent researchers.
- Data collection and anonymisation: questionnaires administered by University of Zambia researchers; villages removed to anonymise; verbal consent obtained; focus group transcripts anonymised and stored as Word/RTF.
- Context and purpose: part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC and ESPA; data intended to illuminate economic and social consequences of HAT in the study area.

## Data provenance, scope, and lineage

- Population: previous and current HAT patients from areas in Zambia where the disease occurs (Lusaka, Eastern, Muchinga Provinces); active cases confirmed by PCR/LAMP; hospital records used when available.
- Study design: household-level quantitative survey (dataset 1) plus qualitative focus group discussions (dataset 2).
- Timing: data collected between 2004 and 2014; dataset preparation linked to the DD DAC project.
- Governance: research team listed (design, implementation, analysis, management) with supervisory oversight.

## Data structure and contents

- Dataset 1: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv
  - Core fields: Id, Province, District, Dist_value, Age, Sex, Marital_status (0=Not Married, 1=Married), Occupation (coded 0–7), Family_n, Formal_n, Informal_n, Unemployed_n, Income, HAT_knowledge, HAT_transmission, HAT_contact, HAT_HH, Patient_signs, Abnorm_sleep, Fever, Body_pain, Headache, LN_enlarge, Weight_loss, Paralysis, Other_symptoms, Date_symptoms, Clinic_visit, No_action, Healer, Self_med, Transport_cost, Medication_cost, Meals_cost, Washing_paste, Food_cost, Hospitalisation, Item_sell, Agric_product, Agric_value, Animal, Animal_value, Other_sold, Other_value, Debt_accum, Debt_value, Debt_clear, Productive_work, Absent_work, Attend_school, Absent_school, School_time, School_stop, School_rpt, Hosp_disch, Disab_disch, Temper, Swelling, Mental_disor, Pain_disch, Weakness_disch, Paralysis_disch, Other_disch, Staged, Review, Review_date, Mortality, Mortality_date, Family_outlive, Child_outlive, Spouse_outlive, Parents_outlive, Depend_outlive, Recovery_full, Recovery_date, Recovery_minor, Recovery_mdate, Recovery_mental, Mental_date, Recovery_major, Major_date, Report_death, Unreport_death, Miscarriage, Suicide, Suicide_date.
  - Notes: missing data represented by *; NA indicates not applicable; exchange rate used during data collection US$1 = ZMW 6.3.
- Dataset 2: Anonymised focus group transcripts (RTF); eight groups; themes related to social consequences of HAT.
- Data capture instrument: Copy of Household Questionnaire (demographics, knowledge of HAT, economic and social impact, costs, debt, schooling, disability, mortality), with explicit question-by-question items.

## Data collection instruments and handling

- Household Questionnaire sections:
  - Section One: Demographics (age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size and composition, monthly income).
  - Section Two: HAT knowledge and transmission (awareness, transmission modes, person-to-person transmission, prior exposure).
  - Section Three: Economic and Social Impact (costs: transport, medication, meals, washing paste, other foods; time at clinics; selling items or taking on debt; productive work and schooling absenteeism; hospital discharge outcomes; disabilities; follow-up; mortality; family impacts).
- Data anonymisation: removal of village names; focus group transcripts anonymised; data stored as Word documents and later converted to RTF for environmental data centre compliance.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations

- Sample size: 64 cases for dataset 1; qualitative data from eight focus groups.
- Data challenges: potential patchy data across variables; missing values indicated by an asterisk (*) in the CSV; NA used for not applicable questions.
- Temporal/contextual considerations: data span 2004–2014; economic values in USD with a fixed exchange rate; changes in currency value and context over time may affect comparisons.
- Generalisability: findings pertain to Eastern Zambia and similar settings; small sample size limits broad generalizations.

## Potential data use and analysis directions

- Economic burden assessment: sum direct and indirect costs (transport, medication, meals, other costs); debt accumulation and asset sales as coping strategies.
- Productivity and education impact: work absenteeism, school absenteeism, dropout, grade repetition, long-term disability outcomes.
- Health-seeking behavior: prior actions (clinic visits, traditional healers, self-medication) and timing of symptom onset.
- Knowledge and perceptions: level of HAT knowledge and transmission understanding; relation to care-seeking behavior.
- Mixed-methods synthesis: triangulate quantitative costs and outcomes with qualitative focus group themes to contextualize drivers and coping mechanisms.

## Access, rights, and data reuse guidance

- Anonymisation has been applied to protect patient identity; verbal consent obtained for all interviews; data prepared for environmental information databases.
- For reuse: ensure continued de-identification, respect consent scope, and note the historical nature of the data (2004–2014).

## Summary takeaway for data support

- The collection provides a paired quantitative and qualitative view of the economic and social burden of HAT in Eastern Zambia, including household-level costs, coping strategies, productivity and education impacts, and community-level perceptions. The data are suitable for dashboards and reports on disease burden, with careful attention to small sample size, temporal context, and data completeness.
