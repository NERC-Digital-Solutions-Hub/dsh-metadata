# Economic and Social Impact of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Eastern Zambia (2004-2014)

- The dataset collection focuses on economic, social, demographic, cultural, and treatment-seeking behaviour of former and current HAT patients in Eastern Zambia from 2004 to 2014.
- Two data sources are included: a quantitative dataset and qualitative focus group transcripts.

## Data Sets

- Dataset 1: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv
  - Main content: Demographics, economics, knowledge about HAT, symptoms, treatment-seeking behaviour, and household-level impacts.
  - Variables cover age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, employment type, income, HAT knowledge and transmission understanding, household HAT exposure, clinical signs, healthcare actions, direct/indirect costs, debt, productivity, schooling impacts, hospitalization, disabilities, recovery status, mortality, and other socio-economic indicators.
  - Data quality notes: missing data represented by *; not applicable values as NA.
  - Data provenance: collected via structured questionnaires administered to patients or their caregivers; anonymised by removing village names; exchange rate noted (US$1 ≈ ZMW 6.3).

- Dataset 2: Focus Group Discussion transcripts
  - Content: Anonymised transcripts from 8 focus group discussions with health workers, HAT sufferers, and relatives/friends.
  - Size/structure: 7–10 participants per group; topics cover concepts, perceptions, and social consequences of HAT.
  - Analysis: inductive approaches with thematic coding by two independent researchers.
  - Data format: transcripts stored as Word documents and converted to Rich Text Format (rtf) for Environmental Information Data Centre requirements.

## Study Population and Data Collection

- Geographic focus: Lusaka, Eastern, and Muchinga Provinces of Zambia.
- Case types:
  - Active cases confirmed by PCR and/or LAMP.
  - Old cases identified from hospital registers or community sources.
- Enrollment: all diagnosed HAT cases from 2004–2014 included where possible.
- Data collection methods:
  - Quantitative: structured questionnaires completed by patients or caregivers.
  - Qualitative: eight focus group discussions conducted by experienced University of Zambia researchers.
- Consent and confidentiality:
  - Verbal consent obtained from all participants.
  - Anonymisation applied to questionnaire data and focus group transcripts.

## Data Structure and Variable Coverage

- Dataset 1 (HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv) includes:
  - Demographics: Id, Province, District, Age, Sex, Marital_status, Occupation, Family_n, Formal_n, Informal_n, Unemployed_n.
  - Economic indicators: Income, transport_cost, medication_cost, meals_cost, washing_paste, food_cost, debt_values, asset sales (item_sell, Agric_product, Animal, Other_sold) and their values.
  - Health knowledge and symptoms: HAT_knowledge, HAT_transmission, HAT_contact, HAT_HH, Patient_signs, Abnorm_sleep, Fever, Body_pain, Headache, LN_enlarge, Weight_loss, Paralysis, Other_symptoms, Date_symptoms.
  - Healthcare and care-seeking: Clinic_visit, No_action, Healer, Self_med, Hospitalisation (duration), Review, Review_date, Recovery_status and dates, Mortality and related dates, Disbility indicators (Mental_disor, etc.), Staged, etc.
  - Household and social implications: Productive_work, Absent_work, Attend_school, Absent_school, School_time, School_stop, School_rpt, Hosp_disch, Disab_disch, various post-discharge outcomes, Report_death, Unreport_death, Mortality_date.
  - Miscellaneous: Debt_clear, Debt_accum, Recovery_mdate, Recovery_minor, Recovery_mental, Recovery_major, etc.
- Dataset 2 (RTF focus group transcripts) covers qualitative themes on social and perceived consequences of HAT.

- Household questionnaire content (copy included in the document) mirrors the variables above and provides the exact question wording across sections:
  - Section One: Demographic Information (age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, employment types, income).
  - Section Two: Knowledge about HAT (awareness, transmission, person-to-person transmission, exposure to HAT cases in family, signs and symptoms observed).
  - Section Three: Economic and Social Impact (expenditures on transport, medications, meals, other costs; time spent seeking care; selling assets; debt; impact on productive work and schooling; hospitalization and disabilities; follow-up and outcomes).

## Data Management and Provenance

- Data handling:
  - Questionnaire data compiled into an Excel sheet and exported as CSV.
  - Focus group transcripts authored in Word, anonymised, and converted to RTf for archiving.
- Data stewardship:
  - Project affiliated with the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC and ESPA.
  - Researchers from the University of Zambia conducted data collection, cleaning, and analysis; authors listed for design, implementation, and analysis.
  - Data and transcripts stored securely at the University of Zambia with anonymisation safeguards.

## Usage and Considerations for Analysts

- Potential analyses:
  - Descriptive statistics of economic and social burdens of HAT at the household level.
  - Correlations between knowledge, treatment-seeking behaviour, and costs/outcomes.
  - Regression analyses to identify predictors of financial hardship, school absenteeism, or disability post-HAT.
  - Thematic synthesis of qualitative focus group data to contextualize quantitative findings.
- Limitations and challenges:
  - Small sample size (64 cases) may limit generalizability.
  - Data spanning 2004–2014; potential changes in healthcare access and costs over time.
  - Data aggregation across districts with possible heterogeneity in services and costs.
  - Data quality concerns typical of field questionnaires (missing values, recall bias in retrospective questions).

## Notes

- Data include a rich set of economic, social, and health-related variables suitable for comprehensive burden analyses.
- Households’ coping strategies (debt, asset sales, work absenteeism, schooling impact) are well-captured.
- Qualitative data provide contextual insights to accompany quantitative results.
