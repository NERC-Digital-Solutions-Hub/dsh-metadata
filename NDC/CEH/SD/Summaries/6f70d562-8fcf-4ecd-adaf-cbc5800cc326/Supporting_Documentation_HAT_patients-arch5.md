# Abstract

## Overview
- Describes two data sets on economic, social, demographic, cultural, and treatment-seeking behaviour of former and current human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) patients in Eastern Zambia (2004–2014).
- Data collected as part of a wider project (Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium, DDDAC) and funded by NERC (NE/J000701/1) with ESPA support.
- Intent: determine economic and social consequences of HAT; support understanding by researchers and stakeholders; data anonymised to protect individuals.

## Datasets
- Dataset 1: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv
  - Contains economic and social impact data, plus demographics, culture, and treatment-seeking information.
  - Data collected via structured questionnaires to patients or their caregivers; anonymised by removing village names.
  - File format: CSV; 64 cases included.
  - Variables cover: id, province, district, age, sex, marital status, occupation, family composition, income, HAT knowledge and transmission understanding, household HAT exposure, clinical signs, care-seeking actions, transport and treatment costs, debt, productivity, education, hospitalisation, disabilities, outcomes (recovery, disabilities, death), and dates.
  - Data notes indicate missing data represented by *, and NA for not applicable; average exchange rate noted (US$1 = ZMW 6.3 at the time of data collection).
- Dataset 2: Focus group transcripts
  - Anonymised transcripts of eight focus group discussions with health workers, HAT patients, and relatives/friends.
  - Format: Rich Text Format (rtf) documents; original transcripts stored as Word documents and anonymised for Environmental Information Data Centre submission.
  - Data captured concepts, perceptions, and ideas related to social consequences of HAT; analysis conducted inductively with thematic coding by two independent researchers.

## Data collection and provenance (Lineage)
- Participants: former/current HAT patients recruited from regions where HAT occurred (Lusaka, Eastern, Muchinga Provinces); active cases confirmed by PCR/LAMP; old cases via hospital/community records.
- Data collection methods:
  - Questionnaires administered to patients or caregivers; roles of University of Zambia researchers noted.
  - Focus groups conducted by experienced researchers; transcripts anonymised.
- Data processing:
  - Questionnaires: consolidated into Excel, exported to CSV; villages anonymised.
  - Focus groups: transcripts coded manually in Word; later converted to RTF for data centre submission.
- Scope: data collected to assess economic and social consequences of HAT; part of the DDDAC project.

## Data structure and metadata

- Dataset 2: Focus group transcripts (rtf) with anonymised content; eight discussions across multiple districts.

## Anonymisation, consent, and ethics
- Personal identifiers removed from all data to protect patient privacy.
- Villages names removed in the CSV to anonymise locations.
- Verbal consent obtained from all participants prior to interviews and focus groups.
- Transcripts and data prepared to meet Environmental Information Data Centre requirements.

## Storage, access, and governance
- Data and transcripts stored at the University of Zambia; transcripts stored as Word documents and anonymised before conversion to RTF.
- Data centre alignment: anonymised Word → RTF for environmental data sharing.
- Data creators and contributors include a team from the University of Zambia (design, implementation, data analysis, data management) with supervisory oversight.
- Funding and project context documented (DDDAC, NERC ESPA support).

## Data quality, limitations, and notes
- Missing data represented by *; not applicable fields marked as NA.
- Data reflect the period 2004–2014; potential changes in disease patterns or health systems since collection.
- Large variety of formats and systems used during collection (Excel, Word, CSV, RTF) requiring careful harmonisation for reuse.
- Some data are self-reported (economic costs, symptoms, care-seeking) and may be subject to recall bias.

## Use and reuse considerations for Data Stewards
- Datasets are clearly labelled with file names and variable descriptions; comprehensive documentation of data collection methods and anonymisation steps is provided.
- Metadata includes data lineage, collection instruments (House Hold Questionnaire copy), and coding schemes (0/1/NA marks, etc.).
- Suitable for secondary analysis on economic and social impacts of HAT, health-seeking behaviour, and community-level consequences.
- When sharing or updating, ensure continued anonymisation, consent alignment, and alignment with Environmental Information Data Centre requirements.

## Copy of House Hold Questionnaire (summary)
- Contains demographic information (age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, employment types, income).
- Knowledge and understanding of HAT (transmission, contact) and whether there has been a HAT patient in the family.
- Questions about signs/symptoms observed, handling of cases (clinic, healer, self-treatment), and costs (transport, medication, meals, other).
- Economic and social impact questions (time spent, debt, asset sales, productive work absence, school attendance, dropouts, repeats, hospital discharge, disabilities).
- Reporting of outcomes (full recovery, disabilities, death, unreported death, late-stage abortion, suicide) and dates.
- Completion by a respondent with signature and date; questionnaire notes and validation details included.
