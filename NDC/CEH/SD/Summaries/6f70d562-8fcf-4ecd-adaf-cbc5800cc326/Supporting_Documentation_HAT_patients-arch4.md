# Economic and Social Consequences of Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Eastern Zambia

- Overview
  - Two data sets collected (2004–2014) on economic, social, demographic, cultural, and treatment-seeking behavior from former and current HAT patients in Eastern Zambia.
  - Aimed to determine the economic and social consequences of HAT as part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC and ESPA.
  - Data have anonymised identifiers and removed village names to protect participants.

- Data Sets
  - Data Set 1: Economic and social impact
    - Demographics, culture, and treatment-seeking behavior collected via structured questionnaires administered to patients or their caregivers.
    - 64 cases included; questionnaires developed and delivered by University of Zambia researchers.
    - Anonymised by removing village names.
  - Data Set 2: Focus group transcripts
    - Anonymised transcripts from eight focus group discussions with health workers, patients, and relatives.
    - Seven to ten participants per group; discussions conducted by University of Zambia researchers.
    - Transcripts analyzed inductively with thematic coding by two independent researchers; stored as Word documents and later converted to Rich Text Format (RTF) for Environmental Information Data Centre requirements.

- Data Collection and Lineage
  - Population: Previous and current HAT patients from areas where the disease occurs (Lusaka, Eastern, Muchinga Provinces).
  - Case confirmation: Active cases by PCR/LAMP; old cases from hospital registers or community.
  - Data collection: Structured questionnaires covering economics, social impact, demographics, culture, and treatment seeking.
  - Data handling: Collected data compiled into an Excel spreadsheet and exported as CSV; village names removed for anonymisation.
  - Focus groups: Conducted in multiple districts (Chama, Mambwe, Mpika, Rufunsa); transcripts stored and anonymised; analysed by thematic coding.

- Household Questionnaire (Copy)
  - Structure:
    - Section One: Demographic Information (age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, employment types, income)
    - Section Two: Knowledge about HAT/HAT (awareness, transmission, contagion, whether a household has had an HAT patient)
    - Section Three: Economic and Social Impact (costs incurred, time spent seeking care, coping strategies (selling items, debt), productivity loss, school absenteeism, hospital discharge outcomes, disabilities, follow-up, mortality)
  - Content emphasizes costs (transport, medication, meals, washing paste, other foods), debt, productive work, school attendance, and post-treatment outcomes (recovery, disability, death).

- Privacy, Ethics, and Data Governance
  - Anonymisation applied to all datasets (removal of personal identifiers and village names).
  - Verbal consent obtained from participants prior to interviews and focus group discussions.
  - Data stored and managed by the University of Zambia; transcripts prepared and anonymised to protect individuals.

- Data Quality, Limitations, and Considerations for Data Leaders
  - Sample size: 64 survey cases; focus groups provide qualitative insights across districts.
  - Data are self-reported and retrospective (potential recall bias).
  - Variable definitions are explicit, with clear coding schemes (e.g., 0/1 for binary responses; monetary values in US$).
  - Data are stored in accessible formats (CSV for quantitative data; RT F/Word for qualitative transcripts) but require proper metadata for discoverability.
  - Metadata considerations: dataset naming, variable descriptions, data collection methods, consent and anonymisation status, and data provenance.
  - Potential for cross-study synthesis exists if standardized metadata and documentation are maintained; align with wider community standards for socio-economic disease impact data.
  - Cross-disciplinary use (health economics, social impact assessment, policy planning) is supported by explicit cost components and disability/outcome measures.

- Implications for Data Leaders
  - Emphasise end-to-end data management: provenance, anonymisation, metadata, discoverability, and updates.
  - Facilitate data integration with wider datasets by documenting variable definitions, coding schemes, and data collection instruments (questionnaires and focus group guides).
  - Support user needs through clear data dictionaries and example analyses to help policy colleagues and researchers interpret economic and social impacts.
  - Encourage co-ownership and collaboration with external data communities to enhance system-level understanding of HAT’s socio-economic burden.
