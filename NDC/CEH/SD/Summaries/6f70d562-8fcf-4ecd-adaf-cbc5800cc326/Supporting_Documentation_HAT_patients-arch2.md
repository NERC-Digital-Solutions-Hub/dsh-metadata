# Economic and social impact of human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Eastern Zambia (2004-2014)

## Overview
- Two data collections were conducted to determine the economic and social consequences of HAT in Eastern Zambia (2004–2014):
  - A quantitative dataset from structured household questionnaires (64 cases).
  - Qualitative data from eight focus group discussions with health workers, people affected by HAT, and their relatives.
- Part of the Dynamic Drivers of Disease in Africa Consortium (DDDAC); funded by NERC ESPA.
- Data collection and analysis conducted by University of Zambia researchers; data anonymised and shared for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Datasets included
- Dataset 1: HAT_Burden_DDDAC_2016.csv
  - Contents: Demographics, economics, social indicators, culture, treatment-seeking behaviour, and health-related variables.
  - Example variables: age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, employment by sector, income, knowledge/understanding of HAT, symptoms, healthcare-seeking behaviour, costs (transport, medication, meals), debt, productivity impact, schooling impact, hospitalisation, disabilities, recovery and mortality outcomes, and follow-up data.
  - Data handling: values with missing data indicated by *, non-applicable items by NA; exchange rate noted (US$1 = ZMW 6.3).
- Dataset 2: Anonymised transcripts of focus group discussions (RTF)
  - Focus groups: 7–10 participants per group; five groups across districts Chama, Mambwe, Mpika, Rufunsa.
  - Participants: health workers, HAT patients, and their relatives/friends.
  - Analysis: inductive thematic coding by two independent researchers; transcripts anonymised and stored as Word documents, then converted to RTF for Environmental Information Data Centre.
  
## Data collection, provenance, and processing
- Population and recruitment
  - Inclusion: former and current HAT patients diagnosed 2004–2014 in Lusaka, Eastern, and Muchinga Provinces.
  - Case confirmation: active cases via PCR/LAMP; old cases via hospital registers/community.
- Data collection methods
  - Household questionnaire: administered to patients or their caregivers; data entered into Excel and exported to CSV.
  - Focus groups: conducted by experienced University of Zambia researchers; discussions recorded, anonymised, and transcribed.
- Data management and anonymisation
  - Personal identifiers removed from datasets; village names anonymised.
  - Transcripts stored at University of Zambia; encrypted/format-converted for data centre requirements.
- Consent
  - Verbal consent obtained prior to questionnaires and focus group interviews.

## Household Questionnaire: structure and content
- Section One: Demographic information
  - Age, sex, marital status, occupation, family size, formal/informal/unemployed members, estimated household income.
- Section Two: Knowledge about HAT
  - Awareness of HAT, transmission (e.g., tsetse flies), whether transmission via person-to-person contact was believed.
  - History of HAT in the family; observed signs and symptoms; handling of cases (clinic, traditional healer, self-treatment).
- Section Three: Economic and Social Impact
  - Expenditure related to care (transport, medication, meals, washing paste, other foods).
  - Time spent seeking care; debt incurred and whether it was cleared.
  - Productivity impact (productive work, absenteeism from work/school; school attendance/absenteeism; school dropouts or grade repetition).
  - Hospitalisation and post-discharge disabilities; follow-up/review visits; mortality and family-outlive indicators.
  - Reported clinical outcomes (fully recovered, various disabilities, death, etc.).
- Additional notes
  - Provides a structured “Reported Clinical Outcome” table for summarising outcomes per respondent.

## Ethical considerations and data use
- Anonymisation: village names and personal identifiers removed to protect privacy.
- Consent: verbal consent obtained for both questionnaire and focus group phases.
- Data use: designed to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation over time; datasets prepared for submission to the Environmental Information Data Centre.

## Key contributors
- Researchers and coordinators: Allan Mayaba Mwiinde, Martin Simuunza, Boniface Namangala, Chitalu Miriam Chama-Chiliba, Neil Anderson, Noreen Machila, and Susan Welburn (design, implementation, data analysis, data management, supervision).

## Geographic and temporal scope
- Geography: Areas where HAT occurs in Zambia (Lusaka, Eastern, and Muchinga Provinces) with district-level detail.
- Timeframe: Data collection covering 2004–2014; includes follow-up data and mortality/recovery observations.

## Potential applications for environment monitoring and policy
- Enables temporal assessment of the social and economic costs of HAT, contributing to assessments of environmental health policy effectiveness.
- Facilitates linkage with environmental drivers and health system indicators to monitor policy performance and target interventions.
- Provides rich context for cross-sector analyses (health, economy, education, social welfare) in HAT-endemic regions.
