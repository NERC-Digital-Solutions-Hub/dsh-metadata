# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site for assessing vegetation.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover by each species; calculation of species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs by summing quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at ground level per quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed; total biomass summarized per site (g biomass per m2).
- Diversity: Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver 1963).
- Functional traits: Community Weighted Mean (CWM) traits calculated from species trait values (traits taken from databases).

## Greenhouse gas flux (CO2, CH4, N2O)

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured with four plastic collars and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser; CO2 influx measured, then efflux measured in the dark; soil moisture, temperature, and PAR measured in triplicate.
- Calculations convert raw CO2 measurements to flux (mg CO2 m-2 h-1) with time-stamped forecasts and standard gas constants.
- CH4, CO2, and N2O measured via chamber gas sampling (9 mL air collected at 10, 20, 30 minutes), analyzed with a Gas-Chromatograph; final flux calculated using the same approach as for CO2.

## Soil sampling and subsampling

- Six soil samples per site collected to 10 cm depth with a 4 cm auger; samples sieved to 2 mm to remove stones/roots.
- Subsamples allocated for PLFA and DNA analyses (stored at -20°C); remaining soil stored at 5°C until processing.

## Bulk density, pH, and soil moisture

- Bulk density: cores from 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths, dried at 80°C for 48 hours; BD calculated as mass/volume.
- pH: soil mixed 1:1 with Milli-Q water, measured with a pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture content: fresh soil weighed, dried at 80°C for 48 hours; moisture calculated as proportion of wet weight.

## Lipid extraction and PLFA analysis (Bligh and Dyer method)

- Stepwise solvent extraction to separate lipid classes: neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids.
- Phases separated and lipids re-eluted on Isolute columns; neutral lipids eluted with chloroform, glycolipids with acetone, phospholipids with methanol; phospholipids dried and prepared for analysis.
- Internal standards added; samples dissolved in MeOH:toluene, saponified, and fatty acids extracted and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) to yield PLFA profiles (nmol g-1 dry weight).
- Fatty acids detected include C14:0, C15:0i, C15:0a, C16:0i, C16:1(n-7), C16:0, i-C17:0, a-C17:0, 7,cy-C17:0, C18:2(n-6), C18:1(n-9), C18:1(n-7), C18:0, 7,8cy-C19:0; standards include C13 and C19.
- Interpretation: most PLFAs are bacterial; C18:2(n-6) associated with non-bacterial sources.

## DNA sequencing and microbial diversity

- DNA extraction from soil using MOBIO PowerSoil kit.
- Dual-indexed amplicon libraries generated for bacteria (16S rRNA) and eukaryotes (18S rRNA); libraries normalized and pooled; sequencing on Illumina MiSeq (V3, 600 cycles); runs yielded >17 million reads per amplicon library.
- Bioinformatics: reads clustered into OTUs at 97% similarity; results presented as the percentage composition of OTUs per sample.

## Soil fauna and nematode assessment

- Soil fauna sampling: cores collected with appropriate corers/augers; three subsamples per plot; smaller subsamples (~100 cm3) saved for nematode extraction.
- Dry extraction (Berlese-Tullgren funnels) used to isolate microarthropods and annelids; large earthworms are hand-sorted, counted, and retained before extraction.
- Nematodes: wet extraction process using sieves; gravity-driven separation into a sample tube; cold storage for later analysis.
- Nematode handling: samples stored at 3–4 weeks max if not processed immediately.

## Nematode extraction workflow (detailed)

- Subsamples washed through a series of sieves; remaining fine soil and nematodes placed in water extractors for 24 hours.
- Gravity drives nematodes to settle in a small tube; cold storage maintained for further processing.

## Trait data and plant functional traits

- Trait data sources: LEDA Traitbase and PlantATT (longevity, plant height, specific leaf area, root architecture, rooting depth, VAM affinity).
- Trait definitions:
  - Longevity: ordinal scale (annual to perennial; five levels).
  - Plant height: centimeters.
  - Specific leaf area (SLA).
  - Root architecture: categorical scale from fibrous to tap roots (seven levels).
  - Rooting depth class: ordinal (shallow to deep).
  - VAM affinity: ordinal (usually mycorrhizal to never mycorrhizal).
- Note: root architecture examples include categories such as fibrous, adventitious, bulbous, nodal, rhizomes, stolons, and tap roots.
