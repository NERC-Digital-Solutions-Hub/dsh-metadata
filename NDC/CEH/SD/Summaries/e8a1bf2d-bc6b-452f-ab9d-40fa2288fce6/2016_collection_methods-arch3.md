# Vegetation work

- A comprehensive set of environmental monitoring methods spanning vegetation metrics, soil properties, greenhouse gas fluxes, and below-ground biodiversity.
- Aims to generate robust, comparable measures for assessing policy impact and informing future decisions.

## Vegetation metrics

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site for sampling.
- Visual estimation of species percent cover within each quadrat.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs summed across the four quadrats.
- Biomass sampled by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, and weighed; total site biomass calculated as g m^-2.
- Shannon diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
- Community Weighted Mean (CWM) traits computed using species relative abundance and trait values (Díaz et al. 2007); traits sourced from established databases (e.g., LEDA, PlantATT).

## Greenhouse gas flux measurements

- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis, and respiration measured using four plastic collars (25 cm diameter) with transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (EGM-4 IRGA).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; measurements repeated after placing a reflective cover to obtain dark efflux.
- Soil moisture, soil temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) recorded in triplicate.
- CO2 flux calculated from change in concentration over time, with standard unit conversion to mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1.
- Methane (CH4), CO2, and nitrous oxide (N2O) sampled using reflective chambers; 9 mL air samples collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes and analysed by Gas-Chromatography (Agilent 7890B).

## Soil sampling and physicochemical analyses

- Six soil samples collected per site to a depth of 10 cm; samples sieved to 2 mm to remove stones and roots.
- Subsamples allocated for PLFA and DNA analysis; remaining soil stored at 5°C until processing.
- Bulk density measured from two cores (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm) after drying at 80°C for 48 hours.
- pH determined by mixing 5 g soil with Milli-Q water (1:1) and measuring with pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture content determined by drying fresh soil and comparing pre- and post-drying weights.

## Lipids and microbial biomass (PLFA)

- Lipids extracted from soil using a Bligh and Dyer based protocol with citrate buffer, chloroform, methanol, and Bligh and Dye reagents; phases separated to isolate neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids.
- Lipid classes separated on a column with graded solvents; phospholipids isolated, dried, and stored for analysis.
- Internal standards added to samples; lipid extracts converted to fatty acid methyl esters (PLFAs) and analysed by GC (Agilent system).
- Fatty acid profiles quantified against standards; PLFA concentrations expressed as nmol g^-1 dry weight soil; predominance of bacterial markers noted (e.g., most fatty acids assigned to bacteria, except for certain polyunsaturated fats).

## DNA sequencing and microbial diversity

- DNA extracted with MOBIO Powersoil 96-well kit.
- Dual-indexed amplicon libraries prepared targeting 16S rRNA (bacteria) and 18S rRNA (eukaryotes); libraries normalised, pooled, and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq (V3, 600 cycles).
- Sequencing depth ≥ 17 million reads per amplicon library.
- Sequences clustered into OTUs at 97% similarity; data reported as the percentage of each OTU per sample.

## Soil fauna and nematodes

- Soil cores sampled with appropriate corers/augers (2.5–10 cm diameter; up to 10 cm depth); three subsamples per plot/subplot; smaller subsamples collected for nematode extraction.
- Berlese-Tullgren funnels used to extract Microarthropods and Annelida; large earthworms hand-sorted and counted when visible.
- Nematodes extracted via a wet extraction process using graded sieves; samples stored cold for further identification and population estimates.
- Nematode samples can be cold-stored for 3–4 weeks if not processed immediately.

## Trait values and references

- Trait suite includes:
  - Longevity (annual to perennial; 5-level ordinal scale; data from LEDA Plant Traitbase).
  - Plant height (cm; PlantATT).
  - Specific leaf area (SLA; LEDA).
  - Root architecture (categorical; from tap roots to fibrous; 7 levels; Grime et al. 2007).
  - Rooting depth class (shallow to deep; 3 levels).
  - Vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) affinity (ordinal; 3 levels; LEDA).

## Data handling and standards (implications for monitoring frameworks)

- Use of standardized, replicable measurement protocols for vegetation, soil properties, GHG fluxes, and biodiversity.
- Clear documentation of analytic approaches (e.g., Shannon diversity, CWM calculations, OTU clustering at 97%).
- Inclusion of explicit steps for sample preservation and storage (e.g., -20°C for subsamples; storage of extracts and standards) to support data integrity and reproducibility.
- Integration of functional trait data to support cross-site comparability and policy-relevant interpretation.
- Emphasis on combining above-ground, below-ground, and microbial/faunal metrics to inform environmental health monitoring and decision-making.
