# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass measured by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, drying at 80 °C for 24 hours, and weighing; summed across the site to yield g biomass per m^2.
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
- Community weighted mean (CWM) traits computed as: CWM = sum(w_i x_i) across species, using relative abundances w_i and trait values x_i; trait values drawn from database sources (Díaz et al. 2007; additional trait sources listed).

Greenhouse gas flux
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange, photosynthesis and respiration measured using four 25 cm diameter plastic collars with transparent chambers connected to an IRGA (EGM-4, PP Systems).
- CO2 influx measured over two minutes; after covering with a reflective cap, a second 2-minute measurement to obtain dark efflux.
- Soil moisture, temperature (WET sensor), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) recorded in triplicate.
- CO2 flux calculated from 27 measurements per chamber over two minutes; reported as final CO2 flux in mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1.
- CH4, CO2 and N2O measured via chambers with air samples collected at 10, 20, and 30 minutes, analyzed by Gas-Chromatograph (Agilent 7890B); calculations analogous to IRGA method.

Soil sampling and properties
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to 10 cm depth; sieved to 2 mm to remove stones/roots.
- Subsamples allocated for PLFA and DNA; remaining soil stored at 5 °C until processing.
- Bulk density determined from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths, dried at 80 °C for 48 hours.
- pH measured in 5 g soil mixed with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio using a pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture content determined by drying fresh soil to calculate post-drying weight.

Procedure (lipids and fractionation)
- 1.5 g fresh soil extracted with citrate buffer to 1.5 ml water content; chloroform/methanol Bligh and Dye extraction steps followed.
- Phase separation and drying under nitrogen to isolate lipid fractions.
- Lipids separated on an isolute column into neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids; fractions eluted with chloroform and acetone/methanol.
- Phospholipids dried and stored; internal standards added later.
- Lipids converted to fatty acid methyl esters (PLFA) for GC analysis; samples redissolved in MeOH:toluene (1:1) and transesterified; internal standards added precisely.
- GC analysis performed to identify fatty acids (e.g., various C14–C19 chain lengths); PLFA values calculated as nmol g^-1 dry weight soil using standardized formula; most fatty acids identified as bacteria-derived except C18:2(n-6).

DNA sequencing
- DNA extracted with MOBIO Powersoil 96-well kit.
- Dual-indexed amplicon libraries created for 16S (bacteria) and 18S (eukaryotes) rRNA genes; libraries normalized, pooled, and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (V3, 600 cycles).
- Sequencing runs yielded >17,000,000 reads per amplicon library.
- Bioinformatics: reads clustered into OTUs at 97% similarity; data expressed as OTU percentages per sample.

Soil fauna
- Soil cores collected using various corers/augers (2.5–10 cm diameter, up to 10 cm depth); sampling adjusted to soil type (hard, stony soil used weed extractors and mallets/hammers).
- Each sample comprised three subsamples per plot; small subsamples (~100 cm^3) reserved for nematode extraction.
- Berlese-Tullgren funnels used to extract microarthropods and Annelida; large earthworms hand-sorted, counted, and stored before processing.
- Samples placed on warm extractors for 3–7 days; heat drives fauna into 75% ethanol at the bottom tube for sorting and identification.
- Nematodes separated via wet extraction with sieves; samples cold-stored for up to 3–4 weeks if not immediately processed.

Nematode extraction
- Wet extraction used to separate nematodes from soil through sieves; remaining soil and nematodes placed in water-filled extractors for 24 hours; gravity drives nematodes to the bottom tube.
- Collected nematodes cold stored for functional group identification and population estimates.
