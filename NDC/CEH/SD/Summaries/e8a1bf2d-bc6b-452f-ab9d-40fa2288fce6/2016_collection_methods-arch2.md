# Vegetation work

## Aim and approach
- Standardized field and lab methods to quantify vegetation structure, diversity, and functional traits for environmental monitoring.
- Data are designed for comparison over time and integration with other environmental datasets.

## Vegetation measurements
- Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of species percent cover; species richness and grasses/forbs cover summed across quadrats.
- Biomass harvested by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 h, and weighed; totals summed to yield g biomass per m^2.
- Community metrics:
  - Shannon’s Diversity index (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
  - Community Weighted Mean (CWM) traits calculated as the sum of each species’ relative abundance times its trait value (Díaz et al. 2007).
  - Traits sourced from databases (Leda Traitbase, PlantATT) and include lifecycle, height, specific leaf area, root architecture, rooting depth, and mycorrhizal affinity.

## Greenhouse gas flux: CO2, CH4, N2O
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange measured with four 25 cm plastic collars and transparent chambers connected to an infrared gas analyser (IRGA); CO2 influx measured over 2 minutes, then repeated with a reflective cover to obtain dark efflux.
- Concurrent measurements of soil moisture, soil temperature, and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) in triplicate.
- Calculations convert raw CO2 concentrations to fluxes (mg CO2 m^-2 h^-1) using chamber volume, area, and time factors.
- Methane, CO2, and nitrous oxide measured by placing reflective-covered chambers, taking gas samples at 10, 20, and 30 minutes, and analyzing with a Gas-Chromatograph (GC). Final fluxes calculated with the same methodology as IRGA-derived CO2.

## Soil sampling and storage
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to approximately 10 cm depth; stones and roots removed, sieved to 2 mm.
- Subsamples allocated for PLFA and DNA analyses (stored at -20°C); remaining soil stored at 5°C until processing.

## Soil physical and chemical properties
- Bulk density: cores from 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depth dried at 80°C for 48 h to compute mass/volume.
- pH: 5 g soil mixed with equal volume Milli-Q water (1:1) and measured with a pH meter.
- Volumetric moisture content: fresh soil weighed, dried at 80°C for 48 h, and moisture calculated from weight change.

## Lipid biomarker and lipid extraction procedure (PLFA)
- Modified Bligh and Dyer extraction on soil subsamples to separate neutral lipids, glycolipids, and phospholipids.
- Lipids fractionated via solid-phase column chromatography and eluted with specific solvents (neutral lipids with chloroform, glycolipids with acetone, phospholipids with methanol).
- Phospholipids converted to fatty acid methyl esters (PLFAs) and analysed by GC (Agilent 7890B); internal standards added for quantification.
- Fatty acids targeted include a broad range (e.g., C14:0, C16:0, C18:1, C18:2, branched and cyclopropane forms); PLFA profile used to infer bacterial vs. fungal signatures.
- Resulting PLFA concentrations reported as nmol g^-1 dry weight soil.

## DNA sequencing for biodiversity assessment
- DNA extracted with MOBIO Powersoil kit.
- Dual-indexed amplicon libraries generated to target bacterial 16S and eukaryotic 18S rRNA genes.
- Libraries normalised, pooled, and sequenced on Illumina MiSeq (V3, 600 cycles); >17 million reads per amplicon.
- Bioinformatics clustered sequences into OTUs at 97% similarity; results presented as OTU percentages per sample.

## Soil fauna and nematode analyses
- Soil fauna sampling tailored to soil type; cores/augers used to collect 2.5–10 cm diameter, up to 10 cm depth.
- Coarse, hard, or stony soils may require weed extractors with mallets; subsamples (≈100 cm^3) collected for nematode extraction.
- Berlese-Tullgren funnels used to extract microarthropods and annelids; large earthworms are hand-sorted and counted when visible.
- Nematodes: samples kept cold if not immediately processed; wet extraction through a sieving cascade and gravity-based separation over 24 h.
- Extracted specimens stored for identification and population estimates.

## Data interpretation and reporting
- The methods enable integration of vegetation structure, diversity, functional traits, soil microbial biomarkers (PLFA), microbial and eukaryotic diversity (DNA), and soil fauna/nematode communities.
- Outputs are suitable for monitoring environmental health, assessing policy-relevant trends, and supporting data portals with standardized formats.

## Trait data referenced
- Trait values used include longevity, plant height, specific leaf area, root architecture, rooting depth, and vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal (VAM) affinity; sourced from LEDA Traitbase and PlantATT, with supporting literature (e.g., Grime et al., Kleyer et al., Hill et al., Shannon & Weaver).
