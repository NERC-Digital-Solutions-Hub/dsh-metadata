# Spatial inventory of UK waterbodies

- Purpose and scope: Polygons accompanying the UK Lakes Portal and the underlying database, used for lakes and ponds research across the UK; Water Body ID (WBID) used as a common identifier; managed and maintained by Philip Taylor.
- Access and licensing: Data available under the Open Government Licence; citation required: Taylor, P.J. (2021). Spatial inventory of UK waterbodies. NERC EDS Environmental Information Data Centre.
- Data description and provenance:
  - Polygons originate from OS PANORAMA data (~1993) with edits over time.
  - Northern Ireland additions include Water Framework Directive (WFD) lakes; some large lakes’ basins split and added.
  - Changes reflect project-focused improvements; ongoing work to increase lake names via local knowledge and maps.
  - Regular use by many institutions; WBID used to synchronize research.
  - Data creators and users should be aware of the age of base data and potential omissions (e.g., newer reservoirs, ponds <1 ha may be underrepresented).
- Quality control and limitations:
  - Based on Ordnance Survey data; edits checked and approved prior to publishing.
  - Older quality issues may persist; real-world changes since original creation may not be reflected.
  - Crowd-sourced data is included only after verification.
- Governance and maintenance:
  - Versioned dataset with updates to the underlying database; polygon updates are incorporated where relevant.
  - Dataset management and portal oversight by Philip Taylor.
- Dataset details:
  - Format: GeoPackage (.gpkg); projected in OSGB 1936 / British National Grid (EPSG: 27700).
  - File name: uklakes_v3_6_poly.gpkg; versioning aligned with the underlying database.
  - Key attributes:
    - WBID: Water Body ID, a cross-institution identifier.
    - NAME: Water Body Name (from OS data, maps, and crowd-sourcing).
    - POLY_AREA_HA: Polygon area in hectares (computed; may differ from historical values).
    - POLY_PERIMETER_KM: Polygon perimeter in kilometers (computed; may differ from historical values).
    - geom: Geometry for GIS use; typically not shown in attribute tables.
- Usage notes and considerations for data stewards:
  - Ensure proper citation when reused.
  - Account for potential mismatches between polygon extents and current on-the-ground features due to dataset age.
  - Be aware of limitations for very large waterbodies and newly added NI lakes; update procedures may be needed for high-impact changes.
  - Maintain data governance practices, including version control and compatibility with downstream systems and portals.
