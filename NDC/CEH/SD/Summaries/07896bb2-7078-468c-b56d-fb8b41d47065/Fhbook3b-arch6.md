# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Guidelines for updating land use, vegetation, and landscape data; establish time-series to monitor change since 1990.
  - Robust, comparable datasets to inform policy, biodiversity action plans, and sustainable development indicators.
  - Integrates ground-truth field data with remote sensing and broad habitat classifications; aims for standardised data collection across observers.

- Data collection framework
  - Large, structured set of plot types (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W, R, V) with areal and nested subplots; five plots per square in many cases.
  - Data captured include presence/absence of species, percent cover in 5% bands, and nested species tallies; permanent marking and GPS/photography used where possible.
  - Universal and change coding system to document current features, changes, new areas, and reliability (e.g., 701 genuine, 702 probable mis-recording; 888 new map codes; 999 no longer present).

- Sampling procedures (Section 10 and related)
  - Soil sampling (three cores per X-plot, five replicate samples per square across X-plots):
    - Central centre plot sampling with three pipes (long black and two white short pipes); rapid processing and shipping to ITE Merlewood.
  - Calluna sampling (foliar nitrogen study):
    - Sample within each square containing Calluna vulgaris; collect current year growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) and despatch for lab analysis.
  - Freshwater sampling:
    - Conducted by IFE staff in coordination with CS2000 field teams; coordinated timing with survey schedule.

- Vegetation recording and data entry
  - Core data capture includes a list of ~200 common species with tick-box presence; unlisted species added with Latin name; nested plot sequencing tracked.
  - Cover estimates in 5% bands; trees recorded with canopy considerations; use of species aggregates where precise ID is uncertain.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from a restricted list with corresponding covers.
  - Emphasis on standardisation and training to reduce observer variation and enable reliable change detection.

- Plot types and data collection details
  - X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W, R, V plots with specific sizes and configurations (e.g., 200 m² areal plots; 2 m × 2 m subplots; boundary and hedgerow plots; streamside plots; arable margin plots).
  - Permanent markers and GPS/photographic references used; relocation rules specified to maintain consistency across surveys.
  - Location and plotting rules consider high-water marks, boundaries, and habitat types; use of plan sketches and GPS for relocation.

- Data recording, mapping, and coding
  - Mapping practices include 1:10,000 scale annotations; change mapping for old squares and new plots for upland vs. enclosed landscapes.
  - Data recording forms capture parcel numbers, CS1990 parcel codes, primary/new parcel codes, and change reliability.
  - Broad habitat reporting with separate handling for montane habitats; ponds included via existing maps (e.g., 1996 Lowland Pond Survey).

- GPS data collection and integration (Annex 1)
  - Procedures for battery power, satellite visibility, PDOP checks (target PDOP < 6 for good 3D fixes).
  - Distinct workflows for stationary (plot) vs moving (new boundary) positions; unique file naming for each plot/feature (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to enable precise relocation and integration.
  - Data logging controls, battery management, almanac updates, and handling obstructions (e.g., tall vegetation) with optional aerial extension antenna.
  - Use of an attribute reference system to quickly select plot IDs during GPS data entry.

- Photography and documentation
  - One camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document general appearance and landmark references.
  - Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and visible in future visits; photos labeled with square/plot identifiers and edge marker boards for scale.

- Procedures after survey and quality control
  - Post-survey checks to ensure no features were omitted; avoid transposing data unless necessary due to damaged materials.
  - Transport of FABs, samples, and documentation back to ITE stations; ongoing training to ensure consistent interpretation of field categories.

- Supplementary data and reference materials
  - Attribute reference lists/sheets to streamline data entry for plot IDs and feature codes.
  - Annexed GPS guidelines and workflow documentation to support spatial accuracy and reproducibility.
