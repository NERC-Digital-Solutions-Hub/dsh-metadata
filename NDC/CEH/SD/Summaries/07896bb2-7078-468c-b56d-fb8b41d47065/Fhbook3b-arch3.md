# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview
- Provides a standardized protocol for field data collection to monitor changes in the rural environment, extending CS1990.
- Aims to produce repeatable, high-quality environmental health measures aligned with biodiversity and policy needs.
- Emphasizes data provenance, metadata, openness where possible, and governance to support policy evaluation and decision-making.

## Sampling design and planning
- Core spatial framework uses a 1 x 1 km square grid; CS1990 covered 508 squares, CS2000 expands to 568 squares in GB (including upland and country-unit considerations).
- Country-level stratification and representation: land classes subdivided by Scotland vs England/Wales; balance of classes and replacement squares to maintain representation.
- Time-series intent: re-survey of prior squares for continuity; new plots added to address habitat changes and data gaps.
- Output focus: data organized by broad habitats to support biodiversity policy targets and national indicators.

## Planning site visits and field operations
- Squares assigned to survey teams; typical workload ~4 days per square; scheduling flexibility to minimize travel and avoid excessive revisits.
- Consistency: prior squares surveyed in the same order as 1990; new squares prioritized to be near neighbours when resources permit.

## Equipment, safety, permissions and access
- Structured provisioning: central supply, station levels, and surveyor responsibilities; includes maps, GPS, FABs, measurement tools, and safety gear.
- Landowner permissions required for full square access; contingency plans for partial or no access; documentation of ownership and access issues for future use.

## General data recording and mapping (FABs and data elements)
- CS2000 introduces three core data elements:
  - Mapping: updated codes with change handling.
  - Plot-based vegetation recording: standardized plots with species and cover data.
  - Sampling: nested plots and transects to quantify habitat structure.
- Broad Habitat Framework: results reported by Broad Habitats to align with biodiversity policy needs; upland vs lowland emphasis differs to capture mosaics and baselines.
- Change-centric approach: old squares map changes; new squares establish baselines for ongoing monitoring.
- Data provenance, metadata considerations, and openness are integrated into the data recording system.

## Plot types, relocation, and data recording methods
- Nested plotting framework:
  - X plots: large 200 m2 plots with nested subplots.
  - Y plots: multiple smaller plots within a square.
  - U plots: unenclosed upland plots.
  - B plots: boundary plots at field edges.
  - A plots: arable field margin plots.
  - H/D, S/W, R/V plots: hedgerows, streams, roadsides, and verges with defined dimensions.
- Permanent relocation markers (metal plates, GPS, photographs) ensure repeatability; relocation procedures described for both old and new plots.
- Recording procedures include species presence, cover classes, dominance, and special taxa handling; woody vegetation and canopy structure are recorded with detailed keys.
- Data integrity emphasizes legibility, traceability of parcels to codes, and documented boundary changes.

## Mapping, coding and data integration
- Mapping and data recording use Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) with integrated 1:10,000 maps and linked data sheets.
- Coding system includes primary/secondary codes for land cover, vegetation, boundaries, and new/atypical features; codes linked to theme maps and CS1990 FABs for traceability.
- Transition between mappable (CS1990-like) and plottable (CS2000 plots) Broad Habitats to capture mosaics and changes, with special notes on Montane/Sub-Arctic habitats.

## Ponds, erosion and erosion scars
- Ponds are mapped and monitored with cross-referencing to Lowland Pond Survey criteria.
- Erosion scars (types A and B) documented within X plots to track grazing and landscape changes.

## Data management, metadata and governance
- Emphasizes traceability across years: parcel linkage, new parcel numbers, and thematic prefixes (P, A, F, B, S).
- Detailed metadata and recording of field conditions, mapping decisions, and plot relocations to support auditability and future reuse.
- Annexes and GPS-related annexes support reproducibility; outputs are designed for dissemination to stakeholders with emphasis on quality control.

## Annexes and updates
- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data, including best practices for power, satellite availability, data file naming, and relocation of plots.
- Updates (as of 2013) reflect refined procedures and expanded plotting options to better support biodiversity policy needs.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Delivers a rigorous blueprint for large-scale, long-term environmental health measurement across landscapes.
- Integrates habitat classification, biodiversity indicators, and landscape change into a policy-aligned monitoring framework.
- Enables robust time-series analyses, change detection, and translation of field observations into policy-relevant indicators (broad habitats, BAP categories, erosion dynamics).
- Addresses data quality, metadata integrity, governance, and practical field data collection considerations for scale.

## Calluna sampling and soil/biological monitoring (Section 10 highlights)
- Soil sampling: five replicate soil samples per 1 km square in each X-plot, processed by ITE Merlewood; standard protocols for sample collection, transport, and labeling.
- Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling: collects current-year growth (CYG) shoots to assess foliar nitrogen as a potential indicator of nitrogen deposition; standardized random sampling within squares and proper sample handling.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated with Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff; both IFE and CS2000 teams may operate in the same square with joint scheduling.

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Photography: one camera per team; photograph every vegetation plot with reference features clearly visible; include square/plot IDs on boards; capture representative visuals of habitat and landmarks.
- After survey: verify data sheets for completeness; avoid post-hoc transposition unless absolutely necessary; transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

## Key practical guidance for monitoring framework authors
- Emphasize standardization of spatial units, data collection forms, and coding to enable comparability over time.
- Integrate robust metadata and provenance practices to support auditability and re-use of data.
- Align field protocols with policy-relevant indicators (broad habitats, habitat change, erosion dynamics) and ensure data can support time-series analyses.
- Plan for cross-disciplinary sampling (soil, vegetation, freshwater) with appropriate governance and inter-agency coordination (e.g., ITE, IFE).
- Maintain clear data sharing pathways and governance to balance openness with governance constraints and ownership issues.
