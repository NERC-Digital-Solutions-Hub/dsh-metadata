# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- A quality assurance (QA) exercise to measure the consistency and reliability of field data in the Countryside Survey 2000.
- Assesses data quality across key components: plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, land-cover mapping, and change detection.
- Compares CS2000 fieldwork against the prior CS1990 survey and the 1991 QA exercise to gauge improvements and ongoing challenges.

## Aims and Scope
- Quantify field recording accuracy and the reliability of change statistics.
- Evaluate plot relocation efficiency and identify observer biases or plot-type effects.
- Relate findings to prior surveys (CS1990 and 1991 QA) to assess improvements over time.
- Test the reliability of land-cover mapping, boundary features, and hedge-related data.
- Assess the recording of land-use changes since 1990.

## Methods and Design
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares from the 1998 survey; within each, one quarter resurveyed.
- Plot types: nine main CS2000 plot types (including quadrats and linear plots such as road verges, streamsides, hedges, boundaries, etc.).
- Records: 234 vegetation plots per QA exercise across the nine plot types.
- Relocation: buried plates used to locate plot corners; assessment compared CS2000 relocation with QA relocation performance.
- Comparison metrics:
  - Species concordance: presence/absence and mis-matches between original CS2000 and QA reassessment.
  - Vegetation cover: estimates of cover percentages for principal species.
  - Land-cover mapping: primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes; boundary features included.
  - Change recording: changes in land use and vegetation between CS2000 and QA assessment.
  - Ordination: DECORANA axis scores to detect directional biases in changes.
- Additional annexes detail coding schemes, change analysis, and data collection protocols.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation and Plate Recovery
- Plot relocation efficiency: CS2000 surveyors could relocate around 60% of plots accurately, about 25% more roughly, with roughly 15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: Assessors located 69.3% of CS2000 plates; this compares with 65.2% plate recovery in the 1991 CS1990 QA exercise.
- Overall, eight years on, relocation performance remained substantial but varied by plot type; small 4m Habitat Plots (Y-plots) were the hardest to relocate.

### Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy
- Initial CS2000 species records showed about 73% concordance with QA assessments; adjustments for plot location errors reduce the discrepancy, aligning efficiency with the CS1990 level.
- The QA frequently produced longer species lists than the CS2000 survey, with mean increases in species per plot (order of 13–14% relative to prior QA benchmarks), consistent with seasonality and management effects between surveys.
- Mis-matches were categorized and analyzed by TI (CS2000) and T2 (QA) variations, including mis-identifications (especially among grasses and certain genera), overlooked species, and location/orientation errors.

### Vegetation Cover and Land-Use Coding
- Cover estimates: broad agreement between CS2000 and QA across principal species, with select species showing significant differences in cover bands (notably grasses). Overall, the QA identified more species and larger cover estimates in some cases, influenced by season and plot overlap.
- Land-use sampling: agreement on common species cover at land-use points was modest to good, with 74.4% concordance for species cover codes awarded at land-use points; some diverse grasses showed larger discrepancies in cover assignment.
- Land-cover codes: primary land-cover codes achieved high concordance (about 87.5% overall; 91.6% excluding BAP codes). BAP codes were less concordant (77.4%), reflecting broader habitat-type complexities.
- Hedge/wall boundaries: primary boundary codes showed strong concordance (around 85–92% depending on metric); hedge shapes and wall conditions had lower, but still substantial, agreement (roughly 67.5%).

### Change Recording and Change Accuracy
- Change concordance between CS2000 and QA was 51.4% overall; a substantial portion of changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA (33.9%), and about 14.7% of changes recorded were not real.
- A significant implication is that many changes since 1990 may have been missed or inconsistently captured; data entry interpretation and location/orientation issues contributed to discrepancies.
- The QA analysis stresses that plot data may offer more reliable evidence of change than the mapped strings alone, given the level of mis-codings and mis-location observed.

### Hedge Diversity and Arable Plots
- Hedge diversity plots (19 samples): total species recorded 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Arable margins: only five plots; concordance between CS2000 and QA was very poor, with substantial seasonal effects and less familiarity with ruderal species; recommends two well-spaced visits for future arable plots.

### Ordination and Axis Change
- DECORANA ordination axis scores for CS2000 vs QA showed no directional bias when assessed overall (mean axis scores: CS2000 ≈ 387.8 vs QA ≈ 392; no significant difference).
- When broken down by plot type and land-class aggregates, there was no consistent, significant shift indicating systematic bias in the QA-retest comparisons.

## Enduring Conclusions and Implications for Data Support
- Overall data reliability: Multiple components of CS2000 data collection demonstrated solid reliability, especially in land-cover mapping and boundary coding; some components (notably plot relocation, change recording, and arable plots) exhibited notable challenges.
- Location and orientation: Errors in plot location and orientation were a major source of non-concordance; improving locating protocols and marker maintenance can reduce biases.
- Change detection: The relatively low change concurrence indicates substantial opportunities for misinterpretation or missed changes; emphasis on using plot-level data for change while refining coding and recording practices is advised.
- Mapping and coding robustness: Primary land-cover and boundary coding showed strong agreement; BAP codes and some hedge/wall categorizations benefited from refinement and clearer protocols.
- Practical recommendations for data support:
  - Strengthen training focused on precise plot relocation and orientation, and on consistent use of plates/markers.
  - Maintain or improve standardized data-entry checks to minimize mis-codings and mis-location errors.
  - When measuring change, rely on robust field verification and consider integrating map-based change evidence with plot records.
  - Consider supplementary visits for challenging plot types (e.g., arable margins) to reduce overlooked species and misidentifications.
  - Continue using QA loops to monitor data quality across time and adapt coding schemes to reduce ambiguity (e.g., hedge and boundary codes).

## Notes for Data Support Practitioners
- QA exercises like this provide a blueprint for assessing and strengthening data integrity across broad, multi-site field programs.
- The balance between efficiency (speed) and accuracy (reliability) is evident; targeted improvements in relocation accuracy and change recording yield the most significant gains in data quality.
- Transparent reporting of discrepancies, along with actionable recommendations, supports better data products and more credible insights for downstream users.
