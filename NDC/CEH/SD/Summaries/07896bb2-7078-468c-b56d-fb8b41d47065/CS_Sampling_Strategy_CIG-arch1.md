## Overview
- Documents the field-survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey 2007 and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification that underpins the framework.
- Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure samples are representative of Britain’s varied landscapes.
- Traces how the sampling frame and land-class classification have developed across successive surveys (1978–2007) to support national, regional, and country-specific reporting.

## Core concept: ITE Land Classification and Stratified Sampling
- Early approach (1978): classify land into 32 ITE Land Classes using environmental attributes; select centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid and classify surrounding squares to form a representative frame.
- Stratification rationale: to avoid bias from purely random sampling and to ensure all parts of the population (land types) are represented, mirroring the logic of stratified opinion polling.
- Sampling frame built by assigning environmental/physiographic characteristics to 1 km squares, then sampling within each Land Class.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey
- 1978 (first framework): 1 km squares classified into 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class (256 total) for the national survey; quadrats and soils recorded, habitat mapping completed.
- 1984 (second field survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); intent to improve precision for national estimates.
- 1990 (land-use emphasis and all-squares approach): Land Classification extended to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map (satellite-derived); all features from 1984 repeated plus new data.
- Post-1990 (refinements to support regional/local estimates): recognition that a GB-wide, uniform 1 km classification was impractical; developed surrogates for climatic/geological/physiographic factors and tested multivariate classifications. The best match to the original classification still allowed only 62% exact correspondence, but neighbouring-class misassignments preserved class averages, enabling a reasonable replacement for forecasting.
- 2000 (CS2000): focus on separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); subdivided Land Classes into country-unit variants; created 40 strata; added squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; introduced uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
- 2007 (CS2007): further adjustments to accommodate Wales-only reporting (devolution context); sub-divided Land Classes into 5 Wales-specific and England-specific variants, creating 45 strata; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (at least 6 squares per Welsh class); some English classes retained a minimum of 4 squares; revised land-class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland.

## Survey-year highlights and structural changes
- CS1978 (Initial Survey): 8 squares per Land Class; total 256; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square multiplied by Land Class area.
- CS1984 (Second Field Survey): 12 squares per Land Class; total 384; continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- CS1990 (All-Squares Land Classification): classification updated to cover all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; inclusion of repeat quadrats and expanded feature recording.
- CS2000 (Separate Country Estimates): introduction of country-unit reporting; Land Classes subdivided by country; increased strata to 40; additional squares allocated; uplands module incorporated; Wales-specific adjustments to sampling and representation.
- CS2007 (Welsh Reporting and Wales-England-Scotland framework): Wales-specific classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; ensured minimum representation in Welsh classes; English classes adjusted to maintain precision; revised country maps issued.

## Wales and uplands modules
- Wales-only reporting requirements driven by policy and legislation needs post-devolution.
- Wales received additional Welsh-specific Land Classes and more Welsh sample squares to enable robust Wales-only estimates.
- An uplands module was added (CS2000/CS2007) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales, funded by multiple agencies.

## National estimates and comparability
- Changes in the basic Land Classification affect the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
- For internal consistency within a survey, the latest classification is preferred; for cross-survey consistency, the original classification can be used.
- The document provides detailed notes on classification changes and their impact on national estimates (see Note Regarding the Creation of National Estimates).

## Data, outputs, and references
- Tables and figures illustrate the evolution of the Land Classification, country-specific sampling frameworks, and the distribution of sample squares (CS2000 and CS2007 maps and tables are referenced).
- References and further reading cover methodological developments and applications of the ITE Land Classification to national and regional ecological surveys.
