# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- This quality assurance (QA) exercise evaluates the accuracy and reliability of the CS2000 field programme across relocation, species recording, vegetation cover estimation, and land-use/mapping components, using a sub-sample of squares and plots for resurvey and comparison with the original CS2000 data.

## Aim and scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in CS2000 and comment on change statistics.
- Assess plot relocation efficiency and compare CS2000 results with QA assessments and CS1990 data.
- Explain differences in recording due to observer error, plot location/orientation, plot type, management, and season.
- Relate findings to overall data quality, coverage, metadata, and change detection.

## Methods (high-level)
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares from CS1998; one quarter of each square resurveyed, focusing on 234 plots across 9 plot types.
- Plate and plot relocation: assessment of ability to relocate original plot markers eight years on; comparison with 1991 QA for the CS1990 survey.
- Data types: land cover mapping, boundary features, hedge delineation, and associated codes; recording of changes since 1990.
- QA metrics: concordance between CS2000 and QA, efficiency of surveyors vs assessors, and analysis by plot type and landclass.

## Plot relocation findings
- Overall recovery of plots and plates: 86.7% (210 planned plots) satisfactorily relocated.
- Relative success by CS2000 surveyors:
  - About 60% accurately relocated.
  - ~25% relocated approximately or more-or-less correctly.
  - ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plates: 69.3% of plates located by assessors; 23.3% of plates located by assessors in a way that overlapped with the CS2000 plot location; overall, relocation success roughly 40–45% when combining exact and approximate recoveries.
- Difficulty: Y-plots (habitat plots) were the most challenging to relocate (23% failure).
- Conclusion: Relocation eight years on is feasible and comparable in effort to relocation after shorter intervals, but some carryover errors (e.g., wrong bank/side of features) and new plates were common.

## Species concordance and recording accuracy
- Overall concordance and error sources:
  - Approximately 71% of CS2000 records were confirmed by QA assessors at resurvey; about 2% non-concordances were due to real changes (management/season).
  - Initial recording accuracy around 73%, with most discrepancies attributable to plot location errors.
  - Compared with CS1990 QA, the trends and magnitudes of species recording accuracy were similar, after accounting for differences in plotting and permanent marking.
- Species counts per plot:
  - CS2000 mean species per plot: 17.9; QA mean: 20.4 (QA records typically longer lists).
  - Across land classes, the order of richness largely remained consistent between CS2000 and QA, though the road verges tended to be richer in 1998 than streamside plots.
- Mismatches and error types:
  - A majority of mismatches stemmed from overlooked species, mis-identifications (especially grasses and related taxa), and plot location/orientation errors.
  - Seasonal effects contributed to some mismatches, particularly for annuals and management-related changes.
- Summary takeaway: recording accuracy is solid but sensitive to plot relocation and species identification challenges; most mismatches balance out when considering larger patterns across plots.

## Vegetation cover and quantitative comparisons
- Cover estimates for principal species generally aligned between CS2000 and QA; several species showed significant differences in cover, notably among grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), with some differences attributable to seasonal timing.
- Statistical signals:
  - Some species showed significant differences in cover between surveyors and assessors (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), while others did not.
  - The pattern indicates reasonable overall agreement but with species-specific variation likely due to phenology and observer interpretation of cover bands.
- Overall, cover concordance was adequate but not uniform across species; a few coarse grasses showed the strongest discrepancies.

## Direction of vegetation change (DECORANA ordination)
- Axis 1 shifts between CS2000 and QA were generally small and not biased toward a particular direction.
- When plotted by plot type and landclass, there were no statistically significant directional biases in overall change between time one and time two.
- Interpretation: changes observed are largely random with respect to direction, rather than indicating systematic bias in either CS2000 or QA methodologies.

## Land-cover mapping and coding
- Primary land-cover codes:
  - High concordance between CS2000 and QA; overall primary land-cover agreement excluding BAP codes: 87.5%.
  - BAP (broad habitat) codes: concordance about 77.4%.
  - Boundary and land-use context: primary boundary feature concordance around 92% (high consistency), with hedge/wall coding showing robust agreement overall; boundary height and stockproof status also show high concordance (around 83–89% depending on metric).
- The mapping framework and coding were largely reliable, with small discrepancies largely traceable to boundary delineation, code interpretation, and seasonal changes in vegetation.

## Change in land use and coding
- Change concurrence: 51.4% overall agreement on observed changes between CS2000 and QA.
- Change not noted by CS2000: 33.9%.
- Change noted but not substantiated by QA assessors: 14.7%.
- Interpretation: substantial portion of observed changes remained unrecorded or misrecorded by CS2000, highlighting challenges in documenting change over time and the need for clearer change-coding protocols.

## Hedge diversity, arable plots, and other unique plots
- Hedge diversity (19 samples):
  - Total species recorded: 124; common species: 92.
  - Overall percentage agreement: 74.2%; surveyor efficiency: 77.4%.
  - Mean species per hedge plot: 5.16 (CS2000) vs 5.89 (QA).
- Arable plots (n=5):
  - Very low concordance (approximately 30.6% agreement).
  - Noted strong seasonal effects and lower familiarity with ruderal/arable flora; recommendation for multiple visits (two visits spaced in time) for robust arable margin data.
- Overall: hedge and arable plots show contrasting reliability, with hedges generally robust while arable margins require more intensive sampling.

## Overall assessment and conclusions
- The CS2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally strong data quality in relocation, primary land-cover coding, and boundary mapping, with reasonable concordance in species recording and vegetation cover.
- Notable limitations include:
  - Plot relocation challenges and occasional mis-location/orientation errors affecting species lists and cover estimates.
  - Change documentation between CS2000 and QA often under-recorded or misinterpreted, indicating room for improved change-tracking protocols.
  - Arable plots show particularly weak concordance, underscoring the need for enhanced sampling strategies in ruderal/arable habitats.
- Implications for data governance:
  - Robust QA procedures are essential for establishing data reliability and tracking changes over time.
  - Clear, standardized coding schemes and documentation practices help reduce misclassification and misinterpretation.
  - Continuous improvement in plotting markers, field protocols, and training can mitigate location/orientation errors and enhance data fidelity.

## Practical takeaways for data leaders
- Implement and document a formal QA framework to quantify data reliability across data products (plots, species, cover, land cover, boundaries).
- Emphasize durable, clearly marked plots and markers to improve repeatability and reduce relocation errors.
- Standardize species identification, with reference materials to minimize mis-identifications and “over-recording” of certain taxa.
- Strengthen change-tracking mechanisms to distinguish true ecological change from coding or data-entry artifacts.
- Allocate targeted QA efforts to data domains with higher variability or lower reliability (e.g., arable margins, complex hedge boundaries) and plan for repeated sampling where necessary.
- Use QA findings to guide metadata and lineage documentation, ensuring end users understand the confidence and limitations of each data product.
