# Countryside Survey 1998: vegetation plot data, Great Britain Dataset Documentation

## Overview
- Documentation for Countryside Survey vegetation plot data from 1998 (and 1999), covering two CSV files: plot metadata and species lists.
- Managed by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; data rights and acknowledgement requirements apply.

## Dataset contents and structure
- Two files:
  - Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 1998.csv: metadata for each plot
  - Vegetation Plot - Species List 1998.csv: species observed in each plot
- Plot Information fields:
  - YEAR, SQUARE_ID, PLOT_ID, PLOT_TYPE, COUNTRY (ENG/SCO/WAL), ENV_ZONE_2007, EZ_DESC_07
- Species List fields:
  - YEAR, SQUARE_ID, PLOT_ID, AMALG_PTYPE, BRC_NUMBER (species identifier), BRC_NAMES (species name), NEST_LEVEL, FIRST_COVER, TOTAL_COVER
- Species nomenclature follows Stace (1997): New flora of the British Isles
- Data from 1998 survey (and 1999); notes reference Barr (1998) for field methodologies

## Standards, nomenclature and zone references
- Environmental zones described using ENV_ZONE_2007 and EZ_DESC_07 (2007 version)
- Ongoing alignment with Countryside Survey methodologies and field handbooks (Barr 1998; Countryside Survey publications)

## Data stewardship implications
- Ensure complete metadata quality and alignment with current standards (field definitions, zone mappings, and nomenclature)
- Maintain proper data provenance, versioning, and access controls; monitor updates to environmental zone schemes
- Manage species reference data (BRC_NUMBER and BRC_NAMES) and maintain traceability to Stace nomenclature
- Enforce acknowledgement language in all disseminations and presentations; respect copyright and usage rights
- Facilitate discoverability by linking to associated publications, field handbooks, and project websites for users and data creators
