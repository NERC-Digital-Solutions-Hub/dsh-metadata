- Usage notes and context
  - The dataset provides plot-level information and species lists to enable analysis of vegetation composition across GB plots.
  - Useful for creating data products (e.g., dashboards or reports) that summarize species presence, cover, and environmental zone context.
  - References and metadata available for deeper methodological understanding and linking to environmental zoning.
