## Purpose and Analytical Use
- Supports monitoring the environment in a consistent format to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Enables categorisation of environmental health against standards using standardized methods.
- Outputs can be presented as reports, maps, and charts; datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Usage Notes for Analysts
- Data from GB plots for 1998 (and 1999) across the English, Scottish, and Welsh countryside.
- Environmental zones are coded using the 2007 version (ENV_ZONE_2007) with textual descriptions (EZ_DESC_07).
- Data quality and standardisation steps include verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation, aligned with Countryside Survey methodologies.
- Data should be used with proper acknowledgement; combines with other datasets to maximize value, and access to underlying data should be facilitated where possible.

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Increasing the value of the datasets by integrating with related environmental data (avoiding single-use applications).
- Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to create the final outputs, to support transparency and further analysis.
