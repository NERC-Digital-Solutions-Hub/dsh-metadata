# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Contains detailed field data coding, sampling procedures, and data-management guidance for vegetation, soil, freshwater, and related field data across GB.
- Provides standardized flora/fauna coding keys, plot layouts, sampling protocols, GPS data collection, photography standards, and post-survey procedures to enable consistent, traceable time-series analyses. 

## Flora and Mosses/Lichens Coding and Naming Conventions

- Extensive crosswalk of abbreviations to taxonomic names for ferns, forbs/woody species, and mosses/lichens.
- Examples show many abbreviations mapped to full genus/species (e.g., Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas, Equisetum arvense).
- Includes rules for recording aggregations or combinations when species-level identification is uncertain.
- Provides structure for later integration into field forms and metadata.

## Section 10 – Sampling

- Three sampling types within CS2000:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by IFE staff)
- Grounded in a national, spatially referenced sampling framework designed to support soil quality indicators and long-term baselines.

### 10.1–10.2 Background and Aim

- Soil sustainability and soil biology/diversity indices identified as key priorities.
- CS2000 provides a national soil-sampling baseline from the same squares used in the 1978 survey, covering representative ITE Land Class and Land Cover types.

### 10.3–10.5 Soil Sampling Details

- In each square, five replicate soil samples are collected for chemistry (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and soil microbiology.
- Samples collected in five core locations per X-plot, following a standardized method.
- Cores sent to ITE Merlewood for processing; unique shipment and handling procedures outlined.

### 10.6 Equipment and Distribution

- Equipment list indicates items distributed to teams (e.g., cool box, trowel, long blade knife) and packaging materials (envelopes, pipes, end caps).
- Envelopes and bags are labeled with corresponding ITE square numbers and plot numbers; includes spare supplies.

### 10.7 Detailed Soil Sampling Procedure

- In each X-plot’s centre plot (2 x 2 m), five soil sampling locations are defined (north, east, west of the centre).
- For each location:
  - Use specific pipe types (black long pipe for first sample; white short pipes for subsequent samples).
  - Extract soil to a depth >5 cm, cap/preserve, label, and seal.
  - Ensure proper handling, removal of extraneous material, and packaging for transport.
- After sampling, samples are mailed or transported to regional coordinators for collection and processing, with notes added to envelopes if issues arise.

### 10.8 Calluna Sampling Rationale

- Foliar nitrogen concentrations in Calluna vulgaris are linked to nitrogen deposition data; sampling aims to identify GB regions where deposition exceeds critical loads for Calluna.
- Requires sampling within every square where Calluna occurs, using the current year’s growth.

### 10.9 Calluna Sampling Procedure

- In each relevant square, sample CYG Calluna shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from random plants.
- Label, seal, and mail samples; allow for slight drying if wet.

### 10.10 Despatching Calluna Samples

- Send samples to ITE Merlewood promptly, via reporting-in or direct posting; obtain and reclaim postage receipts.

### 10.11 Freshwater Sampling

- Freshwater sampling coordinated with specially trained IFE staff; IFE liaises with co-ordinators for suitable timing.

## Section 11 – Photography

- Each field team receives a camera and initial film stock; additional films must be purchased and claimed.
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and position with reference to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, unique, and permanent; each photo must show square/plot numbers clearly (on a marker board).
- Photos should fill a portion of the frame without excessive sky; training examples to illustrate proper composition.

## Section 12 – Procedures After Survey

- Post-survey checks: review data sheets for omissions; avoid transposing data unless necessary due to damage/spoilage.
- Arrangements for returning FABs and samples to ITE stations should be made promptly.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS Data

- Step-by-step guidance for GPS data collection in CS2000:
  - Battery power checks, satellite count (minimum four satellites; aim for PDOP below 6), and situation monitoring (obstructions can degrade accuracy).
  - Recording stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) with designated data-file naming conventions.
  - File naming: each plot/feature gets its own data file; example: 501X4.PSE for square 501, plot X4; feature files use codes like 501F1.MOB.
  - Data rates, attribute selection, and logging controls are specified, with shortcuts to select plot IDs.
  - Stationary plotting requires a clear sky view and a 3–5 minute recording per plot.
  - End-of-session steps include stopping logging, saving data, and powering down the GPS device.
- Battery recharging, almanac updates, and PDOP considerations for accurate positioning are covered.
- Aimbases for overcoming obstructions include relocating the antenna above obstructing features.

## Data Governance and QA Highlights

- Emphasis on standardized field methods, consistent coding, and traceable data collection across time.
- Clear documentation requirements for plot locations, boundaries, and feature changes.
- Integration with policy-relevant frameworks via standardized data capture and metadata collection.
- Coordination between field teams and central laboratories (ITE Merlewood) for sample processing and storage.
