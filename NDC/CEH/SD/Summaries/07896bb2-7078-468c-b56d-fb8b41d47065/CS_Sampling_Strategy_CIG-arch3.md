# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used by Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification to stratify sampling and enable national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - Aims to detect change over time and inform policy decisions; supports data dissemination and transparency.

- Core concepts and methodology
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of land types.
  - 1 km square sample units selected from a broader ITE Land Classification framework.
  - Use of the centre square from a 15 × 15 km grid, with surrounding squares allocated to classes, to create a robust stratification.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate classification to define land classes and environments.
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per class with the total area of each class.

- Timeline and developments (Land Classification and CS sampling)
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes; 8 samples per class; total 256 squares.
    - Habitat area estimates based on mean per-class square values and class areas.
  - CS1984 (Second field survey)
    - 12 squares per class; total 384 squares; continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - CS1990 ('All Squares' Land Classification)
    - Land Classification revised to include data from all 1 km squares in GB.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - CS2000 (New Land Classification and country-specific estimates)
    - Expanded to allow separate England with Wales and Scotland reporting.
    - Land Classes increased (40 total); framework subdivided to support country-unit estimates.
    - Additional samples allocated to improve representation; upland habitat module added (30 extra squares) for England/Wales.
    - Total GB sample numbers adjusted; 40 strata created (via subdivision and occasional aggregation).
  - CS2007 (Welsh-focused reporting and further refinements)
    - Wales-specific reporting drives adjustments to sampling.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), creating 45 strata.
    - 43 Welsh extra squares added; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; England adjustments maintained despite Welsh additions.
    - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country-unit; England and Scotland rebalanced accordingly.
    - Wales-only reporting required by devolved policy and legislation.

- Country unitization and upland emphasis
  - Introduction of England-with-Wales and Scotland country-unit estimates in CS2000.
  - Wales-specific class subdivisions and additional Welsh sampling in CS2007 to enable Wales-only estimates.
  - Upland module in CS2000 targeted improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.

- Outputs, representation, and data considerations
  - Tables and maps summarize squares sampled by class and country; figures illustrate land-class maps and CS sample locations.
  - Emphasis on achieving balanced representation across classes and countries to support reliable national and country-level estimates.
  - Acknowledges potential trade-offs in precision when modifying classifications or country-specific sampling.

- Consistency, limitations, and governance notes
  - Changing the basic land classification framework affects cross-survey comparability of national estimates.
  - Preference in CS2000/CS2007 to use the latest classification for country-specific estimates while noting cross-survey consistency implications.
  - The document underscores the need for transparent methodology when adapting classifications and sampling to policy demands.
