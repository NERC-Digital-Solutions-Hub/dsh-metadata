# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and purpose (GIS-focused)

- Establishes standardized field recording and map-based data products for CS2000.
- Focuses on linking field data with policy-relevant frameworks and remote sensing, enabling time-series analyses.
- Emphasizes standardized data capture, ground-truthing, and documentation to support GIS analyses and integration with maps and satellite imagery.

## Data capture, field procedures, and coding (GIS data integrity)

- Field data are captured in a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and enlarged 1:10,000 maps; consistent, neat completion is essential for usability.
- Structure supports robust time-series: data are organized by mapping, plots/vegetation, and sampling, with hierarchical mapping codes (primary/secondary) and surveyor codes discouraged when standard codes exist.
- Aerial imagery is used as guidance but ground-truthing remains essential; GPS relocation and plot markers are central to spatial accuracy.

## Sampling and field logistics relevant to GIS

- CS2000 employs three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling; freshwater sampling is conducted by accredited IFE staff.
- Five replicate soil samples are collected per 1 km square within each square, focusing on maintaining spatial representativeness across Land Class/Land Cover types used in analyses.
- Soil sampling uses standardized pipe-based cores from centre plots (2 x 2 m); sampling points are precisely located, labeled, bagged, and shipped to ITE Merlewood for analysis.
- Calluna vulgaris foliar sampling is used to assess nitrogen deposition effects; CYG shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) are collected randomly from Calluna plants and shipped to Merlewood.
- Freshwater sampling may occur in parallel with IFE scheduling; coordination with CS coordinators is required.

## Photography for GIS documentation

- Each vegetation plot is photographed to document appearance and positional reference to landmarks.
- Photos should include square/plot identifiers on a conspicuous board, using recognizable, permanent reference features.
- Photos aim to have a balanced composition (plot area visible) and avoid excessive sky; training examples illustrate proper and improper approaches.

## Procedures after survey (data management and QA)

- At day’s end, data sheets must be reviewed to ensure no features were omitted; transposition of data to fresh maps/forms is discouraged unless necessary due to damage.
- FABs and samples should be transported back to ITE stations promptly to preserve data quality and timeliness.
- The process supports clean handover to GIS workflows and ensures timely availability for analysis.

## Annex 1: GPS data collection and field relocation

- Detailed GPS data collection procedures for upland/unenclosed plots and relocation of previously marked plots.
- Emphasizes ground-truthing and precise relocation of permanent markers (metal plates) with plan/photograph references.
- Includes guidance on creating unique data files per plot/feature (e.g., square and plot IDs in file names) and managing GPS logging sessions (stationary vs moving positions).
- Provides instructions for managing PDOP (target < 6 for 3D fixes), battery management, almanac updates, obstructions handling, and using the Magellan keypad for data entry.
- Relocation and re-establishment procedures ensure compatibility with earlier surveys (CS1990/CS2000) and new squares.

## Access, equipment, and field documentation (GIS-ready)

- Equipment lists cover safety, surveying tools, GPS, FABs, marking plates, and photo gear; distribution is organized via regional coordinators.
- Field procedures emphasize pre-visit landowner permissions, contingency strategies for restricted access, and careful route planning to minimize time and travel.
- GPS and photogrammetric data are designed to integrate with GIS workflows and Time-series analyses, supporting landscape-scale interpretation and policy-relevant outputs.

## Practical GIS implications

- Standardized FAB structure and three-tier data organization (mapping, plots, sampling) streamline GIS integration and time-series analyses.
- Precise GPS practices and robust plot relocation enable accurate spatial alignment across survey years.
- The combination of soil, Calluna, and freshwater data enriches spatial datasets for soil quality, vegetation, and biodiversity modeling.
- Photography and well-documented reference features enhance geospatial contextualization of plots within landscapes.
- Clear data handling protocols post-survey support reliable GIS-ready datasets for national biodiversity and land-use monitoring.
