# Countryside Survey 1998: vegetation plot data, Great Britain Dataset Documentation Version: 1: 28/2/2014 Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology

## Overview
- Documentation for Countryside Survey vegetation plots in Great Britain (1998 and 1999 data collection).
- Comprises two CSV files: one with plot information and one with species lists per plot.
- Data designed to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation, with emphasis on traceability, data provenance, and clear metadata.

## Data contents and structure
- Vegetation Plot - Plot Information 1998.csv
  - Columns:
    - YEAR: survey year
    - SQUARE_ID: survey square identifier
    - PLOT_ID: plot identifier
    - PLOT_TYPE: type of plot
    - COUNTRY: ENG, SCO, or WAL
    - ENV_ZONE_2007: environmental zone number (2007 version)
    - EZ_DESC_07: environmental zone description (2007 version)
- Vegetation Plot - Species List 1998.csv
  - Columns:
    - YEAR: survey year
    - SQUARE_ID: survey square identifier
    - PLOT_ID: plot identifier
    - AMALG_PTYPE: plot type
    - BRC_NUMBER: species identifier
    - BRC_NAMES: species name
    - NEST_LEVEL: nest species first recorded in
    - FIRST_COVER: percent cover in first nest
    - TOTAL_COVER: percent cover in whole plot
- Species nomenclature follows Stace (1997), New Flora of the British Isles.

## Metadata, provenance, and standards
- Data provenance: Countryside Survey project; detailed methodology referenced in Barr (1998) and related CS documentation.
- Environmental zoning: environmental zones described per 2007 version; cross-referenced in accompanying metadata.
- Metadata and data quality: notes point to the need for robust metadata, clear data provenance, and consistent naming conventions to facilitate reuse and verification.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks
- Provides a concrete example of structured, plot-based ecological data collection and documentation.
- Demonstrates integration of plot-level information with species-level data, standardized nomenclature, and clear attribution requirements.
- Highlights practical considerations for monitoring data governance, metadata completeness, data accessibility, and transparent communication of methods and limitations.
