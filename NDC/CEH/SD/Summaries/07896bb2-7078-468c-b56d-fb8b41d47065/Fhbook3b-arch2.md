# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Purpose and Scope
- Establishes standardized guidelines for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to update land-use databases, monitor ecological changes, and support policy-relevant monitoring over time.
- Builds on CS1990 with emphasis on time-series consistency, data quality, and integration with government/NGO reporting (biodiversity, sustainable development, CAP reforms).
- Aims to reduce observer variation through detailed field handbook, clear coding, definitions, and procedures.
- Promotes long-term, policy-relevant environmental monitoring across GB with repeatable methods and standardized outputs.

## Sampling Framework and Coverage
- Core concept: 1 x 1 km sample squares across GB using the ITE Land Classification System.
- CS1990 baseline of 508 squares expanded to 568 squares; total GB squares recorded across regions.
- Refinements for CS2000:
  - Re-survey all CS1990 squares (except Isle of Man withdrawals) to maintain time-series integrity.
  - Country-unit reporting stratified into 37 sub-classes with added squares to ensure representation.
  - Additional upland/marginal upland squares approved and implemented.
  - Isle of Man replacements with equivalents elsewhere.
- Outputs planned include Britain-wide land cover mapping and enhanced data collection in 1998, with standardised field recording to reduce inter-observer variation.

## Planning Site Visits
- Six teams, each covering about 95 squares (varies by station); typical square surveyed in ~4 days.
- Flexible scheduling with cost-conscious travel; no overtime pay but time off in lieu for large overtime.
- Survey order mirrors CS1990 for old squares; new squares surveyed alongside nearest neighbours where possible.

## Equipment and Field Logistics
- Comprehensive equipment provisioning with clear ownership and care responsibilities.
- Includes safety gear, Field Assessment Books (FABs), GPS, maps, aerial photos, plotting tools, recording materials, and photography gear.
- Standardised procedures for plot relocation (e.g., metal plates, ground plans, GPS) to ensure traceability.

## Planning and Permissions
- Required permits: landowner/farmer consent for access to all parts of a square.
- Access-denied procedures:
  - Complete denial: abandon square and replace randomly.
  - Partial denial: survey accessible parts; status depends on whether the square is new or existing.
- Landowner engagement documented; survey teams carry ITE identity cards and explanatory materials.

## Data Recording and Mapping (FABs)
- Integrated data collection with:
  - Mapping: extensive use of 1:10,000 maps and standardized primary/secondary codes to annotate land cover, boundaries, and features.
  - Plot-based vegetation recording: standardized plots with detailed species lists, cover categories, and nested subplots.
  - Sampling plots: Areal, Y (small targeted), U (unenclosed), B (boundaries), A (arable margins), H (hedgerows), D (hedgerow diversity), S & W (streamside/waterside), R & V (roadside/verge).
- Mapping philosophy: shift toward documenting changes (especially in old squares) and establishing baselines for upland vs. lowland habitats.
- Two-tier habitat framework:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs): woodland types, boundaries, arable/introduced features, improved/neutral grasslands, etc.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (BAPs): upland, montane, heaths, bogs, fens, and other less clearly delimited areas needing additional plots.
- Emphasis on data integrity: standardized field codes, explicit definitions, and quality control; annexes cover GPS data capture and methods for consistency.

## Mapping Methodology in New Squares vs. Old Squares
- New squares (CS1990 methodology): full mapping of land cover and landscape features with complete FABs and boundary coding.
- Old squares (1998 methods): focus on change mapping relative to CS1990; requires linking to past parcel codes and primary codes; two approaches for change (de novo vs. change-to-change) with options to adjust parcel lines or renumber features.
- Output alignment: changes tied to BAP maps and data recording forms to preserve traceability across survey cycles.

## Plot Types and Recording Protocols
- X PLOTS (Large/Wally plots): 200 m2 plots with nested 4 m2 inner plots; permanent markers and GPS used for relocation.
- Y PLOTS (Small/Targeted): five 2 m x 2 m plots per square in various habitats; nested recordings and temporary relocation rules.
- U PLOTS (Unenclosed): 2 m x 2 m plots within unenclosed habitats; quantity tied to proportion of Plottable Broad Habitats in the square.
- B PLOTS (Boundary): 200 m2 plots at field boundaries to capture boundary vegetation dynamics; relocation rules if hedges or boundaries shift.
- A PLOTS (Arable margins): 100 x 1 m plots along field margins to monitor arable weed communities.
- H PLOTS (Hedgerows): two hedgerow plots per square with detailed woody species inventories; permanent markers.
- D PLOTS (Hedgerow diversity): baseline plots to quantify woody species diversity along hedgerows.
- S & W PLOTS (Streamside/Waterside): five plots along watercourses to capture aquatic and riparian vegetation.
- R & V PLOTS (Roadside/Verge): five plots to sample verge vegetation across road types.
- All plots use permanent markers, precise orientation, detailed sketches; GPS and photography recommended for relocation and documentation.

## Species Recording and Identification
- Standardized lists for common species (top 200) and framework for unlisted taxa with Latin/common names; combinations allowed for difficult taxa.
- Bryophyte and lichen recording limited to a specified list to ensure consistency and comparability with earlier surveys.

## Data Quality, Access, and Use
- Emphasis on standardisation to improve data quality and comparability across years.
- Recognition of value in integrating CS2000 data with other datasets and ensuring access to underlying data used to generate outputs.
- Annexes and guidelines emphasize quality control, observer training, and robust data management for policy-relevant monitoring.

## Key Takeaways for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- CS2000 provides a structured, repeatable framework for long-term environmental monitoring across GB with explicit procedures to ensure data consistency over time.
- Defines a comprehensive set of plot types and a code-based mapping system to capture current conditions and changes since CS1990.
- Employs a two-tier habitat approach (Mappable vs. Plottable Broad Habitats) to accommodate enclosed lowlands and upland/unenclosed landscapes.
- Integrates GPS, standardized FABs, and rigorous relocation protocols to support reliable time-series data and facilitate data sharing and policy evaluation.
- Addresses data value and access by encouraging data integration and broad accessibility to underpin environmental health scrutiny and policy performance assessment.

## Sectional Highlights (Sampling and Data Handling)
