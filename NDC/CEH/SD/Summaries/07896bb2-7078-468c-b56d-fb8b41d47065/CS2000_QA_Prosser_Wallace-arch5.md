# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- This QA exercise assesses consistency, reliability, and accuracy of field recording in the Countryside 2000 survey.
- A subset of squares (38 of 519) was selected; in each, one quarter was resurveyed, recording 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Goals: evaluate plot relocation efficiency, species record concordance, accuracy of percent cover estimates, potential directional bias in habitat change, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and change recording.

## Methods and Scope
- Sample: 38 squares (34 previously included in CS1990 QA; several new squares added).
- Plots: 234 across plot types (quadrats and linear plots, including road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
- Plate relocation: attempted relocation of buried plot corner plates eight years after burial; use of sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors to assess relocation success.
- Data comparison: CS2000 survey data vs QA assessment to quantify concordance, calibration of cover estimates, and detection of change since 1990.

## Key Findings

### Plot Relocation and Plate Recovery
- Plot relocation success: about 60% accurately relocated by CS2000 surveyors; ~25% relocated but not precisely; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Plate recovery: assessors located ~69% of plates; overall recovery rate comparable to prior QA exercises eight years on (vs. 12 months previously).
- Some relocation errors occurred (e.g., wrong bank/side of features, proximity to wrong boundary markers), and new plates were frequently used due to difficulties locating old plates.

### Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy
- Across ~6000 records in 210 plots, initial CS2000 recorder accuracy was about 73%, with assessment indicating roughly 71% of species were confirmed by QA; around 2% attributed to real management/seasonal changes.
- QA detected that the mean number of species per plot increased from CS2000 (17.9) to QA (20.4); same directional bias as seen in CS1990 QA, implying similar observer performance.
- Overall, there is substantial but not perfect concordance in species lists; mis-matches arise from misidentifications (especially grasses), overlooked species, and plot location/orientation errors.

### Vegetation Cover Estimates
- Visual cover estimates for principal species showed good overall agreement between CS2000 surveyors and QA assessors, with several species showing statistically significant differences (notably some grasses). Some differences likely reflect seasonal effects or species life stages.
- For major grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), certain discrepancies persisted, while herb species differences were generally less pronounced.

### Change in Vegetation and DECORANA Ordination
- Changes in species composition between CS2000 and QA were analyzed along DECORANA axis 1. For most plot types, there was no consistent directional bias; shifts often reflected location/orientation or cover-matching differences rather than true ecological trends.

### Land Cover Mapping and Boundary Coding
- Primary land cover codes: high concordance between CS2000 and QA (overall concordance around 91.6% excluding BAP codes; including BAP codes, overall primary land cover agreement ~87.5%).
- BAP (broad habitat) codes also showed strong concordance, though some misclassifications occurred in more complex wooded/shrub/lowland mosaics.
- Boundary features and hedges: primary boundary code concordance ~92.0%; overall boundary/landscape code concordance ~89.2% with boundary height and stockproof status showing good consistency (stockproof ~83.8%).
- Hedge shapes and wall conditions: agreement varied; hedge-shape coding (new codes 374–380) had limited success, with many hedges coded under a single category in practice; walls showed some misclassification between “sound and stockproof” vs deteriorating conditions.

### Land Use Change and Boundary/Area Features
- Change recording: overall agreement on recorded change between CS2000 and QA was about 51.4%; about 33.9% of observed changes were not noted by CS2000, and ~14.7% were recorded but not substantiated by QA.
- This suggests substantial changes since 1990 may be missed in survey strings, underscoring the need for careful field verification and clear documentation of changes.

### Arable Plots
- Only five arable plots were evaluated; concordance was low (around 30.6%), with substantial seasonal and identification challenges noted. Indicates arable margin plots require additional visits and more rigorous recording to be reliable.

### Arising Data and Efficiency Metrics
- Hedge diversity plots showed QA detected more species overall than CS2000, but in many cases hedges were treated as afterthought, leading to higher overlooked counts for woody species.
- Summary dataset (hedge plots): total records 124 species; 92 common; overall agreement ~74.2%; surveyor efficiency ~77.4%; mean species per plot ~5.89 (QA) vs ~5.16 (CS2000).
- For land use, primary qualifying and boundary codes, and major species cover, the QA results generally aligned with CS2000 expectations, though some discrepancies arose from seasonal variation, plot location/orientation, and identification challenges.

## Data Quality Metrics and Implications

- Overall land cover and boundary coding: high reliability
  - Primary land cover concordance (excluding BAP): 91.6%
  - Overall primary land cover agreement (including BAP): 87.5%
  - Primary boundary code concordance: 92.0%
  - Boundary features: code concordance ~89.4% (stockproof) with boundary heights ~74–75% agreement
- Mapping and change detection
  - Change concurrence: ~51.4% (CS2000 vs QA)
  - Significant portion of changes not noted or substantiated, indicating potential under-recording of changes or misclassification.
- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Plot relocation accuracy ~60%; approx 15% inadequately relocated
  - Plate recovery by assessors ~69.3% (eight years after burial)
- Species recording
  - Mean species per plot increased in QA (CS2000: 17.9; QA: 20.4)
  - Species concordance overall strong but with notable mis-identifications and overlooked species, especially among grasses
- Arable plots
  - Very limited data; agreement low (around 30%), highlighting need for cautious interpretation and more visits for arable margins

## Practical Implications for Data Stewardship

- Documentation and metadata
  - Maintain detailed provenance of survey and QA processes, including plot relocation procedures, plate-plate matching, and coding rules (including BAP and hedge codes).
  - Record changes with explicit justification to improve change detection reliability and reduce post hoc interpretation needs.
- Data quality controls
  - Strengthen location/orientation checks to reduce mis-location errors, particularly for linear plots (X, Y, U plots) and boundary-adjacent plots.
  - Standardize cover estimation practices and provide ongoing training to minimize seasonal and observer biases, especially for grasses.
- Mapping and codes
  - Ensure robustness of land cover and boundary coding schemes, particularly hedge shapes and wall conditions, with clear decision rules to improve consistency across teams.
  - For hedges and boundaries, consider consolidating codes or improving guidance to reduce misclassification.
- Change monitoring
  - Implement a clear protocol to capture and verify changes, perhaps by incorporating a “change justification” field and cross-checks with previous survey strings.
  - Schedule biennial re-surveys for complex habitat types or plots with historically high mis-match rates.

## Summary

- The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally high reliability in mapping and boundary coding, robust but imperfect species recording, and reasonable plot relocation performance after eight years.
- Major strengths: high concordance in primary land cover and boundary codes; overall good mapping consistency; manageable but non-negligible observer-related differences in species and cover estimates.
- Key weaknesses: substantial change detection gaps, arable margin plot reliability, and some location/orientation errors that affect data quality.
- For data stewardship, these findings underscore the importance of clear metadata, standardized field procedures, robust change documentation, and targeted training to maintain and improve data quality across large, multi-operator datasets.
