# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Document the sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey field surveys and its evolution over time.
  - Link current methodology to previous ITE Land Classification work to ensure continuity and historical context.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified sampling: dividing land into discrete strata to ensure representative sampling and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental, physiographic and other mapped attributes used to classify land into land classes for stratification.

- Timeline of developments
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
    - Use Indicator Species Analysis to define 32 land classes from 1 km squares (center of 15x15 km grid).
    - Classify surrounding squares; create 6039 km of classified squares.
    - Survey 8 km squares per land class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Extended survey to 12 km squares per land class (total 384).
    - Continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares; urban/sea corrections included.
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats; additional features recorded.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey)
    - Landscape classification updated to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of land classes increases to 40.
  - 2000 (CS2000, Wales/England reporting adjustments)
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-specific classifications.
    - Sub-division and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata; additional 19 squares; further adjustments to ensure representation across countries.
    - Uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - 2007 (Revised Land Classification & 5th Field Survey; Wales-focused adjustments)
    - Wales reporting strengthened by adding Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing Welsh squares to ensure Wales-specific results.
    - England adjustments made to maintain representation; total strata increased to 45.
    - Additional 43 Welsh squares added; still 4 English squares in some classes to maintain reporting precision.

- Sampling design and data assembly
  - Field survey units
    - 1 km squares used as the primary sampling frames; country-level estimates derived from squares within each country.
    - Early approach used a center square plus 4 surrounding squares per classified square.
  - Sample sizes and distribution
    - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
    - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
    - CS1990: 508 squares (expanded to include all GB squares; introduced all-squares Land Classification).
    - CS2000: approximately 30–31 squares per major class in England with additional Wales adjustments; total about 66–70% of GB coverage by country units.
    - CS2007: Wales-focused expansions; total strata increased; more Welsh squares to support Wales-only reporting.
  - Country-specific adjustments
    - Post-1990 adaptations to enable England-with-Wales and Scotland-only estimates.
    - 2000 framework introduced country-unit sub-classes and aggregations to maintain balanced representation across England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Uplands focus
    - Extra upland squares added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

- Outputs and usage
  - National habitat estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of each class.
  - Land Classification maps and class-specific distributions used to model and estimate GB-wide, and country-specific, habitat extents.
  - Outputs support policy and environmental reporting for England, Scotland, and Wales, with Wales gaining dedicated Wales-only reporting in 2007.

- Data quality, consistency, and challenges
  - Changing Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates over time; preferred approach balances internal survey consistency with cross-survey comparability.
  - Representation bias risks addressed via stratification and targeted additions of squares in underrepresented classes or countries.
  - Complexity of cross-country reporting led to evolving class structures (e.g., country-unit versions, sub-divisions, and aggregations) to preserve statistical reliability.
