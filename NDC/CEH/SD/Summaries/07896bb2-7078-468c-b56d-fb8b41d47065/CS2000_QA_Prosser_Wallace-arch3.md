# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- The QA exercise assesses reliability and consistency of the Countryside 2000 field survey across plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and change detection.
- It evaluates how well CS2000 fieldwork stands up to independent reassessment and informs improvements for future monitoring.

## Overview of the QA Exercise

- Sample and scope:
  - 38 of 519 squares were selected; one quarter of each square resurveyed.
  - 234 plots recorded across nine plot types.
  - Aims included: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of cover estimates, detection of habitat change without directional bias, comparability with CS1990, accuracy of landcover mapping, and recording of landuse changes.
- Key measures:
  - Plot relocation success, species concordance, vegetation cover estimates, landcover coding accuracy, hedge/boundary recording, and change detection.
  - Annex B provides dates and measures of surveyor efficiency for each square.

## Methods and Scope

- Plot types and relocation:
  - Re-examined quadrats and linear plots across main CS2000 plot types (including new BAP plots and road verges/streamsides/fields).
  - Plots relocated using original maps, photographs, sketch maps, and, where possible, metal plates.
- Data handling:
  - Direct comparison of CS2000 field codes with QA assessments at identical points.
  - Assessment of changes from 1990 baseline and how well real changes vs. corrections were captured.
- Classification of relocation performance (within-square):
  - I: Plate and plot located and verified by matching records.
  - II: Plate not found, but location deemed close enough.
  - III: Plate not found; approximate relocation.
  - IV: Insufficient plate information; location uncertain.
- Mapping and coding:
  - Three tiers of landcover codes: primary, secondary descriptive, and cover codes.
  - Evaluation included concordance for primary landcover, BAP codes, primary boundary codes, and hedge/wall boundaries.
- Change assessment:
  - Analysis of whether changes recorded by CS2000 matched assessor observations and how much change occurred vs. what was missed.

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - 60% of CS2000 plots were accurately relocated by surveyors; ~25% approximately relocated; ~15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% (compared with 65.2% in 1991 QA of CS1990).
  - About 40–45% could have been recovered if combining assessor and surveyor identifications; several instances of mis-placed plots or misalignment occurred.
  - Some issues noted with locating new plates in 1998, suggesting future surveys may need more robust plate replacement strategies.
- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Mean species per plot: CS2000 17.9 vs QA 20.4.
  - Overall concordance: CS2000 participants vs QA assessors yielded substantial non-concurrences; 73% initial concordance appeared, with the remaining attributable to plot relocation/mis-location and cover differences.
  - Major sources of error:
    - Overlooked species (the largest single category, ~39.8% of TI variations).
    - Orientation and location errors (mis-location and mis-orientation).
    - Mis-identifications and “over-zealous” or inconsistent recording within plots.
  - Species cover comparisons for 8–10 key species showed some significant differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum), while many grasses showed variable agreement; seasonal effects explained some discrepancies.
  - Change in species composition between CS2000 and QA showed axis-score shifts in DECORANA ordination but no overall directional bias in mean axis scores between CS2000 and QA.
- Vegetation cover and abundance
  - QA often produced longer species lists; some species had significantly different mean covers between CS2000 and QA for certain plots.
  - Overall cover agreement was variable by species; some grasses exhibited significant differences, while many herb species did not show significant change.
- Landcover mapping and boundary coding
  - Primary landcover code concordance: 87.5% overall; excluding BAP codes, concordance rose to 91.6%.
  - BAP codes concordance: 77.4%.
  - Land use primary codes and boundary codes showed strong agreement:
    - Primary landcover concordance (excluding BAP): 91.6%; including BAP: 87.5%.
    - Primary boundary code concordance: 92.0% (code concordance) and 85.0% (total concordance).
  - Hedge/wall boundaries: boundary-related codes showed lower concordance (67.5%), with most discrepancies due to omissions or misclassification of hedge shapes.
- Hedge diversity and arable plots
  - Hedge diversity plots recorded more species by assessors than CS2000 surveyors, with notable omissions of woody species in hedge modules.
  - Arable margin plots (small sample): very low concordance (about 30.6% agreement for TI/T2), indicating high seasonal effects and limited familiarity with ruderal species; recommended multiple visits for future arable plots.
- Change recording and concordance
  - Overall change concurrence: 51.4%; 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
  - Many changes observed by assessors were not captured by CS2000 codes, highlighting potential under-recording of change in the main survey.
- Overall assessment of CS2000 data quality
  - No directional bias detected in axis scores; mean scores were similar between CS2000 and QA.
  - Mapping and boundary coding demonstrated high consistency; change detection and plot relocation identified notable gaps, especially in arable margins and where plot relocation was challenging.
  - The QA confirms CS2000 provided generally reliable field data but emphasizes improvements needed in plot relocation accuracy, capture of changes, arable-margin recording, and hedge boundary classifications.

## Mapping, Coding, and Change Details

- Primary land cover and BAP codes
  - High level of concordance for primary land cover; BAP codes showed some inconsistencies due to boundary delineation and evolving habitat categories.
- Boundary coding
  - High concordance for boundary features and boundary height/stockproof status; some misclassification of hedge shapes and wall conditions noted.
- Landuse changes
  - Some mis-codings and omissions regarding changes in crops, hedge types, and boundary status; considerable effort required to separate genuine change from coding corrections.

## Arable and Other Plot Types

- Arable plots
  - Very limited sample; findings indicate substantial seasonality and less familiarity with ruderal species among surveyors; recommended ensuring more visits to future arable margin plots.
- Other plot types (X, Y, U, H road verges, streamsides, etc.)
  - Mixed results; relocation and identification challenges varied by plot type, with road verges and small plots showing higher vulnerability to mis-location and mis-ordering.

## Endnotes and Annexes

- Annex B lists dates and surveyor efficiency metrics for each square, illustrating improvements and variability over time.
- The QA exercise is framed as a continuation of a quality-control tradition (paralleling the 1991 QA exercise for CS1990) to refine monitoring practices and ensure robust data for policy evaluation and future decision-making.

Overall, the Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise demonstrates generally robust field data quality, with strong performance in mapping and boundary coding, but highlights key areas for improvement: plot relocation accuracy, recording of change, handling arable margins, and hedge-boundary classifications to strengthen future environmental monitoring frameworks.
