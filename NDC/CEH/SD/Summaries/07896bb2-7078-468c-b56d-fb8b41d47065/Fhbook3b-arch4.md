# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Provides a national field data collection framework to update land cover, landscape, and vegetation data as time-series.
- Builds on CS1990 with emphasis on change detection, data quality, and policy-relevant biodiversity integration.
- Emphasizes standardized practices, observer training, permissions, and integration with broader data ecosystems (remote sensing, biodiversity reporting).

## How this handbook supports Data Leaders

- Standardized, time-series data collection to enable consistent monitoring of countryside change.
- Clear data architecture with two main streams and a two-tier mapping approach for different landscape types.
- Focus on data quality, metadata, discoverability, and reproducibility of methods.
- Integration-ready outputs (land cover maps, broad habitat classifications, BAP insights) linked to policy and cross-sector use.
- GPS-enabled plotting and GIS workflows to support spatial analyses and data interoperability.

## Data architecture and data streams

- 1 x 1 km sampling units across the UK, continuing the CS1990 time-series with updated sampling in CS2000.
- Two main data streams:
  - Mapping and landscape features (coded features, changes in old squares, full mapping in new squares).
  - Vegetation and plots data (nested plots of various sizes, species identifications, and cover percentages).
- Two-tier mapping:
  - Mappable Broad Habitats (BAPs) for lowland/enclosed landscapes.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats for upland/unenclosed landscapes with additional plots.
- Outputs include Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), theme maps, BAP maps, and GPS-enabled plotting.

## Data collection philosophy and quality

- Emphasis on planning, standardization, and quality control to ensure robust time-series data and credible change detection.
- Observer variation recognized as a data error source; stricter quality control and targeted training to maintain consistency.
- Ethical data collection with landowner permissions and procedures for refusals and communications.

## Planning, field operations, and governance

- CS2000 sample distribution across six ITE Research Stations; teams manage roughly 95 squares each, with ~4 field days per square.
- Sequencing designed to preserve temporal consistency (old squares revisited in 1990 order; new squares aligned with neighbors).
- Planning considerations include field logistics, travel time efficiency, and no overtime (time-off-in-lieu as needed).
- Clear governance for field access, with guidance on refusals and partial access to preserve data integrity.

## Data recording standards, codes, and outputs

- FABs consolidate site data, maps, and coded information; meticulous completion is essential for analytics.
- Uses CS1990 and CS2000 mapping codes for areas, lines, and points; primary and secondary classifications; provision for surveyor-created codes when necessary.
- CS2000 introduces a structured approach:
  - Mapping changes in old squares vs mapping anew in new squares.
  - Broad habitat reporting by BAP-aligned categories with some upland exceptions.
  - Plottable Broad Habitats (upland) with added plots to monitor changes.
- Annexed guidance provides parcel numbering, CS1990/CS2000 change tracking, re-numbering, and mosaics.

## Plot design, sampling design, and plots

- Diverse plot types with detailed layouts and relocation methods to ensure traceability:
  - X plots (AreAL/wide plots), Y plots (small plots), U plots (unenclosed), B plots (boundaries), A plots (arable margins), H and D plots (hedgerow-related), S/W and R/V plots (streams/roadsides).
- Each plot type has defined size, placement, and recording procedures to support repeatable data collection.

## Data products, GIS workflow, and integration

- FABs and maps form the core dataset per square; enable analyses of habitat change, land-cover dynamics, and biodiversity indicators.
- Standardized broad habitat classifications tie field data to national policy and biodiversity reporting (e.g., BAPs).
- GPS integration enhances spatial precision and interoperability with remote sensing data.

## Permissions, ethics, and field governance

- Access permissions required; landowners engaged via pre-visit communication and on-site confirmations.
- Procedures exist for refused or partial access to minimize wasted effort and protect data validity.

## End-of-handover, learning, and collaboration

- Emphasizes clear documentation, reproducible methods, and notes/qualifiers for atypical data.
- Encourages future improvements through collaboration with the data community and broader liaison across sectors.

## Annexes and supplementary guidance

- Annex 1: Collecting GPS data (geolocation of plots, handling GPS logging, file naming, PDOP considerations, and data quality checks).
- Additional guidance on mapping codes, field procedures, and ensuring consistent data capture across the CS2000 program.

## Sampling sections (Section 10 highlights)

- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna vulgaris sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE).
- Soil sampling:
  - Five replicate samples per 1 km square center plot for soil chemistry, fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
  - Specific pipe-based sampling protocol, packaging, and post collection handling to ensure sample integrity.
- Calluna sampling:
  - Foliar nitrogen concentration sampling to assess nitrogen deposition impacts; collection of current-year growth and careful handling and despatch to ITE Merlewood.

## Photography and post-survey procedures

- Photography of vegetation plots using standardized framing, reference features, and plot identification boards.
- Post-survey data checks to ensure no features are omitted; arrangements to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

## Annex 1 – GPS data collection (operational details)

- Step-by-step instructions for battery management, satellite checks (PDOP targets), stationary vs. moving feature logging, and custom file naming tied to square/plot identifiers.
- Guidance on using GPS logging interfaces, recording intervals, and data management for subsequent GIS integration.
