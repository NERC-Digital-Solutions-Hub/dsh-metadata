# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Aim and scope
- Standardizes field data collection for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to ensure current, comparable, and discoverable land-use and vegetation data.
- Builds on CS1990, emphasizing time-series consistency, observer data quality, metadata, and documentation to support policy, biodiversity monitoring, and sustainable land management.
- Supports national/international biodiversity and land-use objectives through standardized coding, robust data management, and clear pathways from field collection to analysis.

## Data standards, governance, and stewardship
- Three core data elements: mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling; mapping change is a key refinement.
- Use of Broad Habitats frameworks and translation to Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs), with distinctions between Mappable Broad Habitats and Plottable Broad Habitats.
- Rigorous documentation and coding conventions to enable traceability, interoperability, and future querying.
- Cross-referencing and alignment with CS1990 parcel codes, new parcel creation, and data model designed for policy-relevant analyses.
- Annexed GPS data workflows to ensure precise, repeatable locations and national data integration.

## Field data collection framework
- Field activities organized to maximize comparability across observers and years, with standardized procedures and forms (FABs).
- Data flow supports national baselines and time-series analysis, enabling consistent trend detection and reporting.

## Planning, access, and equipment
- Structured planning for site visits with defined team allocations, schedules, and landowner permissions; contingencies for restricted access.
- Comprehensive field equipment lists and safeguarding responsibilities; emphasis on data integrity and timely reporting of issues.

## Data recording, coding, and documentation
- FABs split data into mapping, vegetation plots, and sampling; consistent coding by theme (ownership, physiography, land cover, boundaries, buildings/structures, etc.).
- Universal and alpha-numeric coding conventions for rapid field-to-database translation; emphasis on legible, well-structured entries.
- Standardized species nomenclature, with coverage for approximately 200 common species, plus mosses/lichens, and guidelines for handling difficult identifications and aggregations.
- Detailed guidance on feature/parcel coding, ownership data, and boundary changes to maintain robust historical context.

## Plot types, layout, and relocation
- Plot typologies (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W) designed to capture baseline vegetation, habitat monitoring, boundary dynamics, and roadside/linear features.
- Clear relocation procedures using metal plates, photographs, plans, and renaming conventions when features change.
- Permanent marking strategies to ensure future relocatability and data integrity, including accompanying photographs and sketches.

## Change detection, habitat translation, and BAP
- Distinguishes changes that are mappable (CS1990-style mapping) from those better tracked via plots (Plottable Broad Habitats).
- Detailed procedures for translating changes between CS1990 parcels and BAP categories, with guidance on parcel numbering and new lines when needed.
- Documentation and cross-referencing support consistent habitat change reporting and policy alignment.

## Data management, integration, and sharing
- Datasets designed to align with FABs and theme maps, with cross-references to CS1990 parcel codes and New Parcel Numbers for changes.
- Emphasis on a query-friendly data model to support future analyses, biodiversity reporting, and policy decisions.
- Procedures to prepare data and metadata for downstream reporting and potential portal sharing.

## GPS data collection and documentation (Annex)
- Step-by-step GPS data collection, including satellite checks, stationary vs moving captures, and file-naming conventions that embed square and plot identifiers.
- Guidance on achieving high-quality GPS fixes (PDOP considerations, obstruction handling, and almanac updates).
- Practical tips for equipment handling, battery management, and data logging workflows to ensure reproducibility.

## Section 10: Sampling (soil, Calluna, freshwater)
- Three sampling types within CS2000: soil, Calluna vulgaris foliar nitrogen, and freshwater biota; soil and Calluna by field surveyors, freshwater by IFE staff.
- Rationale: establishing baseline soil quality and biodiversity data to support soil sustainability indices and nitrogen deposition analyses.
- Soil sampling protocol: five replicate cores per square within X-plots, triplicate cores per center plot, standardized packaging, rapid shipment of short-term samples, and detailed field notes for any deviations.
- Calluna sampling: standardized collection of current year growth within each square, careful labeling, despatch to ITE Merlewood, and options for during-field collection or station-based dispatch.
- Freshwater sampling: coordinated scheduling with IFE to avoid conflicts and ensure proper timing.

## Section 11: Photography
- Cameras provided per team; photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features.
- Use of prominent, permanent reference features and clear labeling on a visible board showing square/plot identifiers.
- Composition guidance to ensure plots fill a meaningful portion of the frame and landmarks remain visible for future re-visits.

## Section 12: Procedures after survey
- Post-survey data checks: verify no features are omitted; avoid unnecessary transcription to new forms unless essential.
- Prompt transportation of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing and storage.

## Annex: GPS data and documentation
- Practical, field-ready GPS workflow covering power management, satellite visibility, stationary vs moving data capture, and file naming to ensure traceability and integration with square/plot records.

## End notes and context
- The CS2000 Field Handbook is a foundational guide to standardized field data collection, linking field practices to national biodiversity and land-use reporting.
- It emphasizes robust metadata, consistent coding, and a clear pathway from field collection to policy-relevant data analysis.
