# Amazon Fertilization Experiment (AFEX)

## Study area
- Conducted within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP) area, KM41 reserve, ~100 km from Manaus, Brazil.
- Location: 41 km of the vicinal road ZF-3 of BR-174 (02 24'S, 59 52'W).
- Soils: clay-rich Ferralsols (~30% of the Amazon Basin).
- Climate: annual rainfall 1900–2500 mm with a pronounced dry season (June–October).
- Forest structure: above-ground biomass (AGB) 322 ± 54 Mg ha^-1 for individuals ≥10 cm DBH; mean wood density 0.67 g cm^-3; ~280 species (≥10 cm DBH) per hectare.

## Experimental design (AFEX)
- AFEX is a full factorial fertilization experiment with eight treatments and four replicates per treatment, totaling 32 plots.
- Experimental layout: four independent blocks with plots at least 200 m apart.
- Treatments (eight total): Control; nitrogen (N); phosphorus (P); cations (K, Ca, Mg); N + P; N + cations; P + cations; N + P + cations.
- Plot size and spacing: each plot 50 × 50 meters, with a minimum of 50 meters between plots.
- Fertilization regime: annually applied in three applications to reduce nutrient leaching and runoff.
  - N: 125 kg N ha^-1 yr^-1 (urea)
  - P: 50 kg P ha^-1 yr^-1 (triple superphosphate)
  - K: 50 kg K ha^-1 yr^-1 (KCl)
  - Ca: 160 kg Ca ha^-1 yr^-1 (dolomitic limestone)
  - Mg: 160 kg Mg ha^-1 yr^-1 (dolomitic limestone)

## AFEX 2.0: Plot delineation
- AFEX 2.0 includes delineation of all fertilized blocks and plots within the KM41 reserve (referenced in accompanying figures).

## Data collection methods
- LAI measurements: 36 sampling points per plot collected using the LAI-2200 C instrument.
- Sampling schedule: 6:00–17:00 (avoiding 12:00–14:00) to minimize solar interference; readings taken with the sensor above canopy as reference.
- Instrument setup: sensors oriented west in the morning and east in the afternoon; 45° view cap to minimize operator visibility; sensors matched/calibrated prior to data collection.
- Data processing: leaf area index (LAI) calculated using FV2200 software with 5-, 4-, and 3-ring configurations.
- Sampling timeline: October 2017, March 2018, August 2018, and October 2018.
- Location context: Central Amazon (Amazonas, Manaus region).

## Data spreadsheet and metadata
- Data are organized in a spreadsheet (Figure 4) with the following columns:
  - A: CENSO (Plot sampling number)
  - B: PlotID (block and plot code)
  - C: B_Obs (the 36 sampling points)
  - D: Time (sampling time)
  - E: LAI_5_rings (LAI with 5 rings)
  - F: Time (sampling time)
  - G: LAI_4_rings (LAI with 4 rings)
  - H: Time (sampling time)
  - I: LAI_3_rings (LAI with 3 rings)
  - J: Date (campaign date, year_month)
  - K: coord x (horizontal plot position: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 m)
  - L: coord y (vertical plot position: 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 m)
- The leaf area index data are deposited in the EIDC system (reference to Figure 4).
