# Plant community surveys and sampling design

- Objective and scope
  - Describe distribution and abundance of plant species on Jebel, Tunisia.
  - 78 quadrats sampled across widely dispersed sites to capture all community types described by Fay (1980).
  - Sampling occurred from 18 June to 7 August 1983.

- Sampling design and data collection
  - Nested quadrat design with sizes: 2 × 2 m, 5 × 5 m, 7.07 × 7.07 m, 10 × 10 m, and 14 × 14 m.
  - At each site, a 2 × 2 m quadrat was used for herbaceous cover-abundance; the 10 × 10 m quadrat for woody cover-abundance.
  - Central stake located by random throw within each site.
  - Abundances estimated using a modified Braun-Blanquet scale; remaining quadrats recorded presence-absence.
  - On average, three nested quadrats were surveyed per site over 8–10 hours per day.

- Species identification and taxonomy
  - Collected and pressed specimens identified in the field or later; verifications conducted against Tunis herbarium and British Museum herbarium.
  - Acknowledges potential under-recording for late-season flowering taxa (e.g., Liliaceae, Orchidaceae) and some species-lookalike confusions.
  - Taxonomy updated to current standards using Euro-Med PlantBase (PlantBase 2017) and Medchecklist (2012); final taxonomy aligned with Le Floc'h et al. (2010) and Daoud-Bouattour et al. (2007).

- Functional grouping and species synthesis
  - Separate analyses for woody and herbaceous communities due to different spatial scales.
  - Species classified into functional/taxonomic groups with predicted differential grazing responses: Poaceae, Legumes, Geophytes, Forbs, shrub legumes, and shrubs/trees.
  - Forbs category includes ferns, cacti, club mosses, and some mosses; annual vs. perennial not distinguished.

- Grazing intensity and herbivore activity
  - Grazing intensity at each 10 × 10 m quadrat level, focusing on woody species as a proxy for overall grazing impact (assumes woody browse reflects herbaceous grazing as well).
  - Four grazing levels: unbrowsed; lightly browsed; moderate to heavy browsing; severely clipped.
  - Qualitative signs of herbivore activity recorded (hair on trunks, droppings, feeding signs) but not quantified.
  - Distribution: 71% unbrowsed, 12.8% lightly browsed, 16.7% moderate to heavily browsed; heavily browsed sites commonly at low altitude with rock outcrops and smaller olive trees.

- Abiotic environmental measurements
  - Center of each quadrat: altitude (barometric altimeter), slope (inclinometer), aspect (compass), and percent rock outcrop/rock cover.
  - Rationale: disentangle grazing effects from environmental covariates shaping plant turnover.

- Olea europaea as a proxy for anthropogenic activity
  - Counts of Olea europaea stems (>4 cm dbh, measured at ~1.5 m and at 30 cm above ground) within 10 × 10 m quadrats (69 sites; 9 not measured).
  - Density calculated across circumference size classes (0–5 cm, 6–10 cm, 11–15 cm, 16–20 cm, >20 cm).
  - Equal-area transformation used to aggregate stems into a single comparable surface area; stems with bifurcations accounted for by equivalent radius calculations.
  - Rationale: woody vegetation shading and signs of anthropogenic activities (grazing, woodcutting) influence herbaceous composition.

- Data structure and availability
  - Data resource comprises three CSV files:
    - woody_comm.csv: counts of woody plants per site.
    - herb_comm.csv: counts of herbaceous plants per site.
    - spatial_env.csv: abiotic environmental variables per site.
  - Column headings documented in the supplementary file Metadata_for_Tunisia plants.rtf.

- Data quality, reuse notes, and permissions
  - Acknowledges potential limitations in data quality (non-random site selection, patchy data formats, late-season identifications).
  - Authors may seek contact before repurposing the data for additional research.
  - Historical data sources and context provided, with references to methodological benchmarks (e.g., Bunce 1982; Fay 1980; Tomaselli 1977; and related ecological studies).

- Related references and methodological context
  - Key works informing sampling design, grazing assessment, and environmental drivers in Mediterranean systems are cited, including studies on grazing effects, vegetation responses, and environmental gradients.
