# Metadata for Woody species

- Provides coded identifiers for woody plant taxa, mapping each code to a scientific name and a functional group/life form where available.
- Example mappings include ANAGFOET (Anagyris foetida L.), CALIVILL (Calicotome villosa), CERASILI (Ceratonia siliqua L.), PISTLENT ( Pistacia lentiscus L.), PISTTERE ( Pistacia terebinthus L.), RUBIPERE (Rubia peregrina L.), and many others.
- Functional group/life form fields are present but many entries are blank or not differentiated; some taxa specify Legume as the life form.
- Notes indicate that subspecies or finer taxonomic differentiation are not always provided (e.g., “(3 subspecies - not differentiated)”).
- The data appear to function as a reference codebook to support data integration, querying, and downstream analyses of woody vegetation.

# Metadata for herbaceous species

- Provides coded identifiers for herbaceous taxa, mapping each code to a scientific name and a functional trait/growth form.
- Example mappings include AGROPOUR (Agrostis pourretii Willd.) with Graminoid, ALLICOMM (Allium cf. commutatum) with Geophyte/forb, ANTHTETR (Anthyllis tetraphylla L.) with Legume, and many others.
- Functional trait/growth form categories cover Graminoid, Forb, Legume, Geophyte/Forb, and various unspecified or blank fields.
- Many entries list “Forb” or “Geophyte/Forb” as growth forms; some entries have blank functional trait fields.
- The herbaceous section provides extensive codified metadata to support data merging, filtering, and analysis of non-woody vegetation components.

# Metadata for spatial and environmental data

- LATITUDE and LONGITUDE: geographic coordinates in decimal degrees.
- ALTITUDE: elevation in metres.
- SLOPE: slope in degrees.
- Aspect: compass-based directional aspect.
- ROCKCROP: percentage of rock outcropping in the site.
- SOILPH: soil pH measured at 50 sites.
- Grazing index: a ranked category describing grazing pressure with four levels:
  - 1) unbrowsed
  - 2) lightly browsed
  - 3) moderate to heavy browsing
  - 4) severely clipped to short stunted bushes
- OLIVDIAA to OLIVBREE: olive tree diameter classes at two height references:
  - 30 cm height
  - breast height
- MEAN30 and MEANDBH: mean number of olive trees at the two height references.
- FREQ30 and FREQDBH: frequency of olive trees at the two height references.
- These fields enable spatial analyses and environmental associations for olive-dominated landscapes and broader vegetation assessments.
