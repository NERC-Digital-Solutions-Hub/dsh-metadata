# Plant community surveys and sampling design

- Objective and scope
  - Describe plant species distribution and abundance on the Jebel in Tunisia.
  - Assess potential grazing effects and link plant composition to abiotic environmental covariates.
  - Provide data to inform management decisions within the National Park context and for future monitoring.

- Sampling design and field methods
  - 78 quadrats distributed across the Jebel, stratified using Fay (1980) vegetation maps.
  - Nested quadrat design with scales: 2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, 7.07 x 7.07 m, 10 x 10 m, 14 x 14 m.
  - At each site, quadrat centers placed by random throw; most vegetated areas sampled except inaccessible places.
  - Within the 2 x 2 m and 10 x 10 m quadrats, estimated cover-abundance for herbaceous and woody species using a modified Braun-Blanquet scale; other quadrats recorded presence-absence.
  - On average, three sites (nested quadrats) surveyed per day, totaling 8–10 hours of fieldwork.

- Species identification and taxonomy
  - Plants collected in the field and, if needed, pressed for herbarium verification (Tunis or British Museum).
  - Timing likely under-recorded some taxa (e.g., Liliaceae, Orchidaceae) due to late flowering period.
  - Taxonomic names updated to Euro-Med PlantBase / Medchecklist; final taxonomy aligned with Tunisian flora references.
  - Some species pairs grouped when species-level distinction was not possible in the field.

- Functional grouping and analysis
  - Separate analyses for woody and herbaceous communities.
  - Species categorized into functional groups predictive of grazing responses: Poaceae, Legumes, Geophytes, Forbs, shrub legumes, and shrubs/trees.
  - Forbs include ferns, cacti, club mosses, and some unidentified mosses.

- Grazing intensity assessment
  - At each 10 x 10 m quadrat center, rank woody-browse intensity on principal woody species.
  - Assumed woody browse reflects overall grazing intensity on both woody and herbaceous species; herbaceous grazing not quantified.
  - Four-level grazing categories: unbrowsed, lightly browsed, moderately to heavily browsed, and severely clipped.
  - Signs of herbivores recorded qualitatively (hair, droppings, feeding signs) but not quantified.
  - Distribution across 78 sites: 71% unbrowsed, 12.8% lightly browsed, 16.7% moderately to heavily browsed; heavily grazed sites tended to be low-altitude with rocky outcrops and smaller olive trees.

- Abiotic environmental variables
  - Altitude measured with a barometric altimeter.
  - Slope measured with an inclinometer; aspect recorded as a proxy for solar insolation.
  - Rock outcropping/rock cover quantified to capture parent material effects on shrub communities.

- Olea europaea as a proxy for anthropogenic activity
  - Olea stems >4 cm dbh counted in the 10 x 10 m quadrat at breast height (~1.5 m) and at 30 cm above ground.
  - Densities calculated across circumference classes (0–5 cm, 6–10 cm, 11–15 cm, 16–20 cm, >20 cm).
  - For bifurcated trees, stems combined to provide a single equivalent radius.
  - Rationale: woody vegetation shading and Olea density as an indicator of anthropogenic pressure (grazing, woodcutting).

- Data structure and availability
  - Data resource comprises three CSV files:
    - woody_comm.csv: counts of woody plants per site.
    - herb_comm.csv: counts of herbaceous plants per site.
    - spatial_env.csv: environmental variables per site.
  - Column definitions provided in the supplementary metadata document (Metadata_for_Tunisia plants.rtf).

- Data quality, limitations, and governance
  - Taxonomic updates and cross-checks with plant ecologists; some identifications uncertain due to phenology and morphological similarity.
  - First 9 sites lacked Olea measurements.
  - Non-random site selection and single-season sampling may limit generalizability to other times or areas.
  - Data sharing and reuse: authors indicate a preference for being contacted before reuse of the data.
  - Data cleanliness and documentation are addressed through explicit metadata and data files to support reproducibility.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy
  - Demonstrates integration of biotic (woody and herbaceous communities) and abiotic drivers (altitude, slope, aspect, rock cover) in a single monitoring design.
  - Uses functional groups and a proxy for anthropogenic impact (Olea density) to interpret grazing effects.
  - Provides structured, multi-scale data suitable for longitudinal monitoring and policy evaluation, with explicit data governance considerations and metadata support.
