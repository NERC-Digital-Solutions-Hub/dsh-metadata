# Metadata for Woody species

## Overview
- A comprehensive metadata dictionary linking coded species identifiers to scientific names and functional group/life form for woody and herbaceous plants.
- Also includes a separate section detailing spatial and environmental variables used in site-level vegetation monitoring.
- Intended to support standardized data collection, quality assurance, transformation, and integration into monitoring portals.

## Metadata for Woody species
- Provides coded identifiers (e.g., ANAGFOET, ANAGSSPS, ARBUUNED, etc.) mapped to scientific names (primarily woody legumes and associated taxa).
- Each entry includes a scientific name (e.g., Anagyris foetida L., Arbutus unedo L., Calicotome villosa, Ceratonia siliqua, etc.).
- Includes functional group/life form data where available (e.g., Legume for several taxa). Some entries list a functional group/form as blank.
- The list covers a wide range of genera typical of Mediterranean or similar ecosystems (e.g., Anagyris, Arbutus, Ceratonia, Cistus, Olea, Pistacia, Rosa, Juniperus, Myrtus, Lavandula-related groups, etc.), with many entries identified as legumes.

## Metadata for Herbaceous species
- Provides coded identifiers (e.g., AGROPOUR, AIRACUPA, ALLICOMM, ANAGARVE, etc.) linked to scientific names.
- Each entry includes a functional trait/growth form (e.g., Graminoid, Forb, Geophyte/forb, Legume) or blank when not specified.
- Encompasses a diverse set of herbaceous plants including grasses, forbs, sedges, geophytes, and numerous genera (e.g., Agrostis, Aira, Allium, Anthyllis, Linum, Trifolium, Veronica, Satureja, etc.).
- Several entries identify specific growth forms (e.g., Graminoid, Forb, Geophyte/Forb, Legume), while some entries provide no trait.

## Metadata for spatial and environmental data
- LATITUDE: Latitude in decimal degrees.
- LONGITUDE: Longitude in decimal degrees.
- ALTITUDE: Altitude in metres.
- SLOPE: Slope in degrees.
- Aspect: Aspect in compass degrees.
- ROCKCROP: Percentage of rock outcropping.
- SOILPH: Soil pH for 50 sites.
- Grazing index: Ranked grazing intensity with four levels, defined as:
  - 1) unbrowsed (dense forests, gaps, or high-altitude arborescent matorral)
  - 2) lightly browsed (dense mid/low matorral; some browsing on shrubs)
  - 3) moderate to heavy browsing (shrubs clipped to hedge-like shapes or stunted)
  - 4) severely clipped to short stunted bushes
- OLIVDIAA to OLIVBREE: Olive diameter measurements at two height levels (30 cm height and breast height) across several size classes (0–5 cm, 6–10 cm, 11–15 cm, 16–20 cm, >20 cm).
- MEAN30 / MEANDBH: Mean number of olive trees at 30 cm height and at breast height, respectively.
- FREQ30 / FREQDBH: Frequency of olive trees at 30 cm height and at breast height, respectively.

## Notes on use
- The metadata provide the essential codes-to-name and trait mappings needed for consistent data entry, validation, and cross-site analyses.
- The spatial and environmental variables enable integration of vegetation data with site conditions and management factors (e.g., grazing impact, olive tree metrics) for monitoring environmental health and policy outcomes over time.
