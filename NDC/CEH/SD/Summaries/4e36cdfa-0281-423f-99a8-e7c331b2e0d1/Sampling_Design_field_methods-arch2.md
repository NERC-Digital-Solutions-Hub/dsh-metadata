# Plant community surveys and sampling design

## Overview
- Study conducted 18 June – 7 August 1983 on Jebel; 78 quadrats sampled across vegetated areas (excluding inaccessible crags/cliffs).
- Stratified using Fay (1980) vegetation maps; sites widely dispersed to cover all community types.
- Quadrats arranged using a nested design: 2 x 2 m, 5 x 5 m, 7.07 x 7.07 m, 10 x 10 m, and 14 x 14 m.
- At each site, central stake located by randomly throwing the quadrat; data captured as cover-abundance or presence-absence depending on quadrat.

## Sampling design
- Herbaceous abundance estimated in the 2 x 2 m quadrat; woody abundance in the 10 x 10 m quadrat.
- Three nested sites sampled per location on average, with 8–10 hours of fieldwork per day.
- Data structured to differentiate woody vs. herbaceous communities due to their differential responses to grazing.

## Species identification and taxonomy
- Collected and pressed unidentified plants; specimens compared with Tunisian herbarium and British Museum.
- Late-season sampling likely led to under-recording of Liliaceae and Orchidaceae; some species pairs could not be distinguished and were combined.
- Plant names updated to Euro-Med PlantBase (2017) or Medchecklist (2012); final taxonomy aligned with Tunisia flora references (Le Floc'h et al. 2010; Daoud-Bouattour et al. 2007).

## Identifying plant species and development of functional groups
- Separate analyses for woody and herbaceous groups; classified into functional/taxonomic groups predicted to respond differently to grazing: Poaceae, Legumes, Geophytes, Forbs, shrub legumes, and shrubs/trees (similar to Fernández-Lugo et al. 2013).
- Forbs group includes ferns, cacti, club mosses, and some mosses; annual vs. perennial not differentiated due to single-season study.

## Assessing grazing intensity
- Grazing assessed at each 10 x 10 m quadrat by ranking browsing on principal woody species.
- Assumed woody-browsing intensity reflects overall grazing pressure on both woody and herbaceous species ( goats likely primary browsers).
- Four grazing levels defined: 1) unbrowsed, 2) lightly browsed, 3) moderate to heavy browsing, 4) severely clipped.
- Qualitative signs of herbivores (hair, droppings, feeding signs) recorded but not quantified.
- Distribution: 71% unbrowsed, 12.8% lightly browsed, 16.7% moderately to heavily browsed; heavily browsed sites typically at low altitude with more rock and smaller olive trees.

## Measuring abiotic environmental variables
- Variables measured at the center of each quadrat to separate grazing effects from environment.
- Altitude recorded with barometric altimeter; slope measured with inclinometer; aspect recorded as proxy for solar insolation.
- Percentage of rock outcropping/rock cover documented at quadrats.

## Olea europaea as a proxy for anthropogenic activity
- Olea europaea stems (>4 cm dbh) measured at about 1.5 m height, and at 30 cm above ground for 69 sites (not collected for the first 9 sites).
- Stem diameters classified into size classes; densities calculated across circumference classes (0–5 cm, 6–10 cm, 11–15 cm, 16–20 cm, >20 cm).
- When trees bifurcated, all stems measured; total surface area computed to yield an equivalent stem radius for comparison.

## Data structure and availability
- Data resources consist of three CSV files:
  - woody_comm.csv – counts of woody plants at each site.
  - herb_comm.csv – counts of herbaceous plants at each site.
  - spatial_env.csv – environmental variables at each site.
- Column headings described in the supplementary metadata document: Metadata_for_Tunisia_plants.rtf.
- Note: 69 sites had Olea density data; data for the first 9 sites were not collected.

## Miscellaneous and data use
- Authors suggest potential future use of these data for additional papers and request prior contact before reuse.
