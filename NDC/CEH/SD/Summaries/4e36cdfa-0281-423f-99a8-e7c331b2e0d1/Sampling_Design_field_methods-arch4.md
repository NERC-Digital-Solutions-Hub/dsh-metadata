# Plant community surveys and sampling design

- Study scope and sampling framework
  - Conducted all sampling from 18 June to 7 August 1983 on Jebel.
  - Located 78 quadrats, stratified using Fay (1980) vegetation maps to capture all community types.
  - Quadrats: nested design with sizes 2x2 m, 5x5 m, 7.07x7.07 m, 10x10 m, and 14x14 m; central stake located by random throw within sites.
  - Sampling cadence: on average three sites (nested quadrats) surveyed per day, 8–10 hours per day.

- Data collection and measurements
  - Abundance estimation:
    - Herbaceous species in 2x2 m quadrats; woody species in 10x10 m quadrats.
    - Use a modified Braun-Blanquet scale (<1%, 1–5%, 6–10%, 11–25%, 26–50%, 51–75%, >75%).
  - Presence-absence data:
    - Recorded for all other quadrats (outside 2x2 and 10x10 m).
  - Separate analyses for woody and herbaceous communities due to different spatial scales.

- Taxonomy and species identification
  - Field collection of unidentified plants; verification against herbarium specimens (Tunis, British Museum).
  - Acknowledges potential under-recording due to late flowering (e.g., Liliaceae, Orchidaceae) and some difficult identifications.
  - Species name updates:
    - Updated nomenclature via Euro-Med PlantBase (PlantBase 2017) or Medchecklist (2012).
    - Final taxonomy aligned with Le Floc'h et al. (2010) and a Tunisia national park flora (Daoud-Bouattour et al. 2007).

- Functional groups and classification
  - Plants categorized into taxonomic and functional groups expected to respond differently to grazing:
    - Poaceae, Legumes, Geophytes, Forbs (annual and perennial), shrub legumes, shrubs/trees.
  - Forbs category includes ferns, cacti, club mosses, and some unidentified mosses.
  - Annual vs. perennial not differentiated due to single-season study.

- Grazing intensity assessment
  - Browsing intensity at each 10x10 m quadrat center:
    - Four levels: unbrowsed; lightly browsed; moderate to heavy browsing; severely clipped.
  - Qualitative signs of herbivores recorded (e.g., hair, droppings, feeding signs) but not quantified.
  - Distribution: 71% unbrowsed, 12.8% lightly browsed, 16.7% moderately to heavily browsed.
  - Heavily browsed sites tended to be at lower altitude with more rock outcropping and smaller-diameter olive trees.
  - Assessed largely through woody plant browsing as a proxy for overall grazing intensity, given difficulty quantifying herbaceous grazing.

- Abiotic environmental variables
  - Center of each 10x10 m quadrat:
    - Altitude measured with a barometric altimeter.
    - Slope measured with inclinometer; aspect recorded to proxy solar insolation.
    - Percentage of rock outcropping/rock cover around the quadrat.

- Olea europaea as proxy for anthropogenic activity
  - Olea stems (>4 cm dbh) measured at ~1.5 m and at 30 cm above ground for 69 sites.
  - Densities calculated across circumference size classes (0–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, >20 cm) and converted to an equivalent stem surface area using an equivalent radius approach.
  - Rationale: woody vegetation shading effects and as a surrogate indicator of anthropogenic activity (e.g., grazing and woodcutting).

- Data structure and accessibility
  - Data organized into three flat CSV files:
    - woody_comm.csv: counts of woody plants at each site.
    - herb_comm.csv: counts of herbaceous plants at each site.
    - spatial_env.csv: environmental variables at each site.
  - Column headings and data structure documented in the supplementary file Metadata_for_Tunisia plants.rtf.

- Miscellaneous and usage notes
  - Acknowledges potential future use of the data for additional studies; authors prefer being contacted before data reuse.
  - References list provides supporting sources for sampling design, grazing effects, and regional flora.

- Key limitations and considerations for data use
  - Non-random site selection (though widely dispersed) and potential under-recording due to seasonal timing.
  - Taxonomic updates may have changed species names since data collection.
  - Grazing intensity is inferred primarily from woody plant browsing; herbaceous grazing not quantified.
