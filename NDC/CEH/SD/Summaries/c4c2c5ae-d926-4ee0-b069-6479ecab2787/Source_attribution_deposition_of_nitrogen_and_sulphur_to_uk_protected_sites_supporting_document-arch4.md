# Frame Modelling

## Overview
- FRAME (Fine Resolution Multi-pollutant Exchange) is a 5 km grid, Lagrangian atmospheric transport model for estimating annual mean deposition of reduced and oxidised nitrogen and sulphur over the UK and its islands (172 x 144 grid).
- Emissions inputs come from UK NAEI (160 sub-sectors, including 22 point sources) and NARSES for ammonia, with regional masks by England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland for regulators.

## Data Inputs and Source Attribution
- Emissions data
  - Sulphur and nitrogen from NAEI, split into 160 sub-sectors; includes 22 major point sources (power stations, refineries, steel works, etc.) and background area emissions (11 SNAP sectors).
  - Ammonia from NARSES, divided into 5 sectors (livestock, fertiliser, non-agricultural sources, etc.).
- Geographic and sectoral segmentation
  - Regional land masks separate sources by country.
  - Sources categorized by point, offshore, international shipping, and European imports.
- Outputs per source
  - For each source, a separate FRAME run is generated by abating that source by 25% to reduce non-linear reaction effects; a baseline run uses all sources.
  - Footprints are calculated as the difference between the baseline deposition and the deposition with a given source abated.
  - Footprints are computed for each 5 km grid cell for SOx, NOy, and NHx; further split into short/long-range components and by ecosystem type (forest, moorland, grid average).

## Running the Model and Footprint Calculation
- Approach
  - Base scenario (all sources) run → abate each source individually by 25% (to handle non-linearities) → final footprints scaled by a factor of 4.
  - Footprint for id = n: FP(id=n) = DEP(id=0) − DEP(id=n).
- Output detail
  - Deposition data are decomposed into multiple species and categories (e.g., dry/wet deposition, NH3/NH4+, NOx, SO2/SO4) and by short/long-range contributions.
  - Outputs include three ecosystem types: forest, moorland, grid average (to reflect surface roughness effects on deposition).

## Calibration and Quality Assurance
- Calibration to CBED (Concentration Based Estimated Deposition, APIS 2015)
  - Calibration aligns FRAME deposition with CBED estimates (2011–2013 average) via proportional scaling factors.
  - Equations provided to calibrate both baseline and footprints so that sums match official CBED totals (2012).
- Quality control
  - Normalisation of footprints so their sum matches the baseline deposition to mitigate model non-linearities.
  - National budgets are checked against previous years for consistency.
  - Each footprint output is also produced as a JPG for quick error detection.

## Spatial Mapping to Protected Sites
- Site-level mapping workflow
  - FRAME produces 160 footprint files per pollutant/source type; these are aggregated to 90 footprint files to ease processing.
  - Python scripts merge footprints with a UK protected site shapefile (SAC, SPA, SSSI) to extract data for sites.
  - For each site and pollutant/footprint type, compute:
    - Minimum, maximum, and grid-average deposition values.
    - Distinctions made for forest, moorland, and grid-average into three output datasets.
- Output detail
  - Results are provided as three separate files (forest, moorland, grid average) with per-site metrics for all 90 footprint types.

## Data Products and Units
- Primary units
  - All deposition values are in kilo-equivalents per hectare per year (keq ha−1 year−1).
  - Conversion to kg S ha−1 year−1 or kg N ha−1 year−1 via multiplication (S: ×16; N: ×14). Total N is the sum of NO2/NO3 and NH3/NH4+.
- Datasets 1–3
  - Three-year mean (2013–2015) source attribution and deposition data at 5 x 5 km resolution.
  - For each site (SAC/SPAs/SSSIs) and ecosystem type (moorland, forest/woodland, grid average), provide:
    - Minimum, maximum, and area-weighted average values.
  - File naming example: APIS_source_attribution_nitrogen_sulphur_to_forest_bysite.csv (and two additional bysite files for moorland and grid average).

## Data Structure and Schema
- Datasets cover:
  - SITECODE, SITENAME, grid coordinates (X, Y), site area, designation, footprint IDs and names, area type (point/area), source location.
  - Deposition metrics per footprint type (local short-range, long-range, and grid-wide) for multiple chemical species and ranges (e.g., SOD, SOW, NOD, NOW, NHD, NHW) with local/long-range separation.
- Multiple CSVs
  - Forest/bysite, Moorland/bysite, Gridaverage/bysite data structures with similar field sets for various deposition components.

## Key Considerations for Data Leaders
- Data scope and lifecycle
  - Framework models complex multi-pollutant deposition with yearly calibration and site-level aggregation, enabling policy-relevant attribution.
- Data quality and provenance
  - Clear calibration to CBED and normalisation steps to ensure consistency and traceability of footprints.
  - Outputs include both detailed footprint files and aggregated site-level summaries for decision-makers.
- Data discoverability and reuse
  - Outputs are organized by ecosystem type and site, with explicit metadata on sites and footprints, facilitating integration with regulatory reporting and stakeholder analyses.
- Data access and governance
  - Large, multi-file outputs require robust data management, versioning, and documentation to maintain transparency for regulators and partner networks.
