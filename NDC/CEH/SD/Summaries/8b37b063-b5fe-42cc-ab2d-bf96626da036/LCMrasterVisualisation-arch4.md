# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- The Land cover map rasters for 2017-2020 are multiband rasters with:
  - 20m and 10m data: two bands (Band 1 = UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier; Band 2 = classification confidence)
  - 25m data: three bands (Band 1 = dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier; Bands 2–3 = classification confidence indicators)
- This document is a short guide for visualising the Band 1 Land Cover Class data in common GIS applications; refer to the product documentation for a full data description.

- Purpose: to visualise the Land Cover Class data consistently across GIS tools by using predefined color styles.

- Color styles: the document provides style files for each application (e.g., LCMcolours_QGIS.qml, LCMcolours.lyr) to ensure correct classification colors.
