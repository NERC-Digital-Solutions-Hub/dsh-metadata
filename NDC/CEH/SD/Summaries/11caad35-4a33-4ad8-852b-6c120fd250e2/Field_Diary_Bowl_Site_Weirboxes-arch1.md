# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl.

## Overview
- Purpose: Document data collection and observations from the two weir boxes measuring Drain flow and Overland Flow (OLF) in the bowl.
- Installation date: 11/04/06.
- Main focus: Logging water heights above the V-notch, calibration of sensors, data quality, and maintenance events affecting measurements.

## Data collection and equipment
- Weir boxes: Drain flow and Overland Flow (OLF) flow measurements via V-notch height references.
- Sensors: Pressure transducers (PTs) and loggers; occasional reboots and battery changes.
- Turbidity sensors added to bowl outflows on 28/11/06.
- Periodic calibrations and height checks performed; two V-notch height baselines recorded for zero flow at times.
- Data recorded as height above V-notch (mm) with adjustments when necessary; occasional notes on measurement methods (two methods used to cross-check depths).

## Key events and maintenance
- 2006–2009: Numerous maintenance actions including battery changes, logger restarts, and data downloads.
- 31/10/08–04/06/09: Multiple calibration efforts due to data anomalies and frozen conditions; some portions of data deemed unreliable due to calibration or equipment issues.
- 12/06/08–16/06/08: PTs reinstalled; calibration checks following potential shifts from freezing conditions.
- 04/06/09: New zero offset calibration established by filling boxes to the base of the V-notch; OLF zero offset = 287.3 mm, Drain zero offset = 271.2 mm. Note that drain inflow pipe was not properly reinstalled during this period, making data from this interval not suitable for use.
- 04/06/09 onward: Ongoing notes about data quality and need for rechecks due to prior issues; some data periods still considered unreliable.

## Data quality issues and corrections
- Frequent data jumps in PT values observed (e.g., on 01/11/06, 14/11/06); corrections applied in analysis (e.g., offsets of -8.85 mm for OLF and -9.76 mm for Drain).
- Missing or incomplete data: data gaps due to dodgy logger or battery; notable losses 25/11–05/12 and 16/12–27/12; occasional periods with data not suitable for use due to calibration problems.
- Zero-flow calibrations and offsets updated multiple times; final recommended zero offsets documented after 04/06/09.
- Potential drift and shifts caused by freezing, blockages, and sensor movement; recalibration needed following such events.
- Some periods required estimation of flow rather than direct measurement, especially when data were compromised by equipment issues or limited rainfall context.

## Environmental and operational challenges
- Freezing conditions and snow: blockages in stilling wells, need for wooden lids and later cleaning/calibration.
- Biological/interference issues: voles and other debris damaging OLF traps; dead animals found in drainage boxes; sediment buildup and “black gunk” requiring cleaning.
- Hydrological disturbances: evaporation effects, diurnal fluctuations linked to temperature, and periods with zero or very low flow complicating baseline determinations.
- Maintenance impacts: data during periods of repair or reinstallation (e.g., incorrect zero offsets applied during some intervals) considered unreliable for flow calculations.

## Observations and interpretation notes
- Height measurements above V-notch used to estimate flow; multiple calibration approaches attempted to ensure accuracy.
- Some periods required explicit estimation of flow due to incomplete or compromised data (e.g., periods with no tips in the tipping buckets, or when the drain inflow pipe was not properly reinstalled).
- Important baselines:
  - Zero-offset calibrations established on 04/06/09: OLF 287.3 mm, DRAIN 271.2 mm (drain pipe reinstallation issue noted during this period).
  - Earlier 0-flow reference: 283.9 mm (OLF) and 227.6 mm (DRAIN) at a point when zero-flow calibration was being performed during bucket calibration.
- Data usability varies by period; some datasets are preserved and usable with corrections, while others are flagged as not suitable for use.

## Summary of usability and recommendations
- Use final zero-offset calibrations (04/06/09 onward) as primary reference, with caution for intervals where the drain inflow pipe was not properly reinstalled.
- Apply documented PT offset corrections for known jumps where reanalysis was performed.
- Treat periods affected by freezing, debris, or logger issues as higher-uncertainty data; validate with cross-checks or supplementary rainfall data where possible.
- When aggregating data across the full period, clearly segment by maintenance/calibration phases to avoid mixing offset states and to reflect varying data reliability.
