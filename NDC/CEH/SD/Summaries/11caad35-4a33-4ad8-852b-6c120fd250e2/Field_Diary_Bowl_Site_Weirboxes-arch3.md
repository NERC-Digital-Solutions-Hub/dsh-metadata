# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl.

## Purpose and scope
- Documentation of the weir boxes measuring drain flow and overland flow (OLF) in the bowl, installed on 11/04/06.
- Records monitoring activities, calibration notes, maintenance, data issues, and interpretation guidance for the collected flow data.

## Equipment and measurement method
- Two weir boxes: Drain flow and Overland Flow (OLF) flow measurements using a V-notch crest.
- Height above the V-notch is used to estimate flow; measurements logged for both drain and OLF.
- Data collection setup included pressure transducers (PTs), loggers, and tipping buckets; sampling details noted (logger restart, recording intervals).
- Turbidity sensors were added to the OLF outflows on 28/11/06.
- Box dimensions and cross-sectional areas recorded (e.g., drain and OLF side lengths and calculated areas around 0.40 m^2 each), affecting height-to-flow conversions.
- Periodic physical adjustments and maintenance documented (battery changes, recalibration, cleaning, and calibration tests).

## Data collection and quality control
- Regular data downloads and checks for anomalies; adjustments documented when sensor values jumped or appeared erroneous.
- Calibration and zero-flow determination practiced by introducing controlled water levels to define baseline offsets (0 flow level).
- Offsets and height references updated repeatedly (e.g., 0 flow baselines determined at specific heights, such as OLF 287.3 mm and DRAIN 271.2 mm on 04/06/09).
- Data corrections performed in analysis spreadsheets when PT readings jumped abnormally; noted as necessary adjustments in the Excel analysis file.
- Notable data gaps and reliability issues:
  - Several periods with no data or unreliable data due to logger problems, battery voltage, or downloader issues (e.g., data lost 25/11–05/12 and 16/12–27/12; general logger reliability concerns).
  - Instances when the logger could not handle battery swaps or when the logger was out of water during calibration.
  - Specific periods when the drain inflow pipe was not properly reinstalled, making data unsuitable for use (e.g., around 20/02/09 to 22/04/09).
- Operational actions to address data quality:
  - Recalibration after cleaning or adjustment events.
  - Replacement or reinstallation of PT sensors; recalibration of 0-flow offsets after events (including 04/06/09).
  - Calibration procedures to ensure height references correspond to zero flow or baseline conditions.

## Environmental and maintenance challenges
- Environment-induced data issues:
  - Freezing conditions and snow leading to blocks/ice in stilling wells and pipes; measures taken to mitigate (e.g., wooden lids, opening lids to prevent ice buildup).
  - Sediment buildup, black gunk, and animal interference (voles, dead worms) affecting weirboxes and measurement accuracy.
  - Evaporation effects causing drop in water height above the V-notch; diurnal temperature effects on PT readings.
- Physical modifications and repairs:
  - Cleaning of weir boxes, repairing or adjusting traps, blocking and clearing gutters, and replacing damaged components.
  - Repositioning or recalibrating PT sensors due to shifts from freezing and sediment movement.

## Key events and milestones (highlights)
- 11/04/06: Weir boxes installed.
- 28/11/06: Turbidity sensors installed on OLF and drain outflows.
- 04/06/09: New zero offset calibration conducted; offsets established (OLF 287.3 mm, DRAIN 271.2 mm).
- 20/02/09 – 22/04/09: Drain inflow pipe not properly reinstalled; data during this period deemed not suitable.
- 12/06/08 and 04/06/09: Cleaning and recalibration activities; addressing shifts in PT readings due to freezing.
- 13/11/09: Logger reconnected after a period of not being connected to the battery.

## Data interpretation and governance implications
- The dataset requires careful, ongoing calibration and offset maintenance to ensure comparability across time, especially after environmental disturbances or equipment changes.
- Metadata completeness and consistency are critical to interpret flow estimates accurately (e.g., base 0-flow references, V-notch geometry, and PT offset values).
- Transparent documentation of data corrections (what was changed and why) is essential for reproducibility and trust in the monitoring framework.
- Recognizes recurring barriers to data quality in environmental monitoring, such as data gaps, sensor fouling, and environmental conditions, highlighting the need for robust data governance and contingency procedures.
