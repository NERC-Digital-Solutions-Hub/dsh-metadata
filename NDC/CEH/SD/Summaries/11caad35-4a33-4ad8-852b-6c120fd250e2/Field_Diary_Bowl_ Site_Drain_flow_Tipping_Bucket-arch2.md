# Drain flow data log and calibration notes (2005-2009)

- Purpose and scope
  - Chronological record of drain flow measurements using tipping buckets (TB) and weir boxes, including calibration, maintenance, and data quality notes.
  - Reflects adjustments to data logging intervals, equipment status, and calibration procedures to maintain usable flow records.

- Data collection and equipment
  - Monitoring setup included a weir box, tipping buckets, and a transducer/logger (TinyTag). Reed switch and magnet components used to register TB tips.
  - Data logging interval changed from 10 minutes to 5 minutes to align with the overland flow trap; interval adjustments occurred multiple times (including 03/10/06).
  - Occasional data gaps and anomalies due to hardware issues (bucket misalignment, bucket dislodgement, battery failures, transducer water ingress, ice formation) and calibration activities.

- Data quality assurance and processing
  - Calibration events driven by observed anomalies or maintenance (e.g., 07/06/07 calibration with 30 L through TB to yield 11 tips; later calibration adjustments).
  - Tip volume and TB calibration evolving over time:
    - Initial calibration: 30 L = 11 tips, ~2.91 L per tip.
    - 14/11/08 calibration update: 30.66 L = 11 tips, ~2.79 L per tip; subsequent linear incremental change applied after ~6 months.
  - Data flags and exclusions:
    - Periods marked as ignore or unreliable (e.g., 21/04/06 transducer issues, 25/02/09 zero flow determination, calibration water diversion periods).
    - Time stamp discrepancies addressed (GMT/BST transitions, 04/09/2009 note on potential timestamp issue).
    - Data during calibration or known disturbances routinely excluded or flagged as not representative.

- Maintenance, troubleshooting, and events
  - Routine maintenance and hardware fixes:
    - Weir boxes restarted due to battery failure; TBs reseated or reinstalled after leaks or mechanical issues.
    - Replacements and repairs: TB magnet reattached (15/08/07), TB dislodgement and axle reattachment (30/07/09).
    - Cleaning and reconditioning: removal of gunk/algae from TB, sediment removal from weir boxes.
  - Notable operational events:
    - Periods of rapid drain inflow challenging TB capacity (e.g., 25/10/06: drain flow too fast for TB).
    - Occasional periods of no flow or bucket freezing (30/08/07; 19/02/08).
    - Water diversion during calibration to compare TB with calibration standards (08/10/08; 24/10/08; 31/10/08).

- End status and interpretation
  - Last entry (15/07/09) indicates the data system deemed suitable for use, following prior calibration updates and data quality assessments.
  - Overall trajectory reflects iterative improvement of measurement reliability, calibration accuracy, and data handling practices to ensure a consistent environmental monitoring record.
