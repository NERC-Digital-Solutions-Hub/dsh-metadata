# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl. They were installed on 11/04/06.

## Overview and purpose
- Document is a field log of operations, measurements, and maintenance for two weir boxes (drain and overland flow, OLF) in the bowl.
- Covers installation date (11/04/06) and monitoring events up to 2009, including measurement records, calibration notes, and data quality issues.

## Data collection and measurement methods
- Two measurement channels: DRAIN and OLF. Heights above the V-notch used to infer flow; additional notes on water depth near the notch and any discrepancies.
- Collected data include: pressure transducer (PT) readings, logger activity, and check measurements (e.g., weir box height, V-notch alignment).
- Sampling and logging details mentioned such as initial logging settings (e.g., recording every 5 minutes, sampling every 10 seconds) and subsequent logger-related adjustments.
- Additional flow data sources referenced: tipping bucket (TB) data for flow estimation when direct TB readings were available.

## Data quality, anomalies, and corrections
- Frequent data quality challenges:
  - PT value jumps during downloads requiring adjustments in the analysis.
  - Data gaps due to logger failures, battery issues, or logger disconnections.
  - Occasional misalignment or recalibration needs after maintenance or freezing conditions.
- Notable interruptions:
  - Periods where "logger not recording" or data was lost due to dodgy logger or battery voltage issues.
  - Several instances of data corrections applied in the analysis to account for observed jumps or inconsistencies.
- Calibration and correction events documented:
  - Recalibration and zero-offset adjustments after cleaning or maintenance.
  - Specific zero-offset values recorded (e.g., 287.3 mm for OLF, 271.2 mm for DRAIN after calibration on 04/06/09).
  - Reassessment of baseline height when flow ceased or anomalies occurred (e.g., during freeze events or after removing/relocating PTs).

## Equipment maintenance and operational changes
- Regular maintenance and checks:
  - Battery changes, PT inspections, and transducer reinstallation.
  - Cleaning and clearing sediment or organic debris from the weir boxes (noted events in 2009 with removal of sediment and dead wildlife).
- Structural and setup notes:
  - Box dimensions and V-notch assessments indicating potential non-straightness of V-notch sides.
  - Reinstallation and calibration of PTs, including moving sensors between weir boxes when necessary.

## Environmental and operational challenges
- Adverse conditions impacting data:
  - Snow, freezing, and ice leading to blockages or altered flow dynamics.
  - Debris, vertebrate interference (voles, moles), and “black gunk” affecting measurements and clogging conduits.
  - Occasional downpipes and gutters becoming overwhelmed during high flow events or blockage scenarios.
- Specific incidents affecting data continuity:
  - Frozen conditions causing abnormal PT behavior or skewed readings.
  - Data gaps and periods where streams could not be accurately measured due to equipment limitations.

## Data gaps, provenance, and interpretation notes
- Documented data gaps and periods of unreliable data:
  - Lost data intervals due to logger issues (e.g., 25/11–05/12; 16/12–27/12).
  - Drain inflow pipe issues or misinstallation affecting data quality (e.g., 20/02/09–22/04/09).
- Use of auxiliary data to interpret flows:
  - When direct TB data was unavailable or unreliable, flow estimates relied on prior records and analysis of available PM/PT data.
  - Calibrations and zero-offsets used to anchor zero-flow conditions and align readings with physical measurements.

## Key calibrations, offsets, and data governance notes
- Calibration milestones and offsets:
  - 04/06/09: New zero-offset calibration performed; OLF 287.3 mm, DRAIN 271.2 mm (baseline for zero flow).
  - 04/06/09: Decision that drain inflow pipe was not properly reinstalled during a period, making that data period unsuitable for use.
- Data processing and provenance:
  - Annotations indicate when data were adjusted or corrected in analysis spreadsheets, and when measurements (e.g., height above V-notch) were rechecked using standard methods.
  - Some data considered not suitable due to calibration or equipment issues, with notes to verify during next download.

## Implications for Data Stewardship
- The dataset requires detailed metadata capturing:
  - Sensor placement and orientation, V-notch geometry, and any detected non-straightness.
  - Calibration events, zero-offsets, and any post-maintenance recalibrations.
  - Data quality flags indicating periods of logger errors, data gaps, and periods deemed unreliable.
- Regular maintenance and robust logging practices are essential to minimize data gaps and ensure continuity.
- Documentation of environmental interference (freezing, debris, wildlife) is important for interpreting flow signals and potential biases.
- Clear provenance and traceability for corrections, with explicit notes on when data are estimated vs. directly measured, to support reuse and governance.
