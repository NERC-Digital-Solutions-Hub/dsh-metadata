# Field Log: Overland Flow (OLF), Tipping Buckets and Weir Box Measurements (2004–2009)

## Overview
- Documentation of field monitoring activities for Overland Flow (OLF), tipping buckets (TB), drain flow, and weir box measurements.
- Aimed at maintaining data quality, calibrating instruments, and ensuring data are stored and accessible for environmental monitoring.
- Notes on data handling, calibration, maintenance, and occasional data quality issues.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Instruments involved:
  - Tipping buckets (TB) for rainfall/runoff; magnet and reed switch components repeatedly required maintenance.
  - OLF trap and OLF drain with associated tubing and a weir box for discharge measurement.
  - Tinytags and transducers (pressure/level sensors) with logger boxes (some waterproofing/access issues noted).
- Recording intervals:
  - 22/04/2004: Time interval reduced from 10 to 5 minutes to avoid logger overload.
  - 31/03/2005: Interval reduced further to 4 minutes due to logger limits.
  - 03/10/2006: Reset to 5-minute recording intervals.
- Data handling:
  - Raw datasets remained unedited; some datasets were edited to reduce size (entries removed) as of 19/05/2005.
  - Data are downloaded and stored; references to “datasets stored/uploaded to portals.”

## Calibration, measurement, and data interpretation
- TB calibration and measurements:
  - 19/05/2005: TB recalibrated so each tip equals 2 L instead of 1 L; ongoing dataset edits noted.
  - 07/06/2007: Calibration check with 30 L through TB yielded 15 tips and 1.36 L remaining → 1.90933 L per tip.
  - 30.76 L recorded as 17 tips (≈1.81 L per tip) on 14/11/2008 after calibration changes.
  - 17/11/2008: Adjusted TB tip volume to reflect calibration differences (1.81 L per tip vs 1.90933 L/tip earlier).
  - 12/12/2007: TB crack found during calibration; TB removed and sent for repair; reinstalled 02/12/2008.
- Weir box and OLF:
  - 21/04/2006: Weir box installed for OLF measurement.
  - 29/06/2006: Some drain data entries incorrect (no tips) during data download.
  - 14/07/2006 onward: TB, drain, and OLF data downloaded; time resets noted.
  - 18/01/2008: Period of immense OLF; downpipe blockage observed and cleared; overflow risk noted; mitigations discussed (covers over guttering, possible grate).
  - 23/01/2008 onward: OLF issues stabilized; 28/09/2006: OLF drain pipes cleaned; gravel/plastic sheeting replaced to manage flow.
- Data calibration and timestamps:
  - 31/10/2008–31/01/2009: Time-stamp issues resolved or mitigated; calibration periods flagged to ignore data during calibration.
  - 14/11/2008: Calibration event and data diversion for TB calibration; crack in TB addressed.
  - 07/01/2009: System reported as frozen; subsequent checks required.
  - 20/02/2009: OLF data downloaded; ongoing calibration/maintenance noted.
- Time zone considerations:
  - 02/12/2008: TB reinstalled with BST (not GMT); planned change to GMT at next visit.

## Maintenance, incidents, and operational notes
- Molar/vole-related damage:
  - 25/07/2005: OLF trap damaged by voles; difficulty inserting plastic sheeting at soil interface.
  - 21/04/2006: Mole burrow behind guttering channels OLF; use of clay fill and weir fixes noted.
  - 06/03/2007 and 20/03/2007: Magnet/tipping bucket issues (magnet coming off); multiple re-installations.
  - 21/08/2007: TB reinstalled with magnet secured; accuracy confirmed.
- Electrical and hardware issues:
  - 21/08/2006: Weir boxes restarted due to battery failure.
  - 16/08/2006: Tinytags downloaded; 28/09/2006: OLF drain pipes cleaned; 04–16/06/2008: Weir boxes emptied for PT checks.
  - 12/06/2008 and 18/01/2008: Sensor and TB-related maintenance; bucket freeze events noted (02/2009 data freezing issues later resolved).
- Structural and flow issues:
  - 14/11/2007: TB calibration and diverting water for calibration; crack found in TB at high level.
  - 03/04/2007: TB reinstalled and began logging in afternoon.
  - 29/01/2007 and 02/03/2007: Magnet issues and replacements; TB reinstalled and re-tested.

## Data quality, issues, and guidance
- Data quality considerations:
  - Periods of calibration, maintenance, or sensor testing flagged as to be ignored or treated separately to preserve data integrity.
  - Occasional timestamp issues noted and subsequently resolved; some datasets require careful interpretation around calibration events.
  - Raw data preserved; some editing performed to manage dataset size, with explicit note that raw data remain unedited.
- Dataset accessibility and value:
  - Emphasis on enabling access to underlying data and combining monitoring datasets with other data sources to increase value beyond single-use datasets.
  - Routine uploads to appropriate data portals to support transparency and reuse.

## Endnotes and overall takeaways
- The document records continuous instrument maintenance, calibration adjustments, and data quality efforts over a 2004–2009 period.
- Key improvements occurred in calibration (TB volume per tip adjustments) and in mitigating physical damages from wildlife and equipment failures.
- Ongoing challenges include handling calibration periods, timestamp alignment, data gaps during maintenance, and ensuring timely data storage and accessibility.
- For Analysts Monitoring the Environment, this log demonstrates the importance of standardized data handling, rigorous calibration, and transparent documentation to support long-term environmental monitoring and policy appraisal.
