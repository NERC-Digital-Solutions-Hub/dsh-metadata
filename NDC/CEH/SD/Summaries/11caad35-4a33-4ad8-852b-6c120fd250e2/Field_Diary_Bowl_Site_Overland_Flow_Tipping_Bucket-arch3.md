# Log of Overland Flow, Tipping Bucket, and Weir Box Measurements (2004–2009)

## Overview
- A field measurement log documenting the operation and maintenance of an overland flow (OLF) trap, tipping bucket (TB) system, weir box, drain measurements, and associated instrumentation.
- Tracks interval settings, calibrations, repairs, data edits, and timestamp issues over time to ensure data quality and comparability.

## Instrumentation and Measurements
- Tipping bucket system used to quantify rainfall/flow; includes magnet, reed switch, and transducer within a stilling well.
- OLF drain and weir box used to route and measure surface run-off.
- Data logged by various devices (e.g., tinytags, weir box sensors) with periodic downloads and recalibrations.
- Occasional physical access problems (voles/moles) and equipment misalignment noted.

## Data Collection and Time Intervals
- Time interval adjustments to manage data volume and device capacity:
  - 10-minute intervals initially, reduced to 5-minute, and later to 4-minute intervals to prevent logger overflow.
  - 03/10/06: Reset to 5-minute recording intervals.
- Intermittent data loss or anomalies addressed by recalibration and retiming; some periods marked to ignore during calibration or testing.

## Calibration and Data Processing
- TB calibration events to determine per-tip volume:
  - 07/06/2007: Calibrated to determine TB tip volume (~1.909 L per tip).
  - 17/11/2008: Calibration indicating 30.76 L corresponding to 17 tips (~1.81 L/tip).
  - 11/06/2009: Calibration indicating ~1.90 L/tip (30.54 L = 16 tips).
- TB and weir box calibrations often accompanied by adjustments to reduce measurement error and account for shifts in equipment or wiring.
- Data processing notes:
  - Raw datasets kept unedited in principle, but some entries edited to remove periods with no tips or where data were corrupted.
  - Specific data windows were ignored during sensor recalibration or where transducer alignment affected readings.
- Timekeeping and data alignment issues:
  - Occasional timestamp issues and a switch from GMT to BST noted (02/04/2009).

## Maintenance, Repairs and Data Quality Issues
- Environmental and hardware challenges:
  - Vole/mole damage to the OLF trap and related plumbing; repairs and re-routing performed.
  - Weir box and drainage pipes clogged with soil/leaf litter; routine cleaning recommended.
  - Magnet and reed switch failures on TB; multiple re-installations and replacements.
  - Sensor mounting and alignment problems (transducer in tube, top/bottom of stilling well) corrected over time.
- Calibration and operational interruptions:
  - Equipment recalibrations often required after repairs or significant disturbances (e.g., weir box calibrations, TB calibration checks).
  - Periods of data ignored during calibration, re-routing, or when water was diverted for calibration experiments.

## Data Management and Metadata
- Emphasis on data quality, openness, and documentation:
  - Noted need to verify metadata and maintain data provenance, especially after repairs or recalibrations.
  - Public sharing of underlying data mentioned as a consideration; raw data generally preserved, with selective edits to remove non-informative periods.
- Data governance implications:
  - Regular data downloads, time synchronization, and clear recording of calibration factors to enable comparable, long-term monitoring outputs.

## Endnotes and Last Status
- By early 2009, continued TB calibrations and re-installations maintained measurement integrity.
- Final calibration entry (11/06/2009) documents TB volume per tip (~1.9 L) and total volume corresponding to a given number of tips, sustaining a consistent basis for interpretation going forward.
