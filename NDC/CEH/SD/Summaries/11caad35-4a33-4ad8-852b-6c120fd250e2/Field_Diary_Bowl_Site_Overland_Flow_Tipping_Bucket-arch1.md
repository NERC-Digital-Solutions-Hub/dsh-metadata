# Overland Flow and Tipping Bucket Data Log (2004–2009)

- Overview
  - A field-to-desk data log tracking overland flow (OLF), drain flow, and tipping bucket (TB) measurements, including calibrations, maintenance, and data integrity notes from 2004 to 2009.

- Instrumentation and data collection
  - Measurement updates and time base:
    - 22/04/04: Time interval reset from 10 to 5 minutes to prevent TB overloading the small tag logger.
    - 31/03/05: Time interval reduced to 4 minutes.
    - 03/10/06: Reverted to 5-minute recording intervals.
  - Tipping buckets (TB) and gear:
    - 19/05/05: TB recalibrated so each tip equals 2 L (previously 1 L).
    - 29/06/06–21/08/07: Multiple TB repairs/reinstalls due to magnet detachment, reed switch issues, and vole damage.
    - 17/10/07–03/04/07: TB reinstalled and restarted after maintenance.
  - Weir box, transducer, and sampling:
    - 11/04/06: Weir box installed for OLF measurement.
    - 17/10/07: Drilled drain pipe before water enters weir box for water sampling.
    - 18/01/08–19/02/08: Periods of very high OLF; bucket and downpipe conditions noted.
  - Data loggers and timekeeping:
    - Regular tinytags downloaded; intermittent time stamps and calibration-related time resets noted (e.g., 29/06/06, 26/07/06, 24/10/08, 31/10/08).

- Calibration and data processing
  - Initial TB calibration and conversion factors:
    - 19/05/05: TB settled at 2 L per tip.
    - 07/06/07: Calibrated with 30 L through TB yielding 15 tips + 1.36 L remaining; computed tip volume = 1.90933 L.
  - Ongoing recalibration and updates:
    - 30.76 L = 17 tips = 1.81 L/t observed (late 2008).
    - 17/11/08: Recognized discrepancies between 07/06/07 TB tip volume and 14/11/08 measurements; applied a linear incremental adjustment to tip volume, approximately 6 months after initial calibration.
    - 02/12/08: TB reinstalled after adjustments.
    - 11/06/09: TB calibration recorded as 30.54 L = 16 tips = 1.9 L/t.
  - Data edits and exclusions:
    - 19/05/05 onward: editing to reduce data size by removing non-recorded tips; raw data retained unedited.
    - Specific ignore periods during maintenance/calibration (e.g., 13:30–14:30 on 05/07/06; 0854 GMT–1200 GMT on 25/07/08; 10:24–13:00 GMT on 24/10/08).

- Maintenance, repairs, and anomalies
  - Vole/animal-related damage:
    - 25/07/05: OLF trap damaged by voles; access issue at trap end.
    - 03/10/06: vole-related channeling behind guttering noted; weir box and OLF pathways affected.
    - 18/01/08, 19/02/08, 24/03/09: significant vole-related or wear issues affecting TB and OLF setup; later TB repairs and realignment required.
  - Hardware failures and fixes:
    - Magnet detachment and reed switch failures (02/03/07; 06/03/07; 20/02/07; 20/03/07).
    - Weir box rework, sediment removal, and downpipe clearing to manage blockages (2006–2008).
    - 07/06/07: calibration performed following TB integrity checks; system stability improved but later recalibration adjustments applied.
  - Other issues:
    - Transducer alignment problems and water ingress noted (21/04/06); corrective measures implemented.
    - Occasional battery failures and calibration-related PT tests (e.g., 25/07/08, 24/10/08, 31/10/08).

- Data quality, gaps, and interpretation
  - Calibration periods and instrument adjustments introduced intentional data exclusions to avoid biased analyses.
  - Time stamp issues and data corrections noted (e.g., 24/10/08 and 31/10/08) to maintain temporal integrity.
  - Periods of very high OLF (e.g., 18/01/08) and subsequent data filtering (e.g., ignoring to the calibration windows) to separate instrumentation effects from actual hydrological signals.

- Key observations and implications for analysis
  - TB calibration stabilizes around approximately 1.9 L per tip after multiple validations and adjustments (initially ~1.909 L/T, with later refinements).
  - OLF system is highly sensitive to vole damage and sedimentation in gutters/downpipes, requiring ongoing maintenance and potential design mitigations (grates, stabilization of gutters, trap repair).
  - Regular maintenance (magnet/reed switch repairs, weir box calibration, downpipe cleaning) is essential to maintain data continuity and accuracy.
  - Data handling practices emphasize clear documentation of calibration events, data exclusions, and reprocessing steps to ensure traceability and reproducibility.

- Current status and takeaways (as of 11 June 2009)
  - TB calibration established at ~1.9 L per tip; system remains susceptible to mechanical and biological disturbances.
  - OLF pathway continues to require monitoring and repair due to vole damage and blockages; several calibrations and re-installations were performed to maintain data quality.
  - Ongoing data collection with acknowledged gaps during calibration and maintenance periods; careful interpretation required to separate hydrological signals from instrument-related artifacts.
