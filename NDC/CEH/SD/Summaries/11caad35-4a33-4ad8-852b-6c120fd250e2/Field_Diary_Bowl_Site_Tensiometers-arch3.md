# The data in this folder is data downloaded from the Delta-t logger in the bowl study area.

## Overview
- Data source: Delta-t logger measurements from tensiometers in the bowl study area.
- Variables: Tensiometer readings (pore-water pressure) at multiple depths and transect points.
- Time span: 2004–2009 (with extensive detailed notes across this period).
- Purpose: Record soil moisture tension to inform environmental monitoring, with detailed maintenance and data-quality notes.

## Instrumentation and data collected
- Tensiometers and depths:
  - Multiple tensiometers (e.g., T1.1, T1.2, T1.3, T1.4, T2.1, T2.2, T2.3, T2.4) at depths such as 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm.
  - Measurements referenced across transects and cages (e.g., bowl transects, cage positions).
- Data logging equipment:
  - Delta-t loggers and Delta T devices (DL6 loggers) used to capture readings.
  - Mention of installations with orientation adjustments (e.g., 15 degrees) and corresponding depth-offset corrections.
- Data format and handling:
  - Data downloaded periodically from Delta-t loggers; notes include settings like overwrite modes and time synchronization issues.

## Data collection, maintenance, and processing
- Routine maintenance activities:
  - Degassing tensiometers and vent inspections; vent exposure to atmosphere noted as impacting data.
  - Grass cutting, cage maintenance, and guarding against animal interference (sheep, moles) to protect equipment.
  - Reinstallation, recalibration, and repairs of tensiometers (including replacements of tubing and vent guards).
  - Weekend/occasional lab checks for calibration and sensor integrity.
- Data management actions:
  - Regular data downloads from Delta-t loggers; some entries mention logger timing and synchronization issues.
  - Adjustments to data processing, including installer-oriented corrections and orientation offsets.
  - Offsets applied to readings to account for installation depth and porous-cup to sensor transducer differences (e.g., -4.8 cm offset for vertical installation; later changes to 0 cm when offset adjustments were updated).
  - Revisions to logger programming and data handling during field updates (e.g., changing warm-up times, reconfiguring DL6 programs).

## Data quality, issues, and gaps
- Data gaps and missing data:
  - Periods of missing data due to missed downloads and logger auto-wrap (loss of data from start of sampling periods).
  - 03/11/08: data download problem from top cage leading to data corruption/unavailable data.
  - 30/07/09: bottom tensiometers failed to respond despite battery changes.
- Instrumental and environmental challenges:
  - Vents buried or damaged by earthworms; some tensiometers and tubes damaged by animals (sheep, chewing, mole activity).
  - Cages and tubing damaged (needs reinstallation or replacement) and some tensiometers pulled from ground.
  - Data quality impacted by logger and battery issues, and occasional time synchronization problems between loggers and computer clock.
- Data integrity adjustments:
  - Offsets applied to readings to correct installation angle and depth differences; offset values adjusted over time (e.g., -4.8 cm; later changed to 0). Corrections documented for upcoming downloads.

## Data management and governance considerations
- Metadata and provenance:
  - Detailed field notes provide context about installation conditions, orientation, and maintenance, which are crucial for data interpretation.
  - Occasional notes indicate metadata gaps (e.g., changes in installation angle, offsets) that must be captured in data provenance.
- Data accessibility and openness:
  - The document itself is a longitudinal maintenance log; broader data-sharing constraints are acknowledged (public sharing of datasets can be a barrier in some contexts).
- Data quality assurance:
  - Emphasis on degassing, vent checks, calibration, and systematic repairs as quality-control practices.
  - Documentation of issues and corrections serves as an audit trail for data quality and processing decisions.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks
- Importance of robust, well-documented data provenance:
  - Field installation details (orientation, depth offsets) directly affect interpretation of readings.
  - Regular maintenance and hardware integrity checks are critical to data continuity.
- Handling data gaps and corrections:
  - Anticipate data loss from missed downloads, logger timeouts, and environmental interference; implement strategies to minimize gaps (e.g., automated backups, redundancy, and explicit gap annotations).
  - Maintain clear records of offsets and processing changes to ensure consistent time series alignment.
- Metadata richness and governance:
  - Comprehensive metadata around instrumentation, calibration, and data processing steps is essential to enable policy-relevant analysis.
  - Establish data governance processes to manage sharing, metadata standards, and version control.
- Data quality as a policy-informing factor:
  - Recognize how animal interference, environmental conditions, and equipment failures can bias readings; plan monitoring designs that mitigate these risks.

## Summary takeaways
- The dataset comprises long-term tensiometer measurements from a Delta-t logging system, with extensive field maintenance and processing notes reflecting real-world operational challenges.
- Data quality hinges on consistent maintenance (degassing, vent checks), protection from animals, and reliable data downloads; several gaps and corrections were encountered and documented.
- For monitoring frameworks, the document highlights the need for thorough metadata, robust data governance, and explicit handling of data gaps and instrument-related biases to ensure environmental health in policy evaluations.
