# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl.

## Overview
- Document logs for the drain (DRAIN) and overland flow (OLF) weir boxes in the bowl.
- Installation date: 11/04/06.
- Measurements focus on height above the V-notch (in mm) used to estimate flow, with occasional direct notes on water level and flow conditions.
- Data collection includes pressure transducers (PTs), loggers, and calibration steps; data are processed in an Excel analysis file.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Weir boxes: DRAIN and OLF, each with a V-notch; measured height above notch used to infer flow.
- Instruments noted: pressure transducers, stilling wells, loggers, battery checks, and occasional tipping buckets.
- Sampling and logging: varied over time; references to recording intervals (e.g., every 5 minutes, sampling every 10 seconds) and data downloads.
- Calibration and measurement notes include dual-method height checks, spirit-level alignments, and geometry calculations (e.g., box side lengths, notches) to validate depth above the notch.
- Data entries include explicit height measurements (in mm) and derived flow references, plus notes on measurement techniques (e.g., cos45 multipliers) and zeroing offsets.

## Data quality issues and anomalies
- Frequent logger problems:
  - Periods where the logger did not record data.
  - Jumps or shifts in PT values requiring post hoc corrections.
  - “Dodgy logger” periods with missing or unreliable data; replacements performed (e.g., 21x logger replaced with 23x).
  - Battery voltage concerns leading to incomplete downloads or pauses.
- Environmental and physical challenges:
  - Snow, freezing conditions, and ice affecting sensor readings and box integrity.
  - Sediment buildup, trapped organisms (e.g., worms, moles), and debris affecting flow measurements.
  - Voles damaging traps and traps requiring maintenance.
- Calibration and zeroing challenges:
  - Occasional need to recalibrate zero offset due to drifts or post-maintenance changes.
  - Separate zero/background flow calibrations performed by adding water to achieve base V-notch level.
  - Some calibrations described as temporary or best estimates pending recheck.
- Data integrity and gaps:
  - Lost data windows (e.g., late 2006 to early 2007, late 2008, late 2009) attributed to dodgy loggers or battery issues.
  - Periods not suitable for use due to reinstallation or missing zero-flow baselines.
  - Reports of data corrections in the accompanying analysis excel file to account for jumps or drift.

## Data processing and transformations
- Height measurements above the V-notch are converted to flow estimates, with multiple methods cross-checked (two measurement approaches) and occasional averaging.
- Corrections and offsets:
  - Offsets derived from calibration efforts (e.g., PT height at zero flow) are applied to align OLF and DRAIN readings.
  - Explicit notes on applying corrections for jumps in PT values during data processing.
  - “Best estimate” offsets used after calibration activities (e.g., 04/06/09) and updated in the analysis file.
- Data handling notes:
  - Data corrections and calibrations referenced as being implemented in the analysis Excel file rather than the raw log.
  - Some data flagged as not suitable for use due to incorrect setup, missing zero references, or calibration issues.

## Notable events by period
- 2006
  - Installation and initial setup; early monitoring entries and logger handling.
  - Several instances of battery changes and logger testing.
- 2007
  - Winter conditions caused freezing and snow ingress; measures taken to protect stilling wells.
  - Several data logging issues documented; some data adjustments later.
  - 26.1 mm vs. 28.3 mm height measurements indicating cross-checks of V-notch depth.
- 2008
  - Freezing conditions and blockages (e.g., vole-related) observed; subsequent repairs and recalibrations.
  - June calibrations and the decision to shift to a larger sample interval (5 minutes) for some data.
  - Noted data gaps and “dodgy logger” periods leading to data loss; multiple recalibration efforts.
  - November–December: additional data gaps due to logger issues; efforts to remeasure zero flow baselines.
- 2009
  - Recurrent data gaps and calibration challenges; emphasis on post-cleanout recalibration.
  - 04/06/09: new zero offset calibration performed after cleaning; best estimates documented (OLF 287.3 mm, DRAIN 271.2 mm).
  - Some periods deemed not suitable for use due to drain inflow pipe issues or battery-related download problems.
  - 13/11/09: logger reconnected after a battery-related disconnect.

## Data availability and current status
- Multiple periods with missing or unreliable data due to logger failures, battery issues, or calibration problems.
- Documented calibrations and offset adjustments intended to enable continued use of the dataset, with corrections tracked in the accompanying Excel analysis file.
- Later entries acknowledge that some data are not suitable for use and require careful consideration or remeasurement.

## Key takeaways for data support
- This dataset provides drain and overland flow measurements via weir boxes with detailed notes on instrumentation, calibration, and environmental challenges.
- Data quality is affected by hardware reliability (loggers, batteries), environmental conditions (frozen conditions, debris), and maintenance activities (calibrations, zero offsets).
- Systematic data cleaning and offset correction are essential, with substantial reliance on post hoc adjustments documented in an analysis file.
- Regular maintenance and robust calibration protocols are critical to minimize data gaps and improve long-term data usability.
