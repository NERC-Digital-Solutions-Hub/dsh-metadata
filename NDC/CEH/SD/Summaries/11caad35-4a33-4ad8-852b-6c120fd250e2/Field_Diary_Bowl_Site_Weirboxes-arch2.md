# This file is for the weir boxes that are measuring drain and overland flow in the bowl.

## Overview
- Weir boxes monitor drain flow (DRAIN) and overland flow (OLF) in the bowl; installed 11/04/06.
- Monitoring spans 2006–2009 with detailed notes on measurements, instrument status, and maintenance.
- Measurements focused on height above the V-notch crest to estimate flow, with data logged regularly and regularly downloaded.

## Data Collected
- Heights above V-notch for DRAIN and OLF, recorded during each monitoring event (e.g., DRAIN ~38.5 mm and OLF ~7 mm on 28/11/06; later values around 0–70 mm range depending on conditions).
- Methods include two height measurements per event and calibration notes for discrepancies.
- Turbidity sensors added to OLF outflows on 28/11/06.
- Weir box dimensions measured (drain: ~210.5 mm side length; OLF: ~199 mm) indicating V-notch not perfectly straight.
- Baseline/zero-flow calibration referenced frequently; explicit zero-offset calibrations recorded on 04/06/09 (OLF 287.3 mm; DRAIN 271.2 mm) and prior adjustments after maintenance.
- Occasional notes on diurnal temperature effects, evaporation effects, and data corrections in post-processing (e.g., adjustments for jumps in pressure transducer values).

## Equipment and Calibration
- Pressure transducers (PTs) in stilling wells tracking water height relative to V-notch crest.
- Loggers and batteries frequently serviced, replaced, or reconfigured (e.g., 14/07/06: logger restart; 31/10/06: logger data gaps; 13/11/09: reconnected logger; 10/11/09: battery voltage ~10.1 V noted).
- Multiple calibrations and offset adjustments performed to account for sensor drift and environmental conditions (e.g., 04/06/09: new zero-offset calibrations; 12/06/08: recalibration after freezing and shifting PT placement).
- Notes on sensor placement changes due to freezing, sediment, and blockages; some PT placements moved or replaced (e.g., one PT removed from weir belt and reinstalled in OLF well).

## Data Quality and Issues
- Frequent data gaps and interruptions due to logger failures, battery issues, and battery-induced shutdowns.
- Jumps/offsets in PT readings observed (adjusted in analysis spreadsheets; some data deemed not reliable for those periods).
- Freezing conditions and snow ingress caused measurement disturbances (e.g., snow entering stilling wells; wooden lids installed to mitigate).
- Blockages and biological interference (vole damage, dead moles) affecting flow measurements and sediment in boxes.
- Evaporation and diurnal temperature effects causing apparent fluctuations; some data corrected post-download (e.g., 17–21 Apr 2007).
- Data loss periods due to “dodgy logger” and disconnections (notably 25/11–05/12 and 16/12–27/12).
- Some data considered non-representative during maintenance periods (e.g., drain inflow pipe removal affecting accuracy).

## Notable Interventions and Events
- 27/04/06 – 14/07/06: initial setup and early testing; logger testing and restarts.
- 21/09/06 – 21/11/06: battery changes, key issues, and ongoing monitoring adjustments.
- 24/11/06 – 28/11/06: turbidity sensors installed on outflows.
- 13/03/07: wooden lids placed on pressure transducer stilling wells to reduce snow ingress.
- 05/06/08 – 12/06/08: drainage and cleaning of weir boxes; PT reinstallation; calibration adjustments after cleaning.
- 04/06/09: new zero-offset calibrations for both OLF and DRAIN after calibration tests.
- 13/11/09: logger reconnected; notes of battery voltage and intermittent data collection.

## Environmental Observations and Implications
- Periods of very low or near-zero flow when boxes are near baseline; calibration required to distinguish zero-flow from sensor drift.
- Freezing, snow, and debris (sediment, organic matter) significantly affected measurement reliability and necessitated physical interventions (lids, cleaning).
- Wildlife interactions (voles, moles) contributed to blockages and sediment buildup, impacting flow capture.
- Turbidity sensors added later provide potential supplementary indicators of water quality concurrent with discharge measurements.
- Data interpretation relies on post-processing corrections (PT jumps, zero offsets) to produce usable flow estimates, indicating the need for careful QA/QC in environment monitoring programs.

## Data Handling and Metadata
- Data downloaded and analyzed in spreadsheets; explicit references to adjustments for sensor jumps and offset corrections.
- Recording methodology (height above V-notch, crest height) and box dimensions documented to support reproducibility.
- Gaps and anomalies tracked to inform future data collection plans and sensor maintenance scheduling.
