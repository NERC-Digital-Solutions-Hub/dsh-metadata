# The data in this folder is data downloaded from the Delta-t logger in the bowl study area.

## Overview
- Data origin: Delta-t logger in the bowl study area, with tensiometers deployed at multiple depths.
- Contents: Time-stamped notes and measurements from tensiometers (depths 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm) across transects (e.g., 1.2, 1.4, 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4); data downloads and maintenance logs spanning 2004–2009.
- Purpose: Documentation of data collection, maintenance, and data quality issues to support discovery and reuse.

## Data collection and instruments
- Instruments: Delta-t logger system; DL6/loggers; tensiometers at 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm; bowl and transect configurations (e.g., 1.x and 2.x transects).
- Installation details:
  - Initial setup with tensiometers in various cages/transacts; several notes of degassing and vent checking.
  - New set installed at ~15° angle; offsets applied to account for depth and installation geometry.
  - Wiring reconfiguration to ensure correct interpretation of readings (negative pore pressure corresponding to negative signal).
- Maintenance activities:
  - Degassing, vent exposure checks, grass cutting, cage/plot maintenance.
  - Reinstallation after damage (sheep, moles, chewing tubing); tube/tubing replacement.
  - Battery changes, logger resets, and program adjustments (e.g., warm-up times, time synchronization).

## Data quality and issues
- Data gaps and loss:
  - 11–15 April 2006: missing data due to logger auto-wrap after degradation or log timing issue.
  - 03/11/08: data corrupted and not available.
  - 30/07/09: bottom tensiometers did not respond despite battery changes.
- Offsets and calibration:
  - -4.8 cm offset introduced on 16/10/08 to account for installation angle and porous cup depth; applied in logger program on 16/10/08 and 24/10/08.
  - Offset changed back to 0 on 25/11/08; subsequent notes indicate updating metadata accordingly.
  - Additional adjustments to account for vertical offset and installation angle differences; future downloads planned to embed offset adjustments automatically.
- Equipment and environmental factors:
  - Vent burials by earthworms; grass/vegetation growth; chewed or detached tubing by sheep; moles affecting vent coverage.
  - Occasional tensiometer components pulled from ground or damaged, requiring reinstallation and degassing.
- Data integrity and timing:
  - 16/06/08: logger time drift corrected (bowl top DL6 ran ~3 minutes faster than laptop clock).
  - Occasional data download issues and reruns to realign data streams across Delta-t and DL6 loggers.

## Data processing and management
- Data capture and downloads:
  - Regular data downloads from Delta-t loggers; occasional mentions of DL6 data handling.
- Processing actions:
  - Reprogramming and calibration updates (e.g., delta T logger warm-up adjustments).
  - Reinstalls and reconfigurations following maintenance events.
  - Documentation of significant events and adjustments for traceability.
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Detailed event-by-event notes tied to specific tensiometers, depths, and transects.
  - Serial numbers (e.g., tensio units 182, 175) referenced during component replacements.

## Notable challenges and considerations for reuse
- Data gaps and reliability:
  - Expect periods with missing or corrupted data; plan for handling gaps in analyses.
- Heterogeneous systems:
  - Use of different loggers (Delta-t, DL6) with offset and angle corrections; ensure metadata captures installation geometry and corrections.
- Documentation needs:
  - Maintain clear records of when offsets were applied or removed, and the rationale for each data correction.
- Provenance and governance:
  - Keep links to maintenance events, reinstallation records, and sensor replacements to support data lineage and reproducibility.

## Key dates and actions (highlights)
- 15/03/04 onward: initial data collection in bowl area.
- 2005–2007: repeated degassing, vent management, and maintenance; data downloads and reinstallation as needed.
- 16/10/08–25/11/08: installation-angle offset introduced (-4.8 cm) and then reset to 0 later in November 2008.
- 16/06/08: logger time drift correction; 03/11/08: data corrupted/not available.
- 30/07/09: bottom tensiometers non-responsive despite battery changes.
