# The data in this folder is data downloaded from the Delta-t logger in the bowl study area.

## Overview
- Records data from Delta-t tensiometer loggers (DL6) in the bowl study area.
- Timeframe spans 2004–2009, with routine maintenance, calibration, and data downloads noted.
- Aimed at monitoring soil pore-water pressure (tensiometer readings) at multiple depths and transects.

## Site, equipment, and measurements
- Study area: bowl transect with tensiometers at depths around 10 cm, 30 cm, and 50 cm.
- Equipment: Delta-t loggers (DL6), multiple tensiometers labeled (e.g., T1.1, T2.1, etc.), and associated cables/tubes.
- Measurements: tensiometer readings used to assess soil moisture pressures; readings adjusted for installation angle and depth differences over time.
- Depths and transects repeatedly referenced (e.g., 10 cm, 30 cm, 50 cm; transect points 1.2, 2.3, etc.).

## Data collection, handling, and standard procedures
- Regular procedures included degassing tensiometers, vent checks, and recalibration.
- Grass cutting and cage maintenance were frequent to reduce interference with sensors.
- Periodic reinstallation or relocation of tensiometers due to damage (sheep, chewing, moles) and soil movement.
- Calibration and data management steps:
  - Degassing and vent exposure checks.
  - Reinstallation after damage and occasional tube/tubing replacements.
  - Delta-t logger maintenance, with updates to logging programs and offsets.
  - Offsets applied to account for depth-to-cup differences and installation angle (initially -4.8 cm; later adjusted to 0 cm on 25/11/08).
  - Installation angle adjusted to 15 degrees relative to ground; corresponding offset applied to account for measurement geometry.
  - Databases and spreadsheets updated to reflect offsets and installation geometry.
- Data collection issues and adjustments:
  - Logger time synchronization: several notes about clock drift and alignment with laptop time.
  - Occasional data gaps due to missed downloads, auto-wrap, and missing data from the start of a period.
  - Revisions to program warm-up periods (e.g., changing from 1-second to 10-second warm-up) and DL6 program offset handling.

## Data quality, integrity, and metadata notes
- Frequent data quality interventions to ensure valid readings (degassing, vent exposure, recalibration).
- Metadata changes accompanying hardware changes:
  - Angle of installation and depth-to-cup differences addressed via offsets (-4.8 cm, later 0 cm).
  - Sign convention adjustments when wiring was changed (negative versus positive pressure readings).
- Notable data gaps and issues:
  - 04/06/2006 and 11–15 April 2006 data missing due to logger auto-wrap after missed downloads.
  - 03/11/2008 data download corruption in top cage; data not available.
  - 30/07/2009 bottom tensiometers: logger non-responsive despite battery changes.
- Ongoing data alignment efforts:
  - Offsets updated in the logger program to reflect installation geometry and measurement depth.
  - When shifts occurred (e.g., relocation, angle change), metadata documented to support later analysis.

## Environmental disturbances and their data implications
- Animal activity and environmental factors repeatedly affected sensor integrity:
  - Sheep movement damaged cages, tubing, and tensiometers.
  - Rodent/mole activity impacted vent protection and sensor placement.
  - Grass growth and cutting influenced access and maintenance schedules.
- Such disturbances caused data gaps, reinstallation needs, and additional calibration steps.

## Outputs, usage, and value realization
- Data outputs expected as standardized datasets suitable for reports, maps, and charts illustrating environmental health and soil moisture dynamics over time.
- Data and metadata are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, supporting transparency and reuse.
- The ongoing maintenance and documentation support data quality and comparability across time, aligning with monitoring and policy-performance assessment aims.

## Implications for environmental monitoring practice
- Demonstrates the importance of rigorous data provenance, including installation geometry, offsets, and calibration history.
- Highlights vulnerabilities of field-based sensing to wildlife and environmental interference, underscoring the need for robust hardware protection and contingency logging.
- Aligns with the archetype’s goals by providing a structured, mappable record that can be scrutinized for environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Suggests opportunities to enhance data value by linking tensiometer data with other environmental datasets and by improving data accessibility across users.
