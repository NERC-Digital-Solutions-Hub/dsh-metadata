# Metaschoepite dissolution in sediment column systems - groundwater/soil geochemistry and uranium X-ray spectroscopy data

- Describes solid and solution phase geochemical trends for metaschoepite-doped sediment columns reacted with oxic or electron-donor amended synthetic groundwater, sacrificed after 6 or 12 months to track metaschoepite dissolution, uranium transport, and speciation. Full methods and interpretation are in Bower et al., 2019 (Environmental Science & Technology, DOI: 10.1021/acs.est.9b02292).

- Experimental design
  - Four metaschoepite-doped columns plus two control systems
  - Conditions: oxic groundwater vs electron-donor amended groundwater
  - Timepoints: 6 months and 12 months
  - Sampling scheme: solid horizons at 5 mm intervals; column effluents sampled periodically up to 12 months
  - Spatial layout: horizons measured in millimeters from sediment base; data sometimes expressed as pore volumes (PV) of groundwater

- Data types and key measurements (datasets 1–9 and beyond)
  - 1 Aqua Regia Sediment Digests_ICPAES_UO3: aqua regia extractions for U and Fe across horizons
  - 2 Column_Effluents_ICPMS_Control_UO3: U (ICP-MS) and Fe, Mn, Mg (AES) in effluents across columns and time
  - 3 Column_Effluents_IC_Control_UO3: anions/carkers in effluents (SO4, NO3, VFA, NO2, PO4)
  - 4 Column_Effluents_pH_Control_UO3: pH of effluents over time
  - 5 Sediment_digests_Ferrozine_UO3: Fe(II) proportion in sediment horizons via 0.5 N HCl extraction
  - 6 Phylogenetic_abundance_control_UO3: microbial community composition, focusing on Fe/Sulfate-reducing strains and broader phylogenetic classes
  - 7 Bulk_MicroXANES_UO3: U L3-edge XANES from bulk and microfocus beamlines (bulk sediments and micro regions)
  - 8 MicroEXAFS_UO3: microfocus EXAFS data from elevated-U regions
  - 9 BulkEXAFS_UO3: core-beam EXAFS data from elevated-U regions
  - Synchrotron XRF mapping data: element distribution maps from resin-embedded thin sections; text files (.txt) and Nexus files (.nxs) covering Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, U, Rb, Sr; DAWN-compatible Nexus files provide full spectra
  - 10–17 UO3_1_1242_reform to UO3_8_xxx: XRF maps for 12-month aged, electron-donor amended system (selected reformatted map files)
  - 18–28 UO3_9 to UO3_19: XRF maps for 6-month aged, oxic and 12-month aged, electron-donor amended systems (additional map files)

- Temporal and analytical depth
  - Time-resolved solute concentrations (U, Fe, Mn, Mg, sulfate, nitrate, nitrite, phosphate, VFA) across four columns and two control setups
  - Solid-phase U and Fe speciation and oxidation state (aqua regia extracts, Ferrozine UO3)
  - Microbial community shifts related to iron/sulfate reduction
  - Uranium speciation and local structure via U L3-edge XANES/EXAFS (bulk and micro-focused, 6 vs 12 months)
  - Spatial distribution of elements (XRF maps) within sediment matrices at 6 and 12 months under different recharge conditions

- Data formats and access
  - Multiple file types: tabular datasets (aqua regia, ICPMS/AES, IC, pH, Ferrozine), sequencing results, XANES/EXAFS spectra, and XRF maps
  - XRF data provided as plain text maps and Nexus files; DAWN Science Suite recommended for viewing Nexus files
  - File naming encodes system: timepoint (6MO, 12MO), condition (OXIC, E-D AM), horizon (mm from base)

- Reference and additional context
  - This dataset accompanies a peer-reviewed study (Bower et al., 2019) detailing implications for uranium speciation and transport in sediment systems

- Analytical opportunities for data-driven insights
  - Correlate solid-phase U/Fe speciation (aqua regia and Ferrozine) with uranium breakout/retardation in effluents
  - Link microbial community dynamics to redox-driven uranium transformations
  - Integrate bulk and micro XAS data to identify oxidation state changes and local coordination around uranium
  - Use XRF maps to assess spatial coupling between mineral phases and uranium-rich zones across time and treatment
  - Develop predictive models of uranium transport under oxic vs electron-donor amended conditions, incorporating horizon-scale and time-resolved data
