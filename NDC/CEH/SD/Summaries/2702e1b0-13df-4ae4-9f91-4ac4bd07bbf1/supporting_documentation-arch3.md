# Metaschoepite dissolution in sediment column systems - groundwater/soil geochemistry and uranium X-ray spectroscopy data

## Overview
- A comprehensive data collection accompanying a study on metaschoepite dissolution and uranium speciation/transport in sediment column systems.
- Datasets cover solid and solution phase geochemistry, microbial communities, and uranium X-ray spectroscopy across oxic and electron-donor amended groundwater conditions.
- Timepoints include 6 and 12 months, with horizons sampled at 5 mm intervals; four metaschoepite-doped columns plus two controls.
- Full experimental details and data interpretation are described in the associated peer-reviewed publication.

## Experimental design and conditions
- Sediment columns doped with metaschoepite; subjected to flowing oxic or electron-donor amended synthetic groundwater.
- Reacted for 6 or 12 months before sacrifice and analysis.
- System types labeled as OXIC (oxic) or E-D AM (electron-donor amended).
- Sediment horizons quantified by distance from column base (in millimeters) for spatially resolved analyses.

  - Datasets cover 6- and 12-month aged systems; maps include Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, U, Rb, Sr, and other emissions; provides spatial distribution of elements in the soil matrix after simulated groundwater flow.
  - Specific file names indicate system type (OXIC or E-D AM) and age (6MO or 12MO) with multiple UO3-related map files.

## Data structure and labeling
- Datasets consistently labeled with system type (OXIC vs E-D AM), timepoint (6MO vs 12MO), and horizon (in millimeters) where applicable.
- Multiple complementary modalities (chemical concentrations, pH, redox-sensitive Fe(II), microbial community composition, and spectroscopic analyses) integrated to characterize uranium speciation and transport.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy evaluation
- Demonstrates an integrated, multi-method approach to monitoring environmental health indicators related to uranium fate and transport in subsurface environments.
- Combines solid-phase and solution-phase chemistry, microbial ecology, and advanced spectroscopy to inform risk assessment and remediation strategies under varying redox conditions.
- Highlights data governance considerations for monitoring frameworks: need for robust metadata (system type, timepoint, horizon), data availability and sharing, harmonized data formats, and clear documentation to enable reuse and policy-informed decision-making.
