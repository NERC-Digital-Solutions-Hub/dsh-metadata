# THAMES CATHCMENT

## Overview
- A map displaying pharmaceutical concentration sampling points in the Thames catchment.
- Sampling point identifiers: TC1–TC21 spread across rivers including the Thames and tributaries such as Cherwell, Windrush, Leach, Colne, Kennet, Loddon, Wye, Misbourne, Mole, Thame, Ray, Ock, Ver, Gade, and Whitewater.
- Indicates multiple sampling sites along the river network with the Thames as a central reference.
- Scale bar shown from 0 to 40 km.

## Data sources and rights
- Source: NERC (CEH) with Ordnance Survey data.

## How to use
- Serves as a geospatial reference for pharmaceutical concentration sampling sites (TC1–TC21) within the Thames catchment.
- The fragment lists site IDs and associated rivers; coordinates and results are not included here but expected in the full dataset.

## Notes and considerations
- Contains only site IDs and river names; no coordinates, concentration values, dates, or methodological details.
- To analyze concentrations, you will need the complete dataset with geolocations and metadata.

## Potential data products (Data Support perspective)
- Geospatial layer mapping TC1–TC21 within the Thames river network.
- Dashboard linking site IDs to concentration results and sampling metadata.
- Data quality checks to confirm coordinates and resolve any duplicate river naming or site placement.
- Clear provenance and licensing documentation (CEH/NERC and Ordnance Survey).
