# THAMES CATHCMENT

- Purpose: A map-like listing of pharmaceutical concentration sampling points within the Thames catchment to support environmental health monitoring and policy performance assessment over time.

- Content overview:
  - Pharmaceutical sampling points across multiple rivers and tributaries, labeled with codes TC1–TC21 (e.g., TC1, TC2, TC3, … TC21, plus others like TC8, TC19, TC10, TC9, TC12, TC14–TC17, TC18, TC20, TC21).
  - Included locations span the Thames and numerous surrounding water bodies such as Cherwell, Windrush, Churn, Leach, Glyme, Thame, Ray, Colne, Kennet, Enborne, Ock, Loddon, Whitewater, Blackwater, Wey, Misbourne, Mole, Ver, Gade, and Environs.
  - Scale indicator present (0–40 km with subdivisions), suggesting a geospatial layout or map context.

- Data provenance and rights:
  - Source: © NERC (CEH) with Ordnance Survey data © Crown Copyright and database right 2013.

- Implications for analysts:
  - Provides standardized geolocated sampling points for environmental monitoring of pharmaceutical concentrations.
  - Facilitates generation of outputs (maps, charts, reports) and supports quality assurance, data cleaning, and transformation workflows.
  - Serves as a reference dataset to integrate with other environmental data for broader analysis and monitoring over time.

- Key challenges to maximize value:
  - Increasing the value of these datasets by integrating them with additional environmental data (e.g., other pollutants, land use, hydrology) to avoid single-use limitations.
  - Enabling access to the underlying data to support transparency, reuse, and external analysis.
