# Intra- and Interpandemic Variations of Antiviral, Antibiotics and Decongestants in Wastewater Treatment Plants and Receiving Rivers

- Context and scope
  - 21 river sampling sites within the River Thames catchment, England, and two WWTPs feeding into the river were studied.
  - Timeframe: sampling from 3 November 2009 to 11 May 2011, covering pandemic and inter-pandemic periods.

- Analytes and sampling design
  - Analytes measured: 11 antibiotics (trimethoprim, oxytetracycline, ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, cefotaxime, doxycycline, sulfamethoxazole, erythromycin, clarithromycin, ofloxacin, norfloxacin), 3 decongestants (naphazoline, oxymetazoline, xylometazoline), and oseltamivir carboxylate (active metabolite ofTamiflu).
  - River samples: weekly concentrations reported in ng/L; additional late-pandemic/inter-pandemic points on 15 March 2010 and 11 May 2011.
  - WWTP samples: hourly concentrations in µg/L over a 24-hour period on 10–11 November 2009; additional point on 11 May 2011.
  - Sampling approaches: grab river samples (1 L bottles) and time-proportional composite wastewater samples (750 mL) stored at -80°C until analysis.

- Chemical analysis and quality considerations
  - Analytes quantified via on-line SPE/LC-MS/MS by Department of Chemistry, Umeå University (June 2010–June 2011).
  - Method described in detail in Khan et al. (2012); data quality assurance implied through established analytical protocol.

- Data files and formats
  - RiverSamplingLocations.csv: location information for all 21 river sites, including Location ID, name, and coordinates (Eastings/Northings).
  - River_PharmaConcentrations.csv: concentrations (ng/L) of all analytes at each river location with Date, Location ID, Location Name, and analyte columns.
  - WWTP_PharmaConcentrations.csv: concentrations (µg/L) for all analytes at two WWTPs (influent/effluent), with Grid Reference, Date, Time, and Location details.
  - WWTPFlow.csv: influent flows (m3/h) at WWTPs with Location IDs, Date, Time.
  - RiverFlow.csv: river flows (m3/s) at 21 locations with Date and Location details.
  - All datasets are provided in CSV format and are designed to be opened in standard data analysis software.

- Methods and access
  - Detailed methods are described in the open-access publication: Intra- and Interpandemic Variations of Antiviral, Antibiotics and Decongestants in Wastewater Treatment Plants and Receiving Rivers. PLoS One 2014 (In Press).
  - Associated datasets and publication materials are intended to support transparent, reproducible environmental monitoring analyses.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a standardized, multi-site, temporally resolved dataset linking riverine and wastewater concentrations of pharmaceuticals, enabling assessment of environmental exposure during different pandemic phases.
  - Includes clear metadata (locations, dates, sample types, units, and measurement methods) to support data governance, interoperability, and traceability.
  - Highlights data structure that supports spatial-temporal trend analyses, cross-site comparisons, and integration into broader environmental health monitoring frameworks.
  - Demonstrates practical data management considerations for monitoring programs, including the need for data sharing, metadata completeness, and harmonized units across different sampling points.
