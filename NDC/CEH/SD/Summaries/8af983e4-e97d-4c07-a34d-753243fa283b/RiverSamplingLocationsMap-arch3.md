# THAMES CATHCMENT

## Overview
- A map listing pharmaceutical concentration sampling points in the Thames catchment and its tributaries.
- Sampling points labeled TC1–TC21 distributed across rivers including Thames, Cherwell, Windrush, Churn, Evenlode, Coln, Leach, Ray, Cole, Thame, Wye, Loddon, Whitewater, Blackwater, Wey, Misbourne, and Mole.
- Purpose implied: to illustrate the spatial distribution of monitoring locations for pharmaceutical concentrations in surface waters.

## Spatial Coverage and Data Details
- Main river and multiple tributaries are covered, indicating a network intended to monitor pharmaceutical presence across a broad catchment.
- Extent and geography presented via a map scale (0 to 40 km) for contextualizing distances between sites.

## Use for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates a structured sampling network design that can inform:
  - Selection of environmental health measures to scrutinise policy.
  - Decisions on monitoring approaches, data needs, and geographic coverage.
  - Planning for reporting outputs (reports, charts, dashboards) and stakeholder consultations.

## Data Management and Governance Considerations
- Highlights the importance of metadata, data provenance, and the ability to publicly share underlying data.
- Underlines potential barriers such as data access, data silos, and the need for data standardisation and governance to keep data current and usable.

## Relevance to Aims and Challenges of Monitoring Frameworks
- Aligns with aims to identify measures for evaluating policy and informing decisions by mapping where pharmaceutical concentrations are sampled.
- Illustrates common challenges for authors of monitoring frameworks:
  - Data availability and quality across sites.
  - Access and timeliness of data.
  - Silos and coordination between organisations.
  - Metadata adequacy and data transformation needs.
  - Governance processes to ensure data are stored, shared, and updated appropriately.

## Practical Implications
- For policy scrutiny: a spatially explicit basis to assess where monitoring data exist and where gaps remain.
- For future decisions: helps prioritise sites for new sampling, data collection, or enhanced governance to improve data usability and transparency.
