# THAMES CATHCMENT

## Overview
- A geospatial inventory listing pharmaceutical concentration sampling points within the Thames catchment.
- Displays multiple sampling points across a network of rivers (e.g., Cherwell, Windrush, Thames, Evenlode, Colne, Kennet, Loddon, Ock, Wye, Mole, Wey, Misbourne, Thame, etc.) labeled with identifiers such as TC1–TC21 and other TC codes (e.g., TC3, TC8, TC19).
- The representation includes place names and river names, suggesting a map-based dataset rather than a plain table.
- A scale bar indicates 0–40 km and a north orientation.

## Data attributes and structure
- Sampling point identifiers (TC1–TC21 and related TC codes) associated with various rivers and locations.
- Geographic context provided by river names and nearby towns/areas (e.g., Cherwell, Thames, Thame, Kennet, Loddon, Mole, Wey, Wye, Misbourne).

## Data quality, access, and metadata considerations
- The text implies a map layer with precise coordinates but does not include explicit coordinates or dates for each point.
- Represents a single snapshot (2013) with copyright/rights notes; may require verification or updating for current use.
- Potential gaps in metadata from the text alone include coordinate reference system, sampling dates, methodologies, units, and data update frequency.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Provides a foundational spatial framework for monitoring pharmaceutical concentrations across the Thames catchment.
- Helps identify coverage and potential data gaps across numerous rivers and sub-catchments.
- Highlights the need for robust metadata, accessibility, and ongoing updates to maintain a coherent, discoverable data asset.

## Next steps and considerations
- Obtain and review the full geospatial dataset to extract coordinates, sampling dates, methods, and units.
- Assess data currency (2013) and pursue updated versions if available.
- Integrate with complementary datasets (water quality, land use, demographics) to support policy, research, and decision-making.
- Establish data governance: metadata standards, data stewardship, discoverability, and access controls to support cross-network collaboration.
