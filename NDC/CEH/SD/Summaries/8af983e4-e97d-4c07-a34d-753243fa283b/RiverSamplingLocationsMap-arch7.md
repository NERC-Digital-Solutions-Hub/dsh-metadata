# THAMES CATHCMENT

## Overview
- GIS data product mapping pharmaceutical concentration sampling points within the Thames catchment.
- 21 sampling sites labeled TC1–TC21 distributed across multiple rivers and tributaries in the catchment.
- Rivers/areas referenced include Cherwell, Windrush, Churn, Thames, Evenlode, Ray, Coln, Leach, Glyme, Ock, Kennet, Lambourn, Enborne, Thame, Wye, Wey, Misbourne, Mole, Tilling Bourne, and Ver, among others.
- Map includes a distance scale (0–40 km) and river network labeling.

## Spatial Extent and Data Structure
- Point features representing sampling locations (TC1–TC21) within the Thames catchment.
- Geographic context shown via major rivers and catchment boundaries.

## Data Sources and Licensing
- © NERC (CEH). Contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown Copyright and database right 2013.

## Content Details
- Spatial arrangement centers on pharmaceutical concentration sampling across the Thames and its tributaries, with repeated river labeling and site codes to indicate locations.

## GIS Usage and Applications
- Suitable for environmental monitoring, spatial planning, and communication of sampling locations to policy teams, clients, or the public.
- Can be integrated with broader GIS layers (river networks, catchment boundaries, basemaps) for analysis and visualization.

## Data Quality and Considerations
- Limited metadata in the text (no coordinates, measurement values, or temporal data provided).
- Based on 2013 OS data; consider updating or verifying against current datasets.
- Ensure coordinate reference system alignment when integrating with other layers.

## Limitations
- Absence of precise coordinates, attribute fields beyond TC identifiers, and any concentration measurements.
- Temporal coverage and sampling methodology not described.
