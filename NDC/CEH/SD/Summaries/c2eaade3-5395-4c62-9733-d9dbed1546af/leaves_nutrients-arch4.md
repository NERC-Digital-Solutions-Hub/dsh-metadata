# AFEX Experiment

- Objective and scope
  - Full factorial nutrient addition experiment (AFEX) to study effects on litter chemistry and nutrient cycling in a tropical forest fragment system.

- Study location and climate
  - BDFFP/INPA AFEX site, about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
  - Plateaued topography (80–160 m a.s.l.), with small seasonal climate variation.
  - Average temperature ~26.7 °C; annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm; rainy season peak >300 mm/mo (Apr) and dry season <100 mm/mo (Jun–Oct).
  - Relative humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design
  - 8 treatments total: 7 nutrient treatments plus untreated control.
  - Full factorial structure covering nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations.
  - Four independent blocks, each with four replicate plots per treatment, totaling 32 plots.
  - Plots: 50 m x 50 m; central 30 m x 30 m area for measurements to maximize litter from target trees.
  - Plots distributed on plateaus with at least 250 m separation between blocks.

- Treatments and replication
  - Treatments include: N, P, N+P, Cations (K, Mg, Ca), N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations, plus Control.
  - Each treatment replicated four times per block (total 4 blocks).

- Plot layout and sampling area
  - Central 30 m x 30 m area within each 50 m x 50 m plot used for main measurements.
  - 32 plots across 4 blocks, enabling assessment of treatment effects across space.

- Nutrient application details
  - Rates applied per year (dry granules on soil surface, three applications per year, avoiding main dry season):
    - N: 125 kg ha^-1 y^-1 (as urea)
    - P: 50 kg ha^-1 y^-1 (as triple superphosphate)
    - K: 50 kg ha^-1 y^-1 (as K)
    - Ca: 50 kg ha^-1 y^-1 (as Ca)
    - Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 y^-1 (as Mg)

- Sample collection and analyses
  - Litter samples collected in August of 2017, 2018, and 2019; samples bulked by plot.
  - Analysis conducted at INPA soil and plants lab.
  - Macro- and micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations:
    - Nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al., 1989) for micronutrients, P, and cations.
    - Atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) for K, Ca, Mg (Anderson & Ingram, 1993).
    - Phosphorus measured by colorimetry and spectrophotometry.
    - Carbon and nitrogen contents determined with an automatic CHN analyzer (Nelson & Sommers, 1996).
  - Leaves not identified by species; leaf metrics represented as plot-level means (Metcalfe et al., 2014).

- Data structure and variables (Data spreadsheet)
  - Column A: N (plot number)
  - Column B: TRT (Treatment: 7 treatments + Control)
  - Column C: PlotID (Block 1–4 and Plot 1–8)
  - Column D: Year (collection year)
  - Column E: Month (collection month)
  - Columns F–K: Nutrient concentrations in litterfall leaves (Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P) with units mg/kg or g/kg
  Columns L–O: Nitrogen, Carbon percentages and masses (N.porc, C.porc, N..g.kg., C..g.kg.)
  Columns P–R: Lignin% (Hemice ll.porc, Cell.porc, Lignin.porc)
  - Leaves for each plot measured as litterfall; species-level resolution not provided.

- Lignin and cellulose analyses
  - Lignin and cellulose quantified using the acid detergent fiber (ADF) method with sulfuric acid treatment, followed by weight-based determination (Rowland & Roberts, 1994; Van Soest, 1963).

- Data governance and notes for data leaders
  - Data are generated from a structured, replicated, multi-year field experiment with clear treatment coding and plot/block identifiers.
  - Documentation includes detailed methodology for chemical analyses and a defined data dictionary for the main dataset.
  - Key considerations for data management: ensure consistent units across years, maintain metadata on sampling dates, treatments, and analytical methods; note plot-level aggregation and absence of species-level identification.
