# AFEX Experiment

- Location and site context:
  - Conducted in the AFEX project area within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), about 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (coordinates 02°25'00'' S, 59°43'00'' W).
  - Environment features: plateaus 80–160 m above sea level, steep slopes/valleys, tropical climate with low seasonal temperature variation, mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April; dry period Jun–Oct), humidity ranging 75–92%.

- Experimental design (AFEX Experiment):
  - Full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments: untreated control, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), cations (K, Mg, Ca), and all combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
  - Structure: 4 replicate plots per treatment, distributed across 4 independent blocks (minimum 250 m between blocks), totaling 32 plots.
  - Plot and sampling layout: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central 30 m × 30 m area designated for measurements to maximize likelihood that litter sampled comes from trees within the plot.
  - Nutrient application: dry granules applied three times annually; rates per year – N: 125 kg ha^-1 (as urea), P: 50 kg ha^-1 (as triple superphosphate), Ca: 50 kg ha^-1, Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 (as dolomitic limestone), K: 50 kg ha^-1 (as potassium chloride).

- Data collection and analysis of litter and nutrients:
  - Litter sampling: bulked by plot from litterfall collected in August of 2017, 2018, and 2019.
  - Laboratory analyses (conducted at INPA’s soil and plants lab):
    - Macro and micronutrients, secondary compounds: via nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989); cations and micronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS); total P by colorimetry and spectrophotometry.
    - Carbon and nitrogen: measured with automatic CHN analyzer (Nelson and Sommers 1996).
    - Leaves not species-identified; data represent plot-level means (Metcalfe et al. 2014).
  - Lignin and cellulose: determined using ADF-sulfuric method (Van Soest 1963; Rowland and Roberts 1994) with lignin by weight loss on ignition.

- Data structure and content:
  - Data spreadsheet components:
    - N: Number
    - TRT: 7 treatments and Control (note: described as eight treatments in text; table lists 7+1)
    - PlotID: Block and Plot identifiers (1–4 blocks; 1–8 plots per block)
    - Year: Collection year
    - Month: Collection month
    - Zn..mg.kg, Mn..mg.kg, Ca..g.kg, Mg..g.kg, K..g.kg, P..g.kg: nutrient contents in litterfall leaves
    - N.porc, C.porc: nitrogen and carbon percentages in litterfall leaves
    - N..g.kg, C..g.kg: nitrogen and carbon per unit mass in leaves
    - Hemicell.porc, Cell.porc, Lignin.porc: hemicellulose, cellulose, and lignin percentages in litterfall leaves

- Key considerations and notes for data use:
  - Leaves were not identified by species; data reflect plot-level averages, which is suitable for broad nutrient cycling analyses across treatments.
  - Central-area sampling design helps ensure litter originates from trees within the treatment plots, improving attribution of effects to nutrient additions.
  - The study spans three August collection years (2017–2019), enabling temporal comparisons of nutrient and structural (cellulose/lignin) composition in litter.
