# AFEX Experiment

- Location and context
  - Conducted in the AFEX project area of the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), about 80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil.
  - Site features plateaus (80–160 m a.s.l.), steep slopes and valleys; tropical climate with small seasonal temperature variation, mean ~26.7°C; annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm (peak >300 mm/month in April; dry period June–October); relative humidity 75–92%.

- Experimental design
  - Full factorial nutrient addition experiment starting May 2017.
  - Treatments: untreated control plus N, P, cations (K, Mg, Ca) and all combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations) for eight treatments.
  - Replication: 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart), totaling 32 plots (50 m × 50 m each).
  - Central sampling area per plot: 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter sampled from trees inside plots.
  - Nutrient application rates (dry granules, three times/year, avoiding main dry season): 125 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 N (urea), 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 P (triple superphosphate), 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 Ca, 20 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 Mg (dolomitic limestone), 50 kg ha^-1 yr^-1 K (potassium chloride).

- Sampling and chemical analyses
  - Litter sampling: bulked by plot using litterfall collected in August 2017–2019.
  - Analysis location: INPA soil and plants lab.
  - Sample processing: dried; ground (knife/ball mill); leaves and insect frass analyzed separately.
  - Macros/micronutrients, P, and cations: nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989); K, Ca, Mg, and micronutrients by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS); total P by colorimetry with spectrophotometry (Anderson & Ingram 1993).
  - Carbon and nitrogen: measured with CHN analyzer (Nelson & Sommers 1996).
  - Leaf species identity: not performed; leaf characteristics averaged at the plot level (per Metcalfe et al. 2014).
  - Lignin and cellulose: lignin and cellulose concentrations in litter via ADF-sulfuric method (Van Soest 1963; Rowland & Roberts 1994); lignin by weight loss on ignition (0–50°C) in a muffle furnace.

- Data management and structure
  - Data are organized in a spreadsheet with defined columns:
    - N: Number
    - TRT: Treatment (7 treatments plus Control)
    - PlotID: Block and Plot identifiers for littertrap locations
    - Year: Data collection year
    - Month: Data collection month
    - Zn..mg.kg, Mn..mg.kg, Ca..g.kg, Mg..g.kg, K..g.kg, P..g.kg: nutrient concentrations in litterfall leaves (various units)
    - N.porc, C.porc: nitrogen and carbon percentages in litterfall leaves
    - N..g.kg, C..g.kg: nitrogen and carbon concentrations in leaves (g/kg)
    - Hemicell.porc, Cell.porc, Lignin.porc: component percentages in litterfall leaves
  - Purpose: to quantify how nutrient additions affect litter chemistry and nutrient cycling over time.

- Relevance to monitoring and governance
  - Demonstrates a structured, policy-relevant monitoring framework: a clear factorial experimental design, standardized analytical protocols, and robust replication to attribute effects of nutrient inputs on litter chemistry.
  - Emphasizes data quality and comparability through established methods (Malavolta 1989; Anderson & Ingram 1993; Van Soest 1963; Rowland & Roberts 1994; Nelson & Sommers 1996).
  - Supports transparency and potential data sharing via explicit data schema and documented methodologies.
  - Shows integration of ecological measurements (nutrients, carbon/nitrogen, lignin/cellulose) to inform environmental health and nutrient cycling policies in tropical forest contexts.

- Considerations and potential challenges (in line with monitoring framework aims)
  - Data completeness and metadata quality are critical for verifying measurement standards and facilitating reuse.
  - Species-level variation is not captured (leaf identities not determined), which may affect interpretation of plant-driven responses.
  - Data transformation and standardization may be required to compare across studies or datasets.
  - Sharing underlying data and ensuring data governance (ownership, accessibility, updates) are needed to maximize policy-relevant utility.
