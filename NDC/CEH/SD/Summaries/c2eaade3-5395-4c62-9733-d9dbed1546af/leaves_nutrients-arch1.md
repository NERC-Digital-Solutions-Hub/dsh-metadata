# AFEX Experiment

## Overview
- Full factorial nutrient addition experiment (AFEX) initiated May 2017 in BDFFP/INPA, Amazon Brazil.
- Eight treatments including untreated control and combinations of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca).
- Focus on understanding how nutrient additions affect litter chemistry and potential ecosystem processes.

## Site and Climate
- Location: AFEX project area, BDFFP/INPA, ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Terrain: plateaus 80–160 m above sea level with slopes and valleys.
- Climate: average ~26.7°C; mean annual rainfall 1900–3500 mm; peak rainfall in April (>300 mm/month) and a dry period June–October (<100 mm/month).
- Relative humidity: 75–92% across the year.

## Experimental Design
- Full factorial design with eight treatments plus control; factors include N, P, and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations.
- Replication and layout: 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart), 32 plots total (50 m × 50 m each), with 4 replicates per treatment.
- Central measurement area: each plot’s 30 m × 30 m central area used to maximize sampling from trees inside plots.
- Nutrient application: manual on soil surface, three times per year.
  - N: 125 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as urea)
  - P: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as triple superphosphate)
  - Ca: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1
  - Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as dolomitic limestone)
  - K: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as potassium chloride)

## Sampling and Chemical Analysis
- Litter sampling: collected August 2017, 2018, and 2019; leaves and insect frass analyzed separately.
- Sample preparation: dried, ground (knife or ball mill).
- Analyses:
  - Macro and micronutrients, phosphorus, and cations via nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al. 1989); Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
  - Total P by colorimetry and spectrophotometry.
  - C and N contents using an automatic CHN analyzer.
  - Leaves not species-identified; leaf characteristics averaged at the plot level (Metcalfe et al., 2014).

## Lignin and Cellulose Analysis
- Lignin and cellulose measured using the acid-detergent fiber (ADF) method.
- Process: apply ADF detergent, then determine cellulose with 72% H2SO4, and lignin by weight loss on ignition (0–50°C).

## Data Structure and Variables
