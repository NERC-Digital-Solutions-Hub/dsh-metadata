# AFEX Experiment

## Overview
- Full factorial nutrient addition study conducted at the AFEX project area within BDFFP/INPA, about 80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
- Aims to understand how nutrient additions (N, P, and cations: K, Mg, Ca) affect litter chemistry and nutrient cycling in tropical forest fragments.

## Site and Climate
- Location: BDFFP/INPA, Amazon region; coordinates 02°25'00"S, 59°43'00"W; altitude 80–160 m above sea level.
- Climate: relatively small seasonal temperature variation; mean ~26.7°C.
- Rainfall: annual 1900–3500 mm with peak rains in April (>300 mm/month) and a dry period June–October (<100 mm/month).
- Relative humidity: 75%–92% across seasons.

## Experimental Design
- Date started: May 2017.
- Design: full factorial nutrient addition with eight treatments plus untreated control.
- Nutrients: Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and cations (K, Mg, Ca) and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- Replication and layout: 4 independent blocks (≥250 m apart) containing 32 plots (4 replicates per treatment; 8 treatments total).
- Plot dimensions: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m to maximize litter sampling from trees within the plots.
- Application: nutrients applied manually as dry granules, three times per year (avoiding main dry season) at rates:
  - N: 125 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as urea)
  - P: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as triple superphosphate)
  - Ca: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1
  - Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as dolomitic limestone)
  - K: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (as potassium chloride)

## Sample Collection and Analysis
- Litter samples: bulked by plot using litterfall collected in August of 2017, 2018, and 2019.
- Processing: samples dried, ground (knife and/or ball mill) for analysis; leaves and insect frass analyzed separately.
- Species: leaves not identified by species; plot-level means used for values.
- Macros, micronutrients, and other components analyzed using standard lab procedures:
  - Micronutrients, P, and cations: nitroperchloric digestion (Malavolta et al., 1989).
  - Bases (K, Ca, Mg) and micronutrients: atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS).
  - Total P: colorimetry and spectrophotometry.
  - C and N: automatic CHN analyzer (Nelson & Sommers, 1996).

## Chemical Analyses of Lignin and Cellulose
- Lignin and cellulose in litter determined by the acid-detergent fiber (ADF) method with sulfuric acid.
- Process: ADF for fiber, then cellulose determined after 72% H2SO4; lignin by weight loss on ignition (0–50°C) in a furnace.

## Data Management and Structure
- Data collection spreadsheet includes:
  - N (plot number), TRT (treatment), PlotID (block and plot), Year, Month.
  - Nutrient metrics for litterfall leaves: Zn, Mn, Ca, Mg, K, P (concentrations in appropriate units).
  - Nutrient percentages: N.porc, C.porc.
  - N, C in g.kg^-1; Hemicell.porc, Cell.porc, Lignin.porc.
- Data are generated to support standardized outputs (e.g., environmental nutrient status) and stored for sharing through appropriate portals.

## Outputs and Relevance for Environmental Monitoring
- Produces standardized datasets on how nutrient additions alter litter chemistry and carbon/nutrient cycling.
- Results can inform assessments of environmental health and policy performance over time by providing comparable, plot-level indicators of litter nutrient status and structural components (lignin, cellulose).

## Data Quality, Access, and Collaboration Challenges
- Challenge: increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use outputs).
- Challenge: enabling broad access to underlying data used to produce final outputs, supporting transparency and reuse.
