# Temporal variation in temperature and light availability in the Hampshire Avon, United Kingdom  [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- Data describe temporal variation in temperature (°C) and light (Lux) across six streams that feed the Hampshire Avon.
- Collected as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project to understand lateral exchange and seaward flux of C, N, and P.
- Streams reflect contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk) and a gradient in base flow index.
- Data were gathered to support environmental monitoring and analysis by researchers from the River Communities Group and Queen Mary University of London.

## Data collection and instrumentation
- Measurements taken using Onset HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light UA-002-64 data loggers.
- Loggers tethered to the bed of each stream.
- Calibration performed by the manufacturer.
- Recording frequency: every 15 minutes; loggers remained in place for the study duration.
- Breaks in data occur due to data downloads or logger loss/malfunction.
- Data and site details used by project partners for the Macronutrient Cycles study.

## Variables and timing
- Variables: temperature (°C) and light (Lux).
- Temperature accuracy: ±0.53°C from 0 to 50°C.
- Time accuracy: ±1 minute per month at 25°C.
- Light specification: sensors respond to 200–1200 nm; 60% response 500–1100 nm; 100% response at 900 nm.
- Full device details and calibration guidance available in the HOBO UA-002-xx manual.

## Data quality and gaps
- Data quality supported by manufacturer calibration; time accuracy may have minor variability due to logging intervals and device performance.
- Breaks in data due to downloads or potential/logger malfunctions, leading to incomplete time series for some sites.
- Data are suited for standardised environmental monitoring and cross-site comparisons within the Macronutrient Cycles framework.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, site-specific temperature and light profiles across streams with varied geology.
- Enables assessment of temporal environmental health indicators and policy-relevant trends in aquatic conditions.
- Data management practices ensured (calibration, documentation, and storage) to facilitate reuse and integration into broader monitoring portals.
