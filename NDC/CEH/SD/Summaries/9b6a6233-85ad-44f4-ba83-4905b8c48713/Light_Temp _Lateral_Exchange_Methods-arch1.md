Temporal variation in temperature and light availability in the Hampshire Avon, United Kingdom  [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- Data describing temporal variation in temperature (°C) and light (Lux) in six streams that are tributaries of the Hampshire Avon.
- Collected by the River Communities Group, Queen Mary University of London, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project (NE/J012106/1).
- Dr John Iwan Jones (QMUL) was Co-Investigator with overall responsibility for data collection.

## Instrumentation and Calibration
- Instruments: Onset HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light UA-002-64 data loggers.
- Calibration: Per manufacturer.
- Temperature accuracy: ±0.53°C (0–50°C).
- Time accuracy: ±1 minute per month at 25°C.
- Light range/response: 200–1200 nm; 60% response 500–1100 nm; 100% response 900 nm.

## Study Sites and Geology
- Six streams monitored, representing contrasting geology: clay, greensand sandstone, and chalk.
- Loggers tethered to the bed of each stream; data used across project partners.
- Site details:
  - AS1, River Sem, Priors Farm (ST8916428436)
  - AS2, River Sem, Share Farm (ST9234327392)
  - GA1, River East Avon, Marden (SU0973457808)

## Data Collection Details
- Recording frequency: every 15 minutes.
- Duration: loggers remained in situ for the entire data set.
- Data gaps: breaks occur due to data downloads or occasional loss/malfunction of loggers.
