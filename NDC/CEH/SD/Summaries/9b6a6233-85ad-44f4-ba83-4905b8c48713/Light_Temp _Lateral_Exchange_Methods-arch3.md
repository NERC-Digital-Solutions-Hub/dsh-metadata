# Temporal variation in temperature and light availability in the Hampshire Avon, United Kingdom  [Macronutrient Cycling].

- Overview
  - Data collected by the River Communities Group, Queen Mary University of London, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project titled “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1).
  - Dr John Iwan Jones (QMUL) was Co-Investigator with overall responsibility for data collection.

- What was measured
  - Temperature (°C) and light (Lux) using Onset HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light UA-002-64 loggers.
  - Loggers tethered to the bed of six streams, all tributaries of the Hampshire Avon, covering catchments with contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk).
  - Sampling interval set to every 15 minutes; loggers remained in place for the full data collection period.
  - Breaks in data due to data downloads or logger malfunction.

- Instrumentation and calibration
  - Instrument model: HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light UA-002-64.
  - Manufacturer calibration: Temperature accuracy ±0.53°C (0–50°C); Time accuracy ±1 minute per month at 25°C; Light sensor specifications (200–1200 nm, 60% response 500–1100 nm, 100% response 900 nm).
  - Calibration and reference details available in the UA-002-xx manual ( www.onsetcomp.com ).

- Data quality and management considerations
  - In situ data collection with explicit expectations of sensor accuracy and logging interval.
  - Gaps occur due to data downloads or logger malfunctions, indicating potential limitations for continuous time-series analyses.
  - Metadata included (site, location, grid references, durations) to support data verification and reuse.

- Relevance to the Macronutrient Cycles project
  - Provides high-frequency environmental context (temperature and light) across streams with varied geology and baseflow characteristics, informing understanding of how environmental conditions influence nutrient cycling and lateral exchange processes.
