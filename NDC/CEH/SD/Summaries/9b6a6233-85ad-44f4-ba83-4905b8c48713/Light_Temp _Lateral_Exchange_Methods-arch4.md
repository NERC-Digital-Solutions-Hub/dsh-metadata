# Temporal variation in temperature and light availability in the Hampshire Avon, United Kingdom  [Macronutrient Cycling]

## Overview
- Document describes a data collection effort by the River Communities Group, Queen Mary University of London, as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project on lateral exchange and seaward flux of C, N, P.
- Focuses on measurements of temperature and light in six streams tributary to the Hampshire Avon, reflecting contrasting geology and baseflow conditions.

## Data collected and variables
- Variables: temperature (°C) and light (Lux).
- Measurements taken with HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light data loggers (UA-002-64).
- Data logged every 15 minutes; loggers remained in situ for the study duration.
- Calibration and performance details:
  - Loggers calibrated by the manufacturer.
  - Temperature accuracy: ±0.53°C (0–50°C).
  - Time accuracy: ±1 minute per month at 25°C.
  - Light specifications: 200–1200 nm, 60% response 500–1100 nm, 100% response 900 nm.
- Full calibration and device details referenced to the HOBO Pendant Data Logger Manual.

## Instrumentation and data quality
- Data quality considerations include potential breaks due to data downloads or logger loss/malfunction.
- Data management expectations include documentation of format, quality, metadata, discoverability, and updates as part of good data assets practice.

## Study sites and timeline
- Six monitored sites across streams with different catchment geology and baseflow indices:
  - AS1 (River Sem; Priors Farm) — Grid Ref ST8916428436; Start 13/02/2013; End 20/05/2014; 461 days.
  - AS2 (River Sem; Share Farm) — Grid Ref ST9234327392; Start 05/02/2013; End 01/12/2014; 664 days.
  - GA1 (River East Avon; Marden) — Grid Ref SU0973457808; Start 08/02/2013; End 19/05/2014; 465 days.
  - GN2 (River Nadder; Share Farm) — Grid Ref ST9235527364; Start 05/02/2013; End 01/12/2014; 664 days.
  - CE1 (River Ebble; Stoke Farthing) — Grid Ref SU0567225325; Start 06/02/2013; End 19/05/2014; 467 days.
  - CW2 (River Wylye; Brixton Deverill) — Grid Ref SU1723143894; Start 07/02/2013; End 16/10/2013; 222 days.

## Context within the broader project
- Data contribute to the project’s objective of understanding lateral exchange and its modulation of C, N, and P fluxes from streams to the seaward zone.
- The dataset is part of a multi-partner effort and intended to support cross-institution analysis and collaboration.

## Implications for data management and use
- The dataset includes essential metadata (site names, grid references, start/end dates, durations) enabling discoverability and reuse.
- Given the noted data breaks and potential calibration considerations, users should account for temporal gaps and instrument-specific limitations when analyzing temporal patterns.
- Data assets are managed with attention to format, quality, metadata, discoverability, and updates, aligning with best practices for data stewardship in a collaborative research context.
