# Temporal variation in temperature and light availability in the Hampshire Avon, United Kingdom  [Macronutrient Cycling]

- Overview
  - Dataset of temperature (°C) and light (Lux) measurements collected from six streams feeding the Hampshire Avon, UK.
  - Collected as part of the NERC Macronutrient Cycles project exploring lateral exchange and its role in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, and P.
  - Data gathered under the River Communities Group at Queen Mary University of London; Dr John Iwan Jones led data collection.

- Instrumentation and calibration
  - Measurements taken with Onset HOBO Pendant Temperature/Light UA-002-64 data loggers.
  - Logged data every 15 minutes; loggers calibrated by the manufacturer.
  - Temperature accuracy: ±0.53°C from 0 to 50°C; Time accuracy: ±1 minute per month at 25°C.
  - Light data: spectral characteristics specified (200–1200 nm; 60% response 500–1100 nm; 100% at 900 nm).
  - Breaks in data occur due to data downloads or logger malfunctions/loss.

- Sites and sampling details
  - Streams/sites and monitoring details:
    - AS1 (River Sem, Priors Farm) – Grid Ref ST8916428436 – Start 13/02/2013, End 20/05/2014 – 461 days
    - AS2 (River Sem, Share Farm) – Grid Ref ST9234327392 – Start 05/02/2013, End 01/12/2014 – 664 days
    - GA1 (River East Avon, Marden) – Grid Ref SU0973457808 – Start 08/02/2013, End 19/05/2014 – 465 days
    - GN2 (River Nadder, Share Farm) – Grid Ref ST9235527364 – Start 05/02/2013, End 01/12/2014 – 664 days
    - CE1 (River Ebble, Stoke Farthing) – Grid Ref SU0567225325 – Start 06/02/2013, End 19/05/2014 – 467 days
    - CW2 (River Wylye, Brixton Deverill) – Grid Ref SU1723143894 – Start 07/02/2013, End 16/10/2013 – 222 days
  - Site selection reflects a gradient of base flow index and contrasting geology (clay, greensand sandstone, chalk).

- Data quality, availability, and limitations
  - Data covers multiple sites and spans roughly 2013–2014, with some gaps due to downloads or logger issues.
  - Site metadata (location, grid reference) and temporal coverage are documented to support interpretation and cross-site comparisons.
  - Data are used by project partners and should be handled with attention to calibration, sampling interval, and any breaks in series.

- Project context and provenance
  - Part of the project “The role of lateral exchange in modulating the seaward flux of C, N, P” (NE/J012106/1).
  - Co-investigator: Dr. John Iwan Jones (QMUL); data collection overseen by the River Communities Group at QMUL.

- Data governance and sharing considerations for Data Stewards
  - Ensure complete metadata: instrument type, calibration details, sampling interval, site descriptions, grid references, start/end dates, and data gaps.
  - Maintain provenance: connect data to the Macronutrient Cycles project and the NERC grant reference.
  - Prepare data for upload to relevant portals; document any data processing, cleaning, or transformations performed.
  - Plan for updates or additions if additional data become available; clearly note any embargoes or sharing restrictions (none stated here, but monitor for updates).
  - Provide guidance on interpreting data across sites with differing geology and base flow indices; include caveats regarding data breaks.

- Practical takeaways for reuse
  - Suitable for analyses of temporal variability in temperature and light in small stream environments across geologic gradients.
  - Useful as a baseline or comparative component within studies of nutrient cycling and lateral exchanges in river networks.
  - Metadata-rich description supports reproducibility and cross-study integration.
