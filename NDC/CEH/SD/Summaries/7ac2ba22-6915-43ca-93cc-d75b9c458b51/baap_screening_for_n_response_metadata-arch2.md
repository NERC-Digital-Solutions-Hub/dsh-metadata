- Aim
  - Assess rice cultivar responses to nitrogen treatments over 6 weeks to identify high nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) lines and support QTL and candidate gene discovery.

- Location and timeframe
  - School of Biological Sciences, University of Aberdeen, UK
  - September–October 2020

- Personnel and supervision
  - Researchers: Yehia Hazzazi, Aadil Tantray
  - Supervisors: Adam Price, Gareth Norton

- Genetic material and data context
  - 229 cultivars from the Bengal and Assam Association Panel (BAAP) of rice
  - BAAP linked to a large SNP marker database (≈2 million markers)

- Experimental design and materials
  - Growth medium: equal-volume soil/sand mix (Insch soil + builder’s sand)
  - Containers: internal dimensions 160 cm x 70 cm x 27 cm; 600 kg soil/sand per container
  - Growth conditions: controlled environment room; 28°C day/25°C night; ~400 μmol m^-2 s^-1 PAR; 12 h light; humidity >50%
  - Layout: 23 x 10 grid; two seeds per genotype, thinned to one plant; 230 genotypes per box; four replicates per treatment
  - Treatments: 0% N (0N) and 100% N (100N)
    - 100N: 16.12 g urea per box to simulate 40 kg N ha^-1, with first split of a typical field application (Bangladesh context); first two weeks  moist and aerobic, then flooded to ~5 cm
  - Replication and data handling: replicate 1 of the 100N treatment excluded due to a leak causing environmental differences

- Measurements and harvest
  - Weekly measurements starting two weeks after sowing:
    - Plant height (cm)
    - Tillers per plant (count)
    - Nitrogen Balance Index (NBI) from Dualex
    - Chlorophyll content (ChI) from Dualex
  - Harvest at 6 weeks:
    - Shoot dry weight (g)

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Plant height: cm (from soil to tip of tallest leaf)
  - Tillers: count (no unit)
  - NBI and ChI: unitless
  - Shoot biomass: g (dry weight)

- Data collection, structure, and quality control
  - Data files: BAAP_Screen_Aberdeen_0N.csv (0N) and BAAP_Screen_Aberdeen_100N.csv (100N)
  - Structure: 11 columns
    - Replicate, Treatment, BAAP ID, BAAP name, X, Y, and five trait data columns
  - Quality control: initial data checked with Minitab for outliers/unusual observations; corrections only for data-entry errors
  - Notes: First two columns include replicate and treatment; X/Y provide spatial coordinates within the experimental layout

- Data content details
  - 0N and 100N datasets include raw trait values for each plant
  - Descriptions and unit notes are provided for each trait
  - Means for traits are reported in the dataset descriptions

- Funding and references
  - Funding: UK-funded GCRF project “South Asia Nitrogen Hub”; YH and AT support
  - Related work: Norton et al. (2018) BAAP GWAS paper

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
  - Demonstrates standardized data collection and analysis of plant responses to nutrient stress, enabling cross-study comparisons
  - Provides well-documented, citable datasets suitable for integration with other environmental and agronomic data
  - Highlights emphasis on data quality, traceability, and potential data sharing through appropriate data portals and repositories
  - Supports broader insights into nutrient management, NUE, and cultivar performance under varying nitrogen regimes, informing sustainable agricultural policies.
