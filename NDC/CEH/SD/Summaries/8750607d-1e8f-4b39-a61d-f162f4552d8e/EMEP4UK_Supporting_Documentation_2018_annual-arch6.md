# European Monitoring and Evaluation Program Model for the UK (EMEP4UK) annual surface resistance based atmospheric deposition for 2018

- Dataset scope: Provides the annual total surface resistance based atmospheric deposition for the UK in 2018, produced with EMEP4UK model rv4.36 and WRF v4.2.2.
- Models and domain: 
  - Atmospheric chemistry transport model (ACTM) derived from EMEP MSC-W rv4.36.
  - 3D meteorology from WRF v4.2.2 with 1°x1° reanalysis nudging every 6 hours (NCEP/NCAR GFS).
  - Model domain covers EU at 27×27 km2 with a nested UK domain at 3×3 km2; only UK results provided.
- Emissions data:
  - UK emissions (NOx, NH3, SO2, primary PM2.5, primary PMcoarse, CO, NMVOCs) from 2019 NAEI, rescaled to 2018.
  - Non-UK emissions from CEIP at 0.1°×0.1°; UK total used for 2018.
- Data outputs and formats:
  - NetCDF files with surface concentration and deposition fields.
  - Key variables include:
    - Area_Grid_km2 (grid area in km2)
    - DDEP_SOX_m2Grid (dry deposition of oxidised sulphur, area weighted)
    - DDEP_SOX_m2Conif, DDEP_SOX_m2Seminat, DDEP_SOX_m2Water_D, DDEP_SOX_m2Decid, DDEP_SOX_m2Crops (deposition to conifer, semi-natural, water, deciduous, crops)
    - DDEP_OXN_m2Grid, DDEP_OXN_m2Conif, DDEP_OXN_m2Seminat, DDEP_OXN_m2Water_D, DDEP_OXN_m2Decid, DDEP_OXN_m2Crops (oxidised nitrogen)
    - DDEP_RDN_m2Grid, DDEP_RDN_m2Conif, DDEP_RDN_m2Seminat, DDEP_RDN_m2Water_D, DDEP_RDN_m2Decid, DDEP_RDN_m2Crops (reduced nitrogen)
  - Units: area in km2; dry deposition in mgS/m2 or mgN/m2 depending on species and category.
- Data structure and usage guidance:
  - Data projected on a polar stereographic grid.
