# Vegetation work

- This document outlines field procedures to quantify vegetation composition, biomass, and associated soil properties for GIS-ready data products. Data are collected at quadrat and site scales to support spatial visualization of species, biodiversity, and soil characteristics.

## Quadrat-based vegetation metrics
- Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimates of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs summed across quadrats.
- Biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed; summed to yield site-level biomass (g m^-2).
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).

## Soil moisture and PAR
- Soil moisture and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate using WET sensors and PAR sensors (Skye Instruments, UK).

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
- Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density measured from two cores per site at 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## pH
- pH determined by mixing 5 g of fresh soil with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio; measured with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5.0 g of fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; post-drying weight used to calculate moisture content as a proportion of wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl, shaken 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4 and NO3) via autoanalyser.
- A second 5 g sample incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m^-2 d^-1).

## Microbial biomass
- Fumigation-extraction: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator for 24 hours; unfumigated control prepared.
- Nutrient extraction with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken 30 minutes; filtered and analyzed for DIN and dissolved PO4.
- Dissolved carbon measured with TOC-L at corresponding dilutions.
- Values adjusted for water content; KEc (0.35) or KEN (0.54) correction factors applied for extraction efficiency.

## Particle Size
- Particle size distribution determined by sieving through >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm sequences.
