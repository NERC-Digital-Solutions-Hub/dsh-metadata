# Parsonage Down experiment

## Aim
- Investigate how different plant functional groups affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling.
- Examine how applying different herbicides to shift plant communities influences carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Use a combination of hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying to create distinct plant communities on species-rich grassland and compare resulting soil processes.

## Experimental design and treatments
- Two experiments:
  - Experiment 1: Main focus on plant functional groups and carbon/nutrient cycling.
  - Experiment 2: Herbicide-driven alteration of plant communities to assess impacts on carbon/nutrient cycling.
- Design for Experiment 1:
  - Field laid out as a grid with multiple plots arranged to create all combinations of three plant groups.
  - Treatments replicated across the grid (six replicates per treatment).
  - Treatments created through a mix of weeding and selective herbicide application during 2013–2015.
- Data collected:
  - Measures of carbon and nitrogen cycling rates.
  - Associated soil microbial activity and other soil characteristics linked to plant community composition.

## Plant Groups and examples
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; long-lived or mixed lifespans.
  - Predictions: Higher soil carbon storage with roots potentially delivering carbon deeper into soil.
  - Examples: Sanguisorba minor (salad burnet), Daucus carota (wild carrot), Dactylis glomerata (cocksfoot).
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; smaller physical footprint.
  - Predictions: Limited carbon/nitrogen cycling activity due to smaller plant biomass.
  - Examples: Bellis perennis (daisy), Festuca rubra (red fescue), Primula veris (primrose), Thymus pulegioides (broad-leaved thyme).
- Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and fleshy leaves; fast turnover.
  - Predictions: Rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with high microbial activity; potentially lower long-term soil carbon storage.
  - Examples: Vicia cracca (tufted vetch), Avenula spp. (oat grasses), Ranunculus spp. (buttercups).
- A comprehensive species list by group is provided in the study documentation.

## Experiment 1 – Treatment structure
- Plots arranged to test single groups, pairwise combinations, and all three groups together.
- Replication: six replicates for each treatment combination.
- Setup details: a grid layout (7 across by 6 down) to host all combinations, with consistent replication across rows and columns.
- Treatments implemented annually through 2013–2015 via weeding and herbicide application.

## Experiment 2 – Herbicide Experiment
- Objective: Alter plant community composition using seven different herbicides and assess subsequent effects on carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Herbicides used:
  - 2,4-D: kills broadleaved weeds
  - Foundation: kills perennial broadleaved weeds and tree seedlings
  - Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
  - Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaved weeds
  - MCPB: kills broadleaved annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
  - Shield: kills perennial broadleaved weeds
  - Starane: broad spectrum of broad-leaved weeds
- Timing: treatments applied within the same experimental framework and timeframe (2013–2015) to evaluate impact on plant communities and soil processes.

## Timeline and data scope
- Weeding and herbicide treatments conducted across 2013, 2014, and 2015.
- Data collected focus on soil carbon storage, nutrient cycling rates (especially nitrogen), and microbial activity as influenced by plant group composition and herbicide-driven community shifts.
- Design supports cross-comparison of plant-functional-group effects and herbicide-induced community changes on soil carbon and nutrient dynamics.
