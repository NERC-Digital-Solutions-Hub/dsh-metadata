# Parsonage Down experiment

- Two connected experiments in species-rich grassland at Parsonage Down, conducted 2013–2015, to understand how plant community composition affects soil carbon and nutrient cycling.

## Experiment 1: Plant functional groups and carbon cycling

- Aim
  - Create different plant communities using a combination of hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying.
  - Test resulting carbon and nutrient cycling rates and relate them to plant-group characteristics.

- Plant groups (descriptions and expectations)
  - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
    - Prediction: High soil carbon storage; roots transport carbon deeper, making it less accessible to microbes.
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
    - Prediction: Limited carbon/nitrogen cycling due to smaller physical presence.
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; long-lived.
    - Prediction: Rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduction in long-term carbon storage as carbon is quickly mineralized.
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Experimental design
  - A grid of plots: 7 across by 6 down.
  - Across the grid, each plot represents a different combination of the three plant groups (a full factorial of three groups across seven treatments).
  - The arrangement is replicated six times (six rows), creating multiple replicates of each treatment.
  - The layout includes cross-plot mappings (FG combinations) and repeated arrangements to ensure replication (total plots in grid ~42, with replication across rows).

- Treatments and timeline
  - Treatments created via weeding and herbicide applications in 2013, 2014, and 2015.

- Data collected
  - Measurements of carbon and nutrient cycling rates associated with the manipulated plant communities.
  - Comparison of cycling rates to the functional-group characteristics.

## Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment

- Objective
  - Alter the plant community further using seven different herbicides to assess impacts on carbon/nutrient cycling through changes in species composition.

- Herbicides used
  - 2,4D: kills broadleaf weeds
  - Foundation: kills perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
  - Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
  - Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaf weeds
  - MCPB: kills broadleaf annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
  - Shield: kills perennial broadleaf weeds
  - Starane: broad range of broadleaf weeds

## Data handling and scope

- The study integrates field manipulation (weeding and herbicides) with measurements of soil carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Detailed species lists per plant group are provided in the dataset, including representative species and examples.
