# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site; visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs were calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per 1 m².
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated using Shannon and Weaver (1963).

## Measurements and data collected

- Soil moisture and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate using a WET sensor and a PAR sensor.
- Soil sampling: six samples per site, collected with a 4 cm width auger to a depth of up to 10 cm; soil passed through a 2 mm sieve; stored at 5°C until processing.
- Bulk density: from two cores per site; soils divided into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; dried at 80°C for 48 hours; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.
- pH: 5 g fresh soil mixed with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio; measured with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter (LE409 probe).
- Volumetric moisture content: 5 ± 0.001 g fresh soil dried at 80°C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as a proportion of wet weight.

## Data processing, calculations, and quality controls

- KCl extractable nitrogen (N) and potential mineralisation:
  - 5 g soil shaken with 25 ml of 1 M KCl for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) using an autoanalyser.
  - Moisture-adjusted DIN calculations: DIN mg/kg = (raw AA value × (water content of sample + extract volume) × dilution factor) / dry soil weight.
  - Incubation: 5 g soil incubated in 14 days at 25°C; extracted and analyzed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹).
- Microbial biomass:
  - 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator for 24 hours; unfumigated 5 g used as comparison.
  - Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken, filtered, and analyzed by autoanalyser at appropriate dilutions for DIN and PO4.
  - Dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L at the same dilutions.
  - Values adjusted for water content; KE (0.35) or KEN (0.54) correction factors applied for extraction efficiency.
- Particle size analysis: soil passed through sieves of >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.
