# Vegetation work

## Overview
- Random placement of four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats for field assessment.
- Visual estimation of species cover; calculating species richness and total grass/forb cover across quadrats.
- Biomass sampling by clipping, drying at 80°C for 24 h, weighing, and summing to yield g biomass per m².
- Calculation of Shannon's Diversity index (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).

## Soil moisture and PAR
- Soil moisture and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured in triplicate using a WET sensor and PAR sensor (Delta-T Instruments and Skye Instruments, respectively).

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm.
- Samples sieved to 2 mm to remove stones/roots and stored at 5°C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density determined from two cores per site (0–5 cm and 5–10 cm).
- Cores dried at 80°C for 48 h after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## pH
- Soil pH measured by mixing 5 g soil with 5 g Milli-Q water (1:1) and using a pH meter (Mettler Toledo FE20 with LE409 probe).

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 g fresh soil dried at 80°C for 48 h; moisture content calculated as a proportion of the wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g soil shaken with 25 mL of 1 M KCl for 1 h; filtrate diluted and analyzed for DIN (NH4⁺ and NO3⁻) by autoanalyser.
- Calculation adjusts for soil moisture to obtain DIN mg/kg.
- A second 5 g sample incubated at 25°C for 14 days; extracted and analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation: (NO3⁻ + NH4⁺) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² d⁻¹).

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator to lyse microbes; an unfumigated 5 g sample used as control.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 mL 0.5 M K₂SO₄, shaken, filtered, and analyzed via autoanalyser at appropriate dilutions.
- Dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L.
- Data adjusted for water content; extraction efficiency corrected using KE_C (0.35) or KE_N (0.54).

## Particle size
- Particle size distribution determined by sieving soil through >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm fractions.
