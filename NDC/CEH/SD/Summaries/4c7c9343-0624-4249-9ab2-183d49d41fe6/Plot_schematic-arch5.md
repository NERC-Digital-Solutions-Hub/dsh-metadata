# Parsonage Down experiment

- The study comprises two experiments focused on how plant communities affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling, with a second experiment examining how herbicides alter the plant community and related carbon and nitrogen cycling.
- Experimental work was conducted in a field with a species-rich grassland, using hands-on manipulation (weeding and herbicide spot spraying) to create controlled plant communities and to test different herbicide effects over time.

## Experiment 1: Main experiment - plant functional groups and carbon cycling

- Aim: Assess how different plant functional groups (PFGs) influence soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling.
- Experimental design:
  - Grid layout: 7 columns across by 6 rows down, creating a factorial arrangement of treatments.
  - Treatments: Each of the seven non-empty combinations of the three plant functional groups (FG1, FG2, FG3) placed across the grid. Combinations include FG1, FG2, FG3, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3.
  - Replication: The 7 treatment combinations were replicated across six rows, resulting in 42 plots in total.
  - Plot mapping: Detailed correspondences were established (e.g., Plot 1 FG2 = Plot 8 FG1, etc.), and plots were positioned across the field including a slope.
- Plant functional groups and predicted carbon implications:
  - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots, simple root structure, large leaves; includes species such as Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
    - Prediction: Higher soil carbon storage with deeper carbon inputs.
  - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; includes species such as Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
    - Prediction: Moderate carbon/nitrogen cycling activity.
  - Group 3: Big plants with shallow roots and large leaves; includes species such as Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.
    - Prediction: Rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with greater microbial activity; potential lower long-term carbon storage due to quick turnover.
- Measurements and timeline:
  - Carbon and nutrient cycling rates in plots, linked to plant group composition.
  - Field work conducted across 2013, 2014, and 2015 to establish and maintain the treatment communities.

## Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment

- Aim: Test how seven different herbicides shift plant communities and consequentially affect carbon and nitrogen cycling.
- Herbicides used (with target effects):
  - 2,4D: Broadleaf weed control
  - Foundation: Perennial broadleaf weeds and tree seedlings
  - Fusilade Max: Grass weeds (wild oats and other grasses)
  - Kerb: Blackgrass and other grasses plus broadleaf weeds
  - MCPB: Broadleaf annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
  - Shield: Perennial broadleaf weeds
  - Starane: Wide range of broadleaf weeds

## Data and data governance considerations (relevant to Data Stewards)

- Data types and structure:
  - Plot-level treatment data: FG combinations per plot, replication, and spatial layout.
  - Species data: Lists of species within each functional group, with representative examples provided.
  - Ecological measurements: Soil carbon stores, nutrient cycling metrics, microbial activity proxies, and other carbon/nitrogen cycling indicators.
  - Temporal scope: Multi-year data collection (2013–2015) alongside herbicide application events.
- Metadata and documentation needs:
  - Clear mapping between plots, treatments (FG combinations and herbicide applications), and replicate identifiers.
  - Protocol details for weeding, herbicide application, and measurement methods, including units and data collection intervals.
  - Species lists and group assignments should be standardized and versioned to support reproducibility.
- Data quality considerations:
  - Complex treatment structure with many combinations and replicates requires rigorous data validation and auditing.
  - Consistency in naming conventions for plant groups, species, plots, and treatments to enable reliable cross-plot comparisons.
  - Potential data integration across two experiments (plant-group manipulations and herbicide effects) and across multiple years.
- Challenges aligned with Data Steward archetype:
  - Managing a large, multifaceted field dataset with many systems and formats (plot-level treatments, species lists, and ecological measurements).
  - Ensuring timely data capture and updating across 2013–2015 to support ongoing analysis.
  - Keeping metadata and data dictionaries up to date to support discovery, reuse, and accurate interpretation by data users.
