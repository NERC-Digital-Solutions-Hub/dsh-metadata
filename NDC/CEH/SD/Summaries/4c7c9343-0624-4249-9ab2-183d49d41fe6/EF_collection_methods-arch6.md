# Vegetation work

## Overview
- Describes field sampling and laboratory analyses to quantify vegetation composition, biomass, and a broad suite of soil physical, chemical, and microbial properties across sites.

## Sampling design
- Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly per site.
- Data collected aim to support species cover, richness, biomass, and diversity assessments.

## Vegetation measurements
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species within each quadrat.
- Species richness per site calculated by summing quadrats.
- Biomass: clipped at ground level in each quadrat, dried at 80°C for 24 h, weighed; summed across quadrats to yield site total biomass (g m^-2).
- Diversity: Shannon's Diversity (Shannon & Weaver, 1963) calculated from species data.

## Soil moisture and PAR
- Soil moisture measured with a WET sensor; photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured with a PAR sensor (in triplicate).

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger, target depth 0–10 cm where possible.
- Samples sieved to 2 mm to remove stones/roots.
- Stored at 5°C until processing.

## Bulk density
- BD measured from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80°C for 48 h; BD calculated as mass/volume.

## pH
- pH determined by mixing 5 g fresh soil with water (1:1) and measuring with a pH meter.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5.000 g of fresh soil dried at 80°C for 48 h; moisture content calculated as a proportion of wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- Extractable N: 5 g soil with 25 mL 1 M KCl shaken for 1 h; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3–) by autoanalyser.
- Mineralisation: a second 5 g soil sample incubated at 25°C for 14 days; extracts analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation expressed as (NO3– + NH4+) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m^-2 d^-1).
- Results adjusted for soil moisture using site-specific water content and dry weight.

## Microbial biomass
- Fumigation-extraction method: 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform for 24 h; unfumigated control used.
- Nutrient extraction with 25 mL 0.5 M K2SO4; DIN and PO4 measured; dissolved carbon measured via TOC-L.
- Data corrected for water content; extraction efficiency adjusted using KE-C (0.35) or KEN (0.54) quotients.

## Particle size
- Distribution determined by sieving through >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm fractions.
