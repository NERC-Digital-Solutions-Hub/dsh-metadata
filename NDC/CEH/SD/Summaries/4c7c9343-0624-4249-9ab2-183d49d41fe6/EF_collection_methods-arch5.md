# Vegetation work

- Field design: Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site to assess vegetation.
- Vegetation metrics: Visual estimation of percentage cover per species; species richness; percentage cover of grasses and forbs; biomass measured by clipping at ground level per quadrat, drying at 80 °C for 24 h, and weighing; site-level biomass summed from quadrats; Shannon's Diversity index calculated (Shannon & Weaver, 1963).
  
## Soil moisture and PAR
- Measurements taken in triplicate using a WET sensor (Delta-T Instruments) for soil moisture and a PAR sensor (Skye Instruments) for photosynthetically active radiation.

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width auger, aiming to 10 cm depth; soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots; samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density determined from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths; samples dried at 80 °C for 48 h after sieving; bulk density calculated as mass/volume.

## pH
- pH measured by mixing 5 g fresh soil with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio and using a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter with LE409 probe.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5 ± 0.001 g of fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 h; post-drying weight used to calculate moisture content as a proportion of the wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g soil with 25 ml of 1 M KCl shaken for 1 h; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) by autoanalyser; moisture-adjusted DIN values calculated.
- 5 g soil incubated with Parafilm at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analyzed as above; mineralisation calculated as (NO3− + NH4+) × bulk density ÷ days (g m−2 day−1).

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g soil subjected to chloroform fumigation for 24 h to lyse microbes; a parallel unfumigated sample prepared.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken, filtered, and analyzed for DIN and extractable PO4; dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L; data adjusted for water content; KEC or KEN correction factors applied (0.35 and 0.54, respectively) to estimate microbial biomass.

## Particle size
- Particle size distribution determined by sequential sieving: >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.
