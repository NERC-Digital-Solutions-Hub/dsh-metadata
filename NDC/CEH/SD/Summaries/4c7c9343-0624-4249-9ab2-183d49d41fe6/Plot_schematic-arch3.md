# Parsonage Down experiment

- Objective and scope
  - Investigate how different plant communities and herbicide-driven shifts in vegetation affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling in a species-rich grassland.
  - Two interconnected experiments were conducted from 2013 to 2015 to manipulate plant communities and measure resulting carbon and nutrient dynamics.

- Experiment 1: Main experiment – plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Aim: Test how distinct plant functional groups influence soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling rates.
  - Manipulation: Create different plant communities using a combination of hand weeding and targeted herbicide spot spraying.
  - Plant functional groups
    - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots, simple root structure, large leaves (includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species).
      - Predicted outcome: Higher soil carbon storage due to carbon deposition deeper in the soil.
      - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata, among others.
    - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
      - Predicted outcome: Less impact on carbon and nitrogen cycling due to smaller physical presence.
      - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides, among others.
    - Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast growth and long-lived.
      - Predicted outcome: Very rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling with high microbial activity; potentially reduced long-term soil carbon storage.
      - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp., among others.
  - Plot design and replication
    - Field plots arranged in a grid of 7 across by 6 down.
    - All seven across plots represented every row with replications; treatments covered all combinations of the three plant groups.
    - Replicated six times across rows to ensure robust comparisons.
    - Treatments encoded as FG1, FG2, FG3 and combinations (e.g., FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3).
  - Timeline and activity
    - Weeding and herbicide application to establish treatments in 2013, 2014, and 2015.
  - Outcomes measured
    - Soil carbon stores and rates of carbon and nutrient cycling.
    - Characteristics of plant communities and their relations to soil processes.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Aim: Alter the plant community further using seven different herbicides to assess subsequent effects on soil carbon and nutrient dynamics.
  - Herbicides tested
    - 2,4D: Broadleaf weed control
    - Foundation: Perennial broadleaved weeds and tree seedlings
    - Fusilade Max: Grass and wild oat weeds
    - Kerb: Blackgrass and other grass and broadleaved weeds
    - MCPB: Broadleaved annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
    - Shield: Perennial broadleaved weeds
    - Starane: Broad range of broadleaf weeds
  - Implementation
    - Applied as part of the same overarching field experiment to shift plant community composition and assess subsequent impacts on carbon and nutrient cycling.
  - Timeline
    - Treatments implemented within the 2013–2015 experimental window.

- Data, governance, and reporting (implicit)
  - Data collection focused on carbon storage, carbon and nitrogen cycling rates, and plant community characteristics across manipulated plots.
  - Public sharing of underlying data and metadata is a consideration in similar monitoring efforts, though not explicitly detailed in this document.
