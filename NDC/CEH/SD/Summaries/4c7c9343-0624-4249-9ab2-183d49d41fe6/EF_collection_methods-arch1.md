# Vegetation work

- Four 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
- Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
- Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing the four quadrats.
- Biomass clipped at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield biomass per area (g m⁻²).
- Shannon's Diversity index calculated using the Shannon and Weaver (1963) method.

## Soil moisture and PAR
- Soil moisture measured with a WET sensor; photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) measured with Skye Instruments; instruments used in triplicate.

## Soil sampling
- Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm width auger to a depth of 10 cm.
- Samples passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
- Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

## Bulk density
- Bulk density measured from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
- Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; BD calculated as mass/volume.

## pH
- pH determined by mixing 5 g fresh soil with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio and measuring with a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter.

## Volumetric moisture content
- 5.000 g fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as a proportion of wet weight.

## KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
- 5 g soil shaken with 25 ml of 1 M KCl at 150 rpm for 1 hour; filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH₄⁺ and NO₃⁻) by autoanalyser.
- Extracts adjusted for soil moisture using a specified calculation.
- A second 5 g soil sample incubated at 25 °C for 14 days, then extracted and analyzed as above.
- Mineralisation calculated as (NO₃⁻ + NH₄⁺) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹).

## Microbial biomass
- 5 g soil fumigated with chloroform in a desiccator for 24 hours to lyse microbes; a second 5 g unfumigated sample used as control.
- Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K₂SO₄, shaken, filtered, and analysed for DIN and dissolved PO₄; dissolved carbon measured with TOC-L.
- Values adjusted for water content and corrected with KE (0.35) and KEN (0.54) factors to account for extraction efficiency.

## Particle Size
- Particle size distribution obtained by passing soil through sieves: >3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm.
