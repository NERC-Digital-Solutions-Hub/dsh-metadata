# Vegetation work

- Purpose in monitoring: assess vegetation structure and diversity and generate related biomass metrics to support environmental health assessments over time.

- Vegetation measurements
  - Four 50 cm x 50 cm quadrats placed randomly around the site.
  - Visual estimation of percentage cover for each species.
  - Species richness and percentage cover of grasses and forbs calculated by summing across the four quadrats.
  - Biomass sampled by clipping at ground level from each quadrat, dried at 80 °C for 24 hours, weighed, and summed across the site to yield g biomass per m².
  - Shannon's Diversity index calculated as per Shannon and Weaver (1963).

- Soil moisture and PAR
  - Soil moisture and PAR measured in triplicate using a WET sensor (Delta-T Instruments) and a PAR sensor (Skye Instruments).

- Soil sampling
  - Six soil samples per site collected with a 4 cm auger to a depth of 10 cm where possible.
  - Soil passed through a 2 mm sieve to remove stones and roots.
  - Samples stored at 5 °C until processing.

- Bulk density
  - Bulk density determined from two cores per site, split into 0–5 cm and 5–10 cm depths.
  - Cores dried at 80 °C for 48 hours after sieving; density calculated as mass/volume.

- pH
  - pH measured by mixing 5 g fresh soil with Milli-Q water in a 1:1 ratio and using a Mettler Toledo FE20 pH meter with LE409 probe.

- Volumetric moisture content
  - 5.0 ± 0.001 g fresh soil dried at 80 °C for 48 hours; moisture content calculated as a proportion of wet weight.

- KCl extractable N and potential mineralisation
  - 5 g soil mixed with 25 ml of 1 M KCl, shaken for 1 hour, filtered.
  - Filtrate diluted 2:1 and analyzed for DIN (NH4+ and NO3−) by autoanalyser.
  - A second 5 g sample incubated at 25 °C for 14 days; extraction and analysis performed as above.
  - Mineralisation calculated as (NO3 + NH4) × bulk density ÷ number of days (g m⁻² day⁻¹), with moisture adjustment.

- Microbial biomass
  - 5 g soil fumigated in a desiccator with chloroform to lyse microbes for 24 hours; an unfumigated 5 g sample used as comparison.
  - Nutrients extracted with 25 ml 0.5 M K2SO4, shaken, filtered, and analyzed for DIN and extractable PO4; dissolved carbon measured by TOC-L.
  - Values adjusted for water content; KE constants used to adjust extraction efficiency (0.35 for KEC, 0.54 for KEN).

- Particle size
  - Particle size distribution determined by sequentially passing soil through sieves (>3 mm, 2 mm, 0.05 mm, 0.015 mm, and >0.015 mm).
