# Parsonage Down experiment

- Aim and structure
  - Investigates how different plant functional groups affect soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling.
  - Includes a main experiment on plant groups and carbon/nutrient cycling, plus a herbicide experiment to shift plant communities.

- Experiment 1: Plant functional groups and carbon cycling
  - Approach: mixed hand weeding and herbicide spot spraying to create distinct plant communities on species-rich grassland.
  - Measured outcomes: carbon and nitrogen cycling rates and how these relate to the characteristics of the plant groups.

- Plant functional groups (descriptions and examples)
  - Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots, simple root structure, thin, large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
    - Predictions: high soil carbon storage with roots delivering carbon deeper into soil.
    - Examples: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
  - Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots; less physical footprint, potentially lower carbon/nitrogen turnover.
    - Examples: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
  - Group 3: Large plants with shallow, thin roots and large, fleshy leaves; fast carbon/nitrogen cycling.
    - Predictions: rapid microbial activity and carbon/nitrogen turnover, potentially lower long-term carbon storage.
    - Examples: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

- Plot design, replication, and treatment structure
  - Grid layout: 7 plots across by 6 plots down, creating 42 plots in total.
  - Treatment combinations: plots across used all combinations of the three plant groups; each row replicated six times.
  - Plot coding: various FG (functional group) combinations (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3, FG1&2, FG1&3, FG2&3, FG1&2&3) mapped across and down the grid with repeated replicates.
  - Field implementation timing: treatments established through 2013, 2014, and 2015.

- Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment
  - Seven herbicides used to alter plant communities:
    - 2,4D: kills broadleaved weeds
    - Foundation: kills perennial broadleaved weeds and tree seedlings
    - Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
    - Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broadleaved weeds
    - MCPB: kills broadleaved annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
    - Shield: kills perennial broadleaved weeds
    - Starane: broad range of broadleaved weeds

- Timeline and data focus
  - Treatments and data collection occurred across 2013–2015.
  - Primary data collected: rates of carbon and nutrient cycling in relation to plant community structure induced by the treatments.

- Data considerations for data leaders
  - The study involves a structured, replicated field design with a clear mapping between plots and plant functional groups, requiring careful data management of treatment assignments, plot identifiers, and year-to-year measurements.
  - Documentation of plant species within each functional group is provided, enabling traceability of community composition for data analyses.
  - Multi-year data collection (2013–2015) necessitates consistent metadata and versioning to support reproducibility and cross-year comparisons.
