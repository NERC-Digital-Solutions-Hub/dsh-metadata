# Parsonage Down experiment

## Aim
- Assess environmental processes by testing how plant community composition affects soil carbon stores and nutrient cycling.
- Use standardized field methods (plant manipulations, measurements of carbon and nutrient cycling) to enable comparisons over time.

## Experimental design overview
- Two concurrent experiments conducted on a species-rich grassland at Parsonage Down.
- Experiment 1 manipulates plant functional groups (via weeding and selective herbicide) to create different plant communities and then measures resulting carbon and nutrient cycling.
- Experiment 2 uses seven herbicides to alter plant community composition, enabling evaluation of how different weed-control strategies influence ecosystem processes.
- Treatments implemented across multiple plots with replication to enable comparison.

## Experiment 1: Plant functional groups and carbon cycling

### Plant groups
- Group 1: Deep, thick tap roots; simple root structure; large leaves; includes annuals, biennials, and long-lived species.
  - Predictions: high soil carbon storage; roots deposit carbon deeper in soil, less accessible to microbes.
  - Example species: Sanguisorba minor, Daucus carota, Dactylis glomerata.
- Group 2: Small rosettes with very small tap roots.
  - Predictions: lower carbon/nitrogen cycling activity; smaller physical presence.
  - Example species: Bellis perennis, Festuca rubra, Primula veris, Thymus pulegioides.
- Group 3: Big plants with shallow, thin roots and large leaves; fast turnover.
  - Predictions: rapid carbon and nitrogen cycling; high microbial activity; potential reduced long-term carbon storage due to quick turnover.
  - Example species: Vicia cracca, Avenula spp., Ranunculus spp.

### Plot design and replication
- Created a grid of plots: 7 columns across and 6 rows down.
- Across plots represent all combinations of the three plant groups; replication performed so each combination appears multiple times.
- Plot labeling and mapping described for consistent assignment of FG combinations (e.g., FG1, FG2, FG3 and their mixtures).
- Overall replication: treatments replicated six times within the grid; configurations repeated in different zones of the field (including bottom slope).

### Interventions and timeline
- Weeding and herbicide spot spraying used to establish desired plant functional group communities.
- Treatments implemented over the years 2013, 2014, and 2015.

### Data/outputs (focus)
- Measurements of carbon and nutrient cycling rates for each plant-group-based community.
- Comparison of cycling rates to the characterized properties of each plant group.

## Experiment 2: Herbicide experiment

### Herbicides used
- 2,4D: kills broad-leaved weeds
- Foundation: kills perennial broad-leaved weeds and tree seedlings
- Fusilade Max: kills wild oats and grass weeds
- Kerb: kills blackgrass and other grass and broad-leaved weeds
- MCPB: kills broad-leaved annual and perennial weeds (e.g., thistle, buttercup, ragwort)
- Shield: kills perennial broad-leaved weeds
- Starane: broad range of broad-leaved weeds

## Timeline and monitoring focus
- Both experiments were conducted with repeated applications and observations from 2013 onward to assess how plant functional group composition and herbicide-induced changes affect soil carbon storage and nutrient cycling.
- The study emphasizes standardized treatment application and replication to enable robust comparisons across treatments and time.
