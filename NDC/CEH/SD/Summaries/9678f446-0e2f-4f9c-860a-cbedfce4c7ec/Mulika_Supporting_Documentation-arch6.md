# Materials and Methods

- Purpose and setting: Ozone (O3) exposure experiment conducted April–August 2015 at CEH air pollution facility, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales, using wheat (Triticum aestivum L., cv. Mulika).
- Experiment design:
  - Eight solardomes (ventilated hemispherical glasshouses) used to impose O3 exposure profiles over 82 days.
  - Seeds: 40 per pot in 25 L pots with John Innes No.3 compost; density ~260 seedlings/m².
  - O3 treatments: four low-background with high midday peaks (max 36–115 ppb) and four high-background with small daily peaks (max 32–65 ppb); 24 h mean ranged 27–57 ppb.
  - Non-replicated design: no true treatment replication due to limited solardomes; pseudoreplication addressed in analysis with mixed models; random allocation of treatments to solardomes; climatic conditions monitored to be similar across domes.
  - Environment control: two air changes per minute with charcoal-filtered air; added O3 from oxygen; continuous monitoring with 30-min cycle O3 analysers; one solardome had continuous weather monitoring (temperature, PAR, RH).
- Watering and pest/dertilizer regime:
  - Drought treatments: well-watered, early-season drought (booting/flag leaf stages), late-season drought (late milk/early dough); each drought event lasted 10 days with one mid-drought watering.
  - Pests and fertilizer: fungicide for powdery mildew, aphids managed; three insecticide applications; fertilizer (ammonium nitrate) applied after anthesis.
- Measurements and timing:
  - Growth stages: assessed using the Tottman system on four dates (9 Jun, 30 Jun, 14 Jul, 27 Jul); maximum growth stage recorded per pot.
  - Chlorophyll content index (CCI): 523 measurements across 28 days using CCM-200 chlorophyll meter; calibration line applied to standardize measurements.
  - Stomatal conductance to water (gs): 318 measurements across 9 days using AP4 porometer; measured on the flag leaf during daytime; paired with soil water content (SWC) and CCI.
  - Harvest: 5–12 Aug 2015; separate straw and ears; fresh and dry weights recorded; grains threshed and weighed; data validated for anomalies.
- Data handling and quality:
  - Data entered into Excel; unusual values re-checked and re-weighed as needed.
  - Data linked to ozone exposure and watering treatments, enabling self-serve access to end users and potential dashboards or reports.

- Data provenance and usage notes:
  - Measurements are aligned with O3 dose concepts (DO3SE) and cultivar-specific parameterizations; data support potential model parameterization and cross-dataset analyses across growth, physiological, and yield responses to ozone and drought.
  - Datasets collectively enable exploration of relationships among ozone exposure, water availability, stomatal behavior, chlorophyll content, soil moisture, and final yield.
