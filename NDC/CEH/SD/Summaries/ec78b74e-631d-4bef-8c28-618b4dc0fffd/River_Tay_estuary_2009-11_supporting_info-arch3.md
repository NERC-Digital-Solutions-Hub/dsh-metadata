# River Tay estuary greenhouse gas and water chemistry data set

## Overview
- Describes greenhouse gas (N2O, CH4, CO2) and water chemistry measurements at 10 sampling locations along the River Tay estuary.
- Sampling window: April 2009 to July 2011 (publication Harley et al. 2015 covers April 2009–August 2010; the dataset extends to July 2011).
- Sampling locations arranged along the estuary from upstream to downstream (sites 1–10; within ~100 m of UK grid reference location).
- Data intended to support environmental monitoring, assessment of estuarine gas and nutrient dynamics, and informing policy decisions.

## Sampling regime
- Axial surveys of the estuary conducted from a rigid inflatable boat.
- Gas and water chemistry samples collected at each of the 10 sites, starting from the upstream high-tide point.
- Measurements taken in situ for physico-chemical parameters; samples collected in triplicate for laboratory analysis.
- Samples collected over the period April 2009–July 2011, with a focus on capturing spatial and seasonal variation.

## Sampling methods and analytical details
- In situ measurements: dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, temperature, conductivity measured ~10 cm below the water surface using a Hydrolab QuantaProbe (Hach).
- Water sampling: triplicate collection at each site using plastic buckets; filtration through GF/F 0.7 µm filters; samples stored frozen for lab analysis.
- Nutrients: total nitrogen (TN), dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN), ammonium ( NH4+ ), nitrate (NO3−) analyzed colorimetrically on a SEAL AQ2 discrete analyser; total suspended solids (TSS) determined by gravimetric method.
- Greenhouse gases: headspace method with 40 mL estuary water equilibrated with 20 mL ambient headspace; post-equilibration, samples injected into pre-evacuated vials for GC analysis.
- Gas analysis: N2O and CH4 measured by GC with electron capture detector (ECD) and flame ionisation detector (FID); CO2 measured on a separate GC; corrections applied for water temperature and salinity.
- Gas saturations: calculated as the ratio of dissolved gas concentration to atmospheric equilibrium concentration.
- Data handling: detailed procedural description provided in Harley et al. (2015) for methodological context.

## Nature and units of recorded values
- Missing data values marked with an asterisk in the CSV file.
- Data reported to two decimal places.
- Columns include: Date, Time (GMT), Site no. (1–10; upstream to downstream), Site name, Site Grid Ref, N2O-N (µg/L), N2O Sat (%), CH4-C (µg/L), CH4 Sat (%), CO2-C (mg/L), CO2 Sat (%), Temperature (°C), NO3-N (mg/L), NH4-N (mg/L), DIN (mg/L), TN (mg/L), pH, DO (mg/L), DO Sat (%), Conductivity (mS/cm), Salinity (ppt), TSS (mg/L).
- Provides explicit metadata fields (site identifiers, grid references) and a table detailing units per data column to support reuse and governance of the dataset.

## Data structure and provenance
- Data are organized around 10 fixed estuary sampling locations with corresponding site numbers and grid references.
- Time-stamped records including exact sampling date and GMT time.
- The dataset aligns with the sampling description and analytical methods reported in Harley et al. (2015), enabling cross-study comparability and trend analysis over the extended period.
