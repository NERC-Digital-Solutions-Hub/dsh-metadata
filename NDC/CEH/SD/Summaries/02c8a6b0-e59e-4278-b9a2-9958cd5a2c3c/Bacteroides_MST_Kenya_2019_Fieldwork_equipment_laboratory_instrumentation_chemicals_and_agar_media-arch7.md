# Fieldwork equipment

- This document inventories field sampling gear, laboratory consumables, instrumentation, chemicals, media, and general supplies for microbiological analysis and sample processing, with brand references and storage details.

## Fieldwork equipment
- Field sampling containers and PPE (e.g., sterile pots, wide-mouth HDPE bottles)
- Sampling tools (sampling pole, scoop spoon, sterile wooden spatulas)
- Protective items (nitrile gloves, masks)
- Sample containment and transport (plastic bags, cooler, ice packs)
- Biohazard handling (red lab disposal bags)
- Administrative and data capture (sampling proforma, writing board, pens, permanent markers)

## Laboratory consumables
- Glassware and storage containers (microscope slides, test tubes, Sterilin tubes, centrifuge tubes)
- Plates and supporting items (Petri dishes, grid dishes)
- Pipettes and tips (Eppendorf and generic pipettes, tips)
- Plates and media components for plating and culture (spread plate slicks, agar slits, culture loops)
- Anaerobic culture supplies (anaerobic sachets/flasks)
- General disposables and labeling supplies (racks, conical bottles with blue rings, labeling tape)

## Laboratory instrumentation
- Analytical and processing equipment (microscope, spectrophotometer, 4°C fridge, -20°C freezer)

- Sterilization and separation (autoclave, autoclave tap, centrifuge)
- Culture and counting (colony counter)
- Miscellaneous tools (wax crayons, Sharpies, rulers, pencils, rubbers)

## Chemicals
- Broad range of reagents for microbiology workflows (buffers, salts, acids, bases)
- Biological reagents and nutrients (BSA, tryptone, yeast extract, meat extracts, glycerol)
- Growth and selective media components (glucose, NaCl, calcium chloride, magnesium salts, bile salts, hemin)
- Antibiotics and selective agents (kanamycin, nalidixic acid)
- Storage and preparation solutions (NaOH solutions, sucrose, monohydrated L-cysteine)

## Agar media
- Media for targeted organisms and assays (intestinal enterococci, E. coli/total coliforms, somatic coliphages, BPRM phages)
- Specific formulations and components (Chromogenic Coliform Agar, Slanetz and Bartley medium, various peptones, yeast extract, Na2CO3, MgCl2, CaCl2)
- Brand references and preparation ingredients (Oxoid, Fisher, BDH; various supplements and media components)

## General
- Miscellaneous items supporting field and lab workflows (distilled water; Ringers solution)
- Disinfectants and storage/handling reagents (Virkon tablets, HCl)
- Antibiotics and selective agents (Kanamycin, Nalidixic acid)
- Common laboratory buffers and additives (NaOH, BSA, glycerol)
- Additional supply notes (cryogenic storage provisions, cryogenic tubes and boxes)

Note: The document specifies several brand names (e.g., Oxoid, Fisher, BDH) and storage requirements (4°C fridge, -20°C freezer, cryogenic storage) to ensure standardized preparation, labeling, and preservation of samples for subsequent GIS-based analysis and mapping of results.
