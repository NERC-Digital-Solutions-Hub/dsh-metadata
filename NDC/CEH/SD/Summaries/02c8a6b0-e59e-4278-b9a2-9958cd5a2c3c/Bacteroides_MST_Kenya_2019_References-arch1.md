## Overview
- Compilation of standards and research focused on detecting and tracking microbial indicators of fecal contamination in water.
- Emphasizes the role of standardized methods, particularly ISO standards, and the use of bacteriophages and Bacteroides-based approaches for source tracking and virus control.

## Standards and Methods
- ISO 7899-2 (2000): Detection and enumeration of intestinal enterococci by membrane filtration.
- ISO 10705-2 (2001): Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages; somatic coliphages.
- ISO 10705-4 (2001): Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis.
- ISO 9308-1 (2014): Enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria; membrane filtration for waters with low bacterial background flora.
- Methodological tools include membrane filtration, bacteriophage enumeration, and isolation of host strains for Bacteroides relevant to fecal source tracking.

## Key Concepts and Applications
- Bacteriophages as indicators of fecal pollution and the effectiveness of enteric virus removal (McMinn et al., 2017).
- Isolation and use of Bacteroides host strains to track fecal pollution sources in water (Gomez-Donate et al., 2011; Payan et al., 2005).
- Microbial source tracking markers and their relationships to human health outcomes (Harwood et al., 2014).
- Development of host-strain collections and media to improve detection and sourcing of fecal contamination (Livingston, 1978; Payson et al., 2005).

## Data and Practical Considerations for Analysts
- Standardization via ISO standards is critical for cross-study comparability and data quality.
- Data may be dispersed across journals, reports, and local datasets; access to host strains and detailed methodologies is important for replication.
- Methods require specialized laboratory capabilities; results must be contextualized with metadata and reporting standards to be usable for policy or management decisions.

## Data Gaps and Challenges for Implementation
- Potentially limited local-scale data and reliance on specialized sources.
- Access barriers to journals, reports, and strain collections; need for clear metadata and data sharing.
- Ensuring consistent application of ISO methods across laboratories to maintain data comparability.
