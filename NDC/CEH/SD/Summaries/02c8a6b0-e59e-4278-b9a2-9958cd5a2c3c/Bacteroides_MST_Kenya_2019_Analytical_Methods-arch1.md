# Experimental design/sampling regime

- The study adapted a previous method to isolate human- and cattle-specific Bacteroides spp. hosts from faecal material in rural Siaya County, western Kenya, due to the absence of typical facilities (municipal wastewater/slaughterhouses).
- Sampling sources:
  - Human: pooled faecal material from school pit latrines.
  - Cattle: pooled faecal material from cattle on shorelines of surface water sources.
- Location data:
  - GPS coordinates collected with handheld GPS (World Geodetic System); exact sampling locations listed in LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv.
- Sampling timeline:
  - Faecal samples collected on 7–8 June 2018.
  - Recovery and isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides hosts from human and cattle faeces occurred 10–21 June 2018 at KEMRI Kisian (Kisumu).
  - Detection of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and bacteriophages occurred on 18–21 June 2018; 5–8 November 2018; and 13 June 2019.

## Collection/Generation/Transformation Methods

- Ethical approvals:
  - University of Southampton Faculty of Social and Human Sciences (ref. 31554; date 12/02/2018).
  - Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI SERU/CGHR; ref. 091/3493; date 17/10/2017).
  - Participant information sheets and consent forms used for headteachers to permit sampling from school pit latrines.
- Sampling of faecal material:
  - Cattle: 25 g pooled sample from five fresh stools, collected from shorelines of 10 water sources; transported to KEMRI Kisian within ~4 hours, stored at ~4°C, and processed within 24 hours.
  - Humans: 25 g pooled sample from five pit latrines per school; consent obtained; sterile equipment and cleaning procedures used between samples; transport to KEMRI Kisian within ~4 hours, stored at ~4°C, and processed within 24 hours.
- Isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides spp. hosts:
  - Primary isolation on Bacteroides bile esculine agar (BBEa) with specified composition and pH.
  - Day-by-day workflow:
    - Day 1: Prepare 10 master faecal solutions from 25 g pooled samples; perform serial dilutions; plate on BBEa; incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 24 h.
    - Day 2: Select dark colonies; subculture on duplicate BBEa plates; incubate at 37°C for 24 h under aerobic and anaerobic conditions.
    - Day 3: Screen for Gram-negative obligate anaerobes; perform Gram staining; select appropriate morphologies for further processing.
    - Day 4: Inoculate isolates into BPRM broth; incubate overnight at 37°C; identify cultures with growth; mix with cryoprotectant (bovine serum) and store at -20°C.
  - Outcome: 10 new potential Bacteroides hosts were selected (5 from cattle; 5 from human sources). Host codes and origins include:
    - Cattle: SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8
    - Human: WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2

- Detection of Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) and somatic coliphages:
  - Water samples collected from drinking water sources in Siaya County and from KIWASCO wastewater plant influents/effluents; stored at ~4°C, processed within 24 hours.
  - FIB detection (total coliforms, E. coli, intestinal enterococci) following ISO 9308-1:2014 and ISO 7899-2:2000 using membrane filtration:
    - Sample volumes: 0.1, 1, 10, 100 mL (for surface water); higher concentrations for wastewater with dilutions 10^-2 to 10^-5.
    - Filtration onto 0.45 μm filters; subsequent plating on CCE agar for coliforms/E. coli and Slanetz and Bartley agar for enterococci.
    - Incubation: 24 ± 2 h at 37°C for coliforms/E. coli; 48 ± 2 h at 37°C for enterococci.
    - Results expressed as CFU per 100 mL; TNTC adjustments made by using smaller volumes.
  - Somatic coliphages:
    - Host: E. coli WG-5; preparation of inoculum to OD 0.33 at 600 nm.
    - Assay in semi-solid Modified Scholten’s agar (ssMSA); incubation at 37°C; plaques counted as PFU per 100 mL.
    - Positive controls included.

## Detection of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp.

- Phage detection hosts:
  - Human-derived GB-124 and Kenyan hosts (WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2; cattle-derived SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8).
- Phage recovery and assay setup:
  - Prepare host cultures to target OD 0.33 at 620 nm.
  - Use BPRMB for lytic phage recovery; prepare ssBPRMA for plaque assays.
  - Mix 1 mL water sample with 1 mL host culture in tubes containing 2.5 mL melted ssBPRMA; plate on BPRMA and incubate anaerobically at 37°C for 18 ± 2 h.
  - Enumerate plaques (PFU) as indicators of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp.
- Controls:
  - GB-124 reference phage as positive control; blanks and negative controls included in the assay setup.
