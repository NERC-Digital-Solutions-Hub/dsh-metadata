# Experimental design/sampling regime

- Study location and scope
  - Rural Siaya County, western Kenya; samples collected from human (school pit latrines) and cattle sources; shoreline cattle faeces near surface water sources; field work occurred in June 2018.
  - GPS coordinates recorded with handheld devices and stored in LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv; sampling dates: human and cattle faeces on 7–8 June 2018; isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides hosts at KEMRI Kisian labs between 10–21 June 2018.
  - Water samples collected from drinking water sources in Siaya and from a KIWASCO wastewater plant; sampling dates include 18–21/06/2018; 05/08–11/2018; and 13/06/2019. Locations and detected markers stored in DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv.

- Data and files generated
  - Location data: LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv.
  - Bacteroides host isolates: IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA.csv; IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepB.csv; IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA.csv; IsolationBacteroidesHostsweek17-6-18StepB.csv.
  - Faecal indicator bacteria and bacteriophage data: DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv.
  - Selected Kenyan Bacteroides hosts established from human and cattle sources; host codes listed (e.g., cattle: SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8; human: WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2).

- Sampling and collection methods (faecal)
  - Cattle: pooled sampling from five fresh stools per location (≈25 g total) collected from shorelines, stored in 100 mL pots with ice, transported to lab within 4 hours, processed within 24 hours.
  - Humans: pooled sampling from five pit latrines in primary schools (≈25 g total) using sterile tools, stored similarly, transported to lab within 4 hours, processed within 24 hours.
  - Pooling and labeling performed to create master faecal solutions for subsequent isolation.

- Laboratory processing and isolation of Bacteroides hosts
  - Primary recovery on Bacteroides bile esculine agar (BBEa) under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; selection for colonies that grow under strict anaerobic conditions.
  - Gram staining and morphological assessment to identify Gram-negative obligate anaerobic rods.
  - Subculturing on BBE and BPRM media; incubation at 37°C for 24 hours; selection of robust isolates.
  - Overnight cultures in BPRM broth, cryopreservation with bovine serum, stored in -20°C; ten new Kenyan Bacteroides hosts selected (five from cattle, five from human sources).

- Data capture and availability
  - Isolate data include host codes, faecal origin, and processing steps, captured in the specified CSV files.
  - Locations for sampling and detection sites documented in corresponding CSV files for downstream data integration and mapping.

- Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and bacteriophage detection (environmental samples)
  - FIB detection and enumeration follow ISO methods:
    - Total coliforms and E. coli: ISO 9308-1:2014; intestinal enterococci: ISO 7899-2:2000.
    - Method: membrane filtration onto coliform chromogenic agar and Slanetz and Bartley agar; results expressed as CFU per 100 mL; TNTC adjustments using smaller volumes.
  - Somatic coliphages
    - Host: E. coli WG-5; detection via plaque assays on Modified Scholten’s broth/agar; results as PFU per 100 mL.
  - Bacteroides phages
    - Hosts: human-derived GB-124 and Kenyan isolates (human: WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2; cattle: SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8).
    - Assay setup: Bacteroides phage recovery medium (BPRMB/BPRMA) with semi-solid media; incubation and plaque enumeration; positive controls with GB-124 phage.
  - Data outputs from these assays include CFU/100 mL for FIB, PFU/100 mL for somatic coliphages, and PFU for Bacteroides-infecting phages.

- Ethical approvals and consent
  - Approvals obtained from University of Southampton (ref: 31554; 12/02/2018) and Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI/SERU/CGHR/091/3493; 17/10/2017).
  - Participant information sheets and consent forms used for sampling from school pit latrines.

- Data management and quality controls
  - Field and laboratory instrumentation and reagents described in related sections; use of positive and negative controls (e.g., GB-124 phage) to ensure assay validity.
  - Samples stored under cold chain (4°C up to 24 hours) and cryopreserved for long-term use; comprehensive procedural details provided to enable replication.
  - Data structured in CSV files with explicit mappings to sampling sites, host isolates, and detection results to support downstream data exploration and self-service analysis.
