# References

- A bibliography of ISO standards and scientific studies focused on water quality testing, particularly microbial indicators and microbial source tracking using bacteriophages, Bacteroides, and related markers.

## What the references cover

- ISO standards for water quality testing:
  - ISO 7899-2: Detection and enumeration of intestinal enterococci (membrane filtration method).
  - ISO 10705-2: Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages (somatic coliphages).
  - ISO 10705-4: Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis.
  - ISO 9308-1: Enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria (membrane filtration for waters with low background flora).
- Research themes and tools:
  - Phages of Bacteroides as a potential tool for tracking viral waterborne disease control.
  - Isolation of Bacteroides bacteriophage host strains for tracking fecal pollution sources in water.
  - Microbial source tracking markers and their relationships to human health outcomes in environmental waters.
  - Development of media and methods for identifying Bacteroides fragilis group.
  - Bacteriophages as indicators of fecal pollution and enteric virus removal.
- Methodological and applied implications:
  - Host-strain selection and marker-based approaches to determine pollution sources.
  - The role of phages and microbial markers in environmental monitoring and risk assessment.
- Publication scope and timelines:
  - A range of sources from 1978 to 2017, highlighting evolving standards and tracking methodologies.

## Data implications for Data Leaders

- Standardization and comparability:
  - ISO standards provide authoritative methods that enable consistent data across organizations and networks.
- Data types and metadata:
  - Counts and detections of enterococci, E. coli/coliforms, bacteriophages, and microbial source tracking markers require careful metadata (sampling context, assay conditions, host strains, processing steps).
- Data integration and governance:
  - Combining data from standardized methods with host-strain and phage data necessitates cohesive data governance and metadata schemas.
- Access and collaboration challenges:
  - Potential barriers include paywalls and data access limitations, underscoring the need for coordinated data sharing and communities of practice.

## Practical actions for data governance

- Inventory and map data sources:
  - Identify which ISO methods and microbial markers are in use across partners to enable data integration.
- Define metadata standards:
  - Establish schemas capturing sampling details, assay methodologies, thresholds, and host strains for microbial data.
- Foster coordination and shared practice:
  - Promote collaboration among laboratories and organizations to reduce duplication and build a community of practice around microbial monitoring data.
- Prioritize data accessibility and usability:
  - Seek ways to improve discoverability and access to standardized methods and associated datasets to support public health outcomes.
