## Relevance to data workflows
- Enables standardized sample collection, handling, and processing to support reliable data generation.
- Provides essential materials for accurate measurement, culture, and analysis, contributing to reproducible data products and dashboards.
- Supports traceability and documentation through proformas, labeling, and standardized consumables.

## Observations and considerations for data management
- The inventory underpins field-to-lab data capture by supplying consistent tools and media, reducing variability.
- Consider integrating with a digital inventory system to track usage, lot numbers, and expiration dates, and to link items to specific data products or studies.

## Recommendations (for enhancing data use)
- Link each item to a data product or study in a catalog to improve traceability.
- Add expiration dates and lot numbers to the inventory and capture usage logs to support data quality and reproducibility.
- Ensure labeling and proformas are aligned with data collection workflows to facilitate self-serve data access for end users.
