# References

## Overview
- A collection of references on water quality detection and enumeration methods, primarily ISO standards and related research articles.
- Covers detection/enumeration of intestinal enterococci, bacteriophages (somatic coliphages and phages infecting Bacteroides fragilis), Escherichia coli and coliforms, and microbial source tracking markers.
- Includes methods such as membrane filtration and the use of specific Bacteroides bacteriophage host strains for tracking fecal pollution.

## Relevance for Data Stewards
- Highlights the need for standardized, citable methods to ensure data comparability across datasets.
- ISO standards provide authoritative method references to embed in dataset metadata for traceability and reproducibility.
- Supports provenance tracking by linking datasets to specific methods, organisms, and literature.

## Data Management Considerations
- Metadata should capture:
  - Method standard (e.g., ISO number and part)
  - Target organism or marker (e.g., enterococci, bacteriophages, E. coli/coliforms, Bacteroides markers)
  - Sample type and background conditions
  - Detection/enumeration technique and any deviations from standard methods
  - Limits of detection/quantification and quality control details
- Document data transformations, cleaning steps, and any normalization applied.
- Record data availability, embargoes, proprietary restrictions, and sharing permissions.
- Ensure datasets are uploaded to appropriate portals and cataloged with clear method references and literature links.

## Practical Challenges (from the Document)
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Timely submission of data from data creators.
- Aligning data with standards across many systems and formats, including older or non-interoperable databases.
- Managing large microbiological datasets and data from outdated databases requiring bespoke solutions.

## Actionable Recommendations for Data Stewards
- Promote and enforce adherence to ISO standards in data creation and reporting.
- Provide or implement metadata templates that capture ISO method identifiers, organisms/markers, and reference literature.
- Establish governance policies for embargoes, access rights, and data sharing limitations.
- Develop interoperable data pipelines accommodating diverse formats and legacy databases.
- Maintain up-to-date catalogs/portals with cross-references to ISO standards and related publications for discoverability and reuse.
