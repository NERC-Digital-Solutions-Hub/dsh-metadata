# Drinking-water under a "One Health" lens: quantifying microbial contamination pathways between livestock and drinking-water

## Overview and context
- Diarrhoeal disease and lack of access to safe water remain significant public health issues in developing countries.
- Growing concern about transmission of diarrhoeal infections from livestock to humans in rural sub-Saharan Africa, where people and livestock live in close proximity.
- The project aims to address drinking-water contamination risks through a One Health lens by developing or adapting low-cost bacteriophage-based Microbial Source Tracking (MST) techniques suitable for sub-Saharan Africa.

## Aims and approach
- Develop or adapt MST methods using bacteriophages to differentiate human versus animal faecal sources in water sources.
- Locally isolate novel Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle faeces in rural western Kenya to indicate contamination sources.
- Assess the geographical stability of Bacteroides fragilis GB124 as a human faecal contamination marker in drinking water sources in Siaya County, Kenya.
- Use the MST markers within bacteriophage-based approaches to evaluate drinking-water quality.

## Data types and markers
- Data on recovery and isolation of novel Bacteroides spp. strains from human and cattle faecal sources.
- Data on detected levels of bacteriophages capable of infecting the newly isolated Bacteroides hosts.
- Data on faecal indicator bacteria: total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and intestinal enterococci.
- Data on somatic coliphages.
- Data on bacteriophages capable of infecting Bacteroides fragilis GB124.

## Study sites and sample sources
- Rural West Kenya water sources.
- Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO).

## Data collection and authorship
- Data collection conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Mr. Kevin Ives.
- Data interpretation conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva.

## Relevance for environmental health monitoring
- Provides datasets for MST markers and phage indicators to assess human vs. cattle faecal contamination in drinking-water sources.
- Supports standardized analysis and reporting formats for environmental health assessments.
- Datasets are suitable for storage and upload to appropriate data portals, aligning with routine monitoring practices.

## Implementation and challenges (implied)
- Emphasis on validating the stability and applicability of MST markers across geographic locations within sub-Saharan Africa.
- Potential to enhance dataset value by integrating MST data with other environmental and health datasets, and by enabling broader data accessibility for stakeholders.
