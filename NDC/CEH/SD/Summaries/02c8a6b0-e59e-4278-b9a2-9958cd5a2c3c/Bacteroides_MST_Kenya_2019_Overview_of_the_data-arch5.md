# Overview of the data being described

- Public health context: Diarrhoeal disease and lack of access to safe water are significant in developing countries; the project applies a One Health approach to assess microbial contamination pathways between livestock and drinking water in rural sub-Saharan Africa.
- Research aim: Develop or adapt low-cost Microbial Source Tracking (MST) techniques using Bacteroides spp. as host markers to indicate human versus cattle fecal contamination in drinking water, with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa.
- Dataset purpose: Describe recovering and isolating novel Bacteroides spp. strains from human and cattle fecal sources to serve as MST markers for bacteriophage-based methods; evaluate their applicability in drinking water quality assessment.

- Dataset contents:
  - Novel Bacteroides spp. hosts isolated from human and cattle fecal sources in rural western Kenya, intended as MST markers for bacteriophage-based MST methods.
  - Detected levels data for:
    - Bacteriophages capable of infecting the newly isolated Bacteroides spp. hosts
    - Fecal indicator bacteria (Total coliforms, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci)
    - Somatic coliphages
    - Bacteriophages capable of infecting Bacteroides fragilis GB124
  - Sampling sites include rural West Kenya water sources and a Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO).

- Provenance and roles:
  - Data collection conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Mr. Kevin Ives.
  - Data interpretation conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva.

- Geographic and contextual scope:
  - Sub-Saharan Africa with emphasis on rural western Kenya (Siaya County) and Kisumu, reflecting locally relevant MST marker development for drinking water quality.

- Data governance and stewardship considerations (implications for Data Stewards):
  - Metadata needs: sampling dates, exact locations, sample types (water source, wastewater, fecal samples), host species, isolation methods, MST marker details, detection methods, and QA/QC procedures.
  - Data format and interoperability: standardize measurements (counts/concentrations, units), method names, and applicable detection limits; ensure compatibility with potential data portals and catalogues.
  - Sharing and embargo: identify any data availability restrictions or sharing limitations related to MST data and laboratory methods.
  - Documentation: capture provenance (collection team, interpretation) and any processing steps; consider documenting limitations and uncertainties.
  - Maintenance and updates: establish how data will be updated with future MST markers or expanded sampling, including versioning and changelog.

- Potential use and impact:
  - Supports development and validation of MST approaches suitable for sub-Saharan Africa.
  - Enables assessment of drinking water contamination risk by distinguishing human versus cattle fecal sources in the studied region.
