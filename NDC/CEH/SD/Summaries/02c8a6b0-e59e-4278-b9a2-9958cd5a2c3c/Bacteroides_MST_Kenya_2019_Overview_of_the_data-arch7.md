# Drinking-water under a "One Health" lens: quantifying microbial contamination pathways between livestock and drinking-water

## Overview
- Addresses diarrhoeal disease risk and safe water access in rural sub-Saharan Africa.
- Aims to develop or adapt low-cost bacteriophage-based Microbial Source Tracking (MST) techniques suitable for sub-Saharan Africa.
- Focuses on locally isolating Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle feces in rural western Kenya to serve as MST markers.
- Tests the geographical stability of Bacteroides fragilis (GB124) as an indicator of human fecal contamination in drinking water sources (Siaya County, Kenya).
- Describes the recovering and isolation of novel Bacteroides spp. strains and associated bacteriophages, plus fecal indicators and related phages found at water sources and a wastewater treatment plant.

## Data types and MST markers
- Novel Bacteroides spp. hosts isolated from human and cattle fecal sources for MST use.
- Bacteriophages capable of infecting the newly isolated Bacteroides hosts.
- Fecal indicator bacteria data: total coliforms, Escherichia coli, and intestinal enterococci.
- Somatic coliphages.
- Bacteriophages capable of infecting Bacteroides fragilis GB124 (GB124-infecting phages).

## Study locations and samples
- Rural West Kenya water sources (site locations for drinking water contamination assessment).
- Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO) as a source of comparative data.
- Geographic focus includes Siaya County, Kenya, for evaluating human faecal contamination signals.

## Data collection and interpretation
- Data collected by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Mr. Kevin Ives.
- Data interpretation conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva.

## Relevance to GIS and mapping
- Enables geolocated mapping of MST markers and contamination indicators across water sources and wastewater facilities.
- Supports visualization of spatial relationships between human and cattle fecal sources and drinking-water contamination risks.
- Can be integrated with hydrological data, water distribution networks, and One Health datasets to identify contamination pathways.

## Practical implications and considerations for GIS
- Potential to map distribution of MST markers alongside traditional fecal indicators to identify high-risk locations.
- Useful for informing interventions targeting livestock-human-water interfaces in rural settings.
- GIS workflows should account for data from multiple sources and resolutions, and align with local data standards.

## Data limitations and considerations for GIS
- Geographic scope is restricted to rural western Kenya; broader regional applicability may require additional data.
- Africa-specific MST data are relatively rare; consider data harmonization and provenance when integrating with other datasets.
- Spatial resolution, sampling density, and consistency across sites may influence map-based analyses.
