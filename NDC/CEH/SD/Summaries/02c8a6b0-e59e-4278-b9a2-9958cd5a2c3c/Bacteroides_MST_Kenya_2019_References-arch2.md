## Overview
- The document compiles standards and research on water quality indicators, focusing on enteric bacteria and bacteriophages as tracers of fecal contamination and viral waterborne risks.
- Emphasizes standardized methods, host-strain approaches, and the use of markers for tracking pollution sources in environmental waters.

## Standard Methods for Water Quality Indicators
- ISO 7899-2:2000 – Water quality: Detection and enumeration of intestinal enterococci using membrane filtration.
- ISO 9308-1 – Water quality: Enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria by membrane filtration for waters with low background flora.
- ISO 10705-2 (2001) – Water quality: Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages, Part 2: enumeration of somatic coliphages.
- ISO 10705-4 (2001) – Water quality: Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages, Part 4: enumeration of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis.
- These standards support consistent data collection, QA/QC, and comparability of results across sites and over time.

## Bacteriophages as Indicators and Source Tracking
- Studies explore bacteriophages as tools for monitoring viral waterborne risks and as indicators of fecal pollution.
- Research on isolating Bacteroides bacteriophage host strains to track sources of fecal pollution in water.
- Phages related to Bacteroides species are investigated for their suitability as tracking markers and their relationship to environmental health outcomes.

## Microbial Source Tracking and Media Development
- Markers for microbial source tracking (MST) help distinguish human vs. animal fecal contamination in environmental waters.
- Development and identification of host strains and media (e.g., for Bacteroides fragilis group) support selective isolation and presumptive identification critical for MST efforts.
- Works discuss the effectiveness of MST markers in linking contamination to health outcomes and in informing management decisions.

## Data Management and Monitoring Practices
- The emphasis on standard methods implies a need for clear data provenance, quality assurance, and data sharing.
- For analysts monitoring the environment, there is value in storing and uploading created datasets to appropriate data portals so that outputs (maps, charts, reports) can be scrutinized and reused.
- A core challenge is increasing dataset value by integrating multiple data sources (beyond single-use datasets) and enabling access to underlying data used to generate outputs.
