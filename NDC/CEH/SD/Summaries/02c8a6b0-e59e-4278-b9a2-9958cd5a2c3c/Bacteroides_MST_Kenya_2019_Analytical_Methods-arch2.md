# Recovery and isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides spp. hosts and detection of faecal indicators and bacteriophages in water sources and wastewater in Siaya County, Kenya

## Purpose and scope
- Document describes recovery and isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle feces and the simultaneous detection of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB), somatic coliphages, and bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp. in environmental water samples and a wastewater treatment plant.
- Study location: rural Siaya County, western Kenya; sampling dates in June 2018 with additional water sampling in 2019.
- Data are linked to multiple CSV files providing sampling locations, hosts, and detection results.

## Experimental design and sampling
- Source material:
  - Human feces: pooled samples from school pit latrines.
  - Cattle feces: pooled samples from shoreline cattle stools near surface water sources.
- Locational data collected with GPS (World Geodetic System). Precise sampling locations logged in LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv.
- Faecal sampling dates: 7–8 June 2018; isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides hosts conducted 10–21 June 2018.
- Water samples: collected from 10 water sources (drinking water sources) and from a KIWASCO wastewater plant influent/effluent on multiple dates (samples with detection data in DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv).
- Data outputs prepared as CSV files: IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA/B.csv and IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA/B.csv; DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv.

## Collection/Generation/Transformation Methods
- Ethical approvals:
  - University of Southampton (ref. 31554, 12/02/2018)
  - Kenya Medical Research Institute (ref. KEMRI/SERU/CGHR/091/3493, 17/10/2017)
- Consent: participant information sheet and consent forms from headteachers for sampling school pit latrines.
- Sample collection procedures:
  - Cattle feces: five stools per location, pooled into 25 g; transferred to 100 mL pots with cold chain.
  - Human feces: five pit latrines per school, pooled 25 g; processed similarly.
  - Transport: to KEMRI Kisian labs within 4 hours; stored at 4°C for up to 24 hours.
- Processing and storage: samples prepared into master fecal solutions; aliquoted, stored, and prepared for subsequent isolation and detection assays.

## Isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides spp. hosts
- Medium and initial processing:
  - Bacteroides bile esculine agar (BBEa) used for recovery; specific preparation and pH adjustments described.
  - Serial dilutions prepared in Ringer’s solution; plating on BBE agar; anaerobic incubation at 37°C for 24 h.
- Subculturing and confirmation:
  - colonies grown on BBE under aerobic and anaerobic conditions; Gram staining to identify Gram-negative, obligate anaerobic rods.
  - Subculture onto BBE and BPRM plates; further incubation for 24 h.
  - Selection of viable isolates; overnight cultures expanded in BPRM broth with additives; growth checked by turbidity.
  - Cryopreservation: cultures mixed with bovine serum as cryoprotectant; stored at -20°C.
- Outcome:
  - Ten new potential Bacteroides spp. hosts selected (five from cattle, five from human feces).
  - Host codes and origins documented (e.g., cattle: SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8; human: WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2).

## Detection of faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and somatic coliphages
- Sampling and processing:
  - Water samples collected from drinking water sources and the KIWASCO plant; transported to the lab within 4 hours and stored up to 24 hours.
- FIB detection (ISO standard methods):
  - ISO 9308-1: Enumerate total coliforms and E. coli by membrane filtration; use CCE agar for incubation; colonies colored blue/purple indicate E. coli; pink/red indicate presumptive total coliforms.
  - ISO 7899-2: Enumerate intestinal enterococci using Slanetz and Bartley agar after filtration.
  - Results expressed as CFU per 100 mL; TNTC cases adjusted by using smaller volumes (100 mL, then 10 mL, 1 mL, 0.1 mL as needed).
- Somatic coliphages:
  - Assay using E. coli WG-5 as host; response measured by plaque-forming units (PFU) per 100 mL.
  - Inoculum preparation included monitoring optical density to OD 0.33 at 600 nm; use of Modified Scholten’s broth and semi-solid agar; incubation at 37°C and PFU enumeration.

## Detection of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp.
- Host strains used:
  - GB-124 (human-specific reference host)
  - Kenyan hosts from human and cattle feces (WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2; SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8)
- Assay procedure:
  - Overnight cultures of Bacteroides hosts prepared in BPRMB; cultures adjusted to OD 0.33 at 620 nm.
  - Sample aliquots (1 mL) mixed with host cultures in semi-solid Bacteroides phage recovery medium agar (ssBPRMA); incubated anaerobically at 37°C for 18 h.
  - Plaque-forming units (PFU) counted to quantify phages infecting Bacteroides spp.
- Controls:
  - Positive control with GB-124 reference phage; negative control (BPRMB alone).
- Notes:
  - Detailed compositions and instructions for agar media and diluents referenced in Fieldwork and Laboratory Instrumentation section.

## Data management and interpretation
- Data files and location metadata are stored in CSVs linked to specific sampling events:
  - LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv (sampling coordinates)
  - IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepB.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsweek17-6-18StepB.csv
  - DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv (FIB and MST markers)
- The study emphasizes standardized methods (ISO and established protocols) and traceable data management to enable monitoring of environmental health indicators over time.
