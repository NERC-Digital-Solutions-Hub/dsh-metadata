# Drinking-water under a "One Health" lens: quantifying microbial contamination pathways between livestock and drinking-water

## Executive summary
- Addresses diarrhoeal disease and unsafe drinking water in developing countries, focusing on rural sub-Saharan Africa and livestock–human contamination pathways.
- Aims to develop or adapt low-cost bacteriophage-based Microbial Source Tracking (MST) techniques suitable for sub-Saharan Africa and to test the geographic stability of a human-associated marker (Bacteroides fragilis GB124) in Kenya.
- Describes data collection on novel Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle feces, associated bacteriophages, and fecal indicators to support MST approaches for assessing drinking water quality.
- Data collected from rural western Kenya and a Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO); responsibilities: data collection by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Kevin Ives; data interpretation by Dr. Silva.

## Data describe and content
- Target data: isolating and recovering novel Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle fecal sources to indicate fecal contamination in water sources.
- Associated measurements:
  - Bacteriophages capable of infecting the newly isolated Bacteroides spp. hosts
  - Fecal indicator bacteria: total coliforms, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci
  - Somatic coliphages
  - Bacteriophages capable of infecting Bacteroides fragilis GB124 (human fecal marker)
- Sample sources: rural West Kenya water sources and Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO).
- Purpose: to generate data that support MST markers for evaluating drinking water quality.

## Methods and responsibilities
- Data collection and assembly conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Mr. Kevin Ives.
- Data interpretation performed by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva.

## Data management and usage implications for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates the end-to-end data lifecycle: sourcing from local environments, isolation of microbial hosts, and measurement of associated markers.
- Highlights the need for clear metadata, data quality checks, and documentation to enable MST deployment and cross-site comparisons.
- Emphasizes the potential for co-ownership and collaboration across public health, environmental, and water-management sectors to support One Health outcomes.

## Challenges and data gaps
- Very limited prior similar research in Africa, indicating a potential scarcity of comparable datasets and benchmarks.
- Geographical specificity (Siaya County, Kenya) and the stability of the human marker (GB124) require validation across contexts.
- Detection rates for novel MST markers may be low or variable, impacting data confidence and comparability.
- Data standards, interoperability, and discoverability are critical for integrating these datasets with broader water-quality and public-health data systems.
