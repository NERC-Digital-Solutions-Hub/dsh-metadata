- Overview
  - A collection of international standards and research focused on water-quality microbiology, emphasizing detection and enumeration of fecal indicators (enterococci, E. coli, coliforms) and bacteriophages, plus microbial source tracking using Bacteroides species.
- Standards and methods
  - ISO 7899-2:2000 – Water quality: detection and enumeration of intestinal enterococci by membrane filtration.
  - ISO 10705-2 (2001) – Water quality: detection and enumeration of bacteriophages: enumeration of somatic coliphages.
  - ISO 10705-4 (2001) – Water quality: detection and enumeration of bacteriophages: enumeration of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis.
  - ISO 9308-1 (2014) – Water quality: enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria by membrane filtration for waters with low bacterial background flora.
- Microbial source tracking and indicators
  - Bacteriophages as indicators for fecal pollution and enteric virus removal; exploration of GB-124 phages as a tool for viral waterborne disease control.
  - Isolation and use of Bacteroides bacteriophage host strains to track sources of animal fecal pollution in water.
  - Microbial source tracking markers: relationships with pathogens and human health outcomes.
  - Development of new media for selecting and identifying Bacteroides fragilis group strains; identification of host strains for tracking pollution sources.
