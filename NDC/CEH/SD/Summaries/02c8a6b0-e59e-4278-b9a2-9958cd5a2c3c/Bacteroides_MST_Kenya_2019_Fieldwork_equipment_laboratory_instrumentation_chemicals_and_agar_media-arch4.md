- Agar media
  - Media and components for specific targets: intestinal enterococci (Slanetz and Bartley medium); E. coli and total coliforms (Chromogenic Coliform Agar); somatic coliphages and bacteroides phages (e.g., Agar Bacteriological formulations and related supplements like meat peptone, tryptone, yeast extract, NaCl, L-cysteine, D-glucose, MgCl2, CaCl2, haemin, Na2CO3); general base solutions (distilled water, Ringers solution, Virkon tablets); antibiotics for selective growth (kanamycin, nalidixic acid); and acids/bases for media preparation and pH adjustment.

## Data leadership perspective

- Data quality and provenance
  - The inventory underpins data collection by ensuring field and lab work are conducted with validated, traceable equipment and reagents, enabling reproducibility and accurate metadata (lot numbers, expiry, storage conditions).

- Governance and stewardship
  - Maintaining a central asset registry supports discoverability, updates, calibration/maintenance records, and metadata standardization for all items.

- Safety, compliance, and access
  - Inclusion of PPE, biohazard bags, and disposal items highlights safety and regulatory compliance considerations critical for data integrity and ethical data handling.

- Readiness and interoperability
  - A complete, current inventory supports planning and execution of data collection campaigns, reduces delays due to missing items, and facilitates integration with broader data ecosystems across partners.

## Recommendations for Data Leaders

- Create or link an asset register to the data management plan, capturing item details, quantities, lot numbers, expiry dates, and maintenance schedules.
- Establish metadata standards for all reagents and media (composition, source, preparation notes, storage conditions) to ensure traceability of data provenance.
- Implement routine inventory audits and automated reminders for reordering, calibration, and validation of equipment.
- Align safety and compliance data (PPE, disposal bags, sterilization records) with data governance policies to support auditable data practices.
- Promote coordination with external partners (where applicable) to standardize equipment and reagents across networks, reducing duplicative efforts and improving data quality and interoperability.
