# Drinking-water under a "One Health" lens: quantifying microbial contamination pathways between livestock and drinking-water

- Context and aims
  - Diarrhoeal disease and lack of access to safe water are major public health issues in developing countries.
  - Concern about transmission of diarrhoeal infections from livestock to humans when people and livestock live in close proximity.
  - The project seeks to quantify microbial contamination pathways and to develop or adapt low-cost bacteriophage-based Microbial Source Tracking (MST) techniques suitable for sub-Saharan Africa.

- MST approach and markers
  - Bacteroides spp. are common in human and animal feces and certain bacteriophages infecting these bacteria could discriminate between human and animal sources.
  - Some strains (e.g., Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron GA17 and B. fragilis GB124) are linked to human fecal pollution.
  - The study explores alternative Bacteroides spp. hosts due to geographical and detection-rate limitations of existing markers.

- Primary aim and scope
  - Locally isolate novel Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle fecal sources in rural western Kenya to indicate human and cattle fecal contamination of water sources.
  - Test the geographical stability of Bacteroides fragilis GB124 to assess human fecal contamination in drinking-water sources in Siaya County, Kenya.

- Data described
  - Recovery and isolation of novel Bacteroides spp. strains from human and cattle fecal sources.
  - Detection levels of: bacteriophages capable of infecting these new Bacteroides hosts; fecal indicator bacteria (total coliforms, Escherichia coli, intestinal enterococci); somatic coliphages.
  - Bacteriophages capable of infecting GB124 observed in rural West Kenya water sources and at Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO).

- Study sites and samples
  - Rural water sources in western Kenya.
  - Kisumu wastewater treatment plant (KIWASCO) for comparative data.

- Data collection and interpretation
  - Data collection conducted by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva and Mr. Kevin Ives.
  - Data interpretation led by Dr. Diogo Trajano Gomes da Silva.

- Significance and application
  - Aims to enable MST-based, low-cost, practical monitoring of drinking-water quality in sub-Saharan Africa.
  - Supports One Health by linking human and livestock contamination pathways to water safety.
  - Addresses gaps in Africa where MST work is limited, expanding from prior work mostly outside the continent.
