# Fieldwork equipment and Laboratory consumables

## Overview
- Comprehensive inventory of fieldwork and laboratory supplies, including equipment, consumables, instrumentation, chemicals, agar media, and general items.
- Structured into categories: Fieldwork equipment; Laboratory consumables; Laboratory instrumentation; Chemicals; Agar media; General.
- Supports data governance goals by enabling discovery, reuse, traceability, and lifecycle management of resources used in field and lab work.

## Data governance relevance for Data Stewards
- Treat inventory as a dataset with rich metadata to support provenance, reproducibility, and auditability.
- Capture identifiers (catalog numbers, brands), quantities, units, storage conditions, and location.
- Record supplier details, lot/batch numbers, expiry where applicable, and handling requirements (biosafety, cold chain).

## Categories and representative items
- Fieldwork equipment: sterile pots, wide-mouth HDPE bottles, alcohol, sampling tools, PPE (gloves, masks), cooler, ice packs, field proforma, writing supplies.
- Laboratory consumables: pH strips, microscope slides, test tubes and racks, Sterilin tubes, cryogenic tubes, various reagent bottles, cryo supplies, single-use disposables, AnaeroGen kits.
- Laboratory instrumentation: microscope, spectrophotometer, distilled water dispenser, water bath, vortex, microwave, autoclave, fridges/freezers, colony counter, centrifuge.
- Chemicals: a broad set including buffers, acids/bases, salts, sugars, BSA, tryptones, glycerol, antibiotics, and solution preparations.
- Agar media: specific media for Enterococci, E. coli/total coliforms, coliphages, Bacteroides, with noted components and preparation details.
- General: distilled water, reagents for solutions, Virkon, Kanamycin, Nalidixic acid, NaOH, glycerol, etc.
- Storage and biosafety notes: red lab disposal bags, anaerobic kits, and cold storage requirements (4°C, -20°C).

## Metadata and interoperability considerations
- Include catalog numbers and suppliers (e.g., Oxoid media) to enable cross-referencing across systems.
- Record quantities, units, lot/batch numbers, expiry dates where relevant.
- Document storage conditions, biosafety requirements, and any special handling or containment needs.

## Data quality and completeness
- Use consistent naming and hierarchical categorization across inventories.
- Standardize units and container descriptors (e.g., volumes in ml/L, dish sizes in mm).
- Validate compatibility with existing lab information management systems and procurement records.

## Data lifecycle and updating
- Assign ownership (inventory manager) and implement versioning for the dataset.
- Track changes: additions, removals, updates; maintain change history and archiving of obsolete items.
- Ensure timely updates from field teams and procurement to reflect current stock and upcoming needs.

## Practical recommendations for Data Stewards
- Adopt a publishing mindset: deliver a usable, searchable inventory dataset with clear metadata.
- Provide templates and tools for data creators/sharers to capture required metadata at procurement and receiving.
- Integrate inventory data with data portals/catalogues and procurement systems for interoperability.
- Document provenance and modifications; note replacements, obsolescence, and disposal status.
- Implement access controls and privacy considerations as needed for procurement or supplier data.

## Potential challenges and mitigations
- Incomplete or delayed data entry on inventories; establish clear ownership and update cadence.
- Heterogeneous systems and formats across field and lab sites; use standardized taxonomy and mappings.
- Large numbers of SKUs and complex storage requirements; implement bulk upload and validation rules.
- Bespoke or non-interoperable items; maintain a crosswalk to common metadata fields and standardized descriptors.
