- Scope of the references
  - A compilation of ISO standards and research focused on detection and enumeration of microbial indicators in water (enterococci, bacteriophages, E. coli, and coliforms) and tools for tracking fecal contamination sources.
  - Emphasizes methodologies (e.g., membrane filtration) and host-strain-based approaches for source tracking, with relevance to water quality monitoring and public health.

- Key standards and methods
  - ISO 7899-2: Water quality - Detection and enumeration of intestinal enterococci - Membrane filtration method.
  - ISO 10705-2: Water quality - Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages - Part 2: enumeration of somatic coliphages.
  - ISO 10705-4: Water quality - Detection and enumeration of bacteriophages - Part 4: enumeration of bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides fragilis.
  - ISO 9308-1: Water quality - Enumeration of Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria - Membrane filtration method for waters with low background flora.
  - Livingston (1978) and Harwood et al. (2014) contribute foundational and review perspectives on microbial markers and methodologies for distinguishing fecal contamination sources.

  - The work collectively supports using Bacteroides-host phages as tracers for identifying pollution sources, including animal-derived inputs.

  - These methodological references underpin standardized data collection and interpretation for downstream GIS mapping.

- GIS-relevant implications (integrating these references into map-based data products)
  - Data types implied: standardized microbial surveillance results (enterococci, E. coli, coliphages, bacteriophages targeting Bacteroides), including host-strain data for source tracking.
  - Spatial outputs: contamination heatmaps, source attribution maps, and risk surfaces across catchments and water bodies.
  - Temporal outputs: time-series of surveillance results to show changes in contamination patterns and the effectiveness of interventions.

- Data quality, standards, and interoperability considerations for GIS
  - ISO-based methods encourage consistent data schemas, units, sampling methods, and reporting formats, facilitating integration with other environmental and health datasets.
  - Harmonization is essential when combining datasets from multiple laboratories or jurisdictions.

- Practical guidance for GIS Specialists
  - Build map-based products that visualize both presence/absence and concentration levels of microbial indicators, with layering for source-tracking markers (e.g., Bacteroides phages) and potential pollution sources (land use, wastewater discharges).
  - Integrate hydrological, climatic, and land-use data to support attribution analyses and risk assessment.
  - Develop interactive dashboards that allow stakeholders to explore spatial and temporal trends, uncertainties, and potential health implications.
  - Prioritize data standardization and data cleaning to address fragmentation, resolution gaps, and large dataset management.
  - Engage end users early to tailor map features (filters, legends, and scale) to policy decisions and public communication needs.
