# Recovery and isolation of Kenyan Bacteroides spp. hosts from human and cattle faeces

- Purpose: Isolate and characterize Bacteroides spp. host strains from human and cattle faeces to enable detection of bacteriophages infecting these hosts, in the context of environmental sampling in rural Siaya County, Kenya.

## Study setting and sampling design
- Location: Rural Siaya County, western Kenya; environmental water sources and a wastewater treatment plant in Kisumu used for sampling.
- Sampling windows: Faecal samples collected on 7–8 June 2018; host isolation conducted 10–21 June 2018; environmental samples collected 18–21/06/2018, 05/08–11/2018, and 13/06/2019.
- Sample types:
  - Human: pooled faecal material from primary school pit latrines.
  - Cattle: pooled faecal material from shoreline areas around surface water sources.
- Data capture: Locational data collected with a hand-held GPS following World Geodetic System standards; exact sampling coordinates logged in LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv.

## Data collected and datasets
- Human and cattle faecal sampling datasets:
  - IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepB.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsweek17-6-18StepB.csv
- Location and sampling metadata:
  - LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv
- Environmental detection datasets:
  - DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv
- Data collected include host codes, faecal origin, and the results of isolation and culture procedures.

## Laboratory methods and data generation
- Ethical approvals obtained (University of Southampton and KEMRI) and consent processes documented for sampling from school pit latrines.
- Isolation workflow for Bacteroides spp.:
  - Initial enrichment and serial dilutions of pooled faecal samples.
  - Recovery on Bacteroides bile esculine agar (BBEa) under aerobic/anaerobic conditions.
  - Subculture, Gram staining, and selection of Gram-negative obligate anaerobes.
  - Sub-culturing to BPRM-related media and incubation for isolation of potential Kenyan Bacteroides hosts.
  - Cryopreservation of isolates in BPRM broth with cryoprotectant (Bovine serum) at -20°C.
- Host candidates:
  - 5 cattle-derived hosts: SIN.19, KN.1, KN.2, KN.3, KN.8
  - 5 human-derived hosts: WAA.1, TIB.1, TIA.1, ONA.3, LU.2
- Detection assays for context:
  - Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB) and somatic coliphages from water sources and wastewater plant influents/effluents (ISO-standard methods).
  - Bacteriophages infecting Bacteroides spp. using the Kenyan hosts and the GB-124 human-specific host as reference; recovery in BPRMB/BPRMA media under anaerobic conditions.
- Data outputs include: host codes, origin, culture growth observations, and PFU/CFU counts from subsequent phage assays.

## Data management and metadata
- GPS coordinates and sampling locations recorded; exact coordinates stored in LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv.
- Datasets organized into stepwise CSV files detailing the isolation workflow (StepA/StepB) for each sampling week.
- Environmental data (FIB, somatic coliphages, and Bacteroides phages) stored in DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv and related files.
- Data capture emphasizes traceability from sampling to isolation to phage detection, with references to ISO-standard procedures to support reproducibility.

## Ethics and approvals
- Approvals from:
  - University of Southampton, Faculty of Social and Human Sciences (reference: 31554; 12/02/2018)
  - Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) (reference: KEMRI/SERU/CGHR/091/3493; 17/10/2017)
- Participant information and consent forms used for headteachers before sampling faecal material from school latrines.

## Data accessibility and files referenced
- Data files referenced for full traceability:
  - LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv
  - IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepB.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA.csv
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsweek17-6-18StepB.csv
  - DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv
- Data is organized to support cross-referencing samples, hosts, and detection results across multiple weeks and environmental contexts.

## Key considerations for data leaders
- Ensure end-to-end data provenance from field collection to laboratory results, with clear file naming and versioning.
- Maintain metadata richness (locations, collection dates, sample origins, host codes) to enable re-use and cross-site comparisons.
- Leverage ISO-standard methods to enhance comparability of FIB and phage-detection data.
- Plan for data governance, including ethical approvals, consent artifacts, and data sharing provisions.
- Facilitate access to datasets via well-documented CSV files and metadata descriptors to support broader data integration and community engagement.
