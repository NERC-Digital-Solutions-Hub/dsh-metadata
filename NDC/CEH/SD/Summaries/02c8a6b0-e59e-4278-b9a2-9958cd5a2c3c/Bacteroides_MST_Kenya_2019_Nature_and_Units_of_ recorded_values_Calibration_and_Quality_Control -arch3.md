# Nature and Units of recorded values, Calibration and Quality control

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the nature and units of values across six data files used to isolate novel Bacteroides spp. hosts for assessing faecal contamination of water sources.
  - File 6 documents use of these novel markers alongside established markers (Bacteroides fragilis GB124, somatic coliphages, and faecal indicator bacteria) in drinking water sources and wastewater effluents.
  - Aims to ensure data are interpretable, comparable, and suitable for quality assessment and monitoring decisions.

- Data files and units
  - LocationOfFaecalSampling.csv
    - Units: latitude and longitude in decimal degrees; altitude in metres.
  - IsolationOfBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepA.csv
    - Location coordinates (latitude/longitude/altitude) in decimal degrees and metres.
    - Bacterial counts reported as colony forming units (CFU) from diluted faecal samples.
    - Master faecal solution details: 5 g faeces + 5 mL Ringers solution; dilution scheme with weight-to-volume relationships.
    - Special notes: weight-based calculations; limits provided.
    - Key quantitative limits: Limit of Detection (LOD) = 1 CFU per 0.0001 g faeces; Maximum detected = 16 CFU per 0.001 g faeces; TNTC = Too Numerous To Count.
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek10-6-18StepB.csv
    - Contains CFU data as a confirmatory step.
    - Outcomes categorized by Esulin reaction (positive/negative) and oxygen requirement (anaerobic/aerobic).
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsWeek17-6-18StepA.csv
    - Similar structure and criteria as StepA file above.
  - IsolationBacteroidesHostsweek17-6-18StepB.csv
    - Similar structure and criteria as StepB file above.
  - DetectionOfFIB&MSTmarkers.csv
    - Faecal indicator bacteria (FIB): intestinal enterococci, total coliforms, Escherichia coli.
    - Measured as CFU per 100 mL (CFU/100 mL) in drinking water and wastewater effluents.
    - Somatic coliphages and Bacteroides fragilis GB124 phages also reported with plaque forming units (PFU/mL).
    - Measured ranges: 1 CFU/100 mL to 720,000 CFU/100 mL for FIB; 1 PFU/mL to 740 PFU/mL for phages; TNTC indicates Too Numerous To Count.

- Calibration and instruments
  - Comprehensive calibration details for major equipment:
    - Incubator (Orbital incubator, Stuart SI500) calibrated February 2017 and 2018.
    - Vortex mixer (Brand new at the time of documentation).
    - Autoclave (Sterilmatic STMEX) calibrated February 2017 and 2018.
    - Centrifuge (Thermo Scientific Sorval ST 40) calibrated February 2017 and 2018.
    - Vacuum pump (Brand new).
    - Spectrophotometer (HACH DR/2500) calibrated March 2017 and 2018.
    - Water bath (Fisher Scientific) calibrated March 2017.
  - Calibration data include instrument type, model, serial number, and calibration dates to ensure traceability.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Use of sample blanks comprising sterile distilled water in all microbiological tests.
  - The same group of analysts performed the tests within each sampling campaign to reduce inter-analyst variation.
  - The document emphasizes accuracy, traceability, and consistency in measurement and reporting.

- Notable terminology
  - TNTC: Too Numerous To Count, indicating counts exceed quantifiable range.
