# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose
  - Document the field survey sampling framework used in Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Explain how the ITE Land Classification evolved to stratify a national ecological survey, enabling time-series analyses of habitat change and policy-relevant outputs.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s varied landscapes.
  - ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework: environmental attributes used to group land into 32 (later expanded) land classes.
  - Field sampling unit: 1 km squares, selected to be representative of each class; early work used the centre square of a 15 × 15 km grid.
  - Early sampling: eight squares per class (256 total) for CS1978.
  - Data outputs: estimates of habitat areas and change over time, enabling national and regional (country-based) reporting.

- Historical development and timeline
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - 32 land classes derived from 1228 classified centre squares; eight samples per class (256 total); habitat areas estimated per class to obtain national estimates.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per land class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed; updated land-use and habitat data; land-cover map linked to the program.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
    - Classification expanded to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of classes increased to 40; national estimates aligned with revised framework.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
    - Emphasis on separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); subdivision and aggregation of Land Classes to create country-specific strata (40 strata); additional squares to ensure representation; upland habitat module considered.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs driven by devolved governance; introduction of country-unit Land Classes (creating 45 strata); additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class); adjustments in England due to Welsh additions; Wales-specific sub-division within Land Class 17; uplands module expanded for better country-specific estimates.

- Sampling framework details
  - Land Classes and strata
    - Original 32 Land Classes; expanded to 40 for country reporting; 45 strata after Wales-specific adjustments.
    - Sub-divisions to create England-with-Wales and Scotland frameworks; class aggregation where necessary to preserve representation.
  - Sample sizes and distribution
    - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
    - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class across 32 classes).
    - CS1990: 508 squares (All Squares approach; added urban and sea corrections).
    - CS2000: expanded to 40 strata; multiple class adjustments to support England, Scotland, and Wales reporting; additional Wales samples added; country-specific modules introduced.
    - CS2007: further Welsh sampling; 43 additional Welsh squares; 45 strata; targeted representation in Welsh and upland classes; adjustments in England to maintain overall balance.
  - National estimates methodology
    - Estimates based on mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the area of that class.
    - When classifications changed over time, efforts were made to maintain comparability and interpretability of time-series data, including guidance on using original vs. latest classifications.

- Upland and country-specific considerations
  - Introduction of upland habitat module at CS2000 and expanded Wales-focused sampling and classification adjustments for CS2007.
  - Separate country estimates implemented to reflect England with Wales and Scotland reporting, with corresponding adjustments to sampling, classification, and class counts.

- Outputs and implications for monitoring
  - Outputs include country- and GB-scale estimates of habitat areas and change over time, along with maps and associated data products.
  - The strategy provides a consistent, time-series framework that supports monitoring environmental health and policy performance, while adapting to devolved governance needs and country-specific reporting requirements.
  - Emphasis on maintaining comparability across surveys, while accommodating policy-driven reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat emphasis.
