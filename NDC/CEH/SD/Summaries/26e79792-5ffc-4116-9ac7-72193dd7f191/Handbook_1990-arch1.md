Countryside Survey 1990

- Purpose and context
  - Systematic land-use monitoring to update land-use databases, assess ecological changes, and support modelling and decision-making.
  - Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) using the ITE Land Classification System.
  - A two-tier approach linking bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing, including satellite imagery, to create a Britain-wide land-cover map.
  - Emphasis on standardised field recording to enable robust statistical analysis of change over time.

- Scope and design
  - 512 sample squares across Britain, divided into six groups deployed from six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each group covers about 85 squares; typical survey day plans balance travel and fieldwork.
  - Two main data streams:
    - Land-cover/land-use data (ground-truth for remote sensing, landscape features, and ecological variables).
    - Vegetation and habitat data (via plots and quadrats) for monitoring change in land cover types and vegetation structure.
  - New data collection in 1990 includes satellite-data linkage and enhanced information capture, with increased collaboration.

- Data collection components
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): central data-recording workbook combining maps, site data, and vegetation/factual observations.
  - Mapping: extensive annotation of 1:10,000 scale maps with a code-based system; emphasis on linking codes to ground truth and boundaries.
  - Ownership and farmer information: to document land ownership, access permissions, and background context for field notes.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: standardized recording of landforms, water bodies, boundaries, and coastal features.
  - Boundaries, roads, hedges, walls, and buildings: detailed coding of landscape features and their condition, management, and changes.
  - Vegetation and ground cover: standardized classifications of cover types, species (with a list of common species), and context (e.g., mosaics, bracken, and age structures in woodlands).
  - Bryophytes and lichens: restricted lists to be recorded where relevant.
  - Photographs: vegetation plots photographed to document appearance and ground-truth features.

- Plot and quadrat design
  - Large vegetation plots (Quadrats): five 200 m2 plots per square (with nested 4 m2 sub-quadrats) to capture mosaic vegetation and ground cover.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots per square in natural or semi-natural land cover types.
  - Permanent marking: metal plates placed near plot corners to enable precise relocation in future surveys.
  - Locating and relocation: rules for relocating existing quadrats; if land use changes or plots become non-viable, alternatives are identified, including relocating to boundaries or selecting new plots following predefined procedures.
  - Linear plots: up to five 1 m wide plots per type (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides), positioned adjacent to the main 200 m2 quadrat area, with precise placement relative to the dominant linear feature.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots describe methods to minimize bias and ensure consistent placement; adjustments documented if plots cannot be placed exactly as previously.
  - Plot types include boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside plots, each with specific placement rules and recording practices.

- Vegetation sampling and recording
  - Standardised vegetation recording sheet with a 200-species list plus a pathway for unlisted species.
  - Nested quadrats: inner 4 m2 quadrats nested within the 200 m2 plot to capture species presence and percent cover (recorded in 5% intervals).
  - Cover codes: use of primary and secondary codes; up to three cover codes allowed per unit; mosaics captured with dominant codes and supporting codes.
  - Species identification: guidance on difficult species and acceptable combinations when precise ID is uncertain; bryophytes and lichens recorded from a restricted list.
  - Documentation: sketch of plot layout, distances, and boundaries; permanent markers placed to aid relocation; field notes for any ambiguous observations.

- Aerial photographs and API
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supports identification of features not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundaries between vegetation types, new buildings).
  - API results are guidance, to be reconciled with on-ground evidence.

- Sampling and biota
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE): collected from flowing waters following a separate handbook; two samples per square for standing waters as well, where available.
  - NELUP sampling (Newcastle University): collection of freshwater biota (primarily water beetles) from standing waters; descriptions collected on a map with traceable labeling.

- Data handling and quality
  - Emphasis on neat, complete FABs; clear documentation of the square series number and ownership details on every page.
  - Standardised field-handling procedures to minimise recording variation and improve statistical accuracy.
  - Permanent markers and careful relocation procedures to ensure consistency across survey years.
  - Data and samples transported to ITE Merlewood or designated stations promptly for processing and storage; metadata and traceability are prioritized.

- Permissions and field access
  - Letters to landowners/farmers issued to establish access; coordination with landowners to avoid conflicts and to gather background information.
  - If permission is refused for any part of a square:
    - Abandon fieldwork in that square and replace with a random square.
    - If partial access is possible, complete as much as possible or relocate to neighboring areas if feasible.
  - Document and report any access issues to the Station Coordinator.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, aerial photographs, maps, materials) and local ITE stations (maps, field gear, reference books, cameras, first-aid, etc.); surveyors supply personal gear.
  - Planning for flexible working arrangements and travel-efficient scheduling; compensation via time off in lieu for overtime.

- Timeline and publication notes
  - The document consolidates methodologies and procedures for the 1990 resurvey with revised guidance (final updated version February 1991).
  - Author: Colin Barr; primary reference year 1990, with revisions in 1991.

- Challenges and data opportunities (analytical perspective)
  - The design addresses a key data gap by enabling scalable, comparable, time-series data across local and national levels.
  - Rich, standardised datasets (FABs, codes, plots, and maps) offer potential for correlations between land-use change, vegetation dynamics, landscape features, and management practices.
  - Code-based data enables efficient aggregation and modelling, while standardized field methods support cross-year comparability.
  - Limitations noted include the potential for data gaps due to access issues, boundary changes, and difficulty identifying certain species without specimens.
