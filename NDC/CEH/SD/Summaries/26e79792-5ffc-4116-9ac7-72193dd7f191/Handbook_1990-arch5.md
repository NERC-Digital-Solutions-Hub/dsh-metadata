# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Purpose: update and monitor rural land use data; build current datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems; provide standardized field methods for consistent data across observers.
- Context: ITE conducted the Countryside Survey in 1977/78 and 1984; 1988 data informed a major DOE project; 1990 resurvey aims to standardize recording, enhance data richness, and link field data with satellite imagery through a two-tier approach.
- Goal for data stewards: ensure datasets are governed, discoverable, up-to-date, and usable by others; manage standards, metadata, and provenance across large, evolving datasets.

## Data Collection Scope and Structure
- Core datasets and artifacts:
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and 6" map annotations for site-level data.
  - Ownership and farmer/landowner information; occupancy for access and contact history.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal and boundary/planning metadata.
  - Vegetation data: cover types, species codes, and nested quadrat sampling (large 200 m2 quadrats; five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats per square; multiple linear plots).
  - Woodland/forestry data using woodland-specific codes; trees, scrub, canopy, age, and condition codes.
  - Boundaries, hedges, fences, walls, verges, roads; detailed boundary descriptions and changes (e.g., 999 indicating no longer present).
  - Built environments within curtilages: buildings, gardens, open spaces, land uses, and associated cover types.
  - Sampling components: general vegetation sampling, freshwater biota (IFA/NELUP) and associated sampling protocols (7. Sampling).
- Plot types and layout:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m2; internal nested 4 m2 quadrats; center-of-habitat placement with permanent markers.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots per square in natural/semi-natural habitats.
  - Linear plots: hedgerow, boundary/edge plots; streamside, roadsides, and boundary plots near field features; additional verge/linear plots to capture road/track variation.
- Data capture workflow:
  - Mapping first, then recording quadrats and sampling data; use of alpha and numeric codes to capture complex, multi-factor categories on FABs.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supplements ground data for identifying boundaries and features not visible on maps.

## Data Standards, Codes, and Metadata
- Codes and structure:
  - FAB data pages encode land cover, boundaries, ownership, vegetation types, and other features using primary and secondary codes; alpha codes represent combinations of numeric codes to save space.
  - Universal and domain-specific codes for: vegetation types, boundary types, buildings/curtilages, roads/verges, water features, and woodland attributes.
  - 6.2.1 General: historical data and quadrats to be resurveyed; permanent markers placed to enable repeatable relocation.
  - 6.2.2 Method of recording vegetation: standardized plot types, nested quadrats, 5% cover bands, and a fixed process to record species presence and abundance; use of a predefined species list with a facility to add unlisted species.
  - 6.2.3 Plot types: detailed instructions for quadrats, boundary plots, hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and additional “extra” plots to cover diversity within a square.
  - 6.2.4 1978 rules: location rules for linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) to ensure comparability with earlier surveys.
  - 6.2.5 Species identification: guidelines allowing certain combinations when species-level ID is uncertain; extensive list of accepted combinations for consistency with prior surveys.
  - 6.2.x: “X Universal codes” (e.g., 888 new features; 999 not on map) to support cross-square comparability and future map updates.
- Data provenance and documentation:
  - FABs, maps, and field notes accompany data; permanent markers (plates) and sketches support relocation in future surveys.
  - Photography (8. Photography) documents plots for later interpretation and validation.
  - Metadata capture includes square numbers, ownership, location descriptors, and dates; a clear chain from field collection to centralized storage.

## Data Governance, Permissions, and Access
- Permissions:
  - Prior consent and landowner/farmer outreach are required to access all parts of a square; letters precede field visits and ownership information is captured for contact and cooperation assessment.
  - Procedures defined for permission refusal: abandon the square (or adapt via partial survey/neighboring land) and report to Station Coordinators; prioritize contacting farmers rather than staff; maintain records of access status.
- Access and continuity:
  - Different ownership scenarios (existing vs. new to 1990) are managed with explicit processes to gain access or substitute squares.
  - Documentation and identity (ITE ID) are provided to survey teams; ownership and contact data are maintained to facilitate follow-ups and potentially future surveys.

## Data Quality, Validation, and Consistency
- Quality control:
  - Emphasis on standardizing field recording to reduce observer variability; quality control measures implemented during the 1990 survey to maintain consistency.
  - Field Handbook emphasizes on-site decision-making, with exceptions requiring qualifying notes if necessary.
- Relocation and repeatability:
  - Permanent markers and standardized plotting procedures enable precise relocation of plots in future surveys, supporting long-term change detection.
- Data integrity:
  - Clear guidance on how to treat mosaic vegetation, overlapping cover types, and multi-layer canopies; ensure that data entry remains unambiguous and analyzable.

## Data Lifecycle, Storage, and Workflow
- Survey structure and cadence:
  - 512 squares planned for 1990; 128 new squares introduced; 128 squares re-recorded (some previously recorded plots relocated).
  - Data collection includes FABs, large and small quadrats, linear plots, API results, and photography.
- Data handling and transport:
  - FABs and samples returned to ITE Merlewood; photographic records accompany FABs.
  - Post-survey procedures emphasize data review, with minimal re-transcription unless maps or forms were damaged; aim to minimize data loss.
- Long-term stewardship:
  - Data are intended for inclusion in longitudinal analyses of land cover changes; permanent markers and standardized coding support longitudinal data integrity.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Gaps in user needs and priorities; timely data access and transfer from field teams.
- Integration across diverse systems, formats, and legacy data (e.g., 1978/1988 datasets) requiring careful mapping to contemporary schemas.
- Managing large datasets and complex codes for vegetation, boundaries, and land uses; ensuring scalability of the coding system for future surveys.
- Standardization across observers and over time to ensure comparability of change analyses.

## Key Deliverables and Procedures (Post-Survey)
- End-of-day data checks: read through FABs to ensure no omissions; avoid large post-hoc transcriptions unless necessary.
- Data submission: transport FABs, maps, and samples to ITE stations promptly for central processing.
- Documentation: maintain explicit records of survey methods, locations, ownership, and access conditions to facilitate future replication and audits.

## Summary for Data Stewards
- The Countryside Survey 1990 establishes a comprehensive, standardized data collection framework for large-scale ecological and land-use data, centered on FAB-based data capture, raster-like and vector-like mapping, and a rich set of vegetation, boundary, and land-use codes.
- A strong governance apparatus is embedded in permissions management, permanent survey markers, and explicit documentation to enable reliable longitudinal analyses and future data integration with other sources (e.g., satellite imagery, historical surveys).
- Data quality is anchored in standardized procedures, on-site decisions, and a robust metadata/schema approach, with explicit handling for incomplete data, changes in land use, and legacy data harmonization.
- The system anticipates ongoing data life-cycle needs: versioned upgrades, relocation for repeat surveys, and scalable data capture to support ongoing monitoring and ecological assessment.
