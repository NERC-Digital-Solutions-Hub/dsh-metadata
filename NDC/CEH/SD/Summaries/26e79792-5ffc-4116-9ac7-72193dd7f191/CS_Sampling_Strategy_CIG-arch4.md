# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and overall approach
- Documents the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field component up to 2007.
- Emphasizes linkage to 30 years of prior ITE Land Classification work and the importance of stratified, random sampling to obtain representative ecological data for Great Britain.
- Describes how data collection, classification, and sampling design evolved to support time-series analysis and country-specific reporting.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (foundation for sampling)
- 1978: First version used ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) to classify land into 32 classes based on environmental attributes; center squares of a 15x15 km grid formed the core dataset.
- 1984: Land-use emphasis; framework used 12 km squares per class (384 total) to support land-use change analyses; groundwork for national estimates of habitat features.
- 1990: All GB 1 km squares were considered; Land Classification revised to incorporate data for every square; urban/sea corrections added; 508 squares surveyed; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998: Major revision expanding to 40 classes to enable Scotland-only reporting; 569 squares surveyed; model updated to support regional/local estimates with a more comprehensive classification.
- 2000: CS2000 introduced to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) with 40 strata; substantial increase in sampled squares and a re-balanced framework to improve country-specific precision.
- 2007: CS2007 added Wales-only reporting enhancements; Wales received additional sub-division into new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; extra Welsh squares (minimum 6 per new Welsh class) to ensure adequate representation; some English classes’ sample counts adjusted accordingly.

## Sampling framework and design
- Core concept: stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation across GB.
- Primary sampling unit: 1 km squares classified into Land Classes; centre square plus surrounding four squares (to allocate class membership) for each sampled location.
- Sample size progression over time:
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; added urban/sea corrections; repeat vegetation quadrats).
  - CS2000: expanded to align with 40 classes and country-unit reporting; large increase in total squares.
  - CS2007: further refinements for Wales-only reporting; 45 strata; Wales receives additional samples with dedicated country-unit classes.

## Data collected and outputs
- Data focus includes habitat areas, land use, and vegetation/habitat mapping; CS1990 linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- Early surveys emphasized vegetation quadrats and soils; later surveys expanded to land-use features and habitat mapping.
- National estimates are derived by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of each class.
- Outputs include published main reports and country-specific results (England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific reporting in later years).

## Wales, uplands, and country-specific reporting
- Wales-specific reporting introduced due to devolved environmental policy needs.
- Wales received targeted class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and additional Welsh squares to improve Wales-only estimates.
- England and Wales were grouped for some estimates in early phases; by 2000, the framework supported separate country estimates with added upland modules to improve accuracy in upland habitats (30 extra squares in uplands for England and Wales).

## Data governance considerations for time-series and comparability
- National estimates can be derived using either the latest Land Classification or the original 1990 classification; the 2006 scoping study recommended using the latest for consistency within a survey year, though the older framework offers cross-survey comparability.
- Reclassification and subdivision of land classes affected representation across countries and time-series comparability, necessitating careful documentation of classification version for each survey.
- Some classes were under-represented in particular years/countries; this informed the decision to allocate additional squares and subdivide classes for Wales.

## Uplands module and additional methodological refinements
- CS2000 upland module added 30 squares to better estimate upland/habitat statuses in England and Wales.
- By CS2007, Wales received enhanced country-unit class subdivisions to support Wales-only reporting; England saw adjustments where Welsh squares were reallocated.

## Summary of implications for data strategy (Data Leaders view)
- Robust longitudinal monitoring relies on evolving, well-documented stratification frameworks that reflect policy needs (e.g., Wales-only and England+Wales reporting).
- Time-series integrity requires careful versioning of Land Classifications and transparent metadata to enable comparability across survey years.
- Balancing granularity (many Land Classes) with sample size is critical; targeted sub-divisions (e.g., Welsh classes) improve precision for specific jurisdictions.
- Data governance needs include explicit documentation of sampling allocations, class definitions, spatial coverage changes, and the impact of reclassification on national estimates.
- The approach demonstrates the value of a cohesive data system that links classification schemes, sampling design, field data collection, and national/country-specific reporting to support strategic ecological insights and policy-relevant analytics.
