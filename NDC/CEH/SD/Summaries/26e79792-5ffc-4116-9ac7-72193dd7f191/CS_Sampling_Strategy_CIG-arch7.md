# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the Sampling Strategy used for Countryside Survey field work up to 2007.
  - The strategy is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, rooted in 30 years of development since 1978.
  - Emphasizes understanding how the sampling framework and land classification underpin national, and country-specific, habitat estimates.

- The ITE Land Classification: evolution and purpose
  - Stratified sampling framework built on an environmental stratification of Great Britain.
  - Land classification converts environmental attributes into discrete classes to ensure representative sampling and enable robust national estimates.
  - Early method: classify a subset of 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid) and assign surrounding squares using the same class key.
  - Aims to reduce bias by stratifying across ecological variation (altitude, geology, climate, land use, etc.).

- 1978 – Initial land classification and field survey
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to derive 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 centre 1 km squares.
  - Included 4 surrounding squares per centre, giving a total of 6039 km squares classified.
  - Field survey: 8 squares per land class → 256 total squares.
  - National estimates of habitat areas were calculated from mean habitat area per square by class, multiplied by class area.

- 1984 – Second GB land-use survey
  - Sampling framework retained; increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - Results published with emphasis on landscape change.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification; Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990)
  - Extended classification to all GB squares; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - National estimates based on the revised classification (1990).

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification; preparation for CS2000
  - Recognized need to classify every square for regional/local estimates; used surrogates when full data were impractical.
  - Best simulation produced 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classification; non-matching squares generally fell into neighboring classes with similar characteristics.
  - Result: revised classification; some shifts distorted class representation for some areas.
  - Preparation for CS2000 included ensuring separate country reporting and addressing upland habitat estimates.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) and country-unit estimates
  - Introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales, and Scotland) to support policy and legislation needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants; 40 strata created through subdivisions and aggregation where necessary.
  - Additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; upland habitat module introduced to improve upland estimates in England and Wales.
  - Wales received more intensive sampling due to devolution requirements (Welsh-only reporting).
  - Table and map representations show the distribution and sampling rates across England, Scotland, and Wales.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) and Wales-focused adjustments
  - Addressed Wales-only reporting concerns with additional Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded Wales sampling.
  - Total of 45 strata (up from 40) and 43 additional Wales squares to ensure adequate representation.
  - England adjusted by not adding Welsh squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) retained with 4 squares per class, deemed adequate for English reporting.
  - Revised class maps and sampling framework for England, Wales, and Scotland.

- Outputs, representations, and data considerations
  - Outputs include numbers of squares surveyed per survey year, strata definitions, and sampling rates (e.g., 1:x values) for each class and country.
  - Maps and figures illustrate the revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and Scotland, and the distribution of sample squares.
  - Note on national estimates: changing the basic land classification used for estimation affects the consistency of stock estimates; preferable approaches vary by internal vs. cross-survey consistency.

- Practical implications for GIS specialists
  - The Land Classification serves as the primary stratification for GB-wide ecological sampling, enabling map-based habitat estimation and change detection.
  - Supports country-unit analyses (England with Wales; Scotland) and Wales-only reporting, requiring careful handling of class subdivisions and aggregations.
  - Data integration across time requires harmonization of classifications (original vs. revised) and alignment of sample squares with the appropriate land classes.
  - Upland modules and Wales-specific classes necessitate additional attribute handling to produce accurate, policy-relevant maps and statistics.
  - The framework demonstrates the challenges of evolving classifications with national-scale data, highlighting the need for clear documentation, provenance, and reproducible GIS workflows.
