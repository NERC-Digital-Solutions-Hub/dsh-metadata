# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aims and scope
  - Update land use databases and monitor rural environment changes to inform policy and ecological understanding.
  - Combine bottom-up field surveys with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) to construct a Britain-wide land cover map and ground-truth data.
  - Standardise field recording to enable reliable temporal comparisons and cross-observer consistency.
  - Provide current datasets for scientific evaluation and identify trends and processes in the countryside.

- Survey design and sampling
  - 512 sample squares across Britain, grouped into six teams, each square assigned to one of six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square planned for about three survey days; flexible scheduling, with travel-time management and no overtime payments (time off in lieu for large overtime).
  - Two-tier approach: 
    - Top-down mapping and ground-truthing via field survey.
    - Ground-based vegetation, land cover, and landscape data collection to calibrate and validate remote sensing outputs.
  - Permanence and repeatability: permanent markers and full relocation procedures to enable future re-surveys.

- Equipment and preparations
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, project explanations, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, and basic field tools.
  - Local ITE stations provide location maps, pencils, reference materials, cameras, lenses, films, first aid, and personal gear.
  - Materials support thorough field recording, ownership and farmer information, and field verification.

- Field procedures (overview)
  - On arrival: quick survey of the square, assess access, and identify potential problems.
  - Obtain permission to access the full square and plan a route enabling complete coverage.
  - After recording, review records for omissions and ensure clear presentation.
  - Prior permissions: contact landowners/farmers in advance; obtain consent for all areas; document and manage refusals with contingency actions (replace square if needed).

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions ensure legal access and good relations with landowners, plus background information for data recording.
  - If access is refused for all or part of a square, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon or adapt (replace square or survey accessible parts).
  - Documentation and identity verification (ITE ID card) are standard practice during field work.
  - Ownership and stakeholder information captured on FABs, with staff notes on cooperation levels to inform future access.

- Data recording and mapping (FAB)
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
  - Mapping is the most geographically comprehensive component, using enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with coded data boxes to capture multi-code attributes per feature.
  - Data coding strategy:
    - Use primary and secondary codes; primary codes are required and often bolded in code lists.
    - Alpha codes (letters) compress combinations of numeric codes for map labeling, with uppercase preferred and a defined convention (no X or 0 to avoid confusion; I not 1).
    - Codes are organized to reflect logical data flows (e.g., a boundary code should be followed by its residual descriptors).
  - Boundaries and features:
    - Mark actual and interpreted boundaries; use 999 to indicate no longer present.
    - Distinguish between boundaries (fences, walls, hedges, moorland boundaries, etc.) and other linear features.
  - Minimum mapping units and cross-referencing:
    - Minimum mapped unit: 1/25 hectare; minimum boundary length: 20 m.
    - Some features mapped with crosses to denote point information (e.g., a single tree, well).
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) as a support tool:
    - Identify features not on OS maps (isolated trees, new boundaries) and mark with dashed lines or crosses.
    - End API interpretations are for guidance and can be overridden by ground evidence.

- Filling in the FAB
  - Ensure neatness and legibility; square series numbers and ownership details recorded on every page.
  - Ownership page: mark ownership partitions, provide addresses, and rate owner/cooperation with T (tenant) and C (owner) markers; include contact preferences.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: capture conversation notes as background rather than a formal questionnaire.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, and other sections (e.g., land use, vegetation, boundaries) completed with standardized codes plus optional comments.
  - Colour conventions: use colours for complex built-up areas when necessary; map-built features are described by cover types with corresponding codes.
  - Documentation of recent changes and notes on uncertainty (qualifying notes allowed).

- Vegetation sampling and plot types (6.2)
  - General approach to vegetation data collection mirrors 1977/78 methodologies with updates for 1990.
  - Plot types and layout:
    - Quadrat plots: five large 200 m² quadrats per square, placed to sample different land-cover types; nested 4 m² and smaller subplots used to refine vegetation data; permanent metal markers for relocation.
    - Five small quadrats: 2 m x 2 m placed in five different semi-natural/natural land-cover types.
    - Linear plots: up to five 1 m wide plots along hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides to capture edge vegetation and linear features.
    - Boundary plots: 1–2 plots located at major linear boundaries where they intersect land cover types.
    - Verge plots: additional plots along road verges or tracks to capture roadside vegetation; supplementary plots enable coverage of multiple verge types (A/B roads, Yellow roads, construction tracks, etc.).
  - Plot relocation and placement:
    - Re-locate large quadrats using mapped boundaries; where land use has altered, relocate to the nearest suitable habitat type or establish a new plot on a boundary.
    - Linear plots relocate in relation to hedges, streams, and road edges, with rules to avoid overlap and maintain spacing.
  - Recording vegetation data:
    - Use a standard recording sheet with a list of about 200 common species plus a mechanism to add unlisted species.
    - Record species presence, relative cover in 5% increments, and note dominant species and vegetation type.
    - For complex mosaics, use primary codes for the dominant ground cover and secondary codes for secondary constituents.
    - Bryophytes and lichens have a restricted, predefined list for recording.
  - Species identification and combinations:
    - Experts allow certain species combinations when precise identification is difficult; predefined acceptable combinations are provided to ensure consistency with prior surveys.
  - Permanent markers and documentation:
    - Quadrats marked with metal plates; precise placement and orientation documented with sketches, distances, and photos.
  - Data from 6.2.1–6.2.5 emphasize standardized, repeatable methods to support GIS-ready data products and comparability over time.

- Sampling from freshwater biota (7)
  - Freshwater biota sampling from flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP) using standardized protocols.
  - Two samples per square when possible: flowing-water biota and standing-water biota (water beetles are a focus for NELUP).
  - Clear labeling, sample handling, and transport to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography and documentation
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to capture general appearance and key landscape context.
  - Plot number identifiers placed on-site; photos linked to FAB and field notes.

- Procedures after fieldwork
  - End-of-day checks: review FABs for omissions; avoid post-hoc data transcription unless damage necessitates it.
  - Transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly to ensure data integrity.

- Data handling and GIS readiness
  - The handbook establishes standardized field data structures, coding schemes, and mapping conventions designed to feed GIS-based data products (land cover maps, vegetation types, physical geography, ownership/landowner information, and infrastructure).
  - Permanent markers and consistent relocation enable longitudinal analyses for change detection and trend assessment.
  - The ITE Countryside Survey 1990 data aim to support integrated analysis with satellite imagery and ground-truthing for robust, policy-relevant land-use insights.
