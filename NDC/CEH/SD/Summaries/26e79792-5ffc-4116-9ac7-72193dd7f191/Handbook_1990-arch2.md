# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and context
  - Establish a consistent, time-series dataset to monitor countryside changes and support evaluation of ecological health and policy performance.
  - Build on prior ITE surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988) to provide current land use, vegetation, and landscape data; enable ground-truthing of remote sensing.

- Study design and timeline
  - 512 sample squares across Britain, grouped into six cohorts, each surveyed by teams from six ITE Research Stations.
  - Each square planned for about three survey days; flexible travel planning to minimize trips and overtime (time off in lieu, no initial overtime payments).
  - 1990 resurvey aims to update land cover, landscape, and vegetation data; increased sampling (128 additional sites to reach 512); integration with satellite-derived land cover mapping.

- Outputs and data handling
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) plus enlarged 1:10,000 maps, aerial photos, and accompanying documentation.
  - Standardised data recording codes (primary and secondary), designed to capture dominant cover, species composition, boundaries, ownership, and land use.
  - Permanently marked plots for repeatable relocation; data stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; emphasis on clear, clean data presentation for downstream analysis.

- Field equipment and materials
  - Field recording materials (FABs, 1:10,000 aerials, maps, clipboards, pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, marker plates, cameras, first aid, weather gear, etc.).
  - Equipment provision split between Merlewood and local ITE Stations; surveyors provide personal gear as needed.

- Permissions and access
  - Prior contact with landowners/farmers encouraged; formal permission required for full square access to avoid wasted effort.
  - Procedures for refusals documented (abandon, relocate, or adjust survey approach); keep coordinators informed.

- Data recording and coding system (FAB)
  - Mapping and recording of quadrats, boundaries, land use, ownership, and habitat features using coded data boxes.
  - Use of alpha codes to compress multi-code information; primary vs secondary codes; codes linked to logical data sequences (e.g., cover types followed by species or boundary type).
  - Clear guidance for mapping boundaries, ownership, and curtilages; attention to older vs. current boundary status (e.g., 999 for no longer present).

- Plot types and layout
  - Large 200 m2 quadrats and five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats per square; linear plots include hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides (up to 5 plots per type per square).
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots retained, with relocations as needed; procedures for boundary, hedge, stream, and watercourse plotting.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) placed near plot corners or boundaries to enable accurate relocation.

- Vegetation sampling and recording (6.2)
  - Standardised vegetation recording across plot types using nested quadrats; 200 m2 large quadrat with 4 m2 inner plots; five nested quadrats per large plot.
  - Field procedures enumerate species with a restricted list (plus unlisted species) and require 5% cover estimates within 5% categories.
  - Heavily documented handling of complex mosaics, dominance, and dominant codes; use of colour coding when necessary; dotted guidelines invite additional information.

- Plot relocation and relayout rules
  - For 1978 squares, relayouts should be as close as possible to original plots; if segments have changed (e.g., new land use), relocate to appropriate land cover boundaries.
  - Hedge, stream, and boundary plots have specific relocation rules to maintain sampling consistency over time; ensure plots remain >10 m apart when necessary.

- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square: one flowing water (IFE) and one standing water (NELUP), prioritising vegetated or representative habitats (lakes/ponds/dried pools, calcareous or acidic flushes, sphagnum pools, etc.).
  - Samples collected, labeled, preserved, and transported to Merlewood; detailed field labeling requirements and timing.

- Photography and documentation
  - Photography captured for each vegetation plot to document appearance and landmark references; plot numbers labeled on a board at plot edge.

- Quality control, training, and consistency
  - Emphasis on standardisation to reduce observer variation; field Handbook provides definitions and guidelines; observers are encouraged to record when categories are doubtful and to qualify notes.
  - Permanent markers and relocation workflows support longitudinal comparisons; ongoing monitoring to detect trends in land cover and vegetation.

- Scope of analyses for analysts monitoring the environment
  - Enables temporal comparison of land cover classes, vegetation composition, habitat types, and landscape features.
  - Supports integration with satellite imagery and bottom-up field data to improve land cover maps and detect pattern changes.
  - Provides rich metadata (ownership, land use, physiography, boundaries, and infrastructure) to support policy performance assessments and environmental health monitoring over time.
