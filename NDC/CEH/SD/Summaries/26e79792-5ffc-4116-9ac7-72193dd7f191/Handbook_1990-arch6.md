# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Update land-use databases, monitor changes, and support models of ecological systems in Britain.
  - Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/78 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System; aims to link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) through a two-tier approach.
  - Emphasizes current, comparable data and standardised field recording to enable robust analyses of landscape change.

- Survey design and management
  - 512 squares planned for 1990, with six ITE Research Stations; six teams, ~85 squares per team.
  - Sampling strategy prioritises consistency and efficiency (e.g., travel time minimised, flexible scheduling, no overtime unless compensated by time off).
  - Aims to re-survey previously studied squares and to add new plots to capture more detail and variation; permanent markers will aid future relocation.
  - QA and standardisation are central: thorough Field Handbook, definitions, and observer consistency are stressed.

- Data collected and data products
  - Three major components: mapping, vegetation recording (quadrats), and sampling; sampling includes aquatic/terrestrial components.
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) used to record data; combination of codes (primary/secondary) and alpha placeholders to compress complex information on maps.
  - A rich coding system for land cover, vegetation, boundaries, ownership, buildings/curtilages, boundaries, and other features; use of universal codes (e.g., 888–999) for non-mapped items.
  - API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) provides guidance to identify features not on OS maps; decisions should be grounded in ground truth.
  - Outputs include 1:10,000 maps with annotated data, FABs, photographs, and permanent markers to enable future dataset linkage.

- Field methods and data collection
  - Field Handbook emphasizes: “understand the ask,” data verification, cleaning, and transformation into usable formats; standardised procedures reduce observer variation.
  - Permissions and access
    - Prior engagement with landowners/farmers; obtain permission for full square access; document ownership and contact details.
    - Procedures for refusals: abandon square, or complete partial survey if feasible; notify Station Coordinator.
  - Data recording (FAB)
    - FABs combine maps and qualitative/quantitative data into units (maps coded by data boxes with primary/secondary codes).
    - Boundary types and edges must be clearly defined; update records if lines no longer exist.
    - Ownership and contact codes help plan follow-ups and collaborations without affecting analysis.
    - Instructions for handling complex mosaics: use dominant primary code and note uncertainties when necessary.
  - Mapping and coding
    - Use enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) for annotation; multiple codes per feature allow a richer, yet compact, record.
    - Avoid clutter by preferring alphanumeric codes; avoid ambiguous symbols; maintain field-to-lab coding consistency.
    - Minimum mappable unit: 1/25 hectare; minimum boundary length: 20 m.
  - Aerial photography and API
    - API conventions: dashed guidance lines for identified boundaries, Crosses for isolated features, Diamonds for boundaries no longer present.
    - API data used as supplementary guidance, subordinate to ground truth.
  - Vegetation sampling and plot types
    - Two primary sample types per square: freshwater biota (IFE) and freshwater biota (NELUP – water beetles focus).
    - Plot types:
      - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots (centered in habitat types) and five 4 m2 quadrats within semi-natural vegetation.
      - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) in natural/semi-natural land cover types per square.
      - Linear plots: up to 5 per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide); included rules to avoid overlap and ensure coverage across land types.
      - Boundary placement prioritised; relocation rules defined for hedges, streams, and ditch types.
    - Permanent marking: metal plates placed adjacent to plots to enable relocation; detailed sketching and distances recorded.
  - Species identification and recording
    - Standard species list of common taxa (crops, grasses, forbs, bryophytes, lichens) with coded abbreviations; allowances for species-combinations when exact ID is difficult.
    - Record up to 3 cover codes per mosaic and interpretive notes for ambiguous areas; bryophytes/lichens included with a restricted list.
  - Data quality and management
    - Emphasis on neat FABs, clear page headers, and consistent mappings; field notes and sketches are important for future data interpretation.
    - Permanent markers and grid references ensure repeatability across surveys and researchers.

- Sampling specifics and procedures
  - Quadrat sampling
    - Large quadrats: 5 x 200 m2 (randomly placed within habitat) plus 5 x 4 m2 within semi-natural vegetation.
    - Small quadrats: 5 x 2 m x 2 m squares in diverse land-cover types.
    - Location/relocation procedures to reflect land-use change or habitat shift; detailed guidelines for edge effects and alignment on ground.
  - Linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides)
    - Plots laid out with 1 m width; marker plates placed at endpoints; location relative to feature carefully described.
    - If existing linear plots from 1978 exist, relocation attempted; if not feasible, moved to nearest permissible boundary feature.
    - 1978 rules for locating linear plots explained (to be followed for consistency).
  - Species identification guidance
    - Emphasizes consistency with 1978/1988 surveys; certain taxonomic groups allowed to be recorded as combinations when necessary.
  - Freshwater sampling (IFE/NELUP)
    - Two standing-water samples per square from vegetated sites; procedures described elsewhere for IFE; NELUP focuses on water beetles with defined sampling and labeling.

- End-to-end workflow
  - End-of-day QA: review FABs for omissions; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless data are damaged.
  - Transport and storage: return FABs and samples to ITE Merlewood or respective stations promptly.
  - Documentation and contacts: clear channels to Station Coordinators; public access to publications and field handbooks for distribution.

- Tools and contacts
  - Equipment: FABs, aerial photos, large-scale and field maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking tools, survey poles, reference books, cameras, field notebooks, and personal gear.
  - Data and support: ITE (Merlewood Research Station) and six ITE Research Stations; Colin Barr and team (1990/1991 revision) as project leadership.

- Key challenges addressed
  - Ensuring consistent field recording across observers and years.
  - Managing patchy, multi-format data from diverse field conditions.
  - Balancing thorough data capture with practical field constraints (permissions, travel time, square relocation).
  - Enabling outputs to be self-serve for end users while maintaining data integrity for longitudinal analyses.
