COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - National-scale land use and vegetation survey to monitor changes in land cover, landscape, and vegetation data across Britain.
  - Two main sampling streams: field vegetation data (mapping, recording quadrats, sampling) and freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP components).
  - 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990; 128 new squares and 128 squares with no prior vegetation plots recorded.
  - Integration with satellite imagery and a two-tier field- and ground-truthing approach to link top-down and bottom-up data.

- Data governance, standards, and provenance
  - Clear, standardized field Handbook (Field Assessment Booklets, FABs) to ensure consistency across observers and survey teams.
  - Emphasis on data quality, comparability over time, and traceability of locations via permanent markers.
  - Ownership and permissions recorded on FABs; handling of landowner interactions and consent, with procedures if permission is refused.
  - Two-tier data model: mapping (location and codes) and vegetation sampling (plots, quadrats, species codes, and cover).

- Data architecture and workflow
  - Primary data capture via FABs, large 6" (1:10,000) maps, and field records; data subsequently consolidated and analyzed.
  - Mapping element uses coded data boxes to annotate features on maps; combinations of primary and secondary codes capture complex land-cover information.
  - Aerial photography interpretation (API) used to support boundary delineation, semi-natural vegetation boundaries, and identification of features not on OS maps.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) and field sketches ensure repeatable relocation of plots; full documentation of plot locations and distances is required.
  - Data capture supports trend analysis and cross-linkage with other datasets (e.g., satellite-derived land cover).

- Data quality, standardization, and coding
  - Strong emphasis on standardizing field recording to minimize observer variation; quality control planned throughout 1990 surveys.
  - Coding conventions:
    - Use of alpha codes to compress multiple numeric codes; uppercase letters only; avoid X, 0, or 1 look-alikes.
    - Each feature annotated with at least one primary code; dominant use prioritized when multiple codes apply.
    - Boundaries: mark present boundaries, note no-longer-present boundaries with code 999.
  - Minimum mapping units and dimensions:
    - Minimum mappable area: 1/25 hectare; minimum length: 20 meters.
  - FAB completion guidelines: neat, unambiguous entries; ownership, farmer interactions, and site descriptions all recorded; page- and plot-level details required for future analysis.

- Planning and field operations
  - Six teams (from six ITE Research Stations) each handling about 85 squares; flexible scheduling with travel planning to minimize backtracking; no overtime paid (time off in lieu for large overtime accumulations).
  - Travel-based budgeting and fieldwork logistics; multiple planning options for daily or multi-week assignments.
  - Permissions process:
    - Seek permissions to access all parts of a square; establish owner/occupier details; contact farmers directly when possible.
    - If permission is refused for all or part of a square, predefined contingencies apply (abandon or relocate square, or proceed partially if feasible).
  - Equipment checklist (FABs and site-specific field gear) provided by Merlewood and local ITE Stations; additional surveyor-provided gear listed.

- Data recording and mapping (FAB)
  - FABs combine data recording forms with adjacent 6" maps; order of pages is flexible but complete.
  - Ownership and farmer information: record owner/tenant names, contact details, and cooperation ratings to guide future surveys.
  - Physiography/Inland water/Coastal and Ground cover data capture:
    - Detailed physiographic, inland water, and coastal features coded and mapped.
    - Extensive ground-cover codes cover grasses, heath, mires, reeds, bracken, wetlands, crops, unimproved vs. cultivated grasslands, and various species groups.
  - Species and bryophytes/lichens:
    - Large listed plant species table (roughly 200 common species) with percentages of cover; unlisted species recorded in a separate section.
    - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from a restricted list with specific codes.
  - Boundaries, hedges, fences, walls, and other boundary types captured with descriptive and coded details.
  - Buildings/structures and communications:
    - Built-cover types cover urban-adjacent land and non-agricultural use; roads, verges, tracks, and other features recorded with a color-coding scheme for urban-curtilage vs. other land.
    - Descriptions include development status (new, derelict, vacant), public spaces, and designated versus non-designated recreational areas.
  - Universal coding and long-term Data integrity:
    - Codes support long-term comparability; universal map codes (e.g., 888 for new to map, 999 for no longer on map) standardize data across surveys.

- Plot types and relocation rules (6.2.3–6.2.5)
  - Quadrats:
    - Five large 200 m2 quadrats per square (arranged to sample major habitat types); five additional 2x2 m squares placed within semi-natural vegetation.
    - Permanent marking with metal plates; detailed relocation procedures for changes in land use; field-centred positioning and measurement from fixed references.
  - Linear plots:
    - Up to five 1 m wide linear plots along boundaries, hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; relocation rules based on field features and previous survey positions (1978 rules for locating linear plots).
    - Special rules ensure plots do not overlap and are placed at appropriate offsets from features like hedges, walls, fences, and banks.
  - Location and relocation:
    - For pre-1978 squares, relocate original plots as closely as possible; if hedgerows or boundaries no longer exist, document and adjust.
    - If new land use precludes vegetation quadrats, relocate to boundary features on or near the original site.
  - Laying out and recording:
    - Quadrats located at the “center of gravity” of the habitat; if not representative, re-randomize; linear plots positioned relative to dominant feature.

- Vegetation sampling methodology (6.2.2, 6.2.5)
  - Standardized vegetation recording across plot types; nested quadrat approach with a hierarchy of quadrat sizes; all vascular plants documented plus a restricted list of bryophytes/lichens.
  - Percent cover estimates in 5% bands; species naming guidance includes accepted combinations for difficult taxa to ensure consistency.
  - 200 common species list included; unlisted species added with a note and cover estimates; sketch maps included with each recording.
  - Photographs: every plot photographed to capture context and landmarks.

- Freshwater biota sampling (7)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square:
    - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) following a separate handbook.
    - Freshwater biota from standing waters for NELUP (water beetles focus, with field descriptions of sampling points and labeling).
  - Clear field protocols for labeling, sample handling, preservation (formalin), and transport to Merlewood.

- Photography and final survey procedures
  - Photography: prints of vegetation plots taken using film; plot numbers displayed on boards at plot edge for reference.
  - End-of-day quality checks: review FABs for omissions; avoid post-hoc transposition unless necessary due to damage; transport FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly.

- Outputs and stakeholders
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), maps, and plotted boundary/plot markers constitute primary outputs.
  - Data intended to support long-term ecological monitoring, trend analysis, and integration with broader data networks and policy-relevant analyses.

- Challenges and considerations for Data Leaders
  - Managing dispersed and evolving data sources, ensuring uniform standards across observers, and maintaining robust metadata and provenance.
  - Balancing field practicality (permissions, access, and logistics) with the need for consistent, reproducible data collection across a national program.
  - Coordinating with multiple partners (ITE stations, DOE/NERC-related initiatives, IFE/NELUP collaborators) to sustain a coherent data ecosystem and community of practice.
