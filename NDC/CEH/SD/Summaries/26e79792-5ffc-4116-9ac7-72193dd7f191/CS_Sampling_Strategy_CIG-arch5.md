# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Documents the evolution of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field surveys from 1978 to 2007.
  - Emphasizes the need to maintain a representative, time-series framework linked to prior surveys, while accommodating devolved administrations (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland contexts.
  - Series of revisions aimed at improving national and country-specific estimates and enabling Wales- and Scotland-only reporting.

- Data Classification: The ITE Land Classification
  - Began with 32 land classes (center squares of a 15x15 km grid) using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) and multivariate analysis (Indicator Species Analysis) to group 1 km squares.
  - Early implementation used a center-square approach plus surrounding squares to create 6039 km² of classified area; eight samples per class for the first GB survey (256 total).
  - Over time, the classification expanded and was revised to better represent broader GB landscapes:
    - 1984: Land Classification expanded for 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - 1990: All GB squares classified; adaptation to support regional and local estimates; introduction of Land Cover mapping linkage.
    - Post-1990: Class counts increased to 40 (1998 revision) and later to 45 (2007 revision) to enable Scotland- and Wales-specific reporting.
  - Shifts in classification required methodological adjustments to preserve comparability across surveys.

- Sampling Framework and Survey Phases
  - 1978 CS: 256 field squares (8 per land class) using the original classification; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square times class area.
  - 1984 CS: Increased sample to 12 squares per class (total 384) to improve precision; continued use of the 32-class framework.
  - 1990 CS: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares reclassified under an expanded framework; added linkage to first Land Cover Map of GB; national estimates based on 1990 classification with some square reallocation.
  - 2000 CS (CS2000): Further refinement to enable separate country estimates; sub-division and aggregation of classes to form 40 strata; added 19 new squares to ensure adequate representation; upland habitat module introduced to improve upland estimates; Wales-specific adjustments increased sampling in Wales.
  - 2007 CS (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements led to Welsh country-unit sub-divisions (five new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); overall strata increased to 45; added 43 Welsh squares; English sampling adjusted to maintain comparability; uplands module expanded for better England & Wales upland estimates.

- Geographic Stratification and Country Reporting
  - Country-unit framework established to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-specific estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to reflect country-specific land-use patterns.
  - Class aggregation used where a country had few squares in a class, ensuring minimum representation.
  - Wales received focused sampling enhancements (and Wales-specific sub-classes) to meet policy/reporting needs; England adjustments compensated for the removal of Welsh squares to maintain balanced representation.
  - The Isle of Man was removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with additional English squares for England–Wales reporting.

- Data Updates, Documentation, and Governance
  - The document traces the lineage of the sampling strategy, emphasizing the need for documentation and metadata to track changes in Land Classification and sampling schemes across surveys.
  - Notes potential consistency issues when switching classifications for national estimates; recommends using the latest country-specific classifications for consistency within a given survey while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Outputs across surveys include tables, maps, and narratives describing the distribution of sample squares and strata; publications include Countryside Survey 1990 main report, CS2000 summary publications, and CS2007 Wales-specific reporting guidance.

- Outputs, Outputs Management, and Accessibility
  - Results have been published in progressive UK-wide and country-specific reports (e.g., CS1990 main report, CS2000 framing, CS2007 Wales-focused guidance) to support policy, planning, and habitat assessment.
  - Figure and table representations (land-class maps, sampling-square distributions) accompany narrative text to enable transparent data interpretation and reuse.

- Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
  - Maintain a robust, historically consistent land classification framework while accommodating country-specific reporting needs.
  - Ensure clear documentation of classification revisions, sample allocations, and strata definitions to preserve traceability and reproducibility of national/country estimates.
  - Implement metadata practices capturing: classification version, country-unit subdivisions, sample sizes per class and per survey, and upland module status.
  - Manage data lineage across surveys to support time-series analyses and inter-survey comparability, including handling of reclassified squares and class sub-divisions.
  - Align data dissemination with policy needs by supporting Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting capabilities, while preserving overall GB comparability.
  - Track and mitigate potential biases arising from differential sampling intensities across countries and across classes, especially during transitions between classifications.
  - Preserve accessibility of historical outputs (maps, tables, reports) to support long-term ecological monitoring and decision making.

- Key Challenges and Lessons Learned
  - Balancing representativeness with practical constraints: ensuring adequate sample sizes in under-represented classes and in specific countries (notably Wales) while keeping the survey feasible.
  - Managing changes in the classification system over time and maintaining cross-survey comparability; some squares change class, affecting national estimates.
  - Devolution-driven needs necessitated country-specific reporting frameworks, leading to targeted class subdivisions and additional sampling.
  - The need for ongoing methodological updates (including upland modules) to improve precision for niche habitat types and to support country-based decision making.

- Endnotes and Further Reading
  - The document references extensive historical development, with key outputs including CS1990 main report, CS2000 summaries, and CS2007 Wales-specific guidance, illustrating the long-term data governance approach underpinning Countryside Survey.
