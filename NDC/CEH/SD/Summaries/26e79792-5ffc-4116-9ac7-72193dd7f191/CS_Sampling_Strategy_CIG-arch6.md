# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose
  - Describes the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) field surveys in Great Britain, linking past methodologies to the 2007 survey.
  - Emphasises the importance of stratified, representative sampling and the continuity of time-series data for detecting change.

- Core concept: stratified, random sampling with the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification carved GB land into discrete land classes (strata) to ensure representative sampling and reduce bias.
  - The sampling unit was typically 1 km squares, with field surveys focusing on vegetation, habitats, land use, and related features.
  - National estimates derive from: for each class, the mean habitat area per square times the total area of that class; then summing across classes.

- Early version: the original ITE Land Classification (CS1978)
  - 32 land classes built from environmental attributes.
  - Used a center 1 km square plus four surrounding squares to form a set; classification based on Quadrat-like environmental data.
  - Field sampling targeted 8 squares per class (total 256 squares) across GB.
  - Provided a framework for estimating habitat areas via class proportions.

- 1984 update (CS1984)
  - Expanded coverage to 12 squares per land class (total ~384 squares).
  - Aimed to improve national estimates; results later linked to the 1978 classification.

- 1990 advancement: All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every square in GB (full spatial coverage).
  - Urban and sea corrections incorporated; 508 squares were surveyed.
  - Reused and extended data from the 1984 survey; results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 revision and 1998 field survey (CS1998 / CS1990-era updates)
  - Recognised need to represent GB at regional/local scales; expanded to 40 land classes.
  - The 1998 revision allowed separate reporting for Scotland, reflecting policy needs.

- 2000 framework: CS2000 developments and country-specific estimates
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England & Wales, Scotland) to enable country-specific estimates.
  - Class-based representation adjusted (40 strata total) with aggregation where necessary to maintain representation.
  - Additional sampling:
    - 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new country-unit classes.
    - 11 extra squares to balance England vs. Wales sampling rates (some adjustments by class and country).
  - A new uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates for upland areas in England and Wales.
  - Outputs included revised maps and a comprehensive table of square allocations and sampling rates.

- 2007 update: Wales-focused reporting and Wales-only adjustments (CS2007)
  - Wales required Wales-only estimates; existing Wales sampling (64 squares) was deemed insufficient for robust Wales-only reporting.
  - Implemented country-unit subdivisions for Wales within land classes, creating additional Welsh-specific classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and increasing the total strata to 45.
  - Added 43 more Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation (≥6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: to maintain balance, no analogous increases were made for England; some English classes ended with as few as four squares, deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
  - Revised country maps (England, Wales, Scotland) and updated CS2007 sample square distributions.

- National estimates and cross-survey consistency
  - The method of national estimation can vary depending on whether the latest land classification or the original (1990) classification is used.
  - For a given survey, using the latest classification provides consistency within that survey, but cross-survey comparability may be affected.
  - Table and note guidance illustrate how sample counts per class change with different classifications across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

- Uplands module (CS2000)
  - Added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland land classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
  - This module supported country-based reporting needs and enhanced accuracy for higher-altitude habitats.

- Outputs and documentation
  - Maps and tables illustrate the distribution of land classes and sample squares across GB and by country.
  - Key tables (e.g., CS2000 and CS2007 summaries) detail the numbers of squares, strata, and sampling rates by class and country.
  - Acknowledges substantial collaboration and methodological guidance from researchers and institutes (ITE, DETR/DEFRA, CEH).

- Overall arc
  - The Sampling Strategy evolved from a small, evenly distributed, 32-class framework to a comprehensive, country-specific, multi-class scheme.
  - Emphasis remained on representativeness, temporal consistency, and the ability to produce robust, self-contained country-level environmental estimates.
  - The 2007 adjustments reflect policy and governance changes, notably devolved reporting requirements for Wales and the need to maintain UK-wide time-series integrity.
