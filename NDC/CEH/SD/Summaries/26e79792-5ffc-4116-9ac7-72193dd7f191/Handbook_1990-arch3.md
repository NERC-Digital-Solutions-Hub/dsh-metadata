# Countryside Survey 1990

## Aim
- Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy and inform future decisions.
- Update land-use and ecological datasets by standardized, comparable monitoring across GB.
- Link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing through a two-tier approach (field survey plus satellite imagery) using the ITE Land Classification System.
- Ensure outputs are clear, timely, and suitable for policy stakeholders, with data governance and openness considerations.

## Scope and Context
- National land-use and countryside monitoring project conducted by ITE, building on earlier surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988) using a consistent Land Classification System.
- Aims to resurvey in 1990 to capture land cover, landscape change, and vegetation data, enabling trend analyses and ecological evaluation.
- Plan to expand sampling to 512 sites (512 squares), with enhanced data capture, ground-truthing, and collaboration; satellite imagery will be used to construct a Britain-wide land-cover map and connect top-down and bottom-up data.

## Methodology and Data Capture
- Fieldwork conducted with standardized procedures to reduce observer variation; emphasis on data quality, metadata, and clear presentation.
- Data collected via Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and 1:10,000 aerial/in-situ mapping, using a comprehensive coding system (primary and secondary codes) to annotate features, boundaries, and land-cover types.
- Vegetation data collected through a two-tier plot system:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m², with nested smaller quadrats (5 x 4 m²; 5 x 2 m² etc.) for detailed vegetation recording.
  - Small quadrats: 5 x 2 m² in five different land-cover types per square.
- Linear plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (up to 5 per square) to capture landscape structure and species assemblages.
- Permanent marking: metal plates or markers to enable precise relocation of plots across surveys.
- API (aerial photo interpretation) used to assist boundary delineation and identification of features not readily visible on maps; field decisions prevail when ground evidence conflicts with API.
- Species data: extensive lists (about 200 common species) recorded; 5% cover categories used; combinations allowed for difficult species identifications; bryophytes and lichens recorded with a restricted list.
- Vegetation data are complemented by notes, sketches, and photographs; all plots require accurate location data, bearings, and distance measurements.

## Planning and Logistics
- Sample squares grouped into six teams from six ITE research stations, with about 85 squares per team.
- Each square expected to take three survey days; flexible scheduling for station coordinators; travel time minimized; no overtime payments (compensated with time off in lieu if needed).
- Surveying strategies include local daily travel, temporary relocations, and multi-week blocks for grouped squares; travel and logistics planned to balance cost and coverage.

## Permissions and Access
- Prior permission from farmers/landowners is essential to access all parts of a square and to gather background information.
- Early communication includes letters to known landowners and site occupiers; on-the-ground confirmation of access arrangements.
- If permission is refused for all or parts of a square, actions include abandoning the square or relocating to a new one; partial permission prompts adjusted surveying within allowed areas.
- Ownership information is recorded on the FAB; coordination with station coordinators to manage access issues and inform stakeholders.

## Data Recording, Mapping, and Documentation (FAB)
- Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling details in Section 7.
- Mapping (6.1): annotate enlarged maps with data codes for land-cover and landscape features; use a system of primary and secondary codes, with an emphasis on logical code ordering (e.g., dominant code first).
- Aerial Photo Interpretation (6.1.1): standardized conventions for boundary marking, feature crosses, and “no longer present” boundaries; API is guidance and may be superseded by ground truth.
- Filling in the FAB (6.1.2): careful completion of all pages; each page includes square series number, ownership details, and notes; instructions for recording vegetation, thresholds, and coding; use of colour codes if necessary to manage complexity.
- 6.2.1–6.2.5 provide general guidance for vegetation sampling, plot types, locating and relocating plots, and species identification (including guidelines for difficult taxa and standardized lists).

## Plot Types and Field Procedures
- Quadrat plots: large 200 m² plots with nested subplots; small 2 x 2 m plots in natural/semi-natural areas; permanent markers for relocation; robust field notes and sketches for each plot.
- Linear plots: hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides, laid out with fixed rules to avoid overlap and ensure representative sampling; permanent marker plates used; documentation includes exact placement relative to features.
- Boundary and other linear features: location guidelines ensure plots are positioned at appropriate distances from boundaries; relocation rules following historic survey placements (1978 rules) when squares were previously recorded.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots retained as a backbone for consistency; detailed guidance on plot width, placement, and data collection along vertical features (hedges, walls, fences) and along water edges where applicable.

## Freshwater Sampling (7)
- Two freshwater biota samples per square:
  - Flowing water biota samples collected by the Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) according to a separate handbook.
  - Standing water biota samples collected for the NERC/ESRC Land Use Programme (NELUP) focusing on water beetles.
- Sampling sites include lakes/lochs, ponds, dried-up streams, calcareous/acict flushes, sphagnum pools, and animal/vehicle track depressions; samples preserved with formalin and labeled with square number, date, and collector.
- Clearly marked sample sites on maps; rapid transport to Merlewood for processing.

## Photography (8)
- Print photography of all vegetation plots to document appearance and key landscape features; plot numbers displayed on a board at the plot edge to aid location.

## Procedures Subsequent to Survey (9)
- End-of-day data checks to ensure completeness and consistency.
- Data and FABs should be transported to ITE stations promptly; avoid re-working maps unless necessary due to damage or loss.
- Emphasis on timely submission of data and samples for processing and quality assurance.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- The Countryside Survey 1990 embodies a comprehensive, standardized monitoring framework combining ground-based surveys with remote-sensing inputs to assess environmental health and land-use change.
- It demonstrates rigorous data governance considerations (permissions, ownership, openness constraints, relocation protocols, and permanent plot markers) and a strong emphasis on metadata, reproducibility, and QA.
- The approach highlights the importance of detailed coding schemes (primary/secondary codes, universal codes) and structured field forms (FABs) to enable consistent, scalable analysis across observers and years.
- It acknowledges practical barriers to monitoring (data gaps, access barriers, siloed data, metadata inadequacy) and provides operational strategies to mitigate these, including stakeholder engagement, data standardization, and governance provisions.
- The document serves as a model for designing long-term environmental health monitoring programs that aim to inform policy and future decision-making while balancing field practicality, data integrity, and data sharing considerations.
