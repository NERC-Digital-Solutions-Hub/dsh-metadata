# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Comprehensive assessment of the accuracy and reliability of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Aimed to quantify observer error, timing/seasonal effects, plot relocation reliability, and to inform methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Aims and scope

- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate findings to previous comparative work and recommend methodological modifications for future surveys.

## Methods and QA design

- Two main QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares, assessed against sketch-map relocations; two independent assessors compared results.
  - 1991: enhanced QA using photographs of plots; additional self-assessment squares; included a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes.
- Plot types assessed (representing original Countryside Survey methods):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots: roadsides, verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries
- Relocation assessment:
  - Plots relocated against sketch maps; plate-based relocation for X-quadrats; photographs used to re-establish position.
  - Recovery rates: Autumn 1990 plate/plot recovery about 71% (plate) and 87% (plots) in one assessment; 65% plate and 87% plots in 1991 assessment (Table 1 data).
- Species concordance measures:
  - Four concordance indices used to compare plot species lists between times (i1–i4), including % agreement, agreement, and % accuracy.
- Coverage and mapping:
  - Vegetation cover estimates recorded and compared; land-use mapping codes evaluated for consistency.
- Temporal and land-use framing:
  - Analyses partitioned by landclass aggregates (LC, LG, MA, UP) and plot types; assessed within-year vs between-year changes.

## Key findings: accuracy and agreement

- Overall species list concordance:
  - Initial overall concordance around 60.9% (Table 4); improved to about 60–75% depending on method and exclusion criteria.
- Efficiency of recording:
  - Initial efficiency (accuracy) of recording around 74% for 1990 survey (preliminary QA breakdown).
- Year-to-year changes:
  - 1991 reassessment showed a statistically significant increase in mean species per plot (1990: ~20.9; 1991: ~23.4), largely due to real seasonal/annual changes and improved detectability; some portion attributed to greater assessor efficiency.
  - Seasonal/annual effects were substantial in some land classes; caution needed when comparing across years or drought vs normal years.
- Plot-type and location effects:
  - X-plots and roadverges more reliably relocated; Y-plots were the most challenging.
  - Upland plots showed less seasonal impact than lowland plots; relocation difficulties increased in unenclosed, upland areas.

## Sources of variation and error (categories)

- A) Mis-identification
- B) Species overlooked in the original survey
- F) Seasonal/annual effects (true ecological change)
- G/H) Plot mis-location and mis-orientation
- I) Overlooked species at re-survey
- J) "Mysteries" or irreconcilable discrepancies
- D/E) Variations due to management changes, crop changes, erosion, etc.
- The study found that many T1 errors were confounded by seasonal/annual changes; thus, some apparent mis-recordings reflect real ecological shifts rather than observer error alone.
- Overall, analysis suggested approximately 60–75% agreement across plots, with around 25–40% categorized as variations due to mis-location, mis-identification, or coverage assignments.

## Vegetation cover observations

- Cover estimates for dominant species showed limited significant differences between 1990 and 1991 for many species, but notable differences occurred for several common grasses and forbs, influenced by seasonal conditions and plot location.
- Bryophyte and lichen recording gaps identified as a notable source of species-level discrepancy; recommended to improve training and include more bryophyte references in field handbooks.

## Land-use mapping and coding performance

- Primary land-use codes:
  - High concordance (around 88–95% overall agreement); lowland arable and grassland codes were particularly reliable.
- Boundary features:
  - Slightly lower concordance (around 80–83%), with some assessor-pair effects; boundary coding less consistent than land-use coding.
- Qualifying codes and Level agreement:
  - Some variation due to interpretation of qualifying codes; overall Level agreement remained reasonable (around 66–89% depending on code category).
- Upgrading land-use code schemes:
  - Recommendations to subdivide certain upland and lowland codes, add new codes (e.g., upland rush pasture, wet heath), and restrict some boundary and cover codes to improve reproducibility.

## Mapping of species cover and point-based assessments

- Point-grid comparisons showed reasonable concordance for dominant species at a given point (about 81% for single-species presence across times); co-dominants had much lower concordance (around 34%), and multi-species co-dominant matches were rare (about 5%).
- Recommendation: focus mapping on the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility; reduce reliance on more detailed co-dominant coding.

## Recommendations and implications for future surveys

- Photographs are highly valuable for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; future QA should systematically include photographic localization and ensure photographers annotate features.
- For relocation efficiency:
  - Use metal marker plates where feasible (especially in enclosed land); however, relocation in upland unenclosed areas remains time-consuming; consider additional manpower for such areas.
  - Improve quadrat positioning techniques, particularly for small Y-plots; ensure photographs clearly show the plot area and nearby distinguishing features.
- Timing of QA:
  - Conduct QA as close as possible to the initial survey season to minimize seasonal/annual variation confounding error estimates.
- Species identification and bryophytes:
  - Train specifically on grasses and bryophytes; consider expanding allowable bryophytes in field lists for wetter habitats; add habitat-specific species lists where appropriate.
- Land-use and vegetation mapping codes:
  - Expand primary land-use code set; simplify mapping by focusing on the most prevalent species rather than exhaustive cover for all species.
  - Subdivide upland and lowland categories as recommended (e.g., subdivide upland grassland; create a distinct wet heath category).
  - Limit or better define boundary codes; restrict the primary boundary code to hedge with explicit hedge composition in qualifying codes.
- Data quality and comparability:
  - Ensure QA comparisons account for same-year, same-season constraints; avoid cross-season comparisons for change statistics where possible.
  - When reporting change statistics, explicitly separate observer-related mis-recording from genuine ecological changes.

## Concluding notes

- Sensible use of photographs, precise plot marking, and season-consistent QA significantly improve data quality and reliability.
- The Countryside Survey 1990 QA exercise provides a robust framework for interpreting observer effects, plot relocation challenges, and land-use coding reliability, informing clearer data standards and better-designed future surveys.
