# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - Document the scope of quality assurance (QA) for the 1990 Countryside Survey.
  - Quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics, explain differences due to observer error, time of year, plot location, and relate findings to previous surveys.
  - Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics for future surveys.

- Aims and context
  - Measure accuracy of field recordings and the reliability of change statistics (1990 vs 1991).
  - Attribute differences to observer error, seasonal/annual factors, plot location, and information type.
  - Compare with ITE survey results and guide future survey methodology and training.

- Methods and QA design
  - Two QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed using original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
    - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of plots; 1 km squares from each of 32 terrain classes; paired assessors revisited 28–29 squares; included a self-assessment set of squares.
  - Plot types covered: 200 m2 X-quadrats, 4 m2 Y-quadrats, 1 x 10 m linear plots, roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; nine predetermined points per quarter-square for landcover and features.
  - Plate relocation and location accuracy assessed using sketches, photographs, metal detectors, and ground markers.
  - Data comparison metrics: species concordance indices (percentage agreement, agreement, etc.), % accuracy, and efficiency of recording; cover estimates analyzed by Wilcoxon tests; DECORANA axis analysis for ecological gradients.

- Key findings: accuracy, consistency, and changes
  - Plot relocation and plate findings
    - Autumn 1990: 71% recovery rate for plate/plot relocation within ~5 minutes; categories of performance defined (plate and plot relocated, plate/plot not found, etc.).
    - 1991: Plate relocation approx. 65% and plots found about 87%; relocation success improved when using photographs.
  - Species recording consistency
    - Initial analyses showed moderate agreement (roughly around 45–60% depending on metric); overall species counts per plot tended to be higher in 1991 QA than in 1990.
    - Across 21 squares, mean species per plot rose from ~20.2 (1990) to ~20.9–23.4 (1991 depending on subset); significant differences emerged when pooling data, with 1991 showing a real increase in species recorded per plot, likely due to genuine seasonal/annual variation and improved identification.
    - Seasonal/annual effects (e.g., drought in 1990) influenced species lists; annual variation likely contributed substantially to differences.
  - Variation by land class and plot type
    - Lowland arable (LC) showed comparatively lower accuracy than other land classes; upland (UP) and other classes generally more robust.
    - X plots relocated more easily; Y plots (small 4 m2) hardest to relocate accurately; roadverges and hedges showed relatively higher relocation success.
  - Cover estimates
    - Visual cover estimates were generally consistent but showed significant differences for a number of common species between surveys, particularly grasses; bryophytes and some species groups required more careful treatment.
  - Ecological gradient analyses (DECORANA)
    - Axis 1 shifts between 1990 and 1991 indicated changes in vegetation composition consistent with broader land-use changes; however, the overall axis shifts were not consistently significant across all plot types.
    - Upland vs lowland differences highlighted distinct vegetation gradients, with uplands showing more stable axis scores.
  - Mapping and land-use coding (data governance perspective)
    - Primary land-use code consistency was high (approx. 88.7% overall), with boundary codes slightly lower (around 80–83% depending on time period and assessor pairings).
    - Agreement for land-use qualifiers and level codes generally good, reflecting careful coding; however, interpretation and code definitions caused some mismatches.
    - Boundary and cover-code mismatches often stemmed from ambiguous qualification codes or missing definitions in the codebook.
  - Mapping of species cover
    - Point-based species cover mapping showed about 81% concordance for dominant species across time points; co-dominant arrangements dropped concordance markedly (e.g., only 34% for two co-dominants).
    - Findings suggest robust mapping for the most prevalent species but limited reproducibility for less dominant components; focus on the two most prominent species improves reproducibility.

- Data governance implications and quality considerations
  - Timing and seasonality
    - QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey to minimize seasonal/annual variation confounding results.
  - Relocation and documentation
    - Photographs significantly aid plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; explicit annotation linking photos to plots improves reproducibility.
    - Ground markers (plates) were helpful but time-consuming in upland unenclosed areas; additional personnel may be needed for relocation in such areas.
  - Metadata and codes
    - The existing field handbook and codes were largely robust but had ambiguities in certain land-use and boundary codes; this affected reproducibility.
    - There is a need to simplify and standardize mapping codes to reduce interpretive variation and improve cross-survey comparability.
  - Training and species identification
    - Training should emphasize similar taxa and vegetative identification of common grasses; include bryophytes more explicitly, especially in wetland/mire contexts.
  - Temporal comparability for QA
    - QA should ideally be conducted in the same year as the original survey or, if not possible, with careful control of temporal factors.

- Recommendations (key actions for future surveys)
  - R1: Retain lichens in general surveys, with targeted training and habitat context to aid identification.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey timing to minimize seasonal/annual variation effects.
  - R3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the plot, including distances to nearby features; ensure clear linkage between photo, sketch, and plot location.
  - R4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land to improve relocation accuracy.
  - R5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with precise surveying technique: use a tape, orient the plot so the side (not diagonal) is N-S, place at the SE corner; improve ground positioning methods.
  - R6–R7 (implicit in the QA package): Ensure robust annotation and cross-linking of data sources (sketch, photo, plate) for each plot; maintain a consistent relocation protocol.
  - R8–R12 (coding and mapping refinements):
    - Sub-divide upland grassland codes (102) into more specific categories (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland) to reduce misclassification.
    - Introduce a lowland rush pasture code.
    - Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with an appropriate primary code.
    - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge and document species composition with qualifying codes.
    - Simplify mapping by limiting to the two most prevalent species, improving reproducibility and comparability across surveys.
    - Enhance guidance and definitions for forb cover and hedge management codes to reduce misapplication.
  - Additional recommendations
    - Maintain a stricter regime for data quality attribution by distinguishing misidentifications, overlooked species, over-recording, and exact plot repositioning issues.
    - Improve training materials for bryophyte and grass identification and consider expanding allowable bryophyte lists in habitat-specific surveys.

- Mapping and data quality notes (summary)
  - Primary land-use codes show high reliability; minor categories are limited by sample sizes.
  - Point-by-point land-use and boundary code comparisons reveal high overall concordance across time periods, with some variation due to assessor differences.
  - Cover mapping shows high concordance for dominant species but limited reproducibility for co-dominant or minor species; two-species mapping approach recommended.

- Conclusions and implications for Data Stewards
  - The Countryside Survey QA demonstrates that a structured QA regime, including photography, marker plates, and standardized codes, materially improves data reliability but also reveals persistent sources of error (seasonality, relocation, and code interpretation).
  - For data stewardship, key takeaways are to ensure:
    - Clear, versioned metadata about survey timing, plot relocation methods, and data-capture protocols.
    - Documentation of QA procedures and results to support data quality flags and provenance.
    - Standardized, well-documented coding schemes with explicit definitions to reduce interpretive variance.
    - Availability of supporting materials (sketches, photographs, plates) to enable reproducibility and re-use of the data.
    - Training materials updated to reflect identified gaps (lichens, bryophytes, grasses, boundary and land-use codes).
  - Overall, QA results align with prior work (ITE/ECOLUC) and support cautious interpretation of year-to-year change statistics, particularly in more diverse land classes and where seasonal effects are pronounced.
