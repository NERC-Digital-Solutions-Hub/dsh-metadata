# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and context
  - Describes the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007 and how it evolved from the ITE Land Classification developed over 30 years.
  - Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative national?regional estimates of habitat and land-use features.
  - Shows how the Land Classification underpins sample allocation and national estimates.

- Core concepts: stratification and land classification
  - Sampling stratified by Land Classes to capture ecological variability across Great Britain.
  - Land Classification built from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create classes that group similar ecological features.
  - Early approach used a 1 km square sampling unit; neighbouring squares around classified centres were assigned to classes to form strata.

- CS1978 – Initial survey and framework
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to derive 32 Land Classes from environmental data for 1,228 centre squares (plus 4 surrounding squares per centre).
  - Final set included 6,039 km squares classified; sampling targeted eight 1 km squares per Land Class (256 total).
  - National estimates derived by: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class × area of that Land Class.
  - Output focused on vegetation, soils, habitat mapping; habitat area estimates reported by Land Class.

- CS1984 – Second GB field survey
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per Land Class (total 384 squares, including previously visited eight).
  - Revisited 1984 survey sites to compare change; results used the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Provided landscape-change statistics and refined understanding of spatial patterns.

- CS1990 – All-Squares classification and third survey
  - Unified Land Classification to classify every GB 1 km square (more comprehensive regional/local estimates).
  - Conducted a third field survey with 508 squares surveyed; repeated the 1984 features and vegetation quadrats.
  - Linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB; some squares reclassified, with urban/sea corrections.
  - National estimates based on the new, all-squares classification; highlighted need for consistency between classifications over time.

- CS2000 – Revised classification and country-based reporting
  - Recognised the need to produce separate reliability for England & Wales versus Scotland; introduced country-unit estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into England-with-Wales and Scotland versions, creating 40 strata; some classes aggregated within countries to maintain representation.
  - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; 11 more to balance England and Wales sampling rates.
  - Implemented an uplands module to improveHabitat estimates in upland England/Wales by adding 30 additional squares within relevant Land Classes.
  - Wales was identified as under-sampled for Wales-only reporting; adjustments increased Wales-specific sampling ( Welsh classes 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w among others).
  - England-only adjustments did not always require extra squares; some classes in England remained at lower per-class counts.

- CS2007 – Wales-focused reporting and further refinements
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to additional Welsh sampling and country-unit sub-divisions, resulting in five new Welsh Land Classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata.
  - Increased Welsh sampling to ensure six squares per Welsh class; some English classes (5e, 15e) remained with four squares per class due to balanced precision considerations.
  - The revised Land Classification maps for England with Wales and Scotland reflected these changes; Wales became more prominently represented in the national framework.
  - Introduction of country-level sampling maps and tables showing the distribution of sample squares by class and country.

- Upland and reporting modules
  - CS2000 uplands module added 30 extra squares to improve habitat estimates in uplands and marginal uplands.
  - CS2007 maintained Wales-focused reporting with extended country-unit stratification to meet devolution-era policy and legislation needs.

- Data outputs and interpretation
  - Each survey cycle produced maps of Land Classes and sample squares, alongside tables detailing the number of squares surveyed by class and country.
  - Emphasis on being able to produce robust, country-specific estimates (England & Wales together, Scotland) and, later, Wales-only results.
  - The approach aimed to balance precision and representation across varied landscape types and administrative regions.

- Summary of evolution and rationale
  - 1978: Establish a stratified, random sampling framework using a 1 km Land Classification.
  - 1984: Increase sample within classes to improve precision and enable change detection.
  - 1990: Move to all-squares Land Classification for finer regional/local estimates; standardize across time with urban/sea corrections.
  - 2000: Expand to separate country-unit reporting; subdivide classes to reflect England-with-Wales and Scotland; introduce upland sampling.
  - 2007: Refine Wales-specific reporting with additional Welsh classes and enhanced Welsh sampling; adjust English sampling where appropriate; further develop upland coverage.
