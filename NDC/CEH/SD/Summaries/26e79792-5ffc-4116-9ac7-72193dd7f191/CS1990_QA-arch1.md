# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A comprehensive QA study of the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify recording accuracy, explain inter-surveyor differences, relate findings to prior work, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Methods
- Two QA phases:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using sketch maps; two independent assessors.
  - 1991 (June–Sept): added photographs of plots; 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes; self-assessment of additional squares.
- Sampling design:
  - One quarter of each square resurveyed, covering six plot types (X quadrats, Y plots; road verges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries).
  - Plot relocation targeted using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detector-flagged plates; standard field procedures maintained.
- Data collection:
  - Nine predetermined points per quarter for landcover and boundary features.
  - Additional self-assessment squares to gauge consistency.
- Metrics:
  - Species concordance indices (percentage agreement, common species, total recorded, and accuracy excluding seasonal/annual changes).
  - Initial efficiency of recording; comparisons of 1990 and 1991 results; DECORANA analysis to study ecological gradients.
- Annexes and supplementary analyses cover mapping codes, cover estimates, and detailed error sources.

## Key Findings
- Overall concordance and efficiency:
  - Percentage agreement across plots between 1990 and 1991: 60.9%.
  - Initial recording efficiency (1990 QA) averaged around 58–74% depending on calculation method; after adjustments, about 74% maximum efficiency approached in standardised conditions.
  - 1991 reassessment showed a substantial species increase per plot (mean from ~20.2 to ~23.4; significant with pooled data), largely due to real ecological differences between years (drought in 1990 vs normal in 1991) and improved recording.
- Species changes and drivers:
  - Some species showed genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Galium aparine, Cirsium arvense).
  - Apparent increases in species numbers in drought year due to under-recording originally; better later due to growing season and observer familiarity.
  - Seasonal/annual effects significantly influence comparability; caution needed when comparing changes across landuses or years.
- Plot relocation and plot types:
  - X plots (200 m2) relocated more reliably; Y plots (4 m2) most difficult to relocate accurately.
  - Metal plates for plot corners had a 71% recovery rate in autumn 1990 with 5-minute search time; 65% plate and 87% plot recovery in 1991.
  - Photographs markedly improve relocation accuracy; photographs plus sketch maps best for precise positioning, especially in unenclosed land.
- Land class and scale effects:
  - Lower recording accuracy in lowland arable (LC) areas; upland and other classes recorded with higher consistency.
  - Analysis across landclass aggregates showed UP (upland) consistently more stable; LC showed the greatest variability.
- Cover estimates and vegetation mapping:
  - Cover estimates for common grasses and species showed some significant differences between times (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica) but overall frequency-based group analyses did not show large shifts in community composition.
  - Mapping primary land-use codes was highly reliable (roughly 88–95% concordance); boundary codes slightly lower due to interpretation differences.
  - Boundary and land-use coding showed substantial agreement between different assessors and between assessors and surveyors, but more interpretive latitude remained in boundary qualifiers and habitat descriptors.
- Species groups and overall vegetation gradient:
  - DECORANA analysis indicated shifts along an ecological gradient consistent with known land-use and climatic changes; however, the mean axis shift was not always statistically significant due to sample size.
  - Across plot types, the direction of axis shifts generally aligned with longer-term ecological trends, with upland plots showing distinct patterns.

## Sources of Variation and Error
- Major categories of variation (with impacts):
  - A) Mis-identification of species
  - B) Species overlooked in the original survey
  - C) Over-zealous recording
  - D) Relocation/positioning errors
  - E) Management/seasonal changes
  - F) Crop changes and seasonal effects
  - G/H) Plot mis-location or mis-orientation
  - I/I2) Relocation mismatches and observed changes between times
- Resulting impact:
  - Approximately 39% total mismatches due to allocation/misalignment and seasonal changes; about 60.9% concordance between T1 and T2.
  Practical implication: many discrepancies stem from seasonal shifts and relocation challenges; seasonally matched QA is crucial.

## Plot Types, Land Classes, and Relocation Performance
- X plots: highest relocation efficiency; road/verge plots easier to relocate; Y plots hardest due to small size and orientation.
- Plate-based relocation: effective but time-intensive in unenclosed uplands; recommended use of metal plates where feasible, with increased staffing in difficult terrains.
- Recommendations (practical): annotate photographs with plot location and distances; use metal markers; improve Y-plot positioning with standardized orientation and ground markers.

## Mapping Land Use Codes and Boundary Features
- Primary land-use codes:
  - Generally reliable; LC and LG codes more straightforward than marginal upland categories.
  - Some failures due to ambiguous definitions (e.g., marsh, blanket moorland) and confusing partitioning between 102 upland grassland variants and 111 bog types.
- Boundary and boundary-qualifier codes:
  - High concordance for primary boundary codes; more variation in boundary qualifiers due to coding complexity.
  - Distinguishing between hedge types and stockproof features showed notable discrepancies; recommendations to simplify or better define boundary codes.
- Mapping of species cover:
  - Point-by-point cover concordance moderate; high concordance for dominant species at high cover, lower for co-dominants.
  - Mapping two most prevalent species at each parcel recommended to improve reproducibility.
- Recommendations (mapping focus):
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes and provide simple, explicit coding pathways.
  - Sub-divide certain upland and lowland categories (e.g., 102 upland grassland) to improve accuracy.
  - Treat lowland rush pasture and wet heath as distinct types.
  - Restrict boundary mapping to hedge presence and use qualifying codes for composition.
  - Record only the two most prevalent species for mapping to improve consistency.

## Recommendations for Future Surveys (Key Actions)
- Conduct QA in the same year as the original survey to minimize seasonal/annual variation.
- Ensure surveyors annotate photographs and tie them to plot locations with identifiable landmarks.
- Use metal marker plates for X plots in enclosed land; allocate more manpower for upland placement and relocation.
- Improve Y-plot positioning with a standardized, clearly marked ground area and explicit orientation.
- Target bryophytes and challenging grasses in training and QA; consider adding species lists and habitat context.
- Avoid cross-season comparisons; standardize the season and timing of QA with the original survey.
- Simplify and expand land-use codes; emphasize the most prevalent species in mapping to improve reproducibility.
- Introduce clear definitions and codes for marshy/wetland units and upland grassland subcategories; formalize edge cases in hedges and boundary descriptions.
- Use two prevalent species for land-use parcel mapping; update qualifiers to reduce ambiguity.
- Enhance documentation of plot distances to nearby features and bearings to improve relocation efficiency.

## Conclusions
- Photographs and accurate relocation are essential for reliable QA, especially in unenclosed landscapes.
- Season, year, and plot relocation challenges substantially influence concordance; standardized timing and robust markers improve data quality.
- Land-use mapping is relatively robust, but boundary coding and habitat qualifiers require clearer definitions and possibly code simplification.
- There is a clear need for targeted training on grasses and bryophytes, as well as standardized procedures for cover and habitat coding to improve comparability across surveys.

## Implications for Practice
- For analysts, the QA results underscore the importance of:
  - Matching sampling timing to minimize seasonal biases.
  - Using photographic evidence to enhance plot relocation and documentation.
  - Focusing training on taxonomic groups and habitat features prone to misclassification.
  - Designing mapping codes and data collection forms to reduce ambiguity and improve reproducibility.
  - Prioritizing consistent data capture for lowland arable and upland systems where variability is greatest.
