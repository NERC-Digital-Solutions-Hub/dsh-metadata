# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Outlines the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification has been developed and applied as the core stratification framework across successive surveys since 1978.
  - Emphasises the need to maintain a time-series framework that remains compatible with policy needs and country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).

- Core concepts and rationale
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples are representative and to minimise bias.
  - Use of an environmental land classification (ITE Land Classification) to define strata with comparable ecological characteristics across GB.
  - Sample units primarily based on 1 km squares; a centre square is classified, with surrounding squares allocated to populate each class.

- Evolution of the sampling framework (timeline and logic)
  - The Beginning (early 1970s)
    - Bunce and Shaw established a national ecological sampling system using stratified random sampling.
    - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to group vegetation into land classes; sampling focused on 1 km squares within those classes.
  - 1978 Countryside Survey – first field survey
    - 32 ITE Land Classes defined from 1 km squares (centre squares plus four surrounding squares).
    - Initial sampling: eight samples per class across 256 squares.
    - National estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class times the land class area.
  - 1984 Survey
    - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384).
    - Emphasis shifted toward land use and habitat mapping while retaining the 1978 Land Classification framework.
  - 1990 Countryside Survey (CS1990)
    - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB (a more comprehensive approach).
    - 508 squares surveyed; repeated 1984 features recorded; new Land Cover Map linked to the program.
    - Entailed updating the classification and adapting results accordingly.
  - Developments leading to CS2000
    - Recognised need for regional (England/Scotland/Wales) estimates and for reliable upland habitat estimates.
    - Expanded to better represent larger land classes; introduced separate country estimates.
    - Sub-division and aggregation of land classes created 40 strata; added 19 new squares for better country representation; added 11 more to balance England and Wales sampling.
    - Wales-specific refinements to improve Wales-only reporting.
  - 2007 Countryside Survey (CS2007)
    - Wales reporting further refined: introduction of country-unit land classes (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
    - Additional sampling in Wales (43 extra squares) to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes; some English classes saw reduced sampling to maintain balance.
    - An uplands module added: 30 squares targeted at upland and marginal upland habitats in England and Wales to improve country-specific estimates.
    - Final framework supports Wales-only, England-only, and Scotland reporting with improved precision for under-represented classes.

- How the sampling is configured and used
  - Land Classification as the backbone
    - Original 32 classes (1978) evolved into broader 40 classes (1990) and then 45 classes (2007) to accommodate country-specific reporting.
    - Classification is based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and validated against observed squares.
  - Sampling design and allocation
    - Centre squares classified; surrounding four squares allocated per centre classification; overall sampling framed as a stratified random design across Land Classes.
    - Class sub-division and aggregation used to adapt to country reporting needs (England with Wales; Scotland).
    - Extra and reallocated squares used to ensure adequate representation of new or under-represented classes in each country.
  - Upland module
    - Targets upland habitats to improve estimates where country-level reporting requires higher precision.
  - National and country-level estimates
    - CS1990 and subsequent surveys introduced and refined separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) to align with policy and legislation requirements.
    - The 2006 scoping work highlighted the trade-off between using the latest country-specific classification and cross-survey consistency; the preferred approach for national consistency is to use the latest country-specific framework within each survey, while maintaining cross-survey comparability where feasible.

- Outputs and presentation
  - Uses the land class framework to estimate habitat areas:
    - The main approach: for each class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the total area of that class; sum across classes to obtain national totals.
  - Outputs include maps and tables illustrating the distribution of Land Classes, sampling squares, and country-specific sampling frameworks.
  - Documentation includes detailed acknowledgements, references, and notes on methodological choices and data handling.

- Practical implications for monitoring framework authors
  - Longitudinal consistency
    - Maintaining a coherent time series requires a persistent stratification framework and careful documentation of any reclassification or sampling changes.
  - Adaptive stratification
    - The strategy demonstrates how to adapt a fixed framework (land classification) to evolving policy needs (country-specific reporting) by subdividing classes and adjusting sample allocations.
  - Balancing precision and practicality
    - Additional sampling in underrepresented classes or regions improves precision but increases effort; the CS2000/CS2007 approach shows how to balance these demands.
  - Data comparability and governance considerations
    - Changes in the Land Classification across surveys necessitate careful translation of estimates to enable trend analysis; the document discusses consistency considerations and choices to prefer latest country-specific classifications for national estimates.
  - Modular enhancements
    - The upland module illustrates how targeted additions to the sampling design can improve estimates for specific habitat types without overhauling the core framework.

- Key takeaways for designing monitoring frameworks
  - Build on a robust, ecologically meaningful stratification system that can be consistently applied over time.
  - Use stratified random sampling to ensure representativeness and to minimize bias.
  - Plan for country-specific reporting when governance and policy require it, including class subdivisions and targeted sampling to improve precision in each country.
  - Anticipate data evolution (reclassification) and document the impact on comparability; preserve a clear mapping between old and new classifications.
  - Consider modular additions (e.g., upland modules) to address gaps in precision for important habitat types.
  - Provide clear, transparent methodological documentation, including how estimates are calculated and how data are shared and used for policy-relevant reporting.
