# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/047d914f-2a65-4e9c-b19109abf57423db

- Context and problem
  - An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000.
  - The Met Office cannot provide a corrected version because the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 data in March 2018.

- Actions taken
  - CEH derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from Met Office daily rainfall grids.
  - SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) was recalculated for the entire period using the corrected dataset.
  - An extra accumulation period of 9 months was added based on user feedback. 

- Data governance and methodology implications for monitoring frameworks
  - When original data are flawed and a corrected version is unavailable, derive alternatives from accessible data and recalibrate indicators accordingly.
  - Document and justify data derivation methods and any changes to accumulation/aggregation periods.
  - Adapt to dataset lifecycle transitions (e.g., superseded datasets) while maintaining continuity of monitoring outputs.
