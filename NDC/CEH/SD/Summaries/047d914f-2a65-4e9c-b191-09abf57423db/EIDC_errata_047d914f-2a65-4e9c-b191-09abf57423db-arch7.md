# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/047d914f-2a65-4e9c-b19109abf57423db

- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000.
- The Met Office cannot provide a corrected version of the monthly grids, as the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 data in March 2018.
- As a workaround, CEH derived monthly rainfall grids from the Met Office daily rainfall grids for the problematic period.
- CEH recalculated the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI) for the entire period using this corrected dataset.
- An additional 9-month accumulation period was added, based on feedback received about the superseded dataset.
