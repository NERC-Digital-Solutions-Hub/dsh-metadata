# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/047d914f-2a65-4e9c-b19109abf57423db

## Overview of the issue
- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for the period 1960–2000.

## Why correction was necessary
- The Met Office cannot provide a corrected version of the monthly grids because the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 data in March 2018.

## What CEH did as a fix
- Derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from the Met Office daily rainfall grids.
- Recalculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the entire period using the corrected dataset.

## Dataset enhancement
- Added an extra accumulation period of 9 months, identified as useful from feedback on the superseded dataset.

## Data quality and provenance implications
- Ensures continuity and consistency by updating the period with a derived monthly grid from daily data.
- Maintains transparency about data provenance and the reason for the correction (supersedence of the original monthly dataset).

## Impact on monitoring outputs
- SPI and any analyses relying on the 1960–2000 period are updated to reflect the corrected dataset.
- Users should adopt the corrected monthly grids and the 9-month accumulation when interpreting results for the affected period.

## Recommendations for users
- Reference the corrected dataset when accessing results for 1960–2000.
- Be aware of the 9-month accumulation addition when comparing with analyses that used the original dataset.
