# Cellulolytic decomposition of Welsh upland rivers in response to organic matter addition

- Objective
  - Investigate how addition of leaf litter influences cellulolytic decomposition in Welsh upland streams using a controlled BACI design.

- Study design and regime
  - Before-after-control-impact (BACI) in which each stream has:
    - Upstream reference (control) zone
    - Downstream experimental zone (receives organic matter)
  - Zones within each stream are similar in length and habitat; 20–50 m separation ensures independence.
  - Time periods
    - Before period (T1): 61–65 days from early Nov 2012 to early Jan 2013; no manipulation; both zones treated identically.
    - After period (T2): 57–62 days from early Jan 2013 to Mar 2013; experimental zone receives leaf litter throughout.
  - Leaf litter treatment
    - 1-tonne bags of deciduous leaves (oak, birch, alder) added to the experimental zone proportionally to its area.
    - Vegetable nets ensure a minimum wet weight of 1.7 kg m^-2 in the experimental zone.
    - Additional 630 kg (wet weight) of leaf litter added on 12 Feb 2013 and 5 Mar 2013 after two large storm events.
  - Experimental units
    - Six cotton strip units placed randomly in each experimental reach; used to assess tensile strength as a proxy for decomposition.

- Collection and laboratory methods
  - Field collection
    - Strips recovered at end of T1 and T2, then frozen at -20°C.
  - Laboratory processing
    - Strips rinsed, oven-dried at 65°C; tensile strength measured with a Hounsfield machine (25 kN load cell, 40 mm gap).
    - One breaking-strain measurement per strip.
    - Three untreated control strips used to account for losses during transport and washing.
  - References noted for methodology (e.g., Jenkins et al. 2013) and related ecological context.

- Variables and data structure
  - Key measured values
    - breaking_strain (Newtons)
    - %_loss (percent loss of tensile strength relative to control batch)
  - Data format
    - Flatbed CSV with 10 columns:
      - site_code, region, date, time (Before/After), landuse, reach (Experimental/Control), replicate, exposure (days), breaking_strain, %_loss

- Supporting materials and context
  - Site description data (CSV) with 10 columns establishing site codes, names, coordinates (Eastings/Northings, Latitude/Longitude), grid references, elevation, survey campaign, and catchment information.

- Quality control and references
  - Calibration steps: None reported.
  - Quality control: None reported beyond use of field controls and untreated strips.
  - Related literature cited to contextualize the experimental approach and data interpretation.
