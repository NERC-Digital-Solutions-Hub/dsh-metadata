# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- Define procedures to measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- Include filtration before chemical analysis to slow sample deterioration.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Use three preservation methods: filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and acidification only for Al and Fe determinations.
- Activities may require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background quality control and documentation are provided in related documents.

## Data and monitoring context (analytical workflow)
- Standardised, repeatable methods to produce outputs such as conductivity, pH, and dissolved ion concentrations.
- Documentation and sample tracking are essential for data quality and future access.
- Aim aligns with routine environmental monitoring practices and data portal submission.

## Procedures and timing

### Initial storage
- If measured intervals exceed 7 hours, store samples at 1–4°C.
- Filtered samples should be processed the same day; otherwise, return to cold storage.
- If sending to another site for initial handling, dispatch the same day via fastest method.
- In-transit samples should be kept in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

### Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Use the HMSO (1978) method; report to 0.1 µS cm^-1.

### pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample.
- Use the same subsample as for conductivity; measure conductivity first, then pH.
- Use HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Report to 0.01 pH unit.

### Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours using Appendix I method.
- Record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyse for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4=2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and DOC (DOC optional for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is limited, follow priority order for determinands as described in AG Protocol.

### Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should occur within 16 days of collection (ideally) and no later than 28 days.
- Minimise out-of-cold-storage periods if samples are sent elsewhere (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday despatch).

## Data handling and accessibility
- Unique reference codes must be used for each sample, to enable inclusion in the ECN database.
- Labels must include: ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, plus sampler code as necessary.
- Final data are submitted for ECN database inclusion, promoting broader data access and reuse.

## Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedures)
- Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil) and membranes (0.45 µm Whatman WCN) plus glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C).
- Vacuum pump capable of ~0.5 bar vacuum.
- Rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
- Do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; single-use per sample.
- Pre-filter soils (SS) and rivers (WQ) with glass fibre filter if needed; rinse filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- If volume >100 ml, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Label containers with the standardized codes; document supplier details for reference.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Wash containers with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- If available, use a washing machine (Deconamic); otherwise, overnight soak in Decon-90.
- Rinse four times with tap water and three times with deionised/distilled water.
- After use, rinse three more times with distilled water, dry in a dust-free environment, and re-cap.
- Decon products are obtainable from listed suppliers.

## Author and reference context
- WH Protocol and associated documents guide the procedures, training requirements, and safety considerations.
- References include HMSO publications (1978, 1988) and protocol-specific appendices.
