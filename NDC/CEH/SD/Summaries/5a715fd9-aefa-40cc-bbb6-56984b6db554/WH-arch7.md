# WH Protocol

- Aim
  - To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale and scope
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; slowing deterioration uses filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations) acidification.
  - Some activities require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.
  - Background and quality control procedures are documented in related documents.

- Key procedures and timing
  - Initial storage
    - Store at 1–4°C if the interval before conductivity and pH measurement exceeds seven hours.
    - If filtering is not completed the same day, return to cold storage.
    - If samples are sent to another site, ship on the collection day using the fastest method; during transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.
  - Conductivity measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
    - Express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
  - pH measurement
    - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample; the same subsample may be used for conductivity, but conductivity must be measured first and the main sample must not be re-used after measurement.
    - Use the HMSO (1988) method with separate glass and reference electrodes; express results to 0.01 pH units.
  - Filtering
    - Perform within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I methods.
    - Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
    - After filtration, analyse for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
    - If sample volume is insufficient for all determinands, follow the priority order in the AG Protocol.
  - Storage prior to chemical analysis
    - Keep 1–4°C; ideally complete analysis within 16 days, but no later than 28 days from collection.
    - If sending to another location, minimise periods out of cold storage; use next-day delivery and avoid Friday dispatch.

- Data management, labeling, and traceability
  - Filtering and analytical steps are documented with unique sample codes (per Appendix I) and final data are submitted to the ECN database.
  - Samples must be labeled with:
    - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
    - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date
    - Additional sampler/machine codes as needed
  - The final data record should include the unique reference for each sample to ensure traceability in datasets used for mapping and analysis.

- Appendices overview
  - Appendix I: Filtering
    - Equipment: filter funnel assemblies (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membranes (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (GF/C), vacuum pump.
    - Procedures: rinse all contact surfaces, handle filters with forceps, single-use per sample, prefilter may be used for soil solution and river water; if volume >100 ml, aliquot 20 ml for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
    - Sample labeling and coding as above.
  - Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing
    - Use phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agents.
    - Cleaning agents include Decon/Decon-90 or equivalent; rinse sequences and drying steps; re-cap after washing.
  - Suppliers
    - WH Protocol references supplier contact details for drinking water/analytical components.

- Safety and training considerations
  - Acknowledge that certain steps require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance (e.g., handling acids for Al and Fe determinations).
