# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

## Aim
- To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water.
- To filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes.
- Slowing deterioration via filtration, cold storage, and acidification (for Al and Fe determinations).
- Some actions require laboratory training, specialized equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are detailed in referenced documents.

## Initial storage
- If the interval between collection and measurement > 7 hours: store at 1–4°C.
- If filtering is not completed the same day as measurements, return to cold storage.
- If sending to another site for initial handling, ship on the collection day by fastest method.
- Samples in transit should be kept in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Express results to one decimal place (0.1 µS cm⁻¹).

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample.
- The same subsample can be used for both conductivity and pH, but conductivity must be measured first; do not return the subsample to the main sample.
- Use the method in HMSO (1988) with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection.
- Use the method in Appendix I.
- Record filtering details with the unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; optional for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, refer to the priority order in the AG Protocol for determinands.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Ideally analyze within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If samples are sent to another location, minimize time outside cold storage (prefer next-day delivery) and avoid Friday dispatch.

## Author references
- J.K. Adamson, HMSO (1978, 1988) for conductivity and pH measurement.
- Protocol context and references to AG Protocol for analytical prioritization.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly, membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters, vacuum pump (≈0.5 bar).
- Procedures:
  - Rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filters or contact surfaces with hands; use forceps; one filter per sample.
  - For soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ), pre-filter may be needed; pre-filter requires washing with 250 ml distilled water.
  - Transfer filtered water to a clean, dry bottle; do not return to the unfiltered bottle.
  - If >100 ml volume, transfer 20 ml to a vial for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Sample labeling: ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06), ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (01), Sampling Date, plus sampler code; these references must accompany final data for ECN database.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Wash containers with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Recommended cleaners: Decon-90; Deconatic if available; rinse sequences: four rinses with tap water and three with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and store with same sampler.
- After washing, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment and recap immediately.
- Decon products available from multiple suppliers (e.g., BDH, Millipore).

## Procedure
- Practical workflow and supplier references for implementation (as detailed in the WH Protocol).
