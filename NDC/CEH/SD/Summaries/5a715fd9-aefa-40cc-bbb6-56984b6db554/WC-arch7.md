# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Establish a standardized protocol for weekly surface water chemistry sampling to monitor changes in major ions and nutrients, enabling assessment of impacts from climate, land use, and pollution.
- Enable calculation of loads and fluxes to support nutrient budgets when combined with water flow data.

## Rationale
- Water chemistry reflects biogeochemical processes and external inputs, indicating shifts due to climate, land use, and industrial/agricultural pollution.
- Measuring major ions (e.g., Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, SO4, alkalinity) and nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P) provides a comprehensive picture of water quality and acidification status (e.g., Al3+ behavior with pH).

## Method

### Location
- Collect dip samples from at least one representative site above a weir.
- Record and consistently use the sampling site location for all collections.

### Sampling
- Weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesdays) to align with other ECN collections.
- Collect one 250 ml sample from flowing water at the same location each time.
- Rinse bottle with river water, fill to the top (no air space) by reaching upstream, and record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water following the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- After filtering, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO42−, PO43−-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.

### Labelling
- Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time, when applicable)
- Mark all information on the sample bottle and ensure it accompanies results when transferred to the ECN database.

### Continuous monitoring
- Plan for continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Sensor selection and ECN specifications are under development; an ECN specification will follow once suitable sensors are identified.

### Recording conventions
- For each WC sampling location, the core dataset requires:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., WC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time
  - pH (with GMT 24-h clock)
  - Conductivity (µS cm−1)
  - Concentrations (mg L−1) of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, NO3−-N, SO4 2−-S, PO4 3−-P, alkalinity, dissolved organic carbon
- The precise data formats and transfer specifications are documented in ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; use the Site Managers' extranet for access and follow-up with ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk if needed.

### Core measurement
- Core measurement: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol)
- Data collected weekly at each site includes the full set of chemistry variables listed above, plus sampling date/time and site identifiers.

### Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is provided by the CCU; an example is available in Appendix II.
