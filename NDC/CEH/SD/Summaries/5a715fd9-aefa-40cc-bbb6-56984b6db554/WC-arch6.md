# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Collect weekly river water samples to analyze major cations and anions.
- Infer potential impacts of climate, land use, and pollution on water chemistry.
- Compute loads and fluxes of ions to inform nutrient budgets.

## Rationale
- Water chemistry reflects biogeochemical processes and inputs from land/atmosphere.
- Measured ions and nutrients (e.g., NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P) indicate chemical state and acidification risk (e.g., Al3+ with pH changes).
- Regular sampling supports understanding of changes over time and drivers of water quality.

## Method

### Location
- Take dip samples from at least one representative site above the weir.
- Record and reuse the same sampling location each occasion.

### Sampling
- Collect weekly on the same day (preferably Wednesdays) to align with other ECN collections.
- Time window: within one hour of a specified time; use a single 250 ml sample from flowing water.
- Rinse bottle with river water, fill without air space, and capture at upstream.
- Record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
- After filtering, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

### Washing equipment
- Bottle washing procedures follow the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

### Labelling
- Unique sample identifiers:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
- Label bottles with these identifiers and attach them to the results during transfer to the ECN database.

### Continuous monitoring
- Plan for continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Sensor development is ongoing; ECN specifications will be defined once sensors are satisfactory.

### Specification of results and recording conventions
- Key identifiers for each sample/recording occasion: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Variables recorded on weekly samplings include pH, conductivity, and concentration data (ions, nutrients, alkalinity, DOC) in appropriate units.
- Data formats and dataset specifications are described in the ECN Data Transfer documentation; access to the documentation is via the restricted ECNCCU extranet (contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk).

### Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an Appendix II example is provided.
