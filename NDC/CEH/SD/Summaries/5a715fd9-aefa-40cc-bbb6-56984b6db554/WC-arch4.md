# WC Protocol

- Aim and rationale
  - Monitors changes in river water chemistry to indicate impacts from climate, land use, and pollution (industrial, urban, agricultural).
  - Measures major ions and nutrients to assess chemical composition, and tracks pH-dependent species (e.g., Al3+) relevant to acidification.
  - Enables calculation of loads and fluxes for nutrient budgets and to understand biogeochemical processes.

- Location and sampling design
  - Sampling from at least one representative site above the weir; site location recorded and used consistently.
  - Weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesdays) and within a specified hour; one 250 ml sample from flowing water per occasion.
  - Record stage height to the nearest 2 mm; sampling point must be the same each time.

- Sampling procedures
  - Bottle handling: rinse with river water, shake, discard rinse; fill bottle to capacity with no air space.
  - On-site measurements: measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water.
  - After filtration: analyze for Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO42-, PO43-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

- Equipment, washing, and labeling
  - Follow washing procedures described in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
  - Each sample labeled with:
    - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
    - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date (and time as required)
  - Labels ensure traceability through all analytical stages and into the ECN database.

- Continuous monitoring
  - Planned: continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
  - Sensor technology is under testing; ECN specifications to be developed once suitable sensors are identified.

- Data recording conventions and data management
  - Core measurement: surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
  - Essential variables for each sampling location include:
    - Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time
    - On-site measurements: pH, conductivity
    - Analyte concentrations as listed above (units in mg L-1 or relevant units)
  - Data formats and transfer:
    - Refer to the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation for dataset formats (restricted access via Site Managers' extranet).
    - Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access to documentation.
  - Recording forms:
    - Standard field recording form available from the CCU; example provided in Appendix II.

- Additional notes
  - The ECN dataset is designated under ECNCCU, dated around 2001, with site-specific codes (e.g., T05) and core measurement codes (e.g., WC).
  - Comprehensive data documentation and traceability are emphasized to support data quality and future analyses.
