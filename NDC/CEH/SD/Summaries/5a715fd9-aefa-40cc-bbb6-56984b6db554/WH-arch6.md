# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Purpose: To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water and to filter samples before chemical analysis.
- Core strategy: Slow deterioration after collection using filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe) acidification; acknowledges need for lab training and safety, and references quality control procedures.

## Aim
- Define procedures to preserve sample integrity and produce reliable measures of conductivity, pH, and filtered chemical determinands.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate chemically and microbiologically after collection.
- Preservation methods:
  - Filtration
  - Cold storage (1–4°C)
  - Acidification (for Al and Fe determinations)
- Protocol emphasizes quality control, background procedures, and potential need for chemist involvement.

## Initial storage method
- If measurement is >7 hours after collection, store at 1–4°C.
- If filtering won’t be completed the same day, keep in cold storage and return to cold storage as needed.
- If sending to another site, ship on the collection day by fastest means.
- Samples in transit should be kept in a cool box with pre-frozen packs.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Report to 0.1 µS cm-1.
- Follow HMSO 1978 method.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample (same subsample as conductivity; measure conductivity first).
- Report to 0.01 pH unit.
- Use HMSO 1988 method with separate glass and reference electrodes.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection using Appendix I method.
- Use unique sample codes for documentation.
- After filtration, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4--S, PO4--P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient, a prioritized order applies for determinands (documented in the protocol).
- If >100 mL sample volume, transfer a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Maintain 1–4°C storage.
- Prefer analyses within 16 days; definitely within 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize time out of cold storage; aim for next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch.

## Author references
- WH Protocol references: J.K. Adamson, HMSO (1978, 1988) for conductivity and pH determinations.

## Appendix I. Filtering (equipment and procedure)
- Required equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Handling: rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; do not touch filter surfaces; use forceps; one filter per sample.
- Pre-filtering: waters from soil solution and rivers may require pre-filtering; pre-filter requires washing with 250 mL distilled water before use.
- Transfer: filtered water goes into a clean, dry 250 mL bottle; do not return filtered water to unfiltered bottle.
- Sub-sample handling: if >100 mL, take a 20 mL subsample for Al/Fe and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
- Labeling: must include ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and sampler code to uniquely identify the sample for ECN database submission.
- Suppliers: lists primary suppliers (BDH, Millipore) and contact details.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Cleaning agents and methods include Decon products (e.g., Decon-90) or an approved alternative (e.g., Decomatic if available).
- Washing sequence: rinse with tap water, then deionised/distilled water; air-dry or warm-air dry; recapped immediately.
- If using a washing machine, follow specified brand guidelines; otherwise soak overnight if needed.
- After use, containers are re-rinsed and prepared for reuse with the same sampler on future occasions.
