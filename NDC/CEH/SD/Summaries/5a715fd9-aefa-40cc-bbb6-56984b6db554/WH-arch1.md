# WH Protocol

## Aim
- To measure conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution, and river water, and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

## Rationale
- Water samples deteriorate via chemical and microbiological processes; to slow this, use filtration, cold storage, and (for Al and Fe determinations) acidification.
- Some activities require laboratory training, equipment, and health and safety compliance.
- Background and quality control procedures are detailed in referenced documents.

## Initial storage and handling
- Store samples cold (1–4°C) if the interval before conductivity and pH measurement exceeds 7 hours.
- Return to cold storage if filtering is not completed the same day.
- If samples are sent to another site for initial handling, ship on collection day by fastest method.
- In transit, use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks.

## Conductivity measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection.
- Use an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
- Express results to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.

## pH measurement
- Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample.
- Use the same subsample as conductivity measurement, but measure conductivity first and do not return the subsample to the main sample.
- Use method HMSO (1988) with separate glass and reference electrodes.
- Express results to 0.01 pH unit.

## Filtering
- Filter within 60 hours of collection.
- Follow Appendix I for method and record filtering details with unique sample codes.
- After filtration, analyze for: dissolved Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
- If sample volume is insufficient to measure all determinands, follow the priority order described in the AG Protocol.

## Storage prior to chemical analysis
- Store at 1–4°C.
- Analysis should be completed preferably within 16 days of collection, but definitely within 28 days.
- If sending to another location, minimize the time the sample is out of cold storage (e.g., next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

## Washing bottles
- See Appendix II for bottle and vial washing procedures.

## Appendix I. Filtering
- Equipment: filter funnel assembly; membrane filters (Whatman WCN, 0.45 µm); glass fibre filters GF/C; vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Procedures: thoroughly rinse all filter parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples; avoid touching contact surfaces; use forceps; each filter for a single sample.
- Pre-filtering:waters from soil solution (SS) and rivers (WQ) may require pre-filtering; wash pre-filters with 250 ml distilled water before use.
- Filtration volume handling: if sample volume >100 ml, transfer a 20 ml subsample to a vial for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling: each sample must include:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler codes as needed (e.g., SS sampler code)
- Data submission: ensure the final dataset contains this unique reference.

## Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
- Containers must be washed with a laboratory cleaning agent before first use and approximately every six months, or after heavy soiling (e.g., bird droppings).
- Cleaning agent should be phosphate- and hypochlorite-free.
- Use Deconmatic for automated washing if available; otherwise, soak overnight in Decon-90.
- Rinse four times in tap water and three times in deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times in distilled water, recap, and store in a dry, dust-free environment.
- Decon products available from multiple suppliers (see Appendix I).
