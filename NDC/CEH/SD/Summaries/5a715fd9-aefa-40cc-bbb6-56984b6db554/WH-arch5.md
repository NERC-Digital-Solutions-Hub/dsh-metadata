# INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001)

- Purpose
  - To measure conductivity and pH of precipitation, soil solution, and river water samples and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis.

- Rationale and requirements
  - Water samples deteriorate due to chemical and microbiological processes; mitigate with filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and, for Al and Fe determinations only, acidification.
  - Some steps require laboratory training, specialised equipment, and health and safety compliance.
  - Background quality control procedures are referenced in related documents.

- Initial storage
  - If the interval before conductivity/pH measurement exceeds 7 hours, store samples at 1–4°C.
  - If filtering isn’t completed the same day, return samples to cold storage.
  - If sending to another site, ship on the collection day; keep samples in a cool box with pre-frozen blocks during transit.

- Conductivity measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours of collection on an unfiltered subsample at 25°C.
  - Report conductivity to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
  - Conductivity measurement should occur before pH; do not return the subsample to the main sample after measurement.

- pH measurement
  - Measure within 36 hours on an unfiltered subsample using separate glass and reference electrodes.
  - Report pH to two decimal places (0.01 pH unit).

- Filtering
  - Filtering must occur within 60 hours of collection.
  - Use the procedure in Appendix I; record details with the unique sample codes.
  - After filtration, analyse for: Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, Fe²⁺, Al³⁺, NH₄⁺-N, Cl⁻, NO₃⁻-N, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC; not mandatory for precipitation water).
  - If sample volume is insufficient for all analyses, prioritize determinands as outlined.
  - Document any required acidification (for Al and Fe determinations) by adding 20 µL HCl for sub-samples if >100 mL volume is used.

- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Store at 1–4°C; analyses should be completed preferably within 16 days, but definitely within 28 days.
  - If samples are sent elsewhere for analysis, minimize time out of cold storage (aim for next-day delivery; avoid Friday dispatch).

- Documentation and data traceability
  - Use unique sample references on final data submissions for the ECN database.
  - Label containers with ECN Site Identification Code, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, and any sampler-specific code to ensure traceability.

- Author references
  - Cited standards and methods from J.K. Adamson and HMSO (1978, 1988) for conductivity and pH measurements and low ionic strength waters.

- Appendix I. Filtering
  - Required equipment: filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (0.45 µm), glass fibre filters (GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar).
  - Handling rules: rinse all contact surfaces with deionised/distilled water; use forceps; single-use filters per sample; pre-filter may be needed for soils/rivers; avoid returning filtered water to the unfiltered bottle.
  - If volume >100 mL, transfer a 20 mL subsample for Al and Fe determination and acidify with 20 µL HCl.
  - Labeling: ECN Site Identifier, ECN Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date, plus sampler code; ensure the final data includes this unique reference.
  - Supplier information for components is provided.

- Appendix II. Bottle and vial washing
  - Containers must be cleaned with a phosphate- and hypochlorite-free cleaning agent.
  - Cleaning options: laboratory washing machine (preferred: Decomatic) or overnight soaking in Decon-90 if no machine is available.
  - Rinse sequence: four times with tap water, three times with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times with distilled water and reuse with the same sampler.
  - Drying and storage: shake off water, dry in warm air in a dust-free environment, then recap immediately.
  - Decon products and suppliers are listed.
