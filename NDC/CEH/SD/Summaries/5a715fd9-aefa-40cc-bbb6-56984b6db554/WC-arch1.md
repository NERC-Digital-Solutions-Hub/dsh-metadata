# WC Protocol

- Aim
  - Detect potential causes and consequences of climate change, land use changes, and industrial/urban/agricultural pollution through river water chemistry.
  - Measure major ions and other variables to assess chemical composition, plant nutrients, acidification indicators, and to calculate loads/fluxes for nutrient budgets.

- Location
  - Collect dip samples from at least one representative site above the weir.
  - Record and reuse the sampling location code for each occasion.

- Sampling
  - Weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesdays) within a specified time window.
  - Collect one 250 ml sample from flowing water at a fixed location; rinse bottle with river water, fill with no air gap, and collect upstream.
  - Record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
  - Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling Protocol.
  - After filtering, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC).

- Washing equipment
  - Bottle washing procedures are described in the Initial Water Handling Protocol.

- Labelling
  - Each sample is uniquely identified by ECN Measurement Code (WC), ECN Site ID Code, Location Code, and Sampling Date.
  - Labels must be on the bottle and accompany results as samples move through analyses; data must be traceable to the ECN database.

- Continuous monitoring
  - Plan for continuous measurements of river temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
  - Sensor trials are ongoing; an ECN specification will be developed once satisfactory sensors are identified.

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Core identifiers for each dataset: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
  - Weekly core measurement variables (WC Protocol) include pH, conductivity (µS cm-1), and concentrations of the listed ions and nutrients, along with alkalinity and DOC; units and recording precision specified (e.g., time to minute, significant figures).
  - Data transfer documentation exists for ECN dataset formats; access via restricted extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
  
- Recording forms
  - A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an Appendix II example is provided.
