    - SITECODE, LCODE, SDATE, SHOUR, SMINS
    - LAB_NID (lab performing analyses)
    - PHDATE, PHHOUR, PHMINS (pH measurement timing)
    - FILTDATE, COMPDATE (filtration and completion dates)
- Quality codes
  - A standard ECN list of codes indicating data quality issues, including:
    - 100, 101, 102, 103, 105, 106, 108, 109, 110, 111, 113, 114, 115, 116, 118, 119, 126, 127, 169, 170, 182, 191, 200, 203, 207, 208, 222, 229, 501–511, 999
  - Codes describe issues such as no information, equipment out of action, sample loss, precipitation effects, lab contamination, non-standard sampling, and unusual events
- Accessibility and use
  - Data may be challenging to access without familiarity with the ECN portal and accompanying quality information
  - Users should consult the accompanying surfaceWaterChemistryProtocol.pdf for methods and ensure proper use of quality metadata
- Usage obligations
  - Acknowledge the ECN data use and share one reprint of publications citing the data

- Notes
  - Weekly dip-sample collection for stream water chemistry
  - QC standard analyses are documented and provided alongside the data
  - Site and location codes allow replication of sampling points across years
  - The dataset includes multiple sites with long temporal coverage, enabling trend and correlation analyses in environmental change studies
