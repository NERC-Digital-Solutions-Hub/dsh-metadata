ANALYTICAL GUIDELINES FOR WATER SAMPLES Version 1.1 (previously AG Protocol, updated Jan 2001)

## Aim
- Provide guidelines for the analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites.
- Each laboratory is responsible for its own resources, but must analyze under controlled conditions and document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures.
- An Analytical Working Group (representatives from each laboratory) conducts annual reviews of procedures.

## Scope and Techniques
- Approved techniques cover key determinands such as pH, conductivity, major ions (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Cl, NO3, SO4, PO4), alkalinity, NH4-N, DOC, Total N, etc.
- Alternative approved techniques are available; reference notes indicate where specific methods quantify related fractions or require comparatives (e.g., IC, AAS, Col- assays, etc.).
- Detection limits are targets for method selection; laboratories may choose methods but must consider limits in relation to study needs.

## Data Documentation and Methodology
- Laboratories keep detailed method documentation locally; a summary is provided to the ECN database.
- Each determinand at each ECN site is represented by a data record linking site, core measurement, determinand, date, and methodology/precision.
- Changes in methodology are timestamped; new records are added to the database whenever details change.

## Reference Techniques and Comparisons
- A set of reference techniques exists to compare and assess new or alternative methodologies.
- Laboratories should report the fraction or form measured (e.g., SO4 2− by IC) and monitor for biases if alternative techniques are used.

## Validation, Accuracy, and Precision
- Validation relies on approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; participation in interlaboratory checks (e.g., AQUACHECK) is encouraged.
- Accuracy: closeness to true value and agreement across the analytical community; record accuracy checks and corrections if applied.
- Precision: assessed via quality control samples; batch bias monitored; QC data reported with results.
- An accuracy record example is provided to illustrate reporting and corrective actions if needed.

## Quality Control Procedures
- A QC system using synthetic solutions is required for batch bias assessment; laboratories should validate QC for each batch and join external interlaboratory schemes where possible.
- Inter-site correction factors may be computed if all sites use the same solutions/procedures.
- The protocol supports detection of rogue batches and long-term trends.

## QC Concentrates and Data Transfer
- Annual preparation of two QC concentrates (one for cations, one for anions) at Merlewood; used in the following year for continuity checks.
- QC data must be transferred to the ECN Central Coordinating Unit (CCU) in a defined machine-readable format; a single QC data record covers both anion and cation results per batch.
- The data record format specifies a detailed sequence of fields (measurement code, site ID, QC codes, preparation dates, analysis dates, measurements for pH, conductivity, alkalinity, major ions, DOC, Total N, etc.) and a quality code if needed.
- Example QC record format is provided (Moor House as illustration).

## Priority Determinands Under Limited Sample Volumes
- When sample volumes are low (e.g., during low rainfall), a priority ranking guides handling and analytical decisions:
  1. pH and conductivity
  2. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+ first; then K+, Na+)
  3. Anions (NO3−, SO4^2−; then PO4^3−, Cl−)
  4. NH4+ N
  5. DOC
  6. Total N and alkalinity
 7. Other cations requiring separate acidified portions (Fe2+, Al3+)
- Refer to the Initial Water Handling Protocol for sample handling specifics (filtration, pH, acidification).

## Operational Notes
- Initial water handling and measurement procedures (pH/conductivity) may be performed locally or in the lab; if done locally, QC preparations must align with the overall QC scheme.
- When reporting, data should be recorded with the specified units, detection limits, and maturity checks; if biases are suspected, monitor via parallel methods in tandem.

## Authors and Governance
- Governance and quality oversight are conducted by the Analytical Working Group.
- The protocol emphasizes documentation of methodology, validation, accuracy/precision, and ongoing interlaboratory quality assurance.
