# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor surface water chemistry to indicate potential impacts from climate change, land use, and industrial/urban/agricultural pollution.
- Measure major ions and nutrients to assess chemical composition, biogeochemical processes, and inputs.
- Calculate loads and fluxes of ions to inform nutrient budgets and environmental assessments.

## Rationale
- Changes in water chemistry reflect underlying physical/chemical processes and external inputs.
- Frequent measurements across key ions (major cations/anions and nutrients) enable interpretation of drivers and trends.

## Method

### Location
- Collect from at least one representative site above the weir.
- Record the site location to be used for sampling on every occasion.

### Sampling
- Weekly sampling on the same day each week (preferably Wednesday).
- Time window aligned with ECN water collections; collect within a specified time for each site.
- Collect one 250 ml river water sample from flowing water at a consistent location.
- Rinse bottle with river water, fill to the top without air space, from upstream.
- Record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.
- After filtering, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl-, NO3--N, SO42-, PO4 3-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.

### Washing equipment
- Bottle washing procedures follow the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.

### Labelling
- Each sample must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time if applicable)
- This information must be marked on the bottle and accompany results through all analytical stages and into the ECN database.

### Continuous monitoring
- Aim to implement continuous measurements of water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Sensors are being tested; an ECN specification will be prepared once satisfactory sensors are identified.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- For each WC sampling location, data must include:
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Sampling Date/time
- Variables recorded (pH, conductivity, and chosen ion concentrations) with specified units and precision.
- Data formats and additional recording conventions are documented in ECNCCU’s Data Transfer documentation (restricted access Site Managers' extranet).

## Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an example is provided in Appendix II.
