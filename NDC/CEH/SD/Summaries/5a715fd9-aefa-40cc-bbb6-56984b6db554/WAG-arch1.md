# WAG Protocol

- Purpose: Analytical guidelines for the analysis of water samples from ECN terrestrial sites; each laboratory manages its resources but must conduct analyses under controlled conditions and document methodologies, significant changes, and validation procedures; annual review by an Analytical Working Group; detection limits set as targets.

## Approved and reference techniques

- Determinands and methods: Includes pH, conductivity, Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl-, NO3-N, SO4-S, HCO3-, PO4-P, DOC, Total N; multiple alternative approved techniques are listed with notes on fractions quantified.
- Reference techniques: Established methods (HMSO references) used for comparison and assessment of new or alternative methodologies; laboratories should monitor for bias if employing alternative techniques.
- Reporting and fractions: Laboratories should report data for the specified fraction (e.g., SO4 as S); if alternative fractions are used, monitor bias against the reference method.

## Priority listing of determinands

- Sample volumes may be limited; priority order to guide handling and analytical options:
  1. pH and conductivity
  2. Cations (Ca2+, Mg2+, then K+, Na+)
  3. Anions (NO3-, SO4 2-, then PO4 3-, Cl-)
  4. NH4-N
  6. Fe2+, Al3+ (requires separate acidified portion)
  5. DOC
  7. Total N, alkalinity
- Refer to Initial Water Handling Protocol for handling, filtration, pH, and acidification.

## Providing details of methodology

- Laboratories keep detailed methodology records for operators; ECN database stores summary information per determinand per site, linking to methodology and precision to indicate current practices.
- Example format shown via a record for nitrate, including substance, sample types, typical concentrations, calibration ranges, method details, detection limits, and QC measures.

## Validation, accuracy, and precision

- Validation through: approved techniques, uniform detection limits, and internal quality control; participation in interlaboratory analysis (e.g., AQUACHECK).
- Accuracy: Assessed by agreement with wider analytical community; requires recording all accuracy checks and any corrections; operational frequency of external checks is limited.
- Precision: Controlled using synthetic QC solutions; QC data reported to Site Managers; labs should join interlaboratory schemes to validate performance; potential to compute between-site correction factors; monitoring for rogue batches and long-term trends.

## Quality control procedures for ECN

- Separate QC system: Labs encouraged to continue independent QC and participate in accredited interlaboratory exchanges.
- Opportunity to compute between-site correction factors if solutions are standardized; detect rogue batches and long-term trends.
- Two concentrated QC solutions distributed annually (one for cations, one for anions) to sites; dilution instructions provided; a continuity check is performed by re-analyzing the previous year’s QC with the new solution.

## Data transfer and QC data format

- QC data submitted to ECN CCU in the same dataset as water samples, with adjusted date fields for preparation rather than sampling.
- Data record format: free-format, comma-separated, with fields including measurement code, site ID, QC sample code, preparation dates, analysis completion dates, pH measurements (unmixed and stirred), conductivity, alkalinity, various determinands (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, PO4-P, NO3-N, NH4-N, Cl, SO4-S, DOC, Total N), and a quality code.
- QC data records contain a single batch entry for both anion and cation results; example provided for Moor House QC record.

## Example records and outputs

- Example accuracy record: shows element, fraction measured, method, date, lab, interlaboratory scheme (AQUACHECK), measured vs mean, relative error, and corrective measures if any.
- Example QC record: Moor House QC with sample codes, preparation dates, analysis dates, measured values, and quality code.

## Governance and authorship

- Governance: Analytical Working Group oversees updates; changes in methodology are stamped as new records in the ECN database.
- Authors: A.P. Rowland, C. Woods, M. Lane (with revision notes in August 1998).
