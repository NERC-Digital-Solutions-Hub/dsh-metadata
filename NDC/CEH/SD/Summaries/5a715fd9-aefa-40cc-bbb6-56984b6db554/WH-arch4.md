# WH Protocol Aim INITIAL WATER HANDLING (WH) Version 1.1 (updated Nov 2001) To measure the conductivity and pH of samples of precipitation, soil solution and river water and to filter these samples prior to chemical analysis

## Purpose and scope
- Objective: measure conductivity and pH of water samples and perform pre-analysis filtration.
- Context: samples deteriorate over time; specialized handling (filtration, cold storage, selective acidification) and trained personnel are required for reliable results.

## Data integrity and quality rationale
- Slowing deterioration through three methods: filtration, cold storage (1–4°C), and, for Al and Fe determinations, acidification.
- Emphasis on health and safety, staff training, and access to chemists for analyses.

## Data lifecycle, storage, and timing
- Initial storage
  - Store at 1–4°C if more than seven hours before measurement.
  - If filtration isn’t completed the same day, return to cold storage.
  - If samples must be sent to another site, ship on the collection day via fastest method; use a cool box with pre-frozen blocks during transit.
- Conductivity measurement
  - Within 36 hours of collection; use an unfiltered subsample at 25°C; report to 0.1 µS cm⁻¹.
- pH measurement
  - Within 36 hours of collection; use the same unfiltered subsample; conductivity measured first; measure with separate glass and reference electrodes; report to 0.01 pH units.
- Filtering
  - Within 60 hours of collection; follow Appendix I; document processing with unique sample codes; following filtration, analyze for specified determinands (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Al, NH4-N, Cl, NO3-N, SO4, PO4, alkalinity, DOC).
  - DOC optional for precipitation water; if insufficient sample volume, prioritize determinands accordingly.
- Storage prior to chemical analysis
  - Maintain 1–4°C; ideally complete analyses within 16 days, but no later than 28 days.
  - If sending to another location, minimize transfer time (e.g., next-day delivery).

## Data labeling, provenance, and discoverability
- Use unique sample codes linked to the ECN database.
- Required bottle labeling format:
  - ECN Site Identification Code (e.g., T06)
  - ECN Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date
  - Additional sampler or instrument codes to uniquely identify the sample (appears with final data in the ECN database)

## Appendix I: Filtering (data quality and procedures)
- Equipment
  - Filter funnel assembly (e.g., Millipore Sterifil), membrane filters (0.45 µm Whatman WCN), glass fibre filters (Whatman GF/C), vacuum pump (~0.5 bar vacuum).
- Handling and contamination avoidance
  - Rinse all parts with deionised/distilled water before first sample and between samples.
  - Do not touch filter surfaces or contact water with hands; use forceps; each filter for a single sample.
  - Pre-filter for SS and WQ samples if needed; pre-wash with 250 ml distilled water.
  - Subsample 20 ml for Al and Fe determination if volume permits; acidify with 20 µl HCl.
- Labeling and documentation
  - Ensure all containers are labeled as described and the final data includes the unique reference.

## Appendix II: Bottle and vial washing (data hygiene)
- Cleaning agents must be free of phosphate and hypochlorite.
- Cleaning process
  - Use appropriate washing equipment (machine preferred); soak if no machine is available.
  - Rinse four times with tap water and three times with deionised/distilled water; after use, rinse three times and cap immediately.
  - Dry and prepare for reuse; Decon products available from listed suppliers.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Provides an end-to-end, standards-based data lifecycle for water chemistry samples.
- Ensures data quality, traceability, and discoverability through defined timing windows, metadata (unique sample codes), and standardized procedures.
- Highlights the need for cross-site coordination, training, and rigorous documentation to enable reliable data products and reuse within wider communities.
