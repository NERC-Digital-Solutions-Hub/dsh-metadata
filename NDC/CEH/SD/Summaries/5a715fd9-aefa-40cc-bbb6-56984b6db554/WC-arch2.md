# WC Protocol

## Purpose and Rationale
- Aim: Collect weekly surface water chemistry data to indicate environmental changes due to climate, land use, and pollution.
- Rationale: Water chemistry reflects biogeochemical processes and inputs; measuring major ions and nutrients enables calculation of loads/fluxes and assessment of nutrient budgets.

## Method: Sampling and Analysis
- Location: At least one representative site above the weir; record location and reuse the same site for each occasion.
- Sampling frequency and timing: Weekly samples on the same day each week (preferably Wednesdays) within a specified one-hour window; one 250 ml sample collected from flowing water, upstream.
- Field procedures: Bottle rinsing sequence, fill to the top with no air space, and record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- In-situ measurements: Measure pH and conductivity on unfiltered water according to the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.
- Laboratory analyses (post-filtering): Major ions Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, NO3--N, Cl-, NO3-, SO4 2-, PO4 3-, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.
- Equipment washing: Bottle washing procedures per the WH Protocol.

## Data labeling and Traceability
- Unique sample identification: ECN Measurement Code (WC), ECN Site ID Code, Location Code, and Sampling Date; these identifiers must be marked on the bottle and accompany results through all analytical stages to the ECN database.
- Continuous monitoring: Plans to implement continuous measurements of stream temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity; sensors are being tested and an ECN specification will be developed.

## Recording conventions and Data Formats
- Core measurement: Surface water chemistry (WC Protocol).
- Key identifying fields for datasets: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time (with time element if sampling is more frequent than daily).
- Measured variables (at each ECN sampling location): pH, conductivity, and concentrations of the listed ions and constituents (with specified units and precision as defined in the protocol).
- Data transfer: Submissions to the ECNCCU follow the accompanying Data Transfer documentation; for access to documentation, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Recording forms
- Standard field recording form available from the CCU; a sample is provided in Appendix II.

## Relevance for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Standardisation: Provides a consistent, QA/QC-friendly protocol for collecting comparable surface water chemistry data.
- Data integration: Enables calculation of loads/fluxes and supports nutrient budgeting and trend analysis.
- Data accessibility: Emphasizes dataset storage and sharing of underlying data, with clear data formats and portal upload requirements.
