# WC Protocol

## Aim
- Collect weekly stream/river water samples to analyze major cations, anions, and nutrients, capturing changes due to climate, land use, and pollution.
- Use data to infer biogeochemical processes and terrestrial/atmospheric inputs; enable calculation of loads and fluxes for nutrient budgets.

## Rationale
- Water chemistry changes reflect drivers of environmental change; major ions provide fundamental composition, while nutrients (NH4-N, NO3-N, PO4-P) inform biological productivity.
- Some species (e.g., Al3+) are pH-dependent and relevant under acidification; frequent measurements with flow data support calculation of ion loads.

## Method

### Location
- Take washing and sampling from at least one representative site above the weir.
- Record and reuse the same location for each sampling occasion.

### Sampling
- Weekly sampling on the same day (preferably Wednesday) to align with other ECN collections.
- Time within one hour of a specified time; use one 250 ml bottle from flowing water, rinsed with river water, filled without air space.
- Record stage height to the nearest 2 mm.
- Measure conductivity and pH on unfiltered water per the Initial Water Handling (WH) Protocol.
- After filtering, analyze for: Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO4 2−, PO4 3−-P, alkalinity, and dissolved organic carbon.

### Washing equipment
- Bottle washing procedures are described in the WH Protocol.

### Labelling
- Samples must be uniquely identified by:
  - ECN Measurement Code (WC)
  - ECN Site ID Code (e.g., 04 for Moor House)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date (and time if applicable)
- This labeling must be on the bottle and accompany results when transferred to the ECN database.

### Continuous monitoring
- Ongoing plans to measure water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity at suitable ECN sites.
- Sensor specifications are being developed; an ECN spec will be created when satisfactory sensors are identified.

## Specification of results and recording conventions

- Core data identifiers (must be included for each sample):
  - Site Identification Code (unique to ECN site)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., WC)
  - Location Code (replicate sampling point)
  - Sampling Date/Time

- Recorded variables for weekly WC sampling (with units and formats defined):
  - pH
  - Conductivity
  - Concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, Fe2+, Al3+, NH4+-N, Cl−, NO3−-N, SO4 2−-S, PO4 3−-P
  - Alkalinity
  - Dissolved Organic Carbon (DOC)
  - Sampling time (GMT 24-h clock) and precision (1 min for time)
  - Units and significant figures as specified (e.g., µS cm−1, mg L−1)

- Data handling
  - Use the ECNCCU dataset formats; refer to Data Transfer documentation on the restricted Site Managers' extranet.
  - If access is needed, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.

## Recording forms
- A standard field recording form is available from the CCU; an example is provided in Appendix II.

## Appendices and additional notes for Data Stewards
- The protocol defines a clear data lineage: field collection, unfiltered vs filtered analyses, and subsequent data transfer to a central database.
- Metadata requirements are explicit (site code, measurement code, location code, precise sampling date/time).
- Continuous monitoring data will require future integration once ECN sensor specifications are finalized.
- Standardized labeling and documenting practices support traceability and data quality assurance across sites.
