# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- CBESS dataset documenting spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites in Essex (two clay sites) and Morecambe Bay (three sandy sites).
- Sampling conducted using suction methods in 1 m x 1 m quadrats during Winter and Summer 2013.
- Lead staff: Hilary Ford.
- Objectives aligned with environmental monitoring: standardised data to assess biodiversity and ecosystem service indicators over time.

## Study design, locations and site context
- Observed locations and sites:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP)
- Coordinates:
  - Essex: AH 51.7833°N, 0.8667°E; FW 51.8167°N, 0.9667°E; TM 51.6833°N, 0.9333°E
  - Morecambe Bay: CS 54.1667°N, 3.0°W; WS 54.1333°N, 2.8000°W; WP 54.1500°N, 2.9667°W
- Habitat contrasts:
  - Essex sites: clay soils, higher inundation frequency, differing creek structure and vegetation
  - Morecambe Bay sites: sandy soils, distinct inundation and vegetation patterns
- Grazing regimes:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by Brent geese
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands heavily grazed by sheep; pink-footed geese grazing in winter
  - West Plain: light grazing

## Sampling methods and data collection
- Sampling method: suction sampling of 1 m x 1 m quadrats; four 20-second suctions per quadrat using a 20 cm diameter tube end.
- Specimen processing: samples placed in plastic bags; spiders and beetles sorted and preserved in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirits (IMS).
- Identification: to species level where possible, guided by Roel van Klink (Groningen University, Netherlands); specimens examined with a Novex stereoscope.
- Timing: field campaigns conducted in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Procedures and calibration: specified as None where applicable; no explicit calibration procedures recorded.

## Data structure and content
- Data format: Excel workbook.
- Observed variables:
  - Species counts per sample for numerous taxa (spiders and beetles), including both adult and juvenile individuals as identifiable to species where possible.
  - Examples of species groups include Pardosa purbeckensis, Pardosa pullata, Pardosa amentata, Pirata (juvenile), Clubiona stagnatilis, Erigone dentipalpis, and many others (extensive species list across taxa).
- Dataset fields and organization:
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S)
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E)
  - Site: Morecambe: CS, WS, WP; Essex: AH, FW, TM
  - Quadrat Number: MF (Mudflat), SM (Saltmarsh)
  - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m to upper limit)
  - Each species value: abundance per sample (numbers)
  - Additional fields include Row Number (sorting), Header and Dataset Field Descriptions
- Data quality notes: NA cells indicate missing data; no explicit data checking procedures recorded in the metadata.

## Data quality, provenance and governance
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford
- Data provenance: field observations from Winter and Summer 2013; species identifications with specialist guidance
- Calibration and quality control: not specified in the provided metadata
- Data accessibility: stored as an Excel workbook; environmental monitoring datasets are typically uploaded to appropriate data portals (not specified for this dataset)

## How this supports environmental monitoring aims
- Provides standardized, species-level biodiversity data across multiple salt marsh sites with contrasting soil types and grazing regimes.
- Enables cross-site comparisons and temporal analyses (Winter vs Summer 2013) to assess environmental health and habitat-value of marshes.
- Fits standard monitoring workflows: documented methods, clear site metadata, and structured dataset field descriptions.
- Potential for data reuse and integration with other datasets to enhance value beyond single-use analyses.

## Key considerations for analysts
- Leverage standardized fields (Season, Location, Site, Quadrat Number, Scale) to homogenize analyses across sites.
- Be mindful of missing data indicated by NA entries when modeling species distributions or abundance.
- Consider integrating with habitat and grazing variables to interpret biodiversity patterns in relation to land management.
- Ensure future data follow-up efforts include data quality checks and explicit calibration procedures to strengthen longitudinal monitoring.

## Summary
- The CBESS dataset offers a comprehensive, species-level record of spider and beetle abundance from six salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay, collected in Winter and Summer 2013 using a standardized suction sampling method. The data are organized with detailed metadata on site characteristics, sampling units, and species counts, enabling robust environmental monitoring analyses and comparisons across habitats with different soils and management regimes.
