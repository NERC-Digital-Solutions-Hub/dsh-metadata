# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Overview
  - Dataset on spider and beetle abundance collected from salt marsh sites as part of CBESS.
  - Focus on Morecambe Bay and Essex sites; sampling during Winter and Summer 2013.
  - Staff: Hilary Ford; data intended to support analysis of biodiversity and ecosystem services.

- Study Area and Site Characteristics
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Coordinates provided for each observation location.
  - Habitat contrasts:
    - Essex: clay soils; higher inundation frequency; different creek structures and vegetation.
    - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils; different inundation and creek dynamics; vegetation differences.
  - Grazing regimes:
    - Essex: hare grazing at AH and FW; heavy over-wintering Brent goose grazing at AH and FW.
    - Morecambe Bay: CS and WS heavily grazed by sheep; pink-footed geese graze in winter at CS/WS.
    - West Plain (WP) lightly grazed.
  
- Sampling Protocol
  - Method: suction sampling from 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
  - Procedure: four 20-second suctions per quadrat using a 20 cm diameter tube end; samples collected into plastic bags.
  - Specimen handling: spiders and beetles sorted and preserved in 70% IMS (Industrial methylated spirits).
  - Identification: to species level where possible; guidance from Roel van Klink, Groningen University.
  - Temporal coverage: general field campaign across Winter and Summer 2013.

- Dataset Structure and Content
  - Observed organisms: spiders and beetles; species listed with abundance per sample.
  - Example taxa included: Pardosa purbeckensis, Pardosa pullata, Pardosa amentata, Pardosa agricola, Pirata (juvenile), Clubiona stagnatilis, Enoplognatha mordax, Oedothorax fuscus, Lepthyphantes tenuis, Coccinella spp., Carabid larvae, various weevil and leaf beetle groups, and numerous other spider species (including juveniles).
  - Data fields:
    - Season (Winter, Summer)
    - Location (Morecambe, Essex)
    - Site (e.g., CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM)
    - Quadrat Number (1–22; Mudflat or Saltmarsh coding)
    - Scale (A–D with corresponding meter ranges)
    - Per-species abundance values (numbers per sample)
    - Additional taxon notes (e.g., weevil sp., beetle larvae unknown)
  - Data format and descriptions:
    - Dataset described as an Excel workbook.
    - Dataset field descriptions include headers, row numbers, and coded entries (e.g., Season, Location, Site).
    - NA entries indicate no data.
  
- Data Quality, Access, and Metadata
  - Quality control and data checking procedures are not elaborated beyond field descriptions (NA cells indicate missing data).
  - Metadata and field descriptions are provided within the dataset; format is Excel for ease of use.
  - Data availability implies datasets can be uploaded to portals with metadata to enable discoverability.

- Key Takeaways for Analysis
  - Provides a rich, species-level abundance dataset for spiders and beetles across contrasting salt marsh habitats and grazing regimes.
  - Enables comparative analyses of invertebrate communities between clay-soil Essex marshes and sandy-soil Morecambe Bay marshes.
  - Supports investigations into how inundation frequency, creek structure, vegetation, and grazing pressure influence arthropod biodiversity and potential ecosystem services.
