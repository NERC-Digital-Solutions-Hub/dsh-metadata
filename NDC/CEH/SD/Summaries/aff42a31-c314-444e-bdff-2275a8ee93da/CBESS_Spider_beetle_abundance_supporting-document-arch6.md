# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- A dataset documenting spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites across Essex and Morecambe Bay.
- Collected as part of a field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Data intended to support analyses of biodiversity patterns and ecosystem services in coastal habitats.

## Data collection and scope
- Sampling method: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; suction sampling using a modified leaf blower.
- Sampling inside each quadrat: four 20-second suctions at four locations.
- Specimens preserved in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirits and identified to species level where possible.
- Identification guided by Roel van Klink (Groningen University, the Netherlands).
- Data format: Excel workbook.
- Data quality notes: NA cells indicate no data; calibration and QA procedures are not described (none noted).

## Locations and site context
- Essex sites:
  - Abbotts Hall (AH)
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW)
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM)
- Morecambe Bay sites:
  - Cartmel Sands (CS)
  - Warton Sands (WS)
  - West Plain (WP)
- Geographic coordinates provided for each observation site.
- Site descriptions:
  - Two contrasting soil types represented: clay soils in Essex; sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
  - Essex and Morecambe Bay saltmarshes differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.
  - Grazing regimes differ:
    - Essex: hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by Brent geese in winter.
    - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands heavily grazed by sheep; West Plain lightly grazed.
- Monitoring period: Winter and Summer 2013.

## Sampling design and temporal coverage
- Seasonal sampling: Winter (W) and Summer (S) within 2013 field campaign.
- Sites chosen to capture variation in soil type, inundation, vegetation, and grazing intensity.
- Quadrats distributed across mudflat and saltmarsh habitats within each site.

## Variables and data structure
- Primary response: species abundance (numbers per sample) for a wide range of invertebrates.
- Species groups represented include:
  - Spiders (e.g., Pardosa, Pirata, Clubiona, Enoplognatha, Oedothorax, Linyphiidae and others)
  - Juvenile and adult specimens labeled by species name or group
  - Beetles and beetle-related taxa (e.g., Coccinellidae, Carabidae, Aleocharinae, etc.)
  - Other invertebrate groups including larvae and miscellaneous taxa (e.g., leaf beetle larvae, weevils)
- Data fields (example):
  - Season (Winter W or Summer S)
  - Location (Morecambe M or Essex E)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22; with habitat type such as Mudflat MF or Saltmarsh SM)
  - Scale categories (A–D, corresponding to spatial span from 1 m to upper limits)
  - Species abundance columns (numbers per sample) for each listed species
  - Additional fields: Row Number (sorting index), descriptions and cell formats
- Dataset field descriptions include detailed mappings of field names to their meanings (e.g., species names and counts, location/site codes, quadrat and scale descriptors).

## Data formats and quality notes
- File format: Excel workbook.
- NA entries indicate missing data.
- Calibration and data quality control procedures are not described in the dataset metadata.
- Observations and data management were conducted with species-level identification where possible.

## How this data can be used (Data Support perspective)
- Comparative analyses of invertebrate biodiversity across coastal saltmarsh sites with different soils, inundation regimes, and grazing pressures.
- Temporal comparison of winter vs. summer assemblages and seasonal abundance trends.
- Cross-site synthesis to explore effects of habitat type (mudflat vs. saltmarsh), grazing intensity, and vegetation structure on spider and beetle communities.
- Creation of self-serve data products such as dashboards or pivot tables to explore species-specific abundances by site, season, and habitat.
- Potential integration with other CBESS data to examine ecosystem services relationships (predation, biodiversity support) across coastal landscapes.
