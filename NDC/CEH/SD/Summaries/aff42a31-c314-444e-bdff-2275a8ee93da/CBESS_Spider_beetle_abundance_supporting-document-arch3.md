# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex.

## Purpose and scope
- Dataset documenting spider and beetle abundance to support monitoring of coastal biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Study locations and ecological context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes (clay soils); hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by overwintering Brent geese.
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands (saltmarsh); West Plain (saltmarsh) with sandy soils; intensive sheep grazing at Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands; pink-footed geese graze in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.
- Sites chosen to represent contrasting soil types and inundation/vegetation conditions.

## Sampling design and field methods
- Timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013 (general field campaign).
- Sampling unit: 1 m x 1 m quadrats; four 20-second suctions per quadrat using a modified leaf blower as suction sampler; samples stored in plastic bags.
- Taxa processing: spiders and beetles identified to species where possible using a stereoscope; identification supported by Roel van Klink (Groningen University, Netherlands).
- Sample handling: specimens preserved in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirits (IMS).

## Variables, data structure, and formats
- Observed taxa: extensive list of spider and beetle species (e.g., Pardosa spp., Pirata spp., Clubiona stagnatilis, various Linyphiidae, Coccinellidae, Carabidae, and others), with abundances recorded as numbers per sample. Juvenile and adult forms sometimes grouped under a species heading.
- Dataset fields (core): Row Number; Season (Winter/Summer); Location (Morecambe/M) or (Essex/E); Site (e.g., CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM); Quadrat Number; Scale; followed by species abundance columns (e.g., Pardosa purbeckensis, Pardosa pullata, etc.).
- Data format and notes: Excel workbook; NA cells indicate no data; two data-field variants exist (labeled 1 and 2) with identical content in different column groupings.
- Data quality indicators: calibration procedures noted as none where applicable; quality control fields present but empty; dataset descriptions and field descriptions provided (though some repetition observed).

## Data management, quality, and sharing considerations
- Metadata is detailed and includes sampling protocol, site descriptions, and taxon lists, supporting transparency and reuse.
- Underlying data sharing and governance aspects are relevant to the monitoring-framework context (e.g., completeness of metadata, openness, and data management standards).

## Temporal coverage
- Winter and Summer 2013 sampling sessions provide seasonal breadth for biodiversity assessment.

## Personnel
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks and governance
- Demonstrates a full monitoring workflow from field collection to species-level data capture and structured metadata.
- Highlights governance considerations relevant to policymakers and monitoring authors: data availability, metadata completeness, standardization across sites, potential data gaps, access timing, and the need for clear data-sharing policies.
- The dataset embodies key challenges identified for monitoring frameworks: ensuring adequate data, access, cross-organizational collaboration, metadata quality, data transformation needs, clear communication of results, and robust data governance.
