# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- A dataset of spider and beetle abundance on salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay, UK.
- Collected via suction sampling in 1m x 1m quadrats, with four 20-second suctions per sample.
- Field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; staff: Hilary Ford.
- Samples preserved in 70% Industrial Methylated Spirits and identified to species level where possible.
- Data stored as an Excel workbook; missing data indicated as NA.

## Study locations and context
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Location coordinates provided for each site.
- Site selection aimed to represent two contrasting soil types: clay soils (Essex) and sandy soils (Morecambe Bay).
- Regional differences in inundation, creek structure, vegetation, and grazing:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; heavy grazing by Brent geese in some sites.
  - Morecambe Bay: intensive sheep grazing with pink-footed geese in winter at some sites; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Methods and sampling design
- Sampling timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013 as part of broader field campaign.
- Sampling approach: 1m x 1m quadrats; 4x 20-second suction samples per quadrat using a modified leaf blower suction device (20 cm diameter tube end).
- Sample processing: specimens identified to species level where possible; preserved in 70% IMS; taxonomic guidance from Roel van Klink (Groningen University, Netherlands).

## Data structure and fields
- Primary data: species abundance per sample (numbers per sample) for a long list of species (e.g., Pardosa purbeckensis, Pardosa pullata, Pardosa amentata, Pirata juveniles, various Linyphiidae and Carabidae, etc.), including juvenile records.
- Dataset fields described include:
  - Dataset Field descriptions (two entries indicating field descriptions and cell formatting)
  - Row Number (sorting index)
  - Season (Winter or Summer)
  - Location (Morecambe or Essex)
  - Site (e.g., CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22; Mudflat or Saltmarsh)
  - Scale (A-D; 1m to upper limit)
  - Species names with corresponding counts per sample
  - Additional notes indicating data was presented as counts per sample
- File format: Excel workbook
- Data coding notes: NA cells indicate no data; two separate entries imply parallel field descriptions or versions of the dataset fields

## Data quality and governance
- Calibration procedures: None indicated
- Data checking/quality control: None indicated
- Metadata depth: Includes site descriptions, grazing regimes, and sampling methodology, supporting context for interpretation and reuse
- Observational scope: Limited to Winter and Summer 2013; spatial coverage limited to six salt marsh sites across two regions

## Access and reuse considerations
- Format: Excel workbook, facilitating analysis in common data tools
- Discoverability: Site coordinates and detailed field descriptions enhance GIS and species-level analyses
- Limitations to consider:
  - Absence of explicit quality control or data validation procedures
  - Taxonomic updates or re-identifications since 2013 may affect comparability
  - Data confined to two seasons in a single year; cross-year comparisons require careful normalization

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: field collection, storage, species-level identification, and metadata provision.
- Highlights importance of linking ecological data to site management context (soil type, grazing, inundation) for system-level data strategy.
- Illustrates how rich, species-level abundance data can inform biodiversity and ecosystem-service assessments, while also exposing potential gaps in data governance (QC procedures, standardization, long-term continuity).
- Emphasizes need for clear metadata and documentation to support discoverability, reuse, and collaboration across networks.
