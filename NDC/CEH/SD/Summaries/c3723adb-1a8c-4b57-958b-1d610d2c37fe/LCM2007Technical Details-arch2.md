# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in different formats, to suit the requirements of various users

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides land cover information for the UK in multiple formats to fit user needs, with standardized data and accompanying documentation.

## Vector data
- The most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel with attributes describing land cover and metadata on data derivation.
- Minimum Mapable Unit for land cover parcels: 0.5 hectares.
- Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
- Coverage: UK.
- Details and attribute descriptions are documented in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.

## Raster data
- Five raster products total; a 25 x 25 m raster gives the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
