Final Report for LCM2007 - the new UK land cover map

# Overview
- This document section compares LCM2007 with Countryside Survey (CS) 2007 and discusses UK-wide land cover estimates, noting where agreement is strong or weak and why discrepancies arise.
- It emphasizes implications for monitoring, policy support, and change detection, highlighting issues with class definitions, spectral variability, and spatial granularity.

# Similar and dissimilar area estimates (4.3.2)
- Similar area estimates (within CS 95% confidence limits) for:
  - Broadleaved woodland
  - Acid Grassland
  - Inland Rock
- Dissimilar area estimates (beyond CS 95% confidence limits) for:
  - Arable and Horticulture
  - Improved Grassland
  - Neutral Grassland
  - Dwarf Shrub Heath
  - Bog
  - Montane Habitats
  - Coastal habitats
- Specifics on Arable and Horticulture:
  - CS UK area ~46,574 km2; DEFRA June 2007 ~63,840 km2 for agricultural land; LCM2007 ~63,005 km2.
  - LCM2007 is notably higher than CS upper limit and closer to DEFRA agricultural totals, suggesting differences in what is classified as Arable and Horticulture and inclusion of boundaries.
  - Contributing factors cited:
    - Differences in classification definitions between CS and LCM2007
    - Spectral confusion due to diverse crops and growth stages
    - Inclusion of boundary and linear features within LCM2007’s Arable and Horticulture
    - Temporal mismatch requiring multiple-year images, increasing field changes (e.g., temporary grassland vs arable)
    - Spectral variability and under-representation of signatures for crops
    - Boundary and linear features treated differently due to MMU differences

# Discussion of discrepancies (4.3.3)
- Countryside Survey scaling versus LCM mapping: CS uses ITE Land Classes and scaling to national estimates; how this affects comparability is under analysis.
- Patch size and MMU effects: CS parcels vary in size; many Fen parcels are below LCM MMU, influencing area comparisons.
- Grassland classification complexities: One-to-many relationships between grassland observations and Broad Habitats lead to priority use of Broad Habitat Association rules.
- Fen, Marsh and Swamp: Large discrepancies explained by complex mosaics and different spatial structures; CS data often map Fen areas that LCM2007 resolves as Rough Grassland or Acid Grassland.
- Summary takeaway: Agreement between LCM2007 and CS varies by Broad Habitat; grassland-related classes are particularly challenging due to spectral and structural differences.

# UK Land Cover distributions and comparison with 2000 (4.4)
- UK-wide snapshot: More than 50% of the UK is in intensive land use (Arable and Horticulture + Improved Grassland) or Built-up Areas and Gardens; ~12% in Broadleaved/Conifer Woodland; ~30% semi-natural; remaining areas include Coastal, Semi-natural Grassland, Mountain, Heath and Bog, etc.
- Country-level patterns:
  - England: highest intensive land-use share (about 76%).
  - Scotland: largest share of Coniferous Woodland; substantial semi-natural grassland and montane habitats.
  - Northern Ireland and Wales: significant intensive land-use components as well.
- Comparison with LCM2000 (Aggregate classes):
  - LCM2007 shows higher Arable and Horticulture share (26%) and lower or similar figures for other broad habitat groups compared to LCM2000.
  - Coniferous woodland and urban areas show modest changes between the two maps, with ongoing questions about the influence of the updated spatial framework.
- Tables/figures (Tables 4.8, 4.9; Figures 4.7, 4.8) illustrate UK-wide and country-level distributions and the degree to which LCM2007 estimates fall within Countryside Survey confidence limits.

# Change mapping considerations
- Difficulties in isolating real land cover change from mapping or methodological differences across LCM versions.
- For change monitoring, the LCM2007 framework provides a robust, parcel-based structure that can support cross-map harmonization, but care is needed when interpreting changes due to temporal and classification differences.

# Implications for monitoring frameworks and governance
- LCM2007 offers coast-to-coast UK land cover data with a robust spatial framework that enhances comparability and change detection, but viewers must:
  - Be aware of differences in class definitions when comparing to CS or other datasets.
  - Use Broad Habitat Associations to interpret grassland-related correspondences and to facilitate policy-relevant comparisons.
  - Consider using 1 km aggregated data for nationwide monitoring where cross-map comparability is essential.
- Validation and interpretation:
  - The parcel-level metadata and knowledge-based enhancements support post-classification validation, but cross-dataset validation remains essential due to differences in spatial structure and temporal alignment.

# Limitations and caveats for monitoring practitioners
- Grassland and upland habitat classes remain challenging to separate spectrally; spectral confusion and transitional mosaics persist.
- Differences in spatial structure (parcels vs CS squares) and MMU affect area estimates and change detection.
- Boundary and linear features are treated differently across datasets, influencing areas attributed to Arable and Horticulture or other classes.
- Temporal misalignment between image capture periods and field surveys can drive discrepancies.

# Bottom line for monitoring practitioners
- LCM2007 provides a comprehensive, policy-relevant UK land cover dataset with rich metadata and a robust spatial framework, designed to enable consistent monitoring and change detection.
- Expect variability in agreement with Countryside Survey across habitat types, with grassland-related classes and fen/marsh/swamp areas showing the greatest divergence.
- For monitoring and policy evaluation, use LCM2007 as a baseline, apply Broad Habitat Association rules to interpret correspondence with CS, and employ careful cross-map harmonization when analyzing change or country-level extrapolations.
