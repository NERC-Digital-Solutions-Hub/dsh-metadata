# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

- Overview
  - LCM2007 is provided in multiple formats to suit different user needs and analyses.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).
  - Includes both vector and raster representations with accompanying metadata and documentation.

- Data formats and specifications
  - Vector data
    - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
    - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describes how the information was derived.
    - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
    - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Raster data
    - Five raster products in total.
    - 25 x 25 m raster: provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
    - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarize the 25 x 25 m raster.
    - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes.
    - Supply format: GeoTiff.
  
- Documentation and metadata
  - Further information is available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
  - Tables included in the documentation:
    - Table 1: Description of the attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
    - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
    - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

- Practical implications for data leadership
  - Choose vector or raster format based on the required level of detail and the analysis scale.
  - Leverage the accompanying metadata and tables to ensure consistent interpretation of classes and attributes.
  - Use the dataset documentation to align classifications with broader habitat frameworks and to understand data provenance and quality.
