# Dung beetle community data from a beforeand-after El Niño experiment in the Brazilian Amazon

## Overview
- Time series dataset of dung beetle abundance at dung-baited pitfall traps.
- Collected in 2010 (around six years before El Niño) and in 2016 and 2017 (six years and 18 months after the 2015-16 El Niño).
- Brazilian Amazon region, part of the NERC Human-Modified Tropical Forest (HTMF) programme.
- Regional focus: Paragominas (PGM) and Santarém/Belterra/Mojuí dos Campos (Santarém STM).
- Aims to quantify how human- and climate-induced stressors influence tropical forest biodiversity; supports standardized environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Data structure and contents
- Four datasheets/files:
  - Species-all.sites_2010: plot-level beetle abundance across 381 plots.
  - Species-subset.sites_2016: plot-level abundance for 36 plots re-sampled in 2016.
  - Species-subset.sites_2017: plot-level abundance for 36 plots re-sampled in 2017.
  - Plot-position: geographic coordinates for each study plot.
- Files in the ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS series:
  - dung-beetles_ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_all.sites_2010.csv
  - dung-beetles_ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_subset.sites_2016.csv
  - dung-beetles_ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_subset.sites_2017.csv
  - dung-beetles_ECOFOR_AFIRE_RAS_all_plot-position.csv
- Columns include species identities and abundance per plot.

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Regions: Paragominas (PGM) and Santarém/Belterra/Mojuí dos Campos (Santarém STM), Pará.
- Sampling framework: 18 catchments (32–61 km²) with plots distributed ~1 per 4 km².
- Plot types: non-forest (pastures and mechanised agriculture) and forest (primary and second-growth after agricultural abandonment).
- 2010: 381 plots sampled (total of 3,429 pitfall traps).
- 2016/2017: 333 pits per year across 36 plots (same plots across years), selected along a degradation gradient:
  - Undisturbed, logged, logged-and-burned, and secondary forests.
  - Half of plots fire-affected during El Niño; others affected by drought only.

## Data collection methods
- Pitfall traps baited with 50 g dung (80% pig, 20% human) and filled with killing solution (5% detergent, 2% salt).
- Trap arrangement: three traps per sampling point on a 300-m transect, forming a 3-m equilateral triangle; sampling at 0, 150, and 300 m.
- Traps active for 48 hours per sampling event; identical protocols across 2010, 2016, 2017.
- Permitting: verbal landowner permits; Brazilian legislation for protected areas; SISBIO permits for 2010-11 and 2016.

## Geographic and temporal scope
- Temporal: 2010 (pre-El Niño); 2016 and 2017 (post-El Niño).
- Geographic coverage: eastern Amazonian Pará state; municipalities of Paragominas and Santarém region; plot locations provided as coordinates in UTM zones 21M and 22M.

## Access, licensing, and reuse
- Data produced under the NERC HTMF programme with funding from NERC, Darwin Initiative, EMBRAPA, CNPq, INCT Biodiversidade, and Swedish Formas.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy scrutiny
- Delivers standardized, plot-level time-series data to monitor biodiversity responses to climate events and land-use change.
- Facilitates cross-study comparisons, detection of biodiversity trends, and evaluation of policy effectiveness on tropical forest resilience.
- Data are organized for storage in appropriate data portals to support ongoing monitoring and transparency.
