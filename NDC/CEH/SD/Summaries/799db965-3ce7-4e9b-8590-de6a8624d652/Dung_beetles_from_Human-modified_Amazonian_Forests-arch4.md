# Dung beetle community data from a beforeand-after El Niño experiment in the Brazilian Amazon

- Purpose: Time-series dataset to assess how human- and climate-induced stressors influence tropical forest biodiversity, focusing on dung beetle communities.
- Data scope: Abundance data from dung-baited pitfall traps collected in 2010 (baseline), 2016, and 2017 (post-El Niño) in the Brazilian Amazon.
- Study design: 381 plots surveyed in 2010 across forest and non-forest habitats; a subset of 36 forest plots re-sampled in 2016 and 2017 along a gradient of prior forest disturbance, including fire-affected and drought-impacted sites.
- Data files (four datasets):
  - All sites 2010: plot-level beetle abundance for 381 plots.
  - Subset 2016: plot-level abundance for 36 re-sampled plots.
  - Subset 2017: plot-level abundance for the same 36 plots.
  - Plot-position: geographical coordinates and municipality for each plot.
- Taxonomic data: Species/morphospecies identifications; abundance per plot.
- Spatial data: Plot coordinates with UTM zones (22M and 21M); municipality information.
- Provenance and collaboration: Part of the NERC Human-Modified Tropical Forest (HTMF) programme; multiple funders and institutions involved; explicit field permits and ethical approvals noted.
- Access and reuse: Data cite with DOI; licensing and reuse limitations described at the provided link; proper citation required for reuse.
- Data collection methods: Pitfall traps baited with dung (80% pig, 20% human) in triplets along a 300-m transect; traps left for 48 hours; consistent methods across years.
- Field logistics: Sampling conducted across catchments in Paragominas (PGM) and Santarém region; coordination with landowners and adherence to Brazilian conservation regulations.
- Data governance: Four structured CSV files with clear column definitions; consistent plot identifiers to enable cross-year comparisons.
