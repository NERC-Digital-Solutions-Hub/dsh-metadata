# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Purpose and Context
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and its evolution.
- Connects the current sampling framework to the long-running ITE Land Classification (developed over ~30 years) to enable robust, time-series habitat estimates.
- Aims to provide national and country-level estimates of habitats and their changes, supporting policy and environmental monitoring.
- Emphasises the need for representative sampling, consistency across surveys, and the ability to detect change over time.

## Foundations: ITE Land Classification and Stratification
- Core idea: stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure all land types are represented.
- ITE Land Classification originated in the 1970s, grouping 1 km squares by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than solely observed species.
- Initial outcome: 32 land classes described by environmental characteristics; sampling unit was a 1 km square, with auxiliary classification of surrounding squares.
- Early sampling used a centre square from a 15 x 15 km grid (1228 centre squares classified), plus four surrounding squares (total 6039 km^2 classified).
- The approach allowed national estimates by weighting mean habitat areas by the land class areas.

## Timeline of Developments and Sampling Frameworks
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from 1 km squares.
  - 8 squares surveyed per class (256 total); national habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square times land-class area.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 squares per class (384 total); used the CS1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; CS1990 results published; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 onward (Revised Classification & CS2000 Adjustments)
  - Land Classification extended to enable regional and local estimates; some squares reclassified; 40 classes established.
  - Changes affected national estimate consistency; adoption of country-based reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) with separate country estimates.
  - CS2000 introduced countries-focused sampling (England with Wales, Scotland) via class subdivisions and reallocation.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve upland estimates (additional 30 squares).
- 2007 (CS2007 Adjustments for Wales and Wales-only Reporting)
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to further class subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares allocated to ensure representation, minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England retained most classes but two English classes (5e, 15e) ended with only 4 squares per class.
  - Wales, England, and Scotland sampling maps updated to reflect revised land-class frameworks.

## Sampling Design and National Estimates
- Sampling units: 1 km squares stratified by ITE Land Classes, with adjustments over time to accommodate country-specific reporting.
- Core calculation: national estimates derived as the mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class.
- Across surveys, the Land Classification used for national estimates varied (1990, 2000, 2007 classifications); cross-survey consistency is influenced by changing classifications.
- Outputs include annual reports and change statistics across survey cycles, informing policy and landscape monitoring.

## Country-specific Reporting and Wales
- CS1990–CS2000 introduced separate country estimates to deliver England with Wales and Scotland-specific results.
- ITE Land Classes subdivided into country-unit variants (e.g., 5e for England, 5w for Wales) to improve country-specific accuracy.
- Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England squares in Wales reporting to maintain country-focused estimates.
- Wales received more intensive sampling (64 squares in 2000; 43 Welsh additions in 2007) to improve Wales-only reporting accuracy.

## Upland Habitats Module
- Additional sampling module added to bolster estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Involves placing an extra set of squares within upland land classes to improve statistical precision for upland habitat estimates.

## Data Consistency, Comparability, and Reporting Notes
- Changing classification schemes across surveys can affect the consistency of national estimates; two approaches exist:
  - Use the latest (country-specific) Land Classification for national estimates to reflect current understanding.
  - Use the original 1990 Land Classification for cross-survey consistency, at the expense of comparability with newer classifications.
- Table 4 in the document contrasts sample sizes per class across surveys under the Original (1990) Land Classification, illustrating how classifications shift sample allocations over time.

## Outputs, Dissemination, and Acknowledgments
- Outputs include summarized numbers of survey squares per class, strata areas, and sampling rates; these underpin the published Countryside Survey UK results (e.g., CS1990, CS2000, CS2007).
- Acknowledges contributions from DETR, CEH, ITE, and statisticians; references to foundational methodological work and subsequent CS reports.
