# Countryside Survey 2007

## Overview
- Large-scale national survey to provide scientific evidence on the countryside’s plants, habitats, soils, and freshwater to inform policy and management.
- Comprises two main parts:
  - Field Survey (this report): habitats, vegetation, soils (0–15 cm) and freshwater.
  - Land Cover Map (to be published in 2009): a digital, satellite-derived map.
- Covers England, Scotland, Wales (1 km2 sample squares); Northern Ireland (0.5 km2 squares) via the Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS); UK data merged for GB/UK reporting.
- Enables estimates of habitat areas and changes, vegetation condition, soil properties, and freshwater/pond condition over time (a 30-year data series from 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007).

## Data and Habitat Classification
- Broad Habitat Classification: 27 Broad Habitats used to monitor nationwide changes and support UK Biodiversity Action Plan commitments.
- Priority Habitats: 65 habitats identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan; CS provides national estimates for a subset (e.g., hedgerows, ponds, arable field margins) and reports on changes where possible.
- Data linkage: Vegetation plots are tied to mapped Broad/Priority Habitats to assess condition; plots can be reassigned to reflect habitat changes over time.

## Field Survey Methodology
- Sampling design: 591 sample squares (1 km x 1 km) across GB; NI adds data from 0.5 km x 0.5 km squares; sampled squares reflect climate and geology variation.
- Re-sampling strategy: Aims to sample the same squares across surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2007) with increasing numbers of squares; missing values estimated via statistical modelling to enable year-to-year change analysis.
- Habitat mapping: all Broad and Priority Habitats and linear features mapped within each square (minimum mappable areas) using a standardized key (updated over time).
- Vegetation sampling plots:
  - Up to ~67 plots per 1 km square across diverse landscape contexts.
  - Plots record plant species presence and percent cover; plots are fixed in space to enable change analysis.
  - Electronic data capture used in 2007 with GPS-enabled field data entry and integrated GIS.
- Soil sampling (0–15 cm):
  - Five plots per square; measures include pH, carbon concentration, bulk density, and other soil properties.
  - Three soil samples per main plot plus a fourth for invertebrate sampling.
- Freshwater sampling:
  - Headwater streams sampled in 373 of 591 squares; macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and River Habitat Survey (RHS) data collected.
  - Ponds surveyed in 260 squares; pond condition assessed using plant-based criteria and PSYM (pond quality assessment) metrics.
  - PSYM uses plant metrics (e.g., submerged/marginal species, trophic rank, uncommon species) to estimate overall pond quality.

## Data and Analysis
- Output measures:
  - Area and change in Broad and Priority Habitats.
  - Condition of vegetation within habitats via Aggregate Classes (ACs) derived from plot data.
  - Linear features lengths and counts of ponds/hedgerow trees.
  - Soil properties (pH, carbon stock in top 0–15 cm; bulk density; variations over time).
  - Freshwater condition indices (bioassessment and habitat diversity) and pond quality (PSYM).
- Statistical approach:
  - Bootstrapping used to assess significance with a standard 0.05 level (and more stringent levels where indicated).
  - Reporting emphasizes GB/UK totals and country-level (England, Scotland, Wales) details; changes between years presented with arrows and significance indicators.
- Measures of vegetation condition (Box 1.3):
  - Species richness; farmland bird food plants; butterfly food plants.
  - Grass:forb ratio; competitor, stress-tolerator, and ruderal scores.
  - Light, fertility, Ellenberg pH, and moisture scores as proxy indicators of habitat conditions.

## Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
- Separate NI sampling (288 squares in 2007 at ~0.5% intensity).
- Data integrated with GB data to form UK estimates; habitat change assessed with country-specific masks and Northern Ireland land classifications.
- Methods include GIS mapping, GPS field data, and linkage to NI ecological maps.

## Outputs and Accessibility
- Data products:
  - Broad Habitat area estimates and changes across GB/UK.
  - Conversion flows among Broad Habitats (1998–2007) to illustrate directional changes.
  - Vegetation condition across Broad Habitats and long-term vegetation change (1978–2007) via ACs.
  - Priority Habitat estimates and associated species data where available.
  - Soil carbon stock estimates (across years) and related soil properties.
  - Freshwater habitat data (streams and ponds) including RHS, MTR (Mean Trophic Rank) for streams, and PSYM for ponds.
  - 1: Land Cover Map (to be published 2009) linking to field data for integrated analysis.
- Data management:
  - Central geographic database integrating mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soil samples, and freshwater data.
  - GIS-based workflow; field data captured electronically; ability to download/upload data through a web-based system.
- Access and use:
  - Reports designed for policy makers, researchers, and practitioners, with caveats about extrapolation beyond the surveyed squares.
  - Rights and reproduction: CS report published by NERC; data/products available via Countryside Survey channels (website and CEH contact).

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Support
- Time spent understanding the ask and aligning data collection with policy needs.
- Handling patchy data and diverse formats across years and regions.
- Ensuring clear communication of complex ecological information to non-specialist end users.
- Encouraging wider sharing and reuse of outputs; promoting outputs to maximize impact.
- Translation and compatibility between historic habitat classifications and the Broad Habitat system.

## Key Takeaways for Data Support
- The Countryside Survey 2007 provides a robust, long-term, evidence-based framework for monitoring UK countryside habitats, vegetation, soils, and freshwater.
- It leverages a carefully designed, statistically grounded sampling regime with comprehensive field mapping, plot-based vegetation data, soil analyses, and freshwater assessments.
- Outputs include habitat extent and change, vegetation condition, soil carbon stocks, and freshwater quality metrics, all underpinned by a centralized GIS-enabled data infrastructure.
- The forthcoming Land Cover Map will complement the field data, enabling integrated analysis and broader accessibility for data exploration and product creation.
