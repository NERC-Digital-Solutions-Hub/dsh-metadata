# Countryside Survey: Ash tree distribution in areas <5ha,  2007

- Purpose: Provides estimates of ash trees for Great Britain within broadleaved woodland areas smaller than 5 hectares, derived from Countryside Survey 2007 data; dataset file named CS07_ashtree_areas (data © NERC CEH).
- Data content and structure:
  - Columns: Gridcode (1-7) and Ha_per_km (ash hectares per km^2) across seven bands: 0-0.2, 0.2-0.4, 0.4-0.6, 0.6-0.8, 0.8-1, 1-5, >5.
  - Resolution: 1 km.
  - Extent: Great Britain.
  - Coordinate system and projection: British National Grid (OSGB1936), Transverse Mercator.
- Dataset scope and limitations:
  - Represents ash presence in 2007 within woodlands <0.5 ha to avoid duplication with Forestry Commission data.
  - Uses mean ash woodland area within a 1 km square by land class, then scales by land class area to generate national estimates in hectares.
- Methodology and data provenance:
  - Countryside Survey uses stratified random sampling of 1 km squares across GB, classified by land class and habitat type; dominant species recorded by percentage cover categories.
  - Land classification: 1990 ITE Land Classification (32 classes); means per land class scaled by the proportion of Broadleaved Woodland in each 1 km square according to Land Cover Map 2007.
  - Calculation approach: sum across land classes of (mean ash area per land class × land class area) to produce GB-wide estimates.
