# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification to provide a consistent, time-series framework for monitoring England, Scotland, and Wales.
  - Emphasises data provenance, verification, quality assurance, transformation, and storage, with outputs (reports, maps, charts) designed for clear environmental health assessment and policy scrutiny.

- Core concepts and methodology
  - Stratified, random sampling: samples are drawn within discrete strata to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - ITE Land Classification: a hierarchical stratification of land based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to define sampling strata.
  - 1 km square sampling units: the basic spatial unit for field surveys; originally centered on a 15 x 15 km grid with adjacent squares allocated to the same land class.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): multivariate method used to group quadrats into land classes for early iterations.
  - National estimates: produced by combining mean habitat area per square within each land class with the land-class area.

- Development timeline of the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey sampling
  - 1978 (CS1978): first use of ITE Land Classification to stratify a GB field sample; 32 classes from 1 km squares; 8 samples per class; total 256 squares.
  - 1984 (CS1984): increased sample size to 12 squares per class; 384 squares total; framework still aligned with original 32 classes.
  - 1990 (CS1990): all GB squares reclassified using a revised Land Classification; 508 squares surveyed; integration with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998/CS1990 refinement: broader regional applicability; classification expanded to 40 classes; groundwork for separate Scotland reporting.
  - 2000 (CS2000): revised Land Classification enabling separate country estimates; class sub-division into country units (England with Wales, Scotland); additional upland habitat sampling module introduced.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting formalised; Welsh class sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata overall; substantial Welsh sampling (43 extra squares) to ensure adequate Welsh representation; adjustments to English sampling in some classes.

- Sampling framework per survey (highlights)
  - CS1978: 256 total squares; 8 per class; baseline national estimates via mean habitat per square times class area.
  - CS1984: 384 squares; 12 per class; refined national estimates.
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares reclassified; integration with Land Cover Map; expanded data collection (repeat vegetation quadrats, etc.).
  - CS2000: ~40 land classes subdivided for country units; 40 strata leading to multiple country-level estimates; upland module added (30 additional upland squares) for improved accuracy in uplands.
  - CS2007: 45 strata (country-unit subdivisions); Wales receives targeted additions (43 extra squares) to ensure Wales-only reporting quality; some English classes reduced to four squares per class but deemed acceptable for precision.

- Country-specific estimates and uplands
  - Separate country estimates created to deliver England with Wales and Scotland results, with corresponding class subdivisions and, where needed, aggregations to maintain adequate sample sizes per country.
  - An uplands module (CS2000) added to strengthen habitat estimates in upland/marginal areas of England and Wales.

- Wales-focused adjustments (CS2007)
  - Introduction of five Welsh country-unit sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Increase to 45 strata from 40; 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure at least 6 squares per new Welsh class.
  - England adjustments to maintain balance after Welsh additions; two English classes (5e, 15e) remain at four squares each, considered acceptable per scoping studies.

- Data handling, outputs, and accessibility
  - Data are verified, quality assured, cleaned, transformed, stored, and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
  - Outputs are delivered as clear formats (reports, maps, charts) suitable for environmental health assessment and monitoring of policy performance.

- National estimates and consistency considerations
  - Changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects comparability; internal consistency favors using the latest classification for GB estimates, while historical consistency might prefer the original system for cross-survey comparisons.
  - Table and note discussions illustrate how sample numbers per class have shifted across versions and the implications for national estimates.
