# Countryside Survey 2007

## Aim
- Use data to demonstrate the condition of the environment in a consistent format for scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Provide a long-term evidence base to inform sustainable countryside management and policy decisions.

## What it is
- Countryside Survey (CS) comprises two main parts:
  - Field Survey (this report): habitats, vegetation, soils (0-15 cm) and freshwater.
  - Land Cover Map: a digital map using satellite data to be published in 2009.
- Coverage:
  - 591 1km x 1km sample squares across England, Scotland and Wales; Northern Ireland data from a separate NI survey (0.5km x 0.5km).
  - Results are integrated to provide UK-wide estimates where possible.
- Outputs:
  - National and regional estimates of Broad Habitats and, for 2007, some Priority Habitats.
  - Baseline and change assessments for vegetation, soils, freshwater, and landscape features (hedges, walls, ponds, trees).

## Data collection and methodologies
- Field Survey components:
  - Habitat mapping within each square and detailed vegetation plots.
  - Soil samples taken from five plots per square (0-15 cm).
  - Freshwater sampling for headwater streams and ponds (where present).
- Classification and measures:
  - Broad Habitat classification (27 Broad Habitats; UK Biodiversity Action Plan framework) and Priority Habitats (65 total across the UK).
  - Vegetation condition assessed via Aggregate Classes (ACs), enabling cross-year comparability (AC1–AC8).
  - Linear features (hedges, walls, fences, etc.) and landscape elements recorded.
- Sampling strategy:
  - Random 1km squares selected within 32 ITE land classes; same squares often reused to track change over time.
  - Long-term time series from 1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, and 2007 (with combined GB and NI data for UK reporting).
  - Advanced statistical modelling used to estimate changes using all available data (not limited to overlapping squares).
- Data collection and storage:
  - First-time use of electronic data capture in 2007; GIS-based mapping with CEH-developed software and ESRI UK.
  - GPS and web-based data management for regular data download/upload; data linked in a single geographically referenced database.
- Northern Ireland:
  - NI Countryside Survey (NICS) complemented CS to provide UK-wide estimates; continuous methodological alignment with UK Broad Habitat framework.

## Measures and outputs
- Broad Habitat area estimates:
  - Area and change for 45 Land Classes; GB, England, Scotland, Wales; UK total when combined with NI data.
  - Tables and figures indicate stock and change, with statistical significance (P ≤ 0.05, with stronger levels indicated where applicable).
- Priority Habitats:
  - National estimates for a subset of Priority Habitats (e.g., Hedgerows, Ponds, Arable Field Margins) presented where possible; spatial masks used to delineate upland, lowland, and woodland types.
- Vegetation condition:
  - Condition assessed across Broad Habitats using AC-based analyses; long-term vegetation change tracked from 1978 to 2007 for cohorts defined by 1978 AC allocation.
- Soil analysis (0-15 cm):
  - pH, carbon concentration, bulk density; additional metrics such as exchangeable nutrients and soil biota planned for dedicated reports.
- Freshwater condition:
  - Headwater streams: biological condition via macroinvertebrates; stream plant communities for nutrient enrichment; River Habitat Survey (RHS) for physical habitat diversity; Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA).
  - Ponds: condition assessments using plant-based criteria (PSYM framework) to rate ecological quality (Very Poor to Good).
- Data and reporting:
  - The 2007 results feed into a broader reporting framework, with measures of vegetation condition and habitat quality presented in tables and figures, marked for significance.

## Vegetation condition measures (examples)
- Species Richness: total taxa per plot (including native and non-native; excluding lichens/mosses/liverworts).
- Farmland Butterfly/Bird Food Plants: plant species used as food resources.
- Grass:Forb Ratio: relative cover; reflects plant community balance.
- Competitor, Stress-tolerator, Ruderal Scores: plant strategy traits indicating dominance patterns and disturbance responses.
- Light Score, Fertility Score, Ellenberg pH Score, Moisture Score: indirect indicators of site conditions derived from species indicators.

## Reporting framework and significance
- Results are reported at UK, GB, and country levels; Broad Habitat data also by country.
- Significance testing (p-values) and directional arrows indicate changes; more granular significance (0.01, 0.001) noted where relevant.
- Boxed measures for vegetation condition and the long-term trajectory (1978–2007) provide context for policy and management decisions.
- The reporting framework supports interpretation of habitat change, benchmarks against UK Biodiversity Action Plans, and linking to strategic programs like Living With Environmental Change.

## Data management, accessibility, and outputs
- Central GIS-based database linking mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soil samples, and freshwater data.
- Electronic data capture and web-based management enable ongoing data access and reuse.
- Land Cover Map (remote sensing) to be published in 2009; integrated with field data for comprehensive spatial analysis.
- Northern Ireland data integrated to deliver UK-wide habitat estimates; distinct masks and regional stratifications used for Priority Habitat estimation.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Challenges:
  - Increasing the value of datasets by combining CS data with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use outputs).
  - Enabling broad access to the underlying data used to create final outputs.
- Opportunities:
  - Long-term time series enable policy evaluation and trend analysis.
  - Standardised methods and integrated datasets support cross-country policy coordination and biodiversity monitoring.

## Collaboration and funding
- Partnership of nine government-funded bodies led by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and Defra.
- Countryside Survey conducted by CEH with broad collaboration across agencies and land managers; extensive acknowledgments to field staff, landowners, and partners.

## Accessibility and use
- Provides hard scientific evidence on the health of the countryside, informing policy decisions, land management, and environmental stewardship.
- Aims to be a foundational data resource for national and strategic environmental programs and future monitoring cycles.
