# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Overview
- The Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running, periodic audit of the UK's countryside, enabling comparison over time and detection of gradual changes since 1978.
- This report estimates the extent and distribution of ash trees (Fraxinus excelsior) in Great Britain in woodlands under 0.5 ha, counts individual ash trees outside woodland, and assesses ash in linear features and vegetation plots.
- The goal is to understand ash distribution to inform potential impacts from ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea) and to identify landscape components where ash is most common.

## Data and Methods
- Sampling design: CS surveys 1 km squares across GB using stratified random sampling based on land classes and ecological gradients; focuses on current land cover, overlapping with but excluding large woodland parcels tracked by the Forestry Commission (NFI data) to avoid duplication.
- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha): Uses percentage cover data per 1 km square, aggregated across land classes to produce national ash area estimates with confidence limits.
- Individual trees outside woodland: Record number and modal diameter at breast height (DbH) per 1 km square; includes small clumps; veteran trees (DbH > 2 m) recorded with extra details.
- Woody Linear Features (hedgerows and lines of trees): Measure ash presence in lines of trees, hedgerows, and belts; ash proportion estimated in each feature type, with separate treatments for natural vs. unnatural shaped features; length estimates per square and scaled to national totals.
- Vegetation plots: Use a nested layout (linear plots along features and small/large plots in habitats) to track ash occupancy and mean cover; change over time assessed via a vegetation-plot change index.
- Analyses integrate CS plots with land-class proportions and, for hedgerows, nearby “D” plots (hedge diversity plots) to estimate ash share.

## Key Findings
- Areal extent: Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha is estimated at 38.5 thousand hectares (with lower/upper confidence intervals provided).
- Landscape distribution: Ash is found in fields, field boundaries, near rivers/streams, and especially in hedgerows.
- Relative abundance: Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) after Oak; England shows the highest ash area (about 32.1 thousand ha), followed by Scotland (4.4 thousand ha) and Wales (2.0 thousand ha).
- Outside woodland: Approximately 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands; ash is the second most common species among individual trees.
- Size distribution: Most ash trees outside woodland are in the mid-range DbH (roughly 21–50 cm); veteran trees are relatively rare.
- Hedgerows: Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species (as a standard in hedgerows), with Oak the next most common.
- Linear features: Ash is estimated to constitute 98.9 thousand km of woody linear features in GB (dividing into lines of trees, hedgerows, and belts), of which England accounts for the majority (86.1 thousand km; 66.3 thousand km in hedgerows, 19.7 thousand km in lines of trees).
- Country differences: Scotland and Wales show notably lower ash presence in linear features than England.
- Vegetation plots: Ash appeared in about 30% of hedgerow plots and in various hedge-related plot types with notable mean cover percentages (e.g., around 19–24% in several plot categories).
- Temporal change: From 1978 to 2007, ash occupancy increased on linear features; ash area plots also rose between 1990 and 2007, indicating a general increase in ash presence across landscape components.

## Interpretation and Significance
- Ash is a major component of the British countryside, especially in hedgerows and small woodland patches, implying that ash dieback could have widespread landscape and habitat impacts.
- The prominence of ash in hedgerows suggests potential structural and ecological consequences for edge habitats and associated species if ash declines.
- The study demonstrates the value of integrating CS data with other datasets (e.g., NFI) to build scale-appropriate, landscape-wide estimates, while noting CS focuses on current land cover rather than stocked woodland areas.
- Limitations include the lack of spatially explicit, fine-grained maps beyond the produced land-class based representations, and the need to couple data with disease status and other driving variables for predictive modeling.

## Future Research and Applications
- Develop monitoring protocols to capture the impact of ash diseases (e.g., dieback) on distribution and condition.
- Create a linear product that scales from 1 km CS squares to GB-wide coverage, integrating CS field data with LIDAR and map layers for improved linear-feature mapping.
- Further analyze CS and GB woodland survey data to determine ash influences on co-occurring plant species and identify species associations with ash presence.
- Attribute ash distribution and change to multiple explanatory variables (climate, soil, deposition, dispersal) to improve models of future distribution and disease impacts.
- Explore complementarity with Forestry Commission data for a fuller picture, while acknowledging methodological differences (CS vs. NFI) in reporting areas vs. current land cover.

## Appendix and Additional Information
- Appendix 1 contains distribution maps for other broadleaved species (birch, oak, beech, sycamore, hazel, hawthorn, willow, alder, chestnut) using similar CS methods.
- Data are intended to inform monitoring, policy, and research into ash dieback and woodland/biodiversity management.
