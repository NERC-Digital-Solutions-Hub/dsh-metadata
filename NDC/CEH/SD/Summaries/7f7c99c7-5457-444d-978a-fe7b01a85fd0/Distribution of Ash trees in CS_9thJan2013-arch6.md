# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- The Countryside Survey is a long-running UK study (since 1978) that samples the countryside using rigorous methods to enable comparisons over time and against previous surveys.
- This report estimates the extent and distribution of ash (Fraxinus excelsior) in Great Britain across several landscape components: woodlands (<0.5 ha), individual trees outside woodland, hedgerows/lines of trees, and vegetation plots.
- It also documents trends in ash occurrence in fixed vegetation plots and discusses data-driven maps and potential future data products.

## Key Findings

- Ash area in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: 38.51 thousand hectares.
- Ash occurs across multiple landscape components (fields, field boundaries, rivers/streams, hedgerows).
- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) after Oak; England shows the highest area (32.1 thousand ha), followed by Scotland (4.4 thousand ha) and Wales (1.99 thousand ha).
- An estimated 2.2 million individual ash trees outside woodland; ash is the second most common species among individual trees.
- Most ash trees have small to mid-range DBH (roughly 21–50 cm); veteran trees are rare.
- Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species, with substantial presence in hedgerows as well as standard hedgerow trees.
- Woody linear features contain an estimated 98.9 thousand km of ash (lines of trees, belts, hedgerows), predominantly in England (86.1 thousand km; hedgerows 66.3 thousand km; lines of trees 19.7 thousand km).
- Vegetation plots show ash in various linear and boundary contexts; ash is found in about 30% of hedgerow plots, with notable mean cover values across plot types.
- Ash distribution shows increases over time: ash occupancy rose on linear plots between 1978–2007, and area plots show increases from 1990–2007.
- Spatially, ash is most abundant in southeast England, with maps produced at the land-class level to indicate broader regional patterns (not a precise spatial map for every location).

## Methodology

- Data source: Countryside Survey (1 km square stratified random sampling across GB) with varying data layers:
  - Areas: mapping ash presence in woodlands (excluding areas reported by the National Forestry Inventory).
  - Individual trees: outside woodland, including small clumps; up to 10 veteran trees per 1 km square recorded.
  - Hedgerows and woody linear features: lines of trees, hedgerows, belts; ash proportions estimated from species composition data and plots adjacent to hedges.
  - Vegetation plots: linear plots along features and small sampled plots in fields and biotopes to measure ash occupancy and cover.
- National estimates are derived by combining local measurements (area, counts, % cover by ash) with land-class areas and scaling to GB totals; midpoints of percentage cover categories were used where necessary.
- Overlay with other datasets (e.g., NFI) to avoid duplication, and separate analyses for different habitat types to prevent confounding with woodland vs non-woodland.
- Change analysis uses change indices across survey years, with significance testing (notably strong significance in some linear plot increases).

## Results by Component

- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha)
  - Ash is the second most abundant broadleaved species in these small woodlands across GB.
  - England dominates with the largest ash-woodland area; region-specific patterns vary by country.
- Individual trees outside woodland
  - ~2.2 million ash trees outside woodland in GB; England contains the majority (~1.8 million), with smaller numbers in Scotland and Wales.
  - Distribution maps show higher concentrations in certain land classes; ash is a major constituent of non-woodland trees.
  - Veteran trees (DbH > 2 m) exist but are relatively rare; age distribution skews toward mid-range DBH.
- Hedgerow trees
  - Ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species, ahead of Oak and others.
- Woody Linear Features
  - Total ash in woody linear features: ~98.9 thousand km across GB.
  - England contains the majority of this length (86.1 thousand km), with hedgerows accounting for ~66.3 thousand km and lines of trees for ~19.7 thousand km.
  - Density/occurrence varies by land class, with higher densities in certain regions and habitat types.
- Vegetation plots
  - Ash present in about 30% of hedgerow diversity plots and in various other plot types (boundaries, roadside, streamside, X/X-field plots, etc.), with mean ash cover values differing by plot type.
- Changes in distribution
  - Ash occupancy increased on linear plots from 1978 to 2007 (significant for linear plots).
  - Ash area plots show increases from 1990 to 2007, indicating a broad upward trend in ash presence across the landscape.

## Discussion

- Ash constitutes a significant component of the British countryside, particularly as hedgerow trees and within linear features; loss of ash could create notable ecological gaps.
- The study demonstrates the value of combining CS field data with spatial products (land-class means, Land Cover Map 2007) to generate landscape-scale insight and approximate maps of ash distribution.
- The analysis is not designed to attribute causes (e.g., climate or disease) but acknowledges ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea) as a driver worth monitoring.
- Data limitations: maps are indicative rather than precise spatial predictions; differences between CS and NFI reporting (e.g., current land cover vs. stock in woodlands) necessitated careful data handling to avoid duplication.
- The Countryside Survey collection includes rich co-located data (soils, water, land use, vegetation, etc.), enabling future modeling of ash distribution against explanatory variables (climate, soil, deposition, etc.).

## Future Work

- Develop monitoring protocols for tree diseases and mortality within CS surveys; potentially extend to measured DBH and veteran status in woodlands (where feasible).
- Create a linear-product (combining CS data with LIDAR, OS maps, and Land Cover Map) to scale linear ash distribution from 1 km squares to GB-wide coverage.
- Carry out deeper analyses of CS vegetation plots (and cross-dataset analyses with GB woodland surveys) to identify plant species associations with ash and the impacts of ash loss on associated communities.
- Expand analyses to attribute ash distribution to drivers (climate, soils, dispersal) and to model future distribution under ash dieback scenarios.
- Use CS data to support models of future ash distribution and to inform management decisions, including hedgerow maintenance and biodiversity planning.

## Appendix and Data Products

- Appendix 1 includes distribution maps for other broadleaved species (e.g., birch, oak, beech, sycamore) using similar methods.
- The report highlights the potential for novel spatial products based on CS data, to be refined and scaled with additional data sources.
