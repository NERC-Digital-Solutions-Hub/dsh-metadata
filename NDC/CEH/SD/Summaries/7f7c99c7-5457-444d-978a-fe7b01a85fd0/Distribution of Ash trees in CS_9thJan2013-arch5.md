# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- This report documents the distribution and extent of ash trees in Great Britain using Countryside Survey (CS) data, prompted by concerns about ash dieback (Chalara fraxinea).
- CS provides a long-running, systematic audit of the countryside (since 1978) with 1 km square sampling to enable national-scale estimates and comparisons over time.
- Focuses on ash distribution across landscape components: woodlands smaller than 0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodland, hedgerows and woody linear features, and vegetation plots.
- Data are used to inform potential impacts of ash dieback and to explore spatial patterns and temporal trends in ash presence.

## Data scope and units

- Areas: areal extent of ash in Broadleaved woodland <0.5 ha per 1 km square; national estimates by landclass with weighting; avoids overlap with Forestry Commission/National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data.
- Individual trees: ash trees outside woodland recorded per 1 km square, including small clumps; up to 10 veteran trees per square with additional attributes.
- Woody Linear Features: ash within lines of trees, hedgerows, belts; ash proportion estimated within natural linear features using vegetation plots adjacent to hedges.
- Vegetation plots: several plot types (boundary, hedge, hedge diversity, arable margins, roadside, streamside, field plots, small habitat patches) used to assess ash occupancy and mean cover.
- Data integration: NFI/FC data overlaid to exclude woodland parcels reported by NFI; CS-based estimates scaled to national totals using landclass frameworks.

## Methodology

- Sampling: stratified random sampling of 1 km squares across GB based on landclasses representing major ecological gradients.
- Areas: map habitats and dominant species within each square; use midpoints of percentage cover bands to estimate ash area per landclass; aggregate to GB totals.
- Individual trees: record outside-woodland trees and modal diameter at breast height (DbH); include clumps below the minimum mappable unit (mmu) of 20 m x 20 m.
- Hedgerows/lines: quantify ash presence in hedgerows, lines of trees, belts; calculate ash length per 1 km square for each habitat stratum; convert to national totals by landclass area.
- Vegetation plots: use linear plots along features and small plots in non-linear areas to assess ash occupancy and mean cover; temporal changes analyzed via change indices.
- Temporal analysis: compare 1978–2007 for linear plots and 1990–2007 for area plots to identify changes in ash occupancy and extent.

## Key findings

- Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha): ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches in GB, with an estimated 38.51 thousand hectares.
- Distribution by landscape components: ash found in fields, field boundaries, along rivers/streams, and particularly in hedgerows.
- Country patterns: ash most abundant in England (around 32.1 thousand ha in small patches), less in Scotland (about 4.4 thousand ha) and Wales (~2 thousand ha).
- Individual trees outside woodland: approximately 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; England hosts the majority (~1.8 million).
- Hedgerows and hedgerow trees: ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species; hedgerows contain most of the ash presence in linear features.
- Woody linear features: total ash-containing WLF length ~98,900 km across GB (England ~86,100 km; Scotland ~3,700 km; Wales ~9,100 km combined across hedgerows, lines of trees, belts).
- Linear features by type: ash dominated hedgerows (66,300 km) and lines of trees (19,700 km); belts contain very little ash.
- Vegetation plots: ash occurs in ~30% of hedgerow plots and in a notable fraction of other plot types, with mean percent cover varying by plot type (e.g., hedges ~20%, streamside ~24.8% mean cover).
- Temporal changes: ash occupancy increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007; ash area plots also rose from 1990 to 2007, indicating a general increase in ash prevalence across the landscape.

## Outputs and accessibility

- Tables and figures summarise national estimates for ash and other broadleaved species in woodlands <0.5 ha (Table 1).
- National estimates for number of individual ash trees outside woodlands (Table 2).
- Total length of ash-containing woody linear features (Table 3).
- Spatial representations include distribution maps based on 1 km square means and landclass weighting (e.g., distribution of ash in small patches; Appendix maps for other broadleaved species).

## Temporal trends and patterns

- Ash has increased in occupancy on linear features (1978–2007) and in area plots (1990–2007), suggesting ash may be becoming more widespread in the countryside over recent decades.
- The dataset highlights ash as a major hedgerow component and a common element in linear landscape features, with regional variation across England, Scotland, and Wales.

## Uses and implications for data stewardship

- Supports disease impact modelling (ash dieback) by providing baseline extents and distributions across landscape components.
- Facilitates monitoring and rapid assessment through development of a linear product integrating CS data with LiDAR and land cover information.
- Enables comparisons with FC/NFI datasets to understand complementary insights and data governance considerations.
- Provides a framework for updating with future CS surveys to track changes in ash distribution and to monitor mortality or damage from disease.

## Limitations and considerations for data governance

- Spatial explicitness: results are national estimates using landclass weighting rather than a single precise spatial map; outputs include indicative distribution maps rather than exact locations.
- Data integration: deliberate overlap avoidance with NFI data; differences between CS (current land cover) and FC/NFI (stocked areas) must be considered in reuse.
- Temporal snapshots: 2007 CS data form the basis for most findings; future CS cycles are essential to monitor ongoing changes.
- Veteran trees: additional information on epiphytes or hollow trunks is limited to veteran trees in plots; interpretive caution advised when using veteran data.
- licensing and provenance: data derive from CS, CEH, and associated reports; ensure proper attribution and alignment with data-sharing permissions when used for modelling or governance purposes.

## Future directions

- Develop monitoring protocols for tree diseases and mortality to augment CS datasets.
- Advance linear feature products to scale from 1 km squares to national extents, integrating with LIDAR and updated land cover data.
- Expand analyses linking ash distribution to abiotic drivers (soil, climate, deposition) using the CS data alongside other national datasets.
- Explore complementary woodland datasets (e.g., GB woodland survey) for historical baselines and to assess the ecological impacts of ash loss on associated species.
