# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Documents the evolution of the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey from its inception in 1978 to 2007.
  - Central concept: The ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework to ensure representative, comparable national and country-specific habitat estimates over time.
  - Emphasizes the importance of documenting methodology to enable time-series analysis and cross-year comparability.

- The ITE Land Classification: foundation of sampling
  - Developed in the 1970s to stratify large-area ecological sampling.
  - Based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) rather than solely on species data.
  - Enabled division of Great Britain into land classes that could be sampled representatively.
  - Early version produced 32 classes; later revisions expanded and redefined classes to support national and country-specific reporting.

- Sampling design and its progression by survey year
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to create 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 central squares (1 km each) within a 15 x 15 km grid.
    - 4 surrounding squares added per central square; total sample comprised 256 field squares (8 per class).
    - National habitat area estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the land-class area.
  - 1984 – Second field survey
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (total 384), maintaining eight previously visited squares.
    - Aimed to improve precision of landscape change estimates.
  - 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
    - Land Classification expanded to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated measurements of 1984 features plus vegetation quadrats; land-cover map linked to the programme.
    - Resulted in a transformed framework; many squares changed class, but most remained in neighboring classes, supporting continued comparability.
  - 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
    - Introduced a version allowing separate Scottish reporting; land classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed.
  - 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
    - Scoping for England & Wales vs. Scotland country estimates; adjusts sampling to support country-unit estimates.
    - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions; aggregation of underrepresented classes within countries.
    - Added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation across new classes; additional 11 squares allocated to balance England and Wales sampling.
    - Introduction of an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Wales-specific class subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a total of 45 strata.
    - Added 43 Welsh squares; adjustments in England due to removal of Welsh squares; two English classes left with 4 squares each.
    - Wales-heavy in sampling density relative to country size; upland sampling continued to enhance country-specific estimates.
    - Welsh and English framework maps updated to reflect England-with-Wales and Scotland classifications; CS2007 table summarizes squares and sampling rates by class and country.

- National estimates and country-specific reporting
  - Early surveys produced GB-wide estimates using a uniform classification.
  - CS1990 introduced country-level reporting but still used the 1990 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - CS2000 and CS2007 refined the framework to deliver England & Wales and Scotland estimates with explicit country-unit strata, while also maintaining cross-survey compatibility.
  - Wales-specific reporting required more Wales-focused sampling, prompting class subdivisions and increased Welsh sample sizes.
  - Note on consistency: Changing the Land Classification impacts the consistency of national estimates; two approaches exist for GB estimates (latest country-specific classifications or original 1990 classification). Preference is given to using the latest classification for consistency within a survey, while the original is used for cross-survey comparisons.

- Data products and governance implications
  - Land Classification maps and class definitions per survey year (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007) along with country-unit subdivisions.
  - Comprehensive documentation of the sampling framework, class boundaries, strata areas, and sampling rates per class and country.
  - Upland module data introduced in CS2000 and CS2007 to improve precision for upland habitats.
  - The methodology supports long-term time-series analysis, enabling detection of habitat change and policy-relevant indicators.

- Challenges and considerations for Data Stewards
  - Versioning and provenance: Maintain clear records of Land Classification versions (32, 40, 45 classes) and country-unit splits; ensure cross-year mappings are documented.
  - Metadata requirements: Capture class descriptions, stratum areas, sampling rates, and changes in country reporting configurations; document upland module implementation.
  - Cross-year comparability: Preserve both latest-classification estimates for within-survey consistency and original classifications for cross-survey comparability where needed.
  - Data interoperability: Ensure datasets align with class boundaries and country-unit delineations across CS1978–CS2007; maintain links to associated maps and tables.
  - Documentation and accessibility: Keep thorough methodological notes, maps (Figures 4–7 and related figures), and tables (e.g., Table 3, Table 4) accessible for users needing to reproduce or audit estimates.
  - Governance of data updates: Manage updates to classifications and sampling frames as policy and devolution requirements evolve (e.g., Wales, Scotland, upland focus).
