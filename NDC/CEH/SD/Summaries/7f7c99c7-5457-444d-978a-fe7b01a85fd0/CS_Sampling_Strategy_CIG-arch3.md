# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Purpose and Context
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) up to 2007, the latest in a 30-year lineage.
- Built around the ITE Land Classification to enable change detection and policy-relevant environmental monitoring across Great Britain.
- Aims to produce robust national estimates and to support country-specific (England, Wales, Scotland) reporting.

## Key Concepts
- Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
- Use of the ITE Land Classification to carve GB into discrete strata (land classes) that reflect environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Sample unit design: selected centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid (1 km squares) with surrounding squares included to assign class membership.
- Early sampling: eight samples per land class (256 total) in CS1978; progressively increased in subsequent surveys.
- National estimates: derived by multiplying the mean habitat area per square within a class by the total area of that class.
- Data and reporting: results inform Countryside Survey main reports and provide a basis for regional and national ecological change assessments.

## Timeline of Developments

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - ISA-based 32 land classes from 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
  - 8 squares per class; total 256 squares surveyed.
  - National habitat area estimates derived from class proportions and class areas.

- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Emphasis shifted to land use and habitat mapping; results published later.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification extended to classify every 1 km square in GB.
  - 508 squares surveyed; added land-use and habitat mapping features; first Land Cover Map linked to the program.
  - Classification updated; results used for regional and national estimates.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification)
  - Increased to 40 land classes; enabled Scotland reporting; refined methodology for regional estimates.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
  - Emphasis on country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) necessitating framework changes.
  - Sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions; created 40 strata.
  - Added 19 extra squares to strengthen country representation; additional Wales adjustments; uplands module proposed to improve England/Wales upland estimates.

- 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
  - Wales-focused reporting further refined due to devolution and policy needs.
  - Creation of five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; English coverage adjusted (two English classes reduced to four squares each).
  - Wales-only and Wales-with-English reporting capabilities enhanced; upland habitat module continued to support country-specific estimates.
  
## Wales, Scotland, and Upland Adjustments
- Wales
  - CS2000: 64 Welsh squares; England and Wales sampling intensified for Wales reporting.
  - CS2007: Wales-specific country-unit subdivisions and 43 additional Welsh squares to improve Wales-only estimates.

- Scotland
  - Separate country estimates maintained from CS1990 onward; updated land classification maps for Scotland in CS2000/CS2007.

- Uplands
  - An additional CS2000 module added 30 upland squares to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

## Implications for Monitoring and Data Use
- Ensures data are stratified and representative, enabling robust national and country-level estimates across surveys.
- Highlights the need to balance changing classifications with the need for comparability over time; notes that switching land classifications can affect consistency of national estimates.
- Emphasizes the importance of transparent documentation of sampling design, class definitions, and country-unit adjustments to support interpretation and policy use.
- Supports data governance and transparency in reporting, with outputs feeding national environmental assessments and policy development.
