# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- Purpose and context
  - Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running UK-wide audit (since 1978) of countryside natural resources.
  - This report specifically estimates the extent and distribution of ash trees in Great Britain, focusing on: woodland patches <0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodland, and ash presence in woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees).
  - Aims to understand ash extent for assessing potential impacts (e.g., ash dieback) and to inform monitoring and future decision-making.

- Data sources and methods
  - CS uses a stratified random sampling of 1 km squares across GB, linked to major ecological gradients (landclasses).
  - Areas (woodlands <0.5 ha): overlap with National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid duplication; CS reports current land cover and uses mid-point % cover to derive national ash area estimates.
  - Individual trees outside woodland: counted per 1 km square; includes small clumps; records veteran trees with additional data (epiphytes, dead wood, hollows).
  - Woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees): measured length and ash proportion within features; includes methodology to handle natural vs. unnatural shapes and different recording schemes for hedges and belts.
  - Vegetation plots: nested, restricted-random plots within squares to assess occupancy and cover; tracked changes over time (1978, 1990, 1998, 2007).
  - Temporal scope: analyses cover change in ash presence from 1978 to 2007 (linear features) and 1990 to 2007 (area plots).

- Key findings
  - Areal extent in woodland patches <0.5 ha: ash = 38.5 thousand hectares; ash is the second most abundant broadleaf species in these small patches, after oak.
  - Geographic pattern: ash most abundant in England; less in Scotland and Wales; distribution concentrated in hedgerows, field boundaries, near rivers/streams.
  - Outside woodlands: about 2.2 million individual ash trees; ash is the second most common species among individual trees.
  - Size and life stage: most individual ash trees are small to medium in diameter at breast height (DbH); few veteran trees.
  - Hedgerows and hedgerow trees: ash is the most common hedgerow tree species; significant presence as standard hedgerow trees.
  - Woody linear features: total ash-containing woody linear features length ~98,900 km nationally, with the vast majority in England (hedgerows ~66,300 km; lines of trees ~19,700 km).
  - Vegetation plots: ash present in about 30% of hedgerow-related plots; ash distribution is widespread along linear features (streamsides, hedgerows) and in hedgerow-adjacent plots.
  - Temporal change: ash occupancy increased on linear plots between 1978 and 2007; ash area plots also increased from 1990 to 2007, indicating rising ash presence in multiple landscape components.

- Spatial interpretation and visualization
  - Developed landscape-level estimates and maps based on landclass means, and where possible, linked to the Land Cover Map 2007; maps indicate ash concentration tends to be higher in southeast England and lower in northwest Scotland.
  - Appendix provides distribution maps for other broadleaved species for comparative context.

- Comparisons and data integration
  - CS-derived estimates are deliberately distinct from NFI reports on larger woodlands; CS focuses on current land cover and small habitats, while NFI reports stocked areas and larger woodland parcels.
  - Data overlapping with FC/NFI are overlain and non-duplicated to provide coherent national estimates.

- Implications for monitoring and policy
  - Ash is a significant and widespread component of the UK countryside, particularly as a hedgerow and linear-feature element; loss of ash could create substantial gaps in hedgerows and landscape structure.
  - The study demonstrates how to derive robust environmental health measures from long-running monitoring frameworks, including:
    - calculating areal extents and counts from stratified samples,
    - integrating disparate data sources (CS and NFI),
    - generating both areal and linear feature metrics,
    - producing change metrics over multiple survey rounds.

- Future work and recommendations for monitoring frameworks
  - Develop monitoring protocols to capture tree diseases (e.g., ash dieback) and health/damage/mortality.
  - Advance linear products to scale from 1 km squares to national, GB-wide coverage (e.g., integrating CS data with LIDAR and OS/land cover data).
  - Further analyses of vegetation plot data to identify plant species associations with ash and to attribute distribution changes to driving variables (abiotic factors, disease pressures).
  - Consider complementarity with forestry surveys by expanding CS to include DbH measurements and veteran status in woodlands where feasible, to enrich understanding of ash age structure and habitat value.
  - Use these methods to develop models of future ash distribution under disease pressures (e.g., ash dieback) and changing environmental conditions.

- Data governance and accessibility considerations for monitoring teams
  - The report highlights the importance of metadata quality, data sharing, and transparency, noting potential barriers when sharing underlying data openly.
  - Emphasizes the need for standardized methodologies to enable comparability across datasets (CS vs NFI) and over time.
  - Indicates ongoing development of integrated products (e.g., linear-feature focused maps) to support scalable, policy-relevant monitoring.

- Endnotes and context
  - Provides detailed methodological descriptions, including data handling for different feature types, and references to related CS and ecological studies.
  - Suggests potential for deeper analyses linking ash distribution to multiple explanatory factors (climate, soil, deposition) to improve predictive models for future policy coordination and disease response.
