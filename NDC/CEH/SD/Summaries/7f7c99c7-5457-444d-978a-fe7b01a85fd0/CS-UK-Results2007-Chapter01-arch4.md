# Countryside Survey 2007

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes rationale and methods for data collection in Countryside Survey (CS) 2007 and prior CS surveys.
  - Two main components: Field Survey (habitats, vegetation, soils 0-15 cm, freshwater) and Land Cover Map (digital satellite-derived map, published 2009).
  - Aims to provide national and regional estimates of Broad Habitats, some Priority Habitats, vegetation condition, and landscape features.

- Sampling design and coverage
  - Field Survey: 591 sample squares of 1 km x 1 km across England, Scotland, and Wales; Northern Ireland included via 0.5 km x 0.5 km sampling.
  - Sampling strategy: random selection within 1 km squares, stratified by Land Classes; emphasis on repeat sampling across surveys to measure change.
  - Data analysis uses a statistical model to maximize data usage across years; provides standard errors and significance for changes.
  - Urban and sea areas excluded; intertidal estimates may be underrepresented.

- Broad Habitat and Priority Habitat classification
  - Broad Habitat framework: 27 Broad Habitats developed for UK biodiversity monitoring; used to estimate area and change.
  - Priority Habitats: 65 identified in UK Biodiversity Action Plan; results presented where feasible.
  - Conversion between Broad Habitats tracked (not a statistical estimate, but indicates the direction of habitat conversion).

- Data collection components
  - Habitat and landscape feature mapping: mapping within each square, generating polygons for Broad and Priority Habitats; linear features (hedges, walls, etc.) recorded; minimum mapping areas defined.
  - Vegetation sampling: Main Plots (up to 67 plots per square) plus smaller targeted plots; record plant presence and percent cover; plot relocation across surveys (GPS used 1998 onward where possible).
  - Soil sampling: five Main Plots per square; 0-15 cm soil samples analyzed for pH, carbon (via loss on ignition), bulk density; soil methods documented in annexes.
  - Freshwater sampling: headwater streams and ponds surveyed in detail in many squares; River Habitat Survey (RHS) used for stream structure; pond assessments using PSYM (pond quality) based on plant metrics; macroinvertebrates sampled in some years for trend analysis.

- Land cover, features, and data attributes
  - Detailed land-cover coding (e.g., Broad Habitats, road verges, hedgerows, boundaries, streams) to support change detection.
  - Linear features and landscape elements quantified in lengths and counts; ponds and hedgerow trees estimated similarly.
  - Data captured electronically in the field using a bespoke GIS, with GPS and laptops; a central GIS-based database links mapping, plots, soils, and freshwater data.

- Vegetation condition measures (Box 1.3)
  - Measures include: Species Richness; Number of farmland butterfly food plants; Number of butterfly food plants; Grass:Forb Ratio; Competitor, Stress-tolerator, and Ruderal Scores; Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, Moisture scores.
  - These metrics underpin vegetation condition assessments within Broad Habitats and across time.

- Soil and freshwater methodologies
  - Soil: standardized sampling (0-15 cm), bulk density corrections, pH, carbon concentration via loss on ignition, and stock calculations; detailed QA and methods in annexes.
  - Freshwater: headwaters sampled in 373 squares; stream plant and macroinvertebrate data collected; RHS-based physical habitat diversity index (HQA) generated; PSYM-based pond quality assessment (Good to Very Poor scale).

- Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)
  - Independent but integrated component; 288 squares surveyed in 2007 (0.5% intensity); regional masks and GIS workflows to align NI data with UK Broad Habitats.
  - Data combined with GB CS results to derive UK totals; methodological alignment maintained across periods.

- Data capture, management, and quality
  - 2007 introduced electronic data capture in the field, improving data completeness, validation, and error reduction.
  - GIS software developed with CEH and ESRI; dedicated hardware (rugged laptops) used in field conditions.
  - All data stored in a single georeferenced database, enabling cross-year analyses and accessibility for users.

- The reporting framework and significance
  - Results reported at UK, GB, and country levels; country-specific CS reports planned for Spring 2009.
  - Significance testing: 0.05 level with arrows to indicate direction; more stringent significance indicated with asterisks in figures.
  - Cautions: small statistically significant changes may have limited ecological meaning; supported by magnitude context in tables and text.

- Long-term change and data interpretation
  - Long-term vegetation change (1978–2007) analyzed by tracking plots assigned to Aggregate Classes (ACs) to maintain cohort continuity despite habitat classification changes.
  - Updates allow assessment of long-term trends in vegetation condition within Broad Habitats and across time.

- Outputs and references
  - Output includes area estimates for Broad Habitats, changes between years, habitat condition measures, vegetation condition indices, linear features, pond counts, stream health indicators, and soil metrics.
  - Supporting annexes provide detailed methods, models, and data handling approaches.
