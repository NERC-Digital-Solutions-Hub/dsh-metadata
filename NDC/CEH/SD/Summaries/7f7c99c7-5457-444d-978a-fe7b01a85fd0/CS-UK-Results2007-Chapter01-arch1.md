# Countryside Survey 2007

- The Countryside Survey (CS) provides a national, long-term, data-driven picture of the UK's countryside to inform policy and management. The 2007 survey marks a continuation of a 30-year data series (1978–2007) and pairs field data with a forthcoming Land Cover Map (to be published in 2009) derived from satellite data.
- The survey is designed to quantify areas and changes in Broad Habitats and Priority Habitats, vegetation condition, soils, and freshwater features, enabling assessment of habitat extent, quality, and ecological change over time.
- It is funded by a partnership of government bodies led by NERC and Defra, with wide participation from landowners, managers, and collaborating agencies; results are produced with strong emphasis on data quality, transparency, and reproducibility.

## Overview of the Survey Structure and Outputs

- Two main components:
  - Field Survey (this report): habitats, vegetation, soils (0–15 cm) and freshwater; 591 1 km x 1 km sample squares across England, Scotland, and Wales; Northern Ireland also contributed data from a separate 0.5 km x 0.5 km survey.
  - Land Cover Map: a digital, satellite-based map to be published in 2009.
- Long-term context: CS provides a 30-year record of environmental change and enables analysis of changes in Broad Habitats, vegetation, soils, waterways, and landscape features, including cross-year conversions between habitat types.
- Reporting framework: results are presented for the UK, Great Britain, and individual countries; significance is tested at the 0.05 level (with additional indicators for stronger significance) and conveyed via arrows and asterisks in figures and tables.

## Data Collected and Measures

- Broad Habitats and Priority Habitats:
  - Broad Habitats: 27 recognized across Great Britain; 45 Land Classes used for area estimation and change analyses.
  - Priority Habitats: 65 identified in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan; some CS results provided for select Priority Habitats (e.g., hedgerows, ponds).
- Vegetation and habitat condition:
  - Detailed vegetation sampling within each square, with up to 67 plots per square; plant species presence and percent cover recorded.
  - Aggregation Classes (ACs): eight ACs used to describe vegetation condition across years (1978–2007) and to relate plots to Broad Habitats.
  - Condition measures summarized in Box 1.3 (e.g., species richness, grass:forb ratio, competitive/stress-tolerator/ruderal scores, Ellenberg-based light, fertility, pH, and moisture indicators).
- Soils (0–15 cm):
  - pH, carbon concentration (via loss-on-ignition), bulk density, and other soil properties; measurement details and stock calculations provided (e.g., tonnes C/ha).
- Freshwater and aquatic habitats:
  - Headwater streams: biological and physical assessments, including macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, and River Habitat Survey (RHS) metrics; habitat diversity index (HQA) compiled.
  - Ponds: plant-based assessments used to identify Priority Habitat Ponds; PSYM (Predictive System for Multimetrics) scores used to evaluate pond condition (Good/Moderate/Poor/Very Poor).
  - Net changes in stream and pond conditions between survey years (e.g., 1990, 1998, 2007) analyzed where data permit.
- Linear features and water bodies:
  - Lengths of hedges, walls, fences, roads, and other linear features; counts of ponds; hedgerow trees; derived through a standardized hierarchy of feature types.
- Data integration and outputs:
  - A single, geographically referenced database linking mapped habitats, vegetation plots, soil sampling points, and freshwater data to enable cross-dataset analyses.

## Methodology and Sampling Design

- Field Survey core:
  - Conducted in 591 randomly selected 1 km squares across GB (England, Scotland, Wales) with supplementary Northern Ireland sampling.
  - Habitat polygons mapped within each square; vegetation plots placed within habitats to capture species composition and cover.
  - Soil samples collected from five plots per square (0–15 cm depth) for chemical and physical analyses.
  - Streams and ponds sampled in many squares to characterize aquatic habitats.
- Sampling strategy:
  - A statistically based approach to ensure national representativeness while allowing regional insights.
  - Efforts to maintain comparability across decades by sampling largely the same squares over time and by using consistent habitat reference systems (Broad Habitats and ACs).
  - Bootstrapping used to estimate changes across years, maximizing use of available data and enabling robust national estimates.
- Field methods and data capture:
  - In 2007, CS moved from paper mapping to a bespoke GIS-based, electronic data capture system, with GPS-supported plot relocation and in-field data validation.
  - Data stored in a centralized GIS-enabled database, enabling integration of map data, vegetation plots, soils, and freshwater data.
- Habitat classification and reporting:
  - Broad Habitat classification system refined to 27 Broad Habitats; habitat change and conversion flows between 1998 and 2007 are documented (not strictly statistical estimates but informative flows).
  - Priority Habitats assigned in the field where possible, with post-survey masks used to delineate upland/lowland status and woodlands across the UK.

## Northern Ireland Countryside Survey (NICS)

- Separate but linked program conducted by the University of Ulster for Northern Ireland.
- 2007: 288 sample squares (0.5% intensity) to derive Broad Habitat estimates; data integrated with GB results for UK-wide interpretation.
- Field methods evolved to provide richer species composition data and refined hedgerow definitions.

## Data Quality, Significance, and Reporting

- Measures of significance:
  - Changes with p-values below 0.05 are flagged in tables; stronger significance is indicated with more asterisks.
  - Arrows show direction of change; brackets between dates indicate significant change across the entire interval.
  - Means and 95% confidence limits accompany graphical representations to convey uncertainty and sampling variation.
- Data interpretation cautions:
  - CS represents estimates rather than complete counts; extrapolation beyond the surveyed area or years should be done with reference to the original dataset and methods.
  - Some Priority Habitats are underrepresented in CS due to rarity or locality; results for these should be used in conjunction with UK BAP data.
- Output scope:
  - The report emphasizes GB/UK trends and country-level analyses; separate country reports for England, Scotland, and Wales are released as part of the 2009 cycle.

## Key Methodological References and Tools

- Broad Habitat framework and 27 Broad Habitats; 65 Priority Habitats (UK BAP context).
- Aggregate Classes (ACs) used to describe vegetation condition across years.
- Box 1.2 PSYM: Pond quality assessment based on plant metrics (submerged/marginal species, trophic ranking, uncommon species) to rate pond condition.
- Box 1.3 Vegetation measures: a suite of indicators (diversity, food-plant availability, Grass:Forb ratio, Competitor/Stress-tolerator/Ruderal scores, Light, Fertility, Ellenberg pH, Moisture).
