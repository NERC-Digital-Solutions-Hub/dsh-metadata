# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Overview
- A Countryside Survey (CS) study assessing the extent and distribution of ash trees to understand potential impacts (e.g., ash dieback) on the British countryside.
- CS provides national estimates by combining 1 km square sampling with landclass gradients; results support temporal comparisons since 1978.

## Key findings
- Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha: about 38.5 thousand hectares; England prominent (≈32.1 thousand ha), Scotland (≈4.4 thousand ha), Wales (≈2 thousand ha).
- Ash is the second most abundant tree species in small woodland patches (<0.5 ha) in GB.
- Outside woodlands, an estimated 2.2 million ash trees exist; ash is the second most common individual tree species.
- Ash is the most common hedgerow tree and forms a large component of woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees): total ash-lined features ≈ 98.9 thousand km across GB (England ≈ 86.1k km; hedgerows ≈ 66.3k km; lines of trees ≈ 19.7k km).
- Distribution is strongest in England, with lower density in Scotland and Wales.
- Within hedgerows, ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species; 30% of hedgerow plots contain ash.
- Vegetation plots show ash in 30% of hedgerow plots and notable mean cover variances across plot types (e.g., hedges, road verges, streamside, field plots).

## Methodology (data and scale)
- Sampling: Stratified random sample of 1 km squares across GB, aligned with national ecological gradients (soil, geology, climate).
- Areas: Focus on woodlands smaller than 0.5 ha; use midpoints of percentage-cover classes to estimate ash presence; exclude woodland parcels covered by the National Forest Inventory (NFI) to avoid duplication.
- Individual trees: Record outside-woodland ash trees with modal diameter at breast height (DbH); include small clumps (below 20 m x 20 m mmu threshold) and veteran trees (up to 10 per 1 km square).
- Hedgerow and linear features: Measure ash proportion within lines of trees, belts, and hedgerows; use D plots (hedgerow diversity plots) for species composition in hedges; compute mean ash length by landclass and scale to GB totals.
- Vegetation plots: Various plot types within each 1 km square (linear 1x10 m; 2x2 m nested plots; larger nested plots) to assess occupancy and cover of ash over time (1978–2007).

## Spatial products and mapping
- Maps produced to indicate ash distribution by landclass and, where possible, by Land Cover Map 2007 data.
- Not a fully spatially explicit map of ash all GB areas; provides indicative patterns (stronger signal in SE England) and informs where ash is most abundant.
- Appendix provides distribution maps for other broadleaved species.

## Temporal trends
- Ash increased in occupancy on linear features (1978–2007) and in area plots (1990–2007), suggesting a rising presence across the landscape over the study period.

## Data integration and comparisons
- CS overlapped with NFI data to avoid duplication; CS emphasizes current land cover rather than stocked woodland areas.
- Potential for integrating with Forestry Commission woodland data and national inventories to enhance comparability and cross-validation.

## Implications for GIS and practice
- Ash is a major component of hedgerows and linear landscape features, making its distribution highly relevant for landscape-scale GIS analyses and for modeling disease spread (e.g., ash dieback) and habitat connectivity.
- The landscape-wide distribution (linear features, hedgerows, and small woodlands) highlights the need for data products that capture both areal and linear ash components.

## Future work and recommendations
- Develop monitoring protocols to capture impacts of tree diseases (e.g., dieback) and mortality.
- Create a linear-product that scales from 1 km squares to the entire GB using CS data, LIDAR, OS maps, and Land Cover Map.
- Further analyses of CS vegetation plots and Woodland survey data to identify ash-associated species and potential ecological impacts of ash loss.
- Attribute ash distribution and change to driving variables (climate, soils, dispersal) to build predictive models for future distribution under disease pressure.
- Extend CS methods to enhance complementary data with Forestry Commission datasets while avoiding duplications.
