# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

- The Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running, rigorous national audit of the UK countryside, enabling comparisons with past surveys and detecting gradual changes. This report estimates the area, number, and distribution of ash trees in GB, focusing on ash in woodlands <0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodland, ash in linear features, and ash in vegetation plots. It also outlines baseline data for ash dieback monitoring and future monitoring enhancements.

## Key findings

- Areal extent in small woodlands: Ash in Broadleaved woodlands <0.5 ha is 38.51 thousand ha; ash is the second most abundant tree species in these patches after oak.
  - Country distribution: England ~32.07 thousand ha; Scotland ~4.44 thousand ha; Wales ~1.99 thousand ha.
- Landscape distribution: Ash occurs across multiple landscape components including fields, field boundaries, rivers/streams, and especially hedgerows.
- Individual trees (outside woodland): Estimated 2.208 million ash trees outside woodlands in GB; most in England (about 1.821 million), with Scotland and Wales contributing smaller numbers. Ash is the second most common species among individual trees.
- Hedgerow and linear features:
  - Ash is the most common hedgerow tree species (as standard trees within hedgerows).
  - Total length of woody linear features containing ash: about 98.9 thousand km across GB; England accounts for 86.1 thousand km, with hedgerows comprising 66.3 thousand km and lines of trees 19.7 thousand km. Scotland and Wales show lower frequencies.
- Vegetation plots: Ash present in 30% of hedgerow vegetation plots; detectable across boundary, hedge diversity (D plots), hedge plots, arable margins, roadside, streamside, field plots, and small habitat patches with varying mean ash cover.
- Trends over time:
  - Between 1978 and 2007, ash increased on linear features (significant in linear plots).
  - Ash area increased between 1990 and 2007 in area plots.
  - Change significance was strong in some plots (p < 0.001 for certain categories).
- Regional pattern: Higher densities in southeast England; lower densities in northwest Scotland; maps indicate where ash is most and least abundant, though not a high-resolution spatial map.

## Methods and data sources

- Sampling framework: CS surveys 1 km² squares using stratified random sampling based on land classes and ecological gradients; scales up national estimates from square-level data.
- Data components:
  - Areas: Mapping ash within 1 km² squares, using broad/priority habitat designations and percentage cover categories; overlain with National Forestry Inventory (NFI) data to avoid double counting and to focus on woodlands <0.5 ha not covered by NFI.
  - Individual trees: Recording ash trees outside woodland and estimating modal diameter at breast height (DbH); includes small clumps (mmu 20 m × 20 m) and veteran trees (up to 10 per square).
  - Hedgerow and woody linear features: Recording ash in lines of trees, hedgerows, and belts; estimating ash proportion by proportion bands; calculations adapted for natural vs. unnatural hedgerow shapes; D plots near hedges used to estimate ash percentage cover in hedges.
  - Vegetation plots: Linear plots along verges and field boundaries; smaller plots for open areas; repeated sampling to assess occupancy changes in ash.
- Data integration and products:
  - National estimates derived by applying mean ash cover per land class to land class areas, with full methodology described and confidence intervals provided.
  - Spatial outputs include maps of ash distribution by land class; not an exact spatial map but indicative of regional patterns. Appendix provides distribution maps for other broadleaved species.
  - Data layering with Land Cover Map 2007 and exploration of a dedicated linear-product (including LIDAR and OS map data) to scale linear features across GB.
- Limitations and scope:
  - Focus is on ash distribution; not an explanatory causation analysis (e.g., climate, soil, dispersal) though CS contains potential explanatory data for such analyses.
  - CS data used to contrast with NFI/FC datasets to avoid duplication and to complement woodland-scale inventories.

## Implications for monitoring and policy

- Ash is a major component of the British countryside, particularly in hedgerows and linear features, implying that ash loss due to dieback could create significant habitat gaps.
- The CS dataset provides a valuable baseline for ash distribution, including non-woodland habitats, which is essential for modeling potential disease impacts and for planning mitigation (e.g., hedgerow management, restoration of ash-free corridors).
- The study demonstrates the feasibility of producing spatially explicit products for ash distribution and highlights the value of integrating CS data with other datasets (LIDAR, Land Cover Map) to scale analyses.

## Future work and recommendations

- Develop monitoring protocols to capture tree diseases, damage, and mortality within the CS framework.
- Create a linear-product that scales ash data from 1 km² CS squares to national extent, using integrated data sources (e.g., LIDAR, OS, Land Cover).
- Conduct further analyses of CS vegetation plot data and woodland survey data to determine ash associations with other species and potential indirect effects of ash decline.
- Attribute ash distribution and change to driving variables (climate, soil, dispersal) to inform models of future distribution and to assess the potential impacts of ash dieback.
- Enhance data sharing and accessibility to enable broader use of underlying datasets by researchers and policy-makers.

## Endnotes and context

- The report notes differences between CS and NFI methodologies (e.g., CS focuses on current land cover rather than stocked areas or post-harvest classifications), and uses overlap with NFI maps to prevent duplication in woodland area estimates.
- Future work includes combining CS data with broader ecological datasets to investigate the drivers of ash distribution and potential competition with other species, and to support predictive modeling for disease scenarios.
