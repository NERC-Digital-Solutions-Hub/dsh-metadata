# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Describe the sampling framework for the Countryside Survey field survey element (up to 2007), showing how the ITE Land Classification has evolved and been applied to GB-wide ecological surveying and habitat estimation.

- Core idea: Use a stratified, random sampling system (ITE Land Classification) to ensure samples are representative of diverse land types and ecological conditions, enabling robust national and country-level estimates.

- Key concepts:
  - Stratified random sampling to reduce bias and improve precision across varied landscapes.
  - ITE Land Classification as the backbone for stratification, grouping land into environmentally meaningful classes.
  - Sample units primarily based on 1 km square grids, with centre squares and surrounding squares classified to form strata.

- Timeline overview of developments:
  - 1978 (The Beginning): First GB ecological survey using ISA-based Land Classification to create 32 land classes from 1 km squares; eight samples per class chosen randomly (total 256 squares).
  - 1984: Land use-focused survey expands to 12 squares per class (384 total); builds on 1978 framework.
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 uses an updated Land Classification that applies to all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; includes repeat vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; introduces Land Cover Map linkage.
  - 1998–2000: Major revision to enable regional and local estimates; Land Classification expanded to 40 classes; adaptation to classify every GB square using surrogates for key environmental factors; prepares for separate country reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and areas requiring Wales- or Scotland-specific estimates.
  - 2007: Further adaptations for Wales-only reporting; introduces Welsh-specific class subdivisions (five new country-unit classes), increases total strata to 45, and adds 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; adjusts England classes due to Welsh additions; upland habitat survey module added to improve upland estimates.

- Land Classification and sampling framework details:
  - Origin: ITE Land Classification built from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and refined to stratify land into homogeneous ecological units.
  - 1978 approach: center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid classified; 4 surrounding squares added to each center; 32 primary Land Classes identified.
  - 1984: Framework extended to emphasize land use and habitat mapping; total sample increased to 12 squares per class.
  - 1990: Classification revised to cover all GB squares; urban and sea corrections incorporated; 508 squares surveyed; data collection expanded beyond soils and vegetation to include broader habitat features.
  - 1990–2000: Transition to a GB-wide classification approach that could support regional and local estimates; computation constraints led to using surrogates for full classification, maintaining class characteristics with acceptable accuracy.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Introduction of country-based estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) via sub-division of land classes and aggregation where necessary; 40 strata configured; additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland module added to improve England & Wales upland habitat estimates.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting enhanced; five new Welsh country-unit classes created; total strata increased to 45; Wales receives a minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes reduced in sampling where Welsh squares replaced them; Wales-focused upland sampling considerations strengthened.

- Separate country estimates and representation:
  - Reason: Post-devolution policy and regional environmental needs required Wales- and Scotland-specific habitat status and change information.
  - Mechanisms:
    - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Aggregation of underrepresented classes within a country to maintain adequate sample sizes.
    - Additional squares allocated to ensure all new country-specific classes are represented (minimum 6 per class in each country).
    - Isle of Man samples removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England samples where necessary.
  - Wales-focused adjustments led to higher sampling intensity in Wales compared with England and Scotland in CS2007.

- Upland and regional sampling enhancements:
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module funded to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - CS2007 continued emphasis on Wales by adding Wales-specific upland representations and class subdivisions.

- Practical data implications:
  - Sample sizes and distributions are detailed by class, country, and survey year, enabling both national and country-level habitat quantity and status estimates.
  - Tables and figures (referenced in the document) illustrate the distribution of survey squares, class maps, and sample rates across years and regions.
  - Note on national estimates: Changing the Land Classification used for national estimates affects consistency; historically, either using the latest country-specific classification or the original 1990 classification are possible, with a preference for the latest for internal consistency and the original for cross-survey consistency.

- Overall aim for analysts:
  - Provide a transparent, evolving framework that links land classification to stratified sampling, enabling robust estimates of habitat areas and changes across GB and its constituent countries.
  - Ensure representation of diverse land types, address country-specific policy needs (England, Wales, Scotland), and improve data access for regional environmental decision-making.
