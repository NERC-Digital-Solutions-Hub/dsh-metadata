# Distribution of Ash trees ( Fraxinus excelsior ) in Countryside Survey data

## Summary
- Countryside Survey (CS) is a long-running, rigorous audit of the UK's countryside (since 1978) used to track changes over time and compare with past surveys.
- This report estimates the areal extent and distribution of ash trees in Great Britain in three components: woodlands <0.5 ha, individual trees outside woodland, and ash within woody linear features (hedgerows and lines of trees), plus areal estimates for other broadleaf species.
- Key findings show ash is a major component of the countryside: second most abundant in small woodland patches, the most common hedgerow tree, widespread along hedgerows, fields, and streams, and a substantial presence in linear features.
- National estimates are generated by integrating CS sample data with landclass scaling and, where appropriate, overlaying Forestry Commission/National Forestry Inventory data, while avoiding duplication.
- Ash distribution has increased on linear features from 1978 to 2007 and also within area plots from 1990 to 2007, suggesting ash expansion across the landscape.
- The report provides data products (tables and maps) and highlights future work, including disease monitoring (Chalara fraxinea) and development of enhanced linear-product maps to scale from 1 km squares to GB.

## Data and Methods
- Data sources
  - Countryside Survey 1 km square sampling across GB; focus on current land cover and habitat types (excluding areas reported as woodland by the National Forestry Inventory to avoid duplication).
  - Forestry Commission/National Forestry Inventory data used for context on woodland extent and composition.
- Scale and units
  - Areal estimates for ash in woodlands <0.5 ha.
  - Individual ash trees outside woodland (including small clumps) and up to 10 veteran trees per square.
  - Woody Linear Features (hedgerows, lines of trees, belts) with ash percentages and lengths.
  - Vegetation plots (linear: 1x10 m; small plots: 2x2 m; nested 14 m² plots) to assess ash occupancy and mean cover by plot type.
- Measurement and data processing
  - Area calculations use midpoints of percentage cover bands to estimate ash presence in woodland parcels.
  - Linear features: ash proportion per feature type (lines of trees, hedgerows, belts) aggregated per 1 km square and scaled by landclass area to obtain national totals.
  - Vegetation plots: ash presence and mean cover summarized by plot type; change assessed via a change index accounting for the nested sampling design.
- Outputs
  - National estimates with confidence intervals (Table 1 for areal extent; Table 2 for number of trees; Table 3 for length in linear features; Figure 2–9 for distribution and change).
  - Distribution maps showing ash extent in small woodland patches and ash density in linear features; appendix includes maps for other broadleaved species.
- Analytical goals
  - Build spatially informative products (maps by landclass) and plan for linear products integrating CS data with other geospatial data (e.g., LIDAR, Land Cover Map 2007).

## Key Findings
- Areal extent in woodlands <0.5 ha
  - Ash area: 38.5 thousand ha; ash is the second most abundant species in small woodland patches after Oak.
  - England hosts the majority (32.1 thousand ha); Scotland and Wales have smaller extents.
- Individual trees outside woodland
  - Estimated 2.2 million ash trees outside woodlands; England holds the majority (about 1.8 million).
  - Ash is the second most common species among individual trees.
  - Veteran trees (DbH > 2 m) are present but relatively few; most ash fall into the 1–2 m to 21–50 cm DBH range.
- Hedgerow trees
  - Ash is the most frequent hedgerow tree species, with Oak second.
- Woody Linear Features
  - Ash-containing woody linear features total about 98.9 thousand km across GB (Lines of Trees: 23.6k km; Hedgerows: 75.1k km; Belts: 0.1k km; mostly hedgerows).
  - England accounts for the majority of ash in hedgerows and lines of trees; Scotland and Wales have lower values.
- Vegetation plots
  - Ash present in 30% of hedgerow plots; ash occupancy is notable along hedges, streamsides, and field boundaries.
  - Ash shows an increasing occupancy trend in linear plots from 1978 to 2007 and in area plots from 1990 to 2007.
- Spatial and temporal patterns
  - Distribution maps indicate ash is most abundant in southeast England and least likely in northwest Scotland (based on landclass weighting).
  - Across the landscape, ash tends to be concentrated in small habitat patches and along linear features rather than evenly distributed in large woodlands.

## Data Products and Accessibility
- National estimates with associated confidence intervals (tables) and distribution maps (Figure 2 and related figures).
- Landscape-scale products
  - Maps based on landclass distributions and, where possible, the Land Cover Map 2007; appendix provides distribution maps for other broadleaved species.
  - Ongoing work to produce a linear-product map integrating CS data with LIDAR and other datasets to scale hedgerow and line features across GB.
- Utility for policy and planning
  - Provides baseline distribution of ash to support assessments of ash dieback risk and the potential ecological impact of ash loss on hedgerows and landscape structure.
  - Establishes a methodological framework for integrating sample survey data with broader geospatial datasets.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Data scope and comparability
  - CS measures current land cover rather than stocking status; NFI reports on stocked areas, creating potential differences in woodland extent counts.
  - Focus on woodlands <0.5 ha to avoid duplication with NFI; larger woodlands are outside the scope of this specific estimate.
- Spatial precision
  - Areal maps are not high-resolution spatially explicit maps but indicate relative abundance by landclass and region.
- Data gaps
  - Limited data on large woodlands (>0.5 ha) and on driver variables; veteran trees are underrepresented due to measurement approach.
  - The report does not fully attribute distribution to causal drivers (climate, soils, disease impacts) but emphasizes potential for integrated analyses with additional datasets.
- Disease context
  - The study is a baseline prior to widespread ash dieback concerns; future monitoring protocols are recommended to capture disease impact and mortality.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Data integration and governance
  - Demonstrates how to combine long-running survey data (CS) with national inventories (NFI) to derive robust national-scale estimates, highlighting the need for careful overlap management and metadata standards.
- Data quality and standards
  - Highlights the importance of consistent definitions (current land cover vs stocking status) and transparent calculation methods (midpoint banding, weighting by landclass) for reproducibility and cross-agency comparability.
- Data products and discoverability
  - Generates actionable data products (areal extents, tree counts, hedgerow and linear features) and maps that can be reused in policy, planning, and ecological modeling.
- Future opportunities
  - Encourages development of advanced linear-feature products (combining CS with LIDAR and other maps) for scalable national insights.
  - Supports disease-monitoring initiatives and multisource analyses to identify drivers of ash distribution and potential impacts of ash dieback.
