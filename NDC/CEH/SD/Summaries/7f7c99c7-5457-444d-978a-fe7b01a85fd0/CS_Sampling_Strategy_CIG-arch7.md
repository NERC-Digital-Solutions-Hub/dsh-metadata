# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the sampling framework and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify Countryside Survey field samples from 1978 through 2007.
- Emphasises the link between classification development and the ability to detect change over time.
- Highlights the need for representativeness through stratified, random sampling and the role of data classification in guiding sampling and national estimates.

## The ITE Land Classification: historical trajectory
- Originated in the early 1970s to classify land for national ecological survey, building on vegetation quadrats and environmental attributes.
- Early version (mid-1970s) produced 32 Land Classes for GB using centre squares of a 15x15 km grid; included surrounding squares to form a 6040-square basis for classification.
- 1 km square sampling framework established to balance field effort with ecological detail; used stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage.
- Over time, the classification expanded and adapted to include climate, geology and physiographic surrogates; later revisions increased the number of classes and enabled country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales).

## Sampling framework evolution by survey year

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and field survey)
  - ISA used to derive 32 land classes from environmental data for 1228 centre 1 km squares; 4 surrounding squares also classified.
  - Final sampling: 8 squares per class (256 squares total).
  - National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in each class times the area of that class.

- 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
  - Framework retained from 1978 but increased sample size: 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Expanded aims to capture land-use and habitat mapping changes; estimates still anchored to 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; third field survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections included.
  - Field survey expanded to 508 squares.
  - First linkage with Land Cover Map from satellite imagery; repeat vegetation quadrats conducted.
  - Result: 508 squares surveyed; national estimates recalculated under the 1990 classification.

- Post-1990 developments
  - A major reclassification effort attempted to classify all GB squares but used surrogates due to computational limits; comparison with the 1990 classification showed about 62% exact correspondence, with non-matching squares typically falling into neighboring classes.
  - This introduced distortions in class distributions and representation across the country.

- 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
  - Need to provide separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) led to changes:
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (resulting in 40 strata).
    - Aggregation of under-represented subgroups within countries to maintain representation.
    - Additional squares deployed to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per new class; additional allocations to England-Wales balance).
    - Wales-specific sub-division applied to Land Class 17 to improve Wales reporting.
    - Isle of Man squares replaced to align with country-unit reporting.
  - Introduction of an upland module as a separate survey component.

- 2007 (CS2007 adjustments)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further Wales-focused sampling:
    - Country-unit subdivision created five new Wales-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares added; minimum 6 squares in each Welsh class.
    - Some English classes (5e, 15e) reduced to four squares per class; precision impact deemed acceptable.
  - Wales, England, Scotland maps of revised Land Classes produced to reflect the CS2007 framework.
  - Figures 6 and 7 illustrate the England-Wales-Scotland class map and the new sampling squares.

- Uplands module (CS2000 onward)
  - An additional uplands module added 30 squares targeted at upland and marginal upland habitats to improve country-specific estimates.

## Country-specific reporting and sampling allocations
- England with Wales and Scotland reporting frameworks updated to enable country-unit estimates.
- Sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40–45 strata, with additional squares to strengthen representation in Wales and for upland habitats.
- Wales received substantial targeted sampling to support Wales-only analyses; England retained most classes but with some reductions in square counts per class where needed.

## Outputs and data representation
- Class maps and sampling-square maps provided (Figures 4–7 in the document).
- Tables summarize the numbers of squares surveyed per class and per survey (CS2000, CS2007), and the overall GB totals.
- Acknowledges the need to balance cross-survey comparability with within-survey accuracy using the latest classification.

## National estimates and cross-survey comparability
- Changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects the consistency of stock estimates across surveys.
- For a given survey, the latest classification is preferred to maintain internal consistency; crossing over to a different classification for cross-survey comparability has limitations.
- Table 4 details how numbers of squares per class would differ under original vs. updated classifications across surveys.
