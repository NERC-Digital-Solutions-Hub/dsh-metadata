# Rift Valley fever virus seroprevalence data from people involved in a cross-sectional survey in Tana River and Garissa counties, Kenya (December 2013 - February 2014)

## Objective and study design
- Cross-sectional survey investigating the effect of land-use change (irrigation schemes) on access to ecosystem services, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a case study.
- Households as the primary sampling units; target sample size 220 households per land-use type.
- Study sites: Bura and Hola irrigation schemes in Tana River County and adjacent pastoral/transhumance areas in Ijara and Sangailu divisions, Garissa County.
- Inclusion: subjects aged at least five years; sampling conducted once.

## Sampling regime
- Sampling frame created by listing households in target areas; registers from irrigation schemes cleaned and updated.
- Random selection of households and individuals within households.
- Sampling design planned to profile RVF risk across irrigated vs. pastoral areas; few riverine-area households included.

## Fieldwork and collection methods
- Ethics: approval from AMREF Ethics and Scientific Review Committee; community, household, and subject-level consent obtained.
- Community engagement: group meetings to review objectives and plans.
- Data collection: electronic forms via Open Data Kit (ODK) on smartphones; geographic coordinates collected (withheld for ethical reasons).
- Personnel: trained enumerators (clinician and two medical technicians) from the University of Nairobi and ILRI; sampling coordinated with the Ministry of Health.
- Biological sampling: blood collected via venipuncture using butterfly needles; sample volumes by age (up to 5 ml for 5–12 years, 5–10 ml for 13–17 years, 10 ml for 18+ years).
- Sample processing: serum and whole blood aliquoted to 2 ml cryo tubes; preserved in dry ice and transported to ILRI biorepository; stored in liquid nitrogen on arrival.
- Transport and logistics: dry ice replenished weekly; samples linked to household and individual data using barcodes.

## Laboratory analysis
- Serum tested for Rift Valley fever virus IgG using a human-specific RVF virus inhibition ELISA (Paweska et al., 2005).
- Analyses performed in duplicates; borderline results re-tested.

## Dataset
- Data file: DDDAC_Kenya_human RVF seroprevalence.csv (single CSV with 23 variables).
- Data collection tool: Open Data Kit (ODK) used in the field; data uploaded to a central ODK Aggregate server at ILRI.

## Quality control and data management
- ODK linkage creates relationships between household and participant data to minimize transcription errors.
- Barcoded tubes linked to household and individual records; samples and data managed to maintain traceability.
- Daily data uploads; laboratory analyses performed in duplicates; borderline results re-analyzed.
- Field logistics: dry ice replenishment and sample handling coordinated to ensure specimen integrity.

## Data dictionary and variables
- Variables cover: date, sampling date, sample identifiers, county/district/division/location/sublocation/village, household ID and relationships, household head demographics, number of males/females, individual gender/age/occupation, sampling site characterization (irrigation, pastoral, riverine), RVF IgG test result (positive/negative), altitude, livestock ownership.
- Geographic coordinates recorded but withheld for ethical considerations.

## Data governance and accessibility considerations for monitoring
- Ethical constraints on sharing precise geolocation data may limit public data accessibility.
- Metadata completeness and standardization are essential for reuse and cross-site comparisons.
- Data sharing requires careful handling of sensitive demographic and location information and adherence to governance standards.
- Practices demonstrate rigorous data quality assurance, provenance, and transparency suitable for monitoring frameworks assessing data integrity and usefulness for policy evaluation.
