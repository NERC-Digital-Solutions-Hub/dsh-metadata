# Rift Valley fever virus seroprevalence data from people involved in a cross-sectional survey in Tana River and Garissa counties, Kenya (December 2013 - February 2014)

## Overview
- Study investigated effects of land use change (irrigation schemes) on access to ecosystem services, using Rift Valley fever (RVF) as a case study.
- Cross-sectional survey conducted December 2013 to February 2014; households as primary sampling units.
- Target: 220 households per land-use type (irrigated vs pastoral), with some riverine households included.
- Sites: Bura and Hola irrigation schemes in Tana River County and adjacent pastoral areas, plus Ijara and Sangailu divisions in Garissa County (transhumance pastoralism).

## Experimental Design and Sampling Regime
- Sampling frame created by listing households in target areas; registers from irrigation schemes cleaned and updated.
- Study sample obtained by random selection of households and random selection of subjects within households.
- Design was cross-sectional, single sampling occasion.
- Eligible subjects: aged at least five years.

## Field Work and Collection Methods
- Ethical approval obtained from AMREF-ESRC; community, household, and subject-level consents obtained.
- Data collection with Open Data Kit (ODK) on smartphones; GPS coordinates captured but withheld for ethical reasons.
- Sampling coordinated by field teams including a clinician and two medical technicians; field personnel trained by University of Nairobi and ILRI.
- Blood samples collected via venipuncture with age-appropriate volumes; samples processed into serum and whole blood, then aliquoted and stored on dry ice and in liquid nitrogen at ILRI Nairobi.
- Samples linked to households via barcodes; daily data uploads to central ODK Aggregate server; samples analyzed in duplicates; borderline results re-tested.

## Analytical Methods
- Serum screened for Rift Valley fever virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) using a RVF virus inhibition ELISA (protocol described in Paweska et al., 2005).
- Laboratory analyses performed in duplicates; borderline results re-analyzed.

## Dataset and Variables
- Data available in a single CSV file: DDDAC_Kenya_human RVF seroprevalence.csv.
- Contains 23 variables covering: date of sampling, sample IDs, geographic hierarchy (county, district, division, location, sublocation, village), household identifiers and relationships, household head demographics (gender, occupation, age), household composition (number of males/females), individual demographics (gender, age, occupation), sampling area type (irrigation, pastoral, riverine), test result (positive/negative), altitude, livestock in household.
- Data collection used a structured framework to link datasets by household; blank cells indicate missing or undisclosed data.
- Geographic coordinates withheld for ethical considerations.

## Quality Control and Data Management
- ODK system used to minimize transcription errors; data linkage across datasets via household codes.
- Devices used barcoded tubes and smartphone cameras to ensure samples were correctly associated with household and individual data.
- Central data repository accessed via ILRI server; field logistics included weekly replenishment of dry ice.

## Ethics and Permissions
- Ethical clearance and community consent secured; sampling approved and conducted under established protocols.
- Consent obtained at community, household, and subject levels; medical and research staff involved in data collection and handling.
