# Rift Valley fever virus seroprevalence data from people involved in a cross-sectional survey in Tana River and Garissa counties, Kenya (December 2013 - February 2014)

- Objective and scope
  - Investigates Rift Valley fever (RVF) seroprevalence as part of a study on land use change and access to ecosystem services, with RVF used as a case study disease.
  - Cross-sectional survey profiling RVF risk across irrigated and pastoral areas; includes a few riverine households.
  - Sample size planned at 220 households per land-use type; subjects aged at least 5 years.

- Sampling design
  - Primary sampling units: households.
  - Sampling frame: cleaned registers from irrigation schemes, supplemented to include newly established households.
  - Random selection of households and subjects within households.
  - One-time sampling; sites included Bura and Hola irrigation schemes (Tana River) and Ijara and Sangailu divisions (Garissa).
  - Data collected from households with a mix of irrigated, pastoral, and riverine sites.

- Fieldwork and data collection methods
  - Ethical approvals from AMREF-ESRC; community, household, and subject-level consent obtained.
  - Community meetings held to outline objectives and plans.
  - Data collection via Open Data Kit (ODK) on smartphones; GPS coordinates captured but withheld for ethical reasons.
  - Sampling coordinated with involvement of Ministry of Health personnel.
  - Blood samples collected by trained personnel; age-based volumes (up to 5–10 ml depending on age).
  - Samples processed into serum and whole blood; aliquoted in duplicates; stored in dry ice and liquid nitrogen before transfer to ILRI biorepository.

- Laboratory analysis
  - Serology: RVF virus immunoglobulin G (IgG) testing using a blocking ELISA developed for humans, domestic and wild ruminants.
  - Protocol referenced to Paweska et al., 2005.
  - Analyses performed in duplicates; borderline results re-tested.

- Dataset and data management
  - Dataset: a single CSV file named DDDAC_Kenya_human RVF seroprevalence.csv containing 23 variables.
  - Data management: daily uploads to a central ODK Aggregate server at ILRI; barcode-linked samples to household and individual data to minimize transcription errors.
  - Variables include: county, district, division, location, sublocation, village name, household id, relationship to household head, head gender/occupation/age, counts of males/females in household, individual gender/age/occupation, sampling site area type, test result (positive/negative), altitude, livestock in household, and sample identifiers.
  - Geospatial data: coordinates captured but not disclosed in the public dataset.
  - Quality control: lab analyses performed in duplicates; samples retested if results were borderline; sampling tubes pre-identified with barcodes; dry ice replenishment and sample handling described.

- Data structure and metadata
  - Table 1 (described in the document) provides detailed metadata for each variable in the dataset, including data type and description.
  - Blank cells indicate missing or undisclosed data.

- Ethical and governance considerations
  - Consents obtained at multiple levels (community, household, subject).
  - Geographical coordinates withheld to protect privacy.
  - Data handling and storage aligned with field protocols and ethics approvals.
