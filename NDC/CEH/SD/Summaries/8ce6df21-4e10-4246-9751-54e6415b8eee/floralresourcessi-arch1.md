# Data overview:

- Records of flower species and their estimated abundances on farmland from eight farms in Hampshire and West Sussex, England (UK).
- Data collection occurred in two periods: May–August 2014 and May–August 2018, with transects retained across years.
- Each farm had a single 3 km transect marked in 2013, spanning diverse habitat types (hedgerows, sown seed mixtures for birds/bees, grass margins, and regenerating areas).

- Farm locations and coordinates are provided for eight sites (A–H).

- Floral surveys were conducted in three rounds per year, aligned across 2014 and 2018 dates, and transect sections were consistently surveyed in both years.

- For each transect section, all flowering plants were recorded and the number of open flowers estimated within a 2 m band on either side of the observer.

- A “flower” is defined as fully open and includes single flowers, umbels/spikes, or capitula.

- Quality control involved calibration between surveyors using photographic counts to derive a scaling factor.

- The dataset is stored in an Excel CSV file named FloralResources.csv with 11 columns, including Year, Round, Type, Farm, Label, What, Length (m), Width (m), Family, Species, and Abundance.

- Management types recorded: Type refers to countryside stewardship agreements (ELS = Entry Level Stewardship or HLS = High Level Stewardship).

- The transect is subdivided into labeled sections (Label) with associated habitat/management details (What).

- Units and measurement details:
  - Length and Width describe transect section dimensions surveyed.
  - Abundance represents the estimated open flowers within the surveyed section.

- Data structure specifics:
  - Year: year of data collection (2014 or 2018).
  - Round: survey round order (1, 2, or 3).
  - Type: stewardship agreement (ELS or HLS).
  - Farm: farm identifier (A–H).
  - Label: transect section identifier.
  - What: management type for the transect section.
  - Length (m): transect section length.
  - Width (m): transect section width surveyed.
  - Family: plant family.
  - Species: plant species.
  - Abundance: estimated number of open flowers observed.
