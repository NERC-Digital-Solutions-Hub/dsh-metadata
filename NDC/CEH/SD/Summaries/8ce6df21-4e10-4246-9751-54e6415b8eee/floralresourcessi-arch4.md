# Data overview:

- What the data is: Records of flower species and their estimated abundances on farmland.

- Geography and scope: Study conducted on eight farms across Hampshire and West Sussex, England, UK, from May to August in 2014 and 2018. A 3 km transect was marked on each farm in 2013, covering habitats such as hedgerows, sown seed mixtures for birds or bees, grass margins, and areas left to regenerate.

- Locations: Eight farms labeled A–H with specific latitude/longitude coordinates provided.

- Study design and timing: Each transect was divided into sections walked in 2014 and retained for 2018 surveys. Floral surveys were performed in three rounds per year with dates aligned between 2014 and 2018:
  - 2014: 17–27 May; 21 Jun–9 Jul; 3–15 Aug
  - 2018: 14–19 May; 20 Jun–7 Jul; 3–7 Aug

- Measurements and units: For each transect section, observers recorded flower species and estimated the number of open flowers within 2 m on either side of the observer. A flower is counted when fully open and includes single flowers, umbels/spikes, or capitula.

- Quality control: Counts were calibrated between surveyors by estimating from photographs and applying a scaling factor to ensure consistency.

- Data structure and available file: Data are stored in an Excel spreadsheet named FloralResources.csv with 11 columns:
  - Year, Round, Type (ELS or HLS), Farm, Label (transect section), What (management type for the section), Length (m), Width (m), Family, Species, Abundance (estimated open flowers).
