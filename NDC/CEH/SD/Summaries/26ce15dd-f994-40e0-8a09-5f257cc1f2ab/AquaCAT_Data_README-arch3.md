# A set of 14400 summaries of mainland GB peak river flow data describing widespread flooding events as modelled using the Grid-to-Grid hydrological model and UKCP18 meteorological data based on RCP8.5

## Overview and provenance
- Authors: Alison Kay; Vicky Bell; Adam Griffin; Lisa Stewart (UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology); Paul Sayers; Sam Carr (Sayers and Partners LLP)
- Funders: UK Climate Resilience programme; AquaCAT project led by Sayers and Partners with UKCEH and Vivid Economics
- Date of upload: 2022-01-20 (Version 0.2)
- Purpose: To provide environmental health monitoring data for scrutiny of policy and informing future decision-making on flood risk under climate change

## Data scope and content
- Dataset comprises 14,400 summaries of mainland Great Britain peak river flow events, generated under UKCP18 meteorological data (RCP8.5) for two time periods:
  - Present day: December 1980 to November 2010
  - Future: December 2050 to November 2080
- Generated by combining Grid-to-Grid hydrological modeling with UKCP18 12-member perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of the Hadley Centre 12 km Regional Climate Model
- Events are national, multi-day flooding episodes identified when at least 0.1% of GB river-network gridcells exceed a location-specific threshold T(x) twice a year on average

## Methods and event generation
- Grid-to-Grid model inputs: gridded precipitation, temperature, and potential evaporation
- Ensemble: 12 PPE members driving the Grid-to-Grid model
- Time slices: baseline (1981-2010) and future (2051-2080) with 360-day years in the RCM
- Event definition and extraction:
  - An event is a sequence of consecutive days meeting the threshold criterion
  - Only the maximum daily flow within each event is retained for each gridcell
  - Thresholds are derived from daily flow distributions; probabilities of exceedance are modeled with a Generalised Pareto distribution for exceedances above T(x)
- Outputs include both flow maxima and exceedance probabilities (daily and annual, via Poisson approximation)

## Data structure and formats
- Per ensemble member and time period: NetCDF file named G2G_events_RCMXX_YSTART_YEND.nc
  - XX: RCM member number (01–15, excluding 02, 03, 14)
  - YSTART/ YEND: 198012–201011 (present) or 205012–208011 (future)
- Contents of each NetCDF file:
  - Flow: maximum river flow (m3/s) observed during the event at each gridcell on the river network
  - Annual probability of exceedance: likelihood that a given flow value is exceeded in any year
  - Daily probabilities: based on empirical daily flow distribution (with GP distribution for exceedances above T(x)); annual probabilities derived from daily via Poisson approximation
  - Location coordinates: Northings and Eastings (m) on the GB National Grid
  - Land/sea handling: flow recorded only on the river network; set to -1 on land outside the network; missing over sea
- Summary statistics file: summary_RCM**_****12_****11.csv
  - Per-event metrics include:
    - Nominal starting day (modelled with 30/360-year calendar)
    - Event ID
    - Event length (days)
    - Maximum annual probability of exceedance within the event
    - Area (km2) exceeding the POT2 threshold at any point during the event
    - Nominal season: DJF (Winter), MAM (Spring), JJA (Summer), SON (Autumn)

## How this supports monitoring frameworks
- Provides event-based flood risk indicators across time slices and multiple climate realizations
- Key measures available for policy scrutiny:
  - Maximum flow during widespread flooding events
  - Annual probability of exceedance for event-level peaks
  - Spatial extent of events (area exceeding threshold)
  - Seasonal patterns of events
- Enables comparison of present-day vs. future risk under a UKCP18 PPE framework

## Metadata, data governance and accessibility
- Data quality considerations:
  - Metadata gaps and transformation needs noted as potential barriers
  - Effort required to verify suitability of data due to data format and completeness
- Data sharing and governance:
  - Public sharing of underlying data is a consideration and can pose barriers for using some datasets
  - Emphasis on ensuring datasets meet quality standards and that data management practices are established at source
- Documentation and references provided to support reproducibility and further methodological development

## Key challenges and practical considerations for monitoring teams
- Data availability and quality: occasional gaps or gaps in metadata; ensuring data are up-to-date
- Access and timeliness: potential barriers to obtaining data promptly
- Organizational silos: coordination across different organizations can hinder data sharing
- Data transformation: non-standard formats require effort to make data usable for policy monitoring
- Communication: translating complex, model-based flood risk metrics into actionable policy insights
