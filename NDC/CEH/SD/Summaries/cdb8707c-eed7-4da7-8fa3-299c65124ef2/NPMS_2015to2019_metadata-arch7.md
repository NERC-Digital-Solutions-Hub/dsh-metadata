# Introduction

- The National Plant Monitoring Scheme (NPMS) is a habitat-based plant monitoring scheme developed by BSBI, CEH, Plantlife, and JNCC to collect data on annual changes in plant abundance and diversity.
- It supports volunteer recorders to monitor plants and habitat attributes in small plots across the UK, Isle of Man, and Channel Islands.
- Objectives:
  - Detect change in the quality of priority habitats.
  - Understand drivers/pressures behind changes.
  - Contribute data for the UK Biodiversity Indicator “C7 Plants of the wider countryside” by measuring plant communities in key habitats.
- The document provides a snapshot of the NPMS database (held at CEH Wallingford) and describes the included data files as well as the Evidence Quality Assurance (EQA) process.

- Data and guidance resources:
  - Field recording guidance (second edition, 2019) and related surveyor resources are available via NPMS websites.
  - The document supersedes the need to access updated guidance by pointing to NPMS content pages for current materials.

- EQA context:
  - A suite of journal articles, reports, and internal documents support the EQA framework for NPMS data, including design and analysis of volunteer-based plant monitoring schemes and models for interval-censored plant data.
  - Outputs are subject to review, uncertainty assessment, and version control according to a Data Management Plan and PRINCE2 standards.

- Scope of the snapshot:
  - Describes the files provided (locations, samples, attributes, occurrences, habitat lookups, and Domin scores) and how they interrelate.
  - Illustrates how to access habitat information linked to samples and how to interpret data quality and verification status.
