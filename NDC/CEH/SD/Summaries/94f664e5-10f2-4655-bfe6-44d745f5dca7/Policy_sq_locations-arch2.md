# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## CS Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When locations may be released (and precision level)
- Location access allows identification of squares within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references require CEH pre-processing to avoid direct release; in very exceptional cases, external release may be granted if the requester demonstrates IP/data confidentiality equal to or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares could indirectly identify square location and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must: preserve confidentiality, store data securely, restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need, have finite licence periods, and destroy data at project end with written confirmation.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; location data must not be used to inform visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licences to six-digit but do not require the same IP confidentiality level; users must not attempt to derive precise locations.

## Responsibilities and processes
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences require sign-off by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI/EIR procedures to support the decision.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH should undertake reasonable pre-processing analysis for internal CS partners within moderate demand; other organizations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific support as part of collaboration or paid arrangements.
