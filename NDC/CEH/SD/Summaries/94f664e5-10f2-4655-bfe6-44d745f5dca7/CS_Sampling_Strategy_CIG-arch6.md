# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Document the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Provide the historical development of the ITE Land Classification and how it underpins national ecological sampling in Great Britain.
  - Explain how sampling design evolved to meet policy needs, regional reporting, and country-specific estimates (England, Wales, Scotland).

- Core concepts
  - Stratified sampling: dividing land into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure representative sampling and reduce bias.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental-attributes–based system used to classify land into 32–40+ classes (over time) to guide sampling.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): multivariate method historically used to form initial land classes in small units (e.g., 1 km squares).

- Early approach (CS1978)
  - Use of a 1 km square sampling unit.
  - 32 ITE land classes derived from environmental variables.
  - Selected eight squares per class (total 256) for field surveys.
  - National habitat estimates calculated as mean habitat area per square in a class times the land-class area.

- 1984 update
  - Expanded sampling to 12 km squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Demonstrated changes in landscapes between 1978 and 1984.

- 1990 (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB (all-squares classification).
  - Field survey comprised 508 squares.
  - Added benefit of linking to the first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite imagery.
  - Some squares reassigned to different classes; urban and sea corrections applied.

- Developments leading to CS2000
  - Recognized need to extend classification so every square in GB is classified for regional/local estimates.
  - Mapped performance of alternate classifications; best approximation preserved class averages despite limited data.
  - Result: sampling distribution across classes shifted; some classes under-represented in certain areas.

- CS2000 changes and country-specific reporting
  - Introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) to reflect policy needs and legislative reporting.
  - Class sub-division to create country-unit versions; class aggregation to ensure adequate representation when counts were low.
  - Added 19 extra squares to strengthen representation; allocated additional squares to ensure consistency across England and Wales.
  - Wales-specific refinement: sub-divided certain classes within Wales (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); created 40 strata (from 32).

- Uplands module (CS2000)
  - Added surveying of 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales.
  - Improves statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates, addressing under-sampling due to country-based reporting needs.

- CS2007 adjustments (Welsh-only reporting)
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only results post-devolution.
  - Welsh-specified class sub-divisions created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata (up from 40).
  - 43 additional Welsh squares added (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class).
  - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) retained with 4 squares each due to precision considerations.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country; England and Scotland maintain substantial samples.
  - CS2007 sample distribution summarized in Table 3 and Figure 6/7 maps illustrating revised land classes and sample squares.

- Outputs, reporting and national estimates
  - Continued aim to produce reliable habitat and land-use estimates at GB and country levels.
  - Note on national estimates: changing the basic classification used for estimation affects cross-survey consistency; approaches include using latest country-specific classifications or keeping the original classification for cross-survey comparability (CS1990 vs. CS2007 considerations).

- Practical data implications for data support
  - Data required across years include land-class assignments for each 1 km square, number of sample squares per class, and sampling rates (1:x).
  - Cross-year comparability challenges due to changes in land classification granularity and country-specific subdivision.
  - Availability of maps and tables showing land-class distributions, sample-square locations, and stratified sampling schemes (e.g., Figures 4–7, Table 2, Table 3).
  - Revisions affect how habitat areas are estimated regionally or nationally; essential to align data products with the corresponding Land Classification version used for a given survey.

  - Land-class maps and country-unit classifications (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales; corresponding English versions).
  - Tables and charts showing: number of squares, strata counts, sampling rates, and habitat estimates per class and country.
  - Upland habitat estimates improved by the 30-square uplands module.
  - Dashboards or pivot-style reports enabling exploration of habitat area by land class and country, with notes on classification version used.
