# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Purpose and scope
- A national countryside survey in Great Britain designed to monitor land cover, capture ecological data, and provide up-to-date datasets for scientific evaluation and policy-relevant analysis.
- Two-tier approach to link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (including satellite imagery) through a standardized field recording system.
- Aim to produce current, comparable land-cover and landscape data to assess change over time and support modelling and decision-making.

## Sampling design and scope
- Total of 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990; sampling divided among six ITE Research Stations (about 85 squares per station).
- Each square expected to take roughly three days to survey; day-to-day planning guided by station coordinators.
- Two-tier sampling: 128 new squares and 128 squares that had not previously recorded vegetation plots; 256 squares have prior data to relocate and update.
- Emphasis on standardization, quality control, and documenting changes across years.

## Planning and logistics
- Flexible working arrangements; travel time minimized; allowances handled via time off in lieu rather than overtime (subject to review).
- Multiple scheduling options for fieldwork (local daily travel or periods away from stations).
- Permissions and landowner engagement are essential before fieldwork; procedures described for handling refusals and contingencies, including replacement of inaccessible squares.

## Equipment and data capture (FAB)
- Core data collection center around Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and mapped information.
- Equipment provided by Merlewood:
  - FABs, aerial photographs, 1:10,000 site maps, project explanations, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, markers, sampling gear, measuring tapes, navigation gear, ITE identity card.
- Equipment from local ITE Stations:
  - Locational maps, pencils, reference books, camera, hand lens, film, first aid, rucksack, weather gear.
- Surveyors may also bring personal gear; emphasis on neat, legible, well-organized FABs to enable later analysis.

## Mapping and aerial imagery
- Mapping is the geographically most comprehensive element; data annotated on enlarged 6" (1:10,000) maps.
- Use of data codes (boxes and alpha-numeric codes) to build rich, machine-readable records that link to map features.
- Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supported to aid feature identification (e.g., isolated trees, boundaries) but not for full land-cover categorization; substitutions made if field evidence conflicts.

## Data coding and structure (FAB and codes)
- Two-tier coding system: primary and secondary codes; alphabets used to compress multiple numeric codes into a single symbol.
- Codes linked to land cover, vegetation, boundary types, uses, buildings, water features, and more.
- Special conventions:
  - Boundaries: clearly mark actual vs. interpreted boundaries; if a boundary no longer exists, code 999 (no longer present).
  - Minimum mappable area: 1/25 ha; minimum mappable length: 20 m.
  - Use of X marks for point features (e.g., individual trees) and avoid linking arrows to codes on the map.
  - When in doubt, field officers should decide in the field; reforms only via documented qualifying notes.
- Universal codes and category lists (e.g., for vegetation, crops, boundary types, buildings, roads, hedges) to standardize field-to-GIS translation and enable cross-year comparability.

## Vegetation recording and plot types (6.2.2–6.2.3)
- Standardized vegetation recording uses a standard form and nested quadrats to capture species and cover:
  - 200 m2 large quadrats (Valley plots): nested 4 m2 quadrats for detailed species recording; permanent metal markers for relocation in future surveys.
  - Five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats per square placed in five different natural or semi-natural land-cover types.
- Plot layout and relocation rules emphasize accuracy, representativeness, and the ability to relocate plots using permanent markers, field boundaries, or local features.
- Quadrats and linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) are laid out with precise width and orientation guidelines; distances and bearings must be sketched on FABs.
- For arable crops or cultivated land, plots may be adjusted to field edges while maintaining representative sampling.

## Linear plots and boundaries (6.2.3 and 6.2.4)
- Linear plots include hedgerows (1 m wide), streams/ditches (1 m to bank level), and road verges (1 m from road edge). Additional verge plots sample various road types (A/B roads, yellow roads, and constructed tracks).
- Rules ensure no overlap between plots and that linear plots are placed at appropriate distances from each other (e.g., at least 10 m apart on the same feature).
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots provide guidance on initial placement relative to quadrats, with contingencies for changes in land use or missing features.
- Permanent marking with metal plates to ensure future relocation; plots are described and sketched with reference to nearby features for reproducibility.

## Species identification and special cases
- Surveyors should strive for species-level identification; however, certain closely related or difficult-to-distinguish species may be recorded as predefined combinations to maintain consistency across surveys.
- A predefined list of common bryophytes and lichens is recorded with separate codes.
- For vegetation, mixtures are allowed with dominant codes and careful documentation when multiple codes apply.

## Sampling of freshwater biota (7)
- Two freshwater samples per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sampling; described in a separate handbook).
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP sampling; water beetles emphasis at Newcastle University).
- For standing waters (lakes, ponds, dried pools, flushes, bogs), sites are chosen to reflect characteristic habitats within the square.
- Sampling protocol includes labeling, time-limited searching, preservation with formalin, and secure transport to Merlewood.

## Photography (8)
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and key landmarks.
- Plot number labeled on a plastic board placed at the plot edge, covering the marker plate position for easy reference.

## Procedure subsequent to survey (9)
- End-of-day checks to ensure no features were omitted; avoid post-hoc transposition unless damage or loss necessitates it.
- FABs and samples to be returned to ITE stations promptly; transport arrangements coordinated to ensure timely processing.

## GIS relevance and application
- The document provides a comprehensive, standardized protocol for producing map-based data products suitable for GIS, policy briefing, and public-facing visualizations.
- Emphasizes data quality, consistency across observers, and linkage between field data and satellite-derived products.
- Establishes repeatable methods for future monitoring surveys and long-term change detection, enabling robust GIS-led analyses of land use and landscape change.
