# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Applies exclusively to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Maintains scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future access permissions.
- Confidentiality policy decisions are made by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners, under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release conditions and precision
- Allowed releases by licence for approximate location to support predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone) using four-digit grid references (10x10 km).
- Six-digit (precise) locations require exceptional licensed access; external requests must demonstrate that associated data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.
- Four-digit releases do not require meeting the higher IP-confidentiality criteria, but still governed by license terms.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for unrelated organizational responsibilities.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation of data destruction and continued confidentiality.
- No third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality; no use to identify or visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- Potential licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit license terms are similar to six-digit but with lower IP-confidentiality requirements; explicit prohibition on deriving precise square locations from released data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- CEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and justification.
- Internal CS partnerships may receive timely pre-processing support from CEH; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and prospective users are advised to consult CEH prior to committing to data use; involvement may be collaborative or paid and is negotiated case-by-case.

## Process and consultation
- CEH can perform necessary pre-processing analyses for internal use within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand.
- External requests require case-by-case consideration and clear demonstration of confidentiality obligations.
