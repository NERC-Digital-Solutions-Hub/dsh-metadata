# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Purpose and Aims
- Establish environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy, and inform future decisions.
- Provide current, scientifically robust datasets on land use, land cover and rural biodiversity to track changes and support ecological modelling.
- Link bottom-up field survey data with top-down remote sensing and map products to improve detection of countryside change over time.
- Standardize field recording to enable comparability across years and observers; maintain data quality and foster transparent data sharing.

## Scope and Planning
- Based on ITE’s land classification framework; prior GB surveys (1977/78 and 1984) informed methodology and sampling.
- 1990 resurvey aims to broaden and deepen data collection, linking land cover, landscape features, and vegetation data.
- Design includes 512 squares in GB, grouped for six ITE Stations; each station surveys about 85 squares.
- Two-tier field approach with planned efficiency considerations:
  - Large quadrats (200 m2) for broad vegetation mapping.
  - Small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) within natural/semi-natural areas for detailed vegetation data.
- Flexible field logistics to optimise travel, with guidance on leave, overtime, and travel costs; random sampling and proportional allocation based on land cover types.

## Data and Equipment (FAB and API)
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) used to capture mapping, vegetation, ownership, and site details; multiple pages per square.
- Equipment kit includes maps, aerial photos, field forms, markers, measuring tools, and personal gear; some items provided by Merlewood, others by local ITE Stations, and surveyors’ own gear.
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) aids identification of features not on OS maps and boundary delineations; interpreted with ground-truth guidance.

## General Field Survey Procedure
- On-site assessment of square to identify problems and plan access routes; obtain full-square permission when possible.
- Select routes enabling complete, detailed examination; complete checks after recording to ensure full coverage and clarity.

## Permissions and Stakeholder Engagement
- Permissions are essential for legal access and farmer/landowner goodwill; prior letters sent to landowners and occupiers; follow-up visits to confirm arrangements.
- If permission is refused for any part of a square, defined contingency procedures apply (replacement square, partial surveying, or abandonment, depending on extent).
- Surveyors should engage with farmers to gather contextual information and respect ownership details.

## Data Recording (Filling in the FAB)
- Countryside Survey 1990 comprises mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with sampling covered in Section 7).
- FABs require neat, legible completion; each page must show square number and ownership/tenure details; include qualitative notes and any qualifying comments.
- Data coding system uses primary and secondary numeric codes with alpha codes to compactly represent complex land-cover and boundary information.
- Codes cover a wide range of elements: boundaries, vegetation types, land use, ownership, and other site characteristics; include instructions for how to handle ambiguous or mixed units.
- When a unit cannot be captured with a single code, multiple codes and dominant-use rules are applied; documentation and comments are encouraged to preserve interpretation.

## Mapping and Coding (Section 6)
- Mapping is the main geographic component; all features annotated on 1:10,000 maps with a combination of data codes.
- Alpha codes (A, B, etc.) represent combinations of numeric codes for compact map annotation; use uppercase letters; avoid confusing characters.
- Boundaries, edge mapping, minimum mappable areas, and cross-referencing with on-ground observations are specified.
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) conventions are applied with field-interpretation priority and conflict resolution rules.

## Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) and FAB Completion
- API provides guidance on boundaries and isolated features and is to be used as a supplementary reference only when ground evidence agrees.
- FABs are compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet per square; a neat, interpretable layout is essential to avoid analysis errors.
- Orders and page-specific instructions guide where ownership, farmer interactions, physiography, vegetation, and boundary information are recorded.

## Vegetation Sampling and Plot Types (6.2.2–6.2.3)
- Vegetation sampling uses standardized plots with nested quadrats:
  - Large Quadrats: five 10 x 200 m2 (approx. 200 m2) plots per square, with nested sampling within each quadrat.
  - Small Quadrats: five 2 x 2 m quadrats placed in natural/semi-natural land cover types per square.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 plots for hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and boundary features (S/V, R/V, etc.).
- Plot layout and relocation rules emphasize center-of-gravity placement for representativeness; if habitat changes, relocation is guided by predefined procedures.
- Permanent marking: metal plates to mark quadrat locations for easy relocation in future surveys.
- Recording protocol for species is detailed:
  - A restricted list of 200 common species for vegetation recording; unlisted species documented and added.
  - 5% cover categories for each recorded species; multiple nested quadrats completed before final cover estimation.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded with defined lists; some species combinations are permitted when precise identification is difficult.
- Plot types include:
  - Quadrats (large and small)
  - Boundary plots (within hedges/linear features)
  - Hedgerows, streamsides, and roadside plots
  - Verge plots for road-related sampling
- 1977/78 rules for locating linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) are referenced for consistency and relocation.

## Vegetation Coding and Species Lists
- Detailed lists of crops, grasses, forbs, and bryophytes/lichens; abbreviations and codes used to describe dominant species, cover, height, and age.
- Species data are limited to 25% cover or more per mapping unit; combinations allowed where identification is uncertain.
- Age classes and canopy proportions help interpret forest and woodland data; multiple codes may be used to describe mixed stands, with guidance on dominant codes.

## Freshwater Biota Sampling (Section 7)
- Two freshwater biota samples per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sample; described in a separate handbook)
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP sample; primarily water beetles)
- Sampling sites should reflect representative habitats within the square (lakes/lochs, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.).
- Sample handling, labeling, and transport procedures are outlined to ensure traceability.

## Photography
- All vegetation plots photographed using print films; plot numbers marked on a board at the plot edge to document location relative to the marker plate.

## Procedures Subsequence Survey
- End-of-day data checks to minimize omissions; transfer of FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly; minimize re-editing of mapped data unless necessary due to damage.

## Implications for Monitoring Framework Authors
- Emphasizes a rigorous, standardized, and repeatable field framework suitable for long-term monitoring and policy evaluation.
- Highlights the importance of data governance, metadata, and openness:
  - Clear data collection protocols, ownership and permission tracking, and data sharing practices.
  - Permanent plot markers and relocation procedures enable consistent longitudinal analyses.
  - Detailed, auditable coding schemes support cross-year comparability and reproducibility.
- Demonstrates how to integrate field data with remote sensing (satellite imagery) to enhance pattern detection and trend analysis.
- Addresses typical monitoring challenges:
  - Managing data access and stakeholder permissions.
  - Ensuring metadata quality and standardized field methods to reduce observer bias.
  - Handling complex mosaics and mixed land uses with explicit dominant-use rules.
- Provides a blueprint for governance of environmental monitoring data, including:
  - Structured data collection (FABs), codes, and field handbooks for consistency.
  - Clear procedures for data handling, storage, and relocation of plots.
  - Protocols for data completeness, quality checks, and timely data handover to central repositories.
