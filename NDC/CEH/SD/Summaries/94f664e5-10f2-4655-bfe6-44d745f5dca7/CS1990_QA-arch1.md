# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Aim: Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, assess the accuracy of change statistics, explain observer- and time-related differences, relate findings to prior work, and recommend methodology improvements to enhance accuracy and confidence in the statistics.

## Background and scope

- Field work involves many recorders; despite training and supervision, variation is expected. QA seeks to measure consistency and reliability across major field components.
- Earlier exercises (1989–1990) demonstrated the usefulness of tests on plot relocation, cover estimates, and observer effects; highlighted difficulties in unifying data from different sources, scales, and formats.
- Specific challenges include data gaps, inaccessible datasets, and the need to align data collection with analysis requirements, especially for vegetation and land-use mapping.

## Aims (detailed)

- (a) Quantify the accuracy of field recording in 1990 and assess the accuracy of change statistics.
- (b) Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, geography, and drought effects.
- (c) Relate conclusions to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
- (d) Recommend methodological modifications for future surveys to improve accuracy and confidence in the statistics.

## Methods

- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990 (Oct–Nov): Limited to 21 original squares; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991 (Jun–Sep): Added photographs of individual plots; tested improvement from photos; used a single 1 km square from each of the 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment group squares.
- Sampling design:
  - Each 1 km square was visited within 14 days of the original survey date; 28 of 32 squares visited by a single assessor.
  - One quarter of each square resurveyed to include all six plot types represented previously (X, Y quadrats; roadverges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries).
- Plot types and relocation:
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots).
  - Linear plots and boundary features; road verges; hedges; streamsides; boundaries.
  - Relocation relied on sketch maps, photographs, and buried metal plates; 9 predetermined survey points within a sub-square.
- Plate relocation and recording:
  - Relocation success and recognition categorized as plate found/located, plate not found, and plots relocated/not relocated.
- Species concordance measures:
  - Four indices used to compare plots across times: simple agreement, agreement excluding likely erroneous original records, agreement assuming original as benchmark, and % accuracy after removing T2 errors.
- Analysis:
  - Comparison of species lists per plot; analysis of seasonal and annual effects; DECORANA first-axis scores to assess ecological gradients and changes; land-class and plot-type comparisons; mapping code concordance.

## Key findings

- Plate relocation:
  - Autumn 1990: 71% recovery rate within five minutes search time.
  - 1991 QA: 65% plates found; 87% plots found; some plots (27) not found.
- Species concordance and recording efficiency:
  - Initial cross-time species agreement across the full data set was modest; early figure around 60% (Table 4/Annex) with ~60.9% concordance overall.
  - The full 1990 QA suggested an initial accuracy of about 74% once T2 variations were accounted for; after removing seasonality-adjusted records, efficiency was about 74% (Table 5 and related text).
  - 1991 QA showed a statistically significant increase in mean species per plot (1990: ~20.7 species; 1991: ~23.4) across all plot types (p = 0.009 overall for combined data; highly significant for pooled comparisons). This largely reflected real differences in species complements between years rather than solely better recorder performance.
  - Seasonal and drought effects: a drought year (1990) vs a comparatively normal 1991 year contributed substantially to differences in species counts; upland and lowland differences also observed.
- Variation sources (breakdown of errors):
  - A) Mis-identifications
  - B) Species overlooked in the original survey
  - C) Over-zealous recording (extra species within plots)
  - D) Failures to locate or align plots between times
  - J, E, F, G, H, I variations: misc. errors due to positioning, seasonal/management changes, relocation issues, etc.
  - Approximately 39% of observations were mis-matches (Table 4); overall, about 60.9% agreement between T1 and T2 when considering all categories.
- Frequency of prevalent species:
  - Frequencies of common species remained broadly similar between years, with some genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata) and some apparent under-recording in the original survey for others (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).
  - Group analyses of 10 species per plot type showed no significant difference in cumulative frequency between 1990 and 1991 for the broader groups, though individual species showed fluctuations likely due to climate.
- Effects on ecological gradient (DECORANA axis 1):
  - Changes in axis 1 were consistent with prior ECOLUC patterns: a general movement along a gradient from shade-tolerant to shade-intolerant species, with upland vs lowland differences.
  - Across all plot types, a trend toward changes predicted by long-term land-use shifts was visible, but year-to-year perturbations were evident, especially in marginal areas.
- Land-use mapping and boundary features:
  - Primary land-use codes: high concordance (around 88–95%); mapping robust for main land uses.
  - Boundary codes: slightly lower concordance (around 80–90%), with some dependence on whether the same assessors were used in both autumn 1990 and summer 1991.
  - Qualifying codes and level-of-detail codes: interpretive differences led to some mis-matches; overall, mapping was a balance between coder interpretation and code definitions.
  - Marsh/wetland and upland vs lowland distinctions (e.g., 114 marsh; 102 upland grassland) required refinement; some recommendations to subdivide upland and to add new primary codes (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) to improve consistency.
- Mapping of species cover:
  - Point-based cover mapping showed about 81% concordance for single dominant species; co-dominants were only 34% concordant.
  - The results suggest focusing on the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit to improve reproducibility and reduce misclassification.
- Bryophytes and seasonal considerations:
  - Recording of bryophytes (mosses) was highlighted as an area for targeted training; seasonal timing strongly affected detectability, especially in moist habitats.
- Overall interpretation of QA results:
  - Photographs are highly valuable for plot relocation, particularly in unenclosed land.
  - Lack of explicit plot-distance and bearing data hampered relocation; photos helped but annotations would improve efficiency.
  - Metal plates for X plots were effective but more manpower is required in upland unenclosed areas.
  - Y plots (4 m2) were particularly challenging to relocate; improved ground positioning techniques and accompanying photographs would help.
  - Seasonality strongly affects species lists; QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey to minimize climatic variation influences.

## Recommendations (key actions to improve future surveys)

1) Retain lichens in general surveys, with training materials and habitat context to improve identification accuracy.
2) Conduct QA as close as practical to the time of the initial survey to minimize seasonal/annual variation effects.
3) Ensure surveyors annotate photographs and relate locations to nearby features; include distances to features on sketches or photographs.
4) Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land to improve relocation reliability.
5) Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a survey tape; orient so the side, not the diagonal, is oriented N–S; place plots at the SE corner.
6) Photographs should be used to re-establish exact plot positions; in unenclosed land, relocation can be time-consuming—allocate adequate manpower.
7) Encourage surveyors to annotate photographs and ensure sketches refer to photo features; maintain consistent relinking between time points.
8) Sub-divide upland grassland codes (102) into: upland improved meadow/pasture (Lolium perenne and Agrostis capillaris with Anthoxanthum odoratum) vs upland grassland (less improved, often with bracken); provide clearer definitions.
9) Introduce a dedicated lowland rush pasture code to reduce mis-coding of wet rushy habitats.
10) Recognize wet heath as a distinct primary vegetation type and assign a primary code accordingly.
11) Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence, with hedge species composition captured via qualifying codes to reduce mis-classification.
12) For mapping land cover, record only the two most prevalent species at a point to improve reproducibility; reduce reliance on extensive cover codes and improve consistency.

- Additional recommendations (summary):
  - Improve definitions and training for certain codes (e.g., marsh code 114; moorland vs blanket bog distinctions).
  - Increase consistency in boundary coding and reducing ambiguity in forb cover codes (138–140) where definitions were lacking.
  - Emphasize the recording of the most informative vegetation attributes (dominant species) to improve cross-year comparability.

## Practical conclusions for analysts and data use

- The QA demonstrates that data quality in vegetation surveys is highly sensitive to season, drought, plot relocation accuracy, and code interpretation. While main land-use mapping is robust, finer-scale mappings and species-cover data require careful standardization and training.
- Photographic documentation and explicit location features substantially improve plot relocation and data reproducibility; integrating annotated photos into data pipelines would support more reliable longitudinal analyses.
- For future analysis, consider year-aligned QA, refined land-use and boundary coding schemes, and a focus on the most informative species to improve data consistency across survey waves.
- Where possible, maintain standardized procedures for plot relocation, include distance bearings, and plan for adequate field personnel in challenging terrains to reduce relocation time and errors.
