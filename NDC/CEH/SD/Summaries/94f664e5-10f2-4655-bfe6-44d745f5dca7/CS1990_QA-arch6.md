# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A study of the quality assurance (QA) process for the 1990 Countryside Survey, detailing the scope, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in survey statistics.

## Scope and Aims
- QA conducted on large field vegetation data collection with many recorders, despite training, handbooks, and supervision.
- Two QA exercises: Autumn 1990 (21 original survey squares) and 1991 (photograph-assisted follow-up across selected squares).
- Plans to quantify recording accuracy, explain differences by observer/season/location, relate to prior surveys, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Methods
- QA Series I (Autumn 1990): Independent assessors re-recorded 21 squares using original sketch maps for plot relocation; divisions included six plot types (Quadrats: X 200 m2; Y 4 m2; linear plots; roadverges; hedges; streamsides; verges; boundaries). Relocation relied on sketch maps and on-site markers.
- QA Series II (1991): Added photographs of individual plots; assessed 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes; each square visited within close timeframe to original survey date; a quarter of each square resurveyed to include all plot types.
- Plate relocation: evaluated effectiveness of relocating buried plates; plate recovery rate ~71% in autumn 1990 with five-minute searches; combined plate/plot relocation success varied by plot type (e.g., roadsides vs. enclosed plots).
- Species concordance: four indices used to compare plots across times, with initial results around 45–47% agreement and improved figures after considering seasonal and other revisions.
- Mapping and coding: evaluated primary land-use codes, boundary codes, and the accuracy of point/parcel mapping against original surveys; included Annexes on cover estimates and land-use code variations.

## Key Findings
- Relocation and data capture
  - Photographs significantly improved plot relocation accuracy; metal plates aided relocation but were time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
  - X plots relatively easier to relocate; Y plots most challenging; roadverges and hedges intermediate; plate-based methods beneficial but require resources.
- Observer and seasonal effects
  - Major sources of discrepancy: mis-identifications, species overlooked, mis-location/orientation, and seasonal/management changes.
  - The 1991 QA suggested a genuine increase in species per plot (about 13%), with approximately 27% attributed to improved recording efficiency and about 73% to real year-to-year differences (likely climate-related).
- Plot types and land classes
  - X plots: best performance in relocation; Y plots hardest.
  - upland (UP) plots showed more stable axis scores; lowland arable plots (LC) exhibited greater recording difficulty.
  - DECORANA ordination showed a measurable ecological gradient shift consistent with longer-term trends, but with year-to-year variation in marginal areas likely due to climate and land-use changes.
- Species and cover
  - Several common species showed changes in frequency, some reflecting genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum, Galium), while others result from under-recording in the initial survey.
  - Cover estimates differed for several major grasses; bryophyte recording was inconsistent and highlighted as a training focus.
- Mapping and coding
  - Land-use primary codes showed high concordance (about 88.7%), boundary codes somewhat less consistent (around 80–83%), and overall level agreement around 79–83% depending on code type and assessor pairing.
  - Mapping of vegetation cover at nine grid points showed substantial concordance for dominant species but much lower for co-dominants (81% for first species at a point; 34% for two co-dominants; 5% for three co-dominants).
  - Recommendations to simplify and standardize mapping to improve reproducibility and reduce coding ambiguity.

## Data Quality and Variation Analysis
- Sources of variation (as allocated in tables):
  - A: Mis-identifications
  - B: Species overlooked in original survey
  - F: Seasonal/annual changes
  - G/H: Plot mis-location/orientation
  - I/J: Overlooked species at re-survey or moving/relocating plots
- Overall, mis-match contributions indicate that most discrepancies arise from a mix of recording and relocation errors plus genuine ecological changes.
- Initial % accuracy for 1990 survey averaged around 74%, with observed improvements in subsequent QA exercises.
- Across plot types and land classes, no single factor fully explains all discrepancies; instead, a combination of crop changes, relocation problems, and changes in cover-values contributed to differences.

## Recommendations (Key Examples)
- Field methods and photography
  - Ensure photographers annotate plots and relate photos to corresponding plots; include distance to features and compass bearings on sketches (to aid relocation).
  - Use metal marker plates for ground-truthing X plots; allocate extra personnel/time for upland relocation.
  - Annotate photos to clearly show plot boundaries and nearby distinguishing features (especially for small plots like Y).
  - Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tapes, orienting sides N-S rather than diagonals; place at SE corner.
- Training and taxonomic focus
  - Emphasize bryophyte identification and grass vegetation in training; consider adding more reference specimens and habitat-specific lists.
  - Improve distinction between similar taxa (e.g., grasses) through training and field guides.
- Timing and QA practices
  - Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey; aim to perform QA in the same year to minimize seasonal effects.
  - Limit QA to the same season/year as the original survey when feasible.
- Land-use mapping and coding
  - Increase the number of primary land-use codes; provide clearer, simpler dichotomous keys to reduce ambiguity.
  - Map only the most prevalent species for land-use parcels to improve reproducibility; restrict emphasis on minor or ambiguous cover values.
  - Sub-divide upland grasslands (102) into more specific categories; recognize lowland rush pasture and wide-scale wet/heath types distinctly.
  - Restrict boundary primary codes to hedge categories with qualifying codes documenting composition; limit use of ambiguous forb cover codes not defined in the handbook.
- Data products and mapping practices
  - Record only the two most prevalent species per land-use parcel to improve code concordance.
  - Improve accuracy checks for point-location codes and boundary features (annexed guidance provided for reference coding).
- Longitudinal and cross-study considerations
  - Use photographs and sketches as standard relocation aids across surveys; compare data within similar land-use and habitat classes to avoid spurious change signals.
  - When feasible, compare across multiple time periods using consistent plot types and land-class groupings (LC, LG, MA, UP).

## Mapping, Vegetation Cover, and Codes (Implications for Data Support)
- Land-use primary codes showed high reliability; boundary codes slightly less reliable due to interpretive variation.
- Level vs. level-code concordance generally robust, reflecting careful coding by assessors and surveyors.
- Nine-point vegetation cover mapping revealed strong agreement for dominant species but limited reproducibility for co-dominants; suggests simplification of mapping rules to improve consistency.
- Annexes propose concrete coding adjustments to improve reproducibility and data quality in future surveys.

## Conclusions for Future Surveys
- Photographs are a valuable relocation aid, especially in unenclosed land; however, consistent annotation and locational data are essential.
- Time- and season-related discrepancies can significantly affect species lists and cover estimates; QA should be year-aligned with the original survey where possible.
- A combination of method refinements (photography, metal plates, standardized plot positioning) and improved training will enhance data quality.
- Standardizing land-use mapping codes and prioritizing the most informative variables will improve comparability and interpretation across time.
- Overall, QA demonstrates that data quality in large field surveys can be substantially improved through targeted methodological refinements and consistent data practices, enabling more reliable interpretation of ecological change over time.
