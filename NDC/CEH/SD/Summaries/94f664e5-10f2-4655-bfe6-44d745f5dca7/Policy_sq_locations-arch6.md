# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Defines how survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares may be accessed.
- Aims to maximise public benefit while protecting future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.

## Current partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access and precision: when and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km): can be released under licence when useful to users.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid direct release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features): can reveal square locations and follow the same exceptional release terms as six-digit coordinates.

## Licensing conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and accessible only to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End of licensing period: written destruction confirmation required.
- No data or derived information to be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If required, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be needed.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; four-digit licensing includes a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; sign-off by a senior authorised representative.
- If approved, CEH handles licensing; if denied, decisions follow statutory Act/Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report summarising access requests and decision grounds.
- CEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable demand; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or monetised.

## Practical guidance for data support work
- Before requesting data, assess whether four-digit grid references suffice or if higher precision is truly necessary.
- Engage CEH early to understand licensing, conditions, and required safeguards.
- Plan secure storage, restricted access, and clear data-handling procedures to meet confidentiality requirements.
- Ensure end-of-project destruction and documentation of compliance.
- Do not use location data to target visits or to impose compliance checks on landowners; respect IP and confidentiality constraints.

## Contact and next steps
- Consult CEH for guidance and potential collaboration; decisions on access are subject to policy and licensing conditions.
- External requests are evaluated case-by-case, with emphasis on protecting site confidentiality and data integrity.
