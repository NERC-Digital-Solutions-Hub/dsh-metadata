# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Aim and scope
- Monitor and update rural land use data by collecting vegetation, land cover, and landscape data to enable trend analyses and modelling.
- Combine bottom-up field surveys with top-down remote sensing; construct a Britain land cover map linked to the ITE Land Classification System.
- Ensure current, high-quality datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and changes in countryside.
- Implement a two-tier approach to improve ground-truth data and enable better spatial projection of survey results.

## Survey design and planning
- Total of 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990, grouped into six teams from six ITE Research Stations; each square managed by a station with about 85 squares.
- Each square planned to take approximately three survey days, with flexibility for access and logistics.
- Flexible scheduling to minimize travel, avoid unnecessary revisits, and manage costs (no overtime payments initially; time off in lieu for large overtime).
- Sampling prioritizes recording diversity of land cover types; larger land covers receive more quadrats to ensure representative sampling.

## Equipment and field materials
- Equipment split between Merlewood (FABs, aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear) and local ITE stations (maps, basic tools, field gear).
- Surveyors may also carry personal gear (clothing, cameras, lenses, etc.).
- Purpose-built data recording and mapping tools to standardize data collection and enable later data processing.

## General field survey procedure
- On-site work depends on land type and access; surveyors should first gain permission for access to enable full square coverage.
- Plan a suitable route to examine the entire square; ensure thorough recording and sufficient time for review and quality control.

## Permissions
- Securing permission is essential for legal access and for obtaining background information from landowners.
- Prior contact via letters and direct visits is encouraged; if permission is refused, procedures to abandon the square or relocate apply.
- When access is granted, document ownership and contact details; note owner cooperativeness for potential future surveys.
- If access is denied for part of a square, follow predefined procedures to decide whether to survey the rest or abandon the square.

## Data recording (FAB: Field Assessment Booklet)
- The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- FABs integrate maps, site data, and vegetation records; ordered pages are flexible but must be neat and clearly legible for later analysis.
- FAB sections include: square series number, ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water/coastal features, land use, vegetation, boundary types, buildings/structures/communications, and sampling details.
- Use a combination of primary and secondary data codes to describe features; primary codes reflect dominant attributes; combinations via alpha codes save space and improve data richness.
- Boundary types must be clearly delineated; codes 999 (no longer present) used for boundaries that no longer exist.
- Minimum mappable unit: 1/25 ha; minimum mappable length: 20 m.
- Aerial photography (API) may be used to identify non-map features and boundaries; API guidance is to be followed when applicable.
- Field notes should be supported by sketches on the FAB, including plot locations, distances, and marker plates.

## Mapping and coding specifications
- Enlarge maps to 1:10,000 and annotate with data codes (primary and secondary) for each feature; use a system of alpha-numeric codes to represent multiple attributes succinctly.
- Always code the entire square, including small corners and edges; if boundaries are outdated, mark as 999.
- Use a consistent, field-based decision process; avoid deferring decisions to lab analysis.
- Aerial photograph interpretation (API) conventions provide guidance on marking boundaries, isolated features, and outdated features; use API results only as guidance when ground evidence contradicts.

## Vegetation recording and plot types (6.2)
- Field vegetation data are collected via standardized plots:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots and five 4 m2 plots for semi-natural vegetation; nested quadrats sample progressively finer scales.
  - Small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) placed in five additional semi-natural land cover types per square.
  - Linear plots: up to five per square across hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and boundary plots.
- Plot layout and relocation:
  - Large quadrats are relocated with precision; if land use changes, relocate to the nearest suitable boundary or new land cover while preserving sampling intent.
  - Boundary plots are placed at boundary features (hedges, fences, walls), with 1 m width from the feature into the field.
  - Streamside and roadside plots follow defined rules to place plots away from boundaries and ensure independence from adjacent plots.
- Permanent marking:
  - Metal plates mark quadrats; plates positioned to facilitate relocation with a metal detector; alternative markers used in challenging terrains.
  - Document the exact location and distances on sketches; take a photograph of plots for documentation.
- Plot placement rules:
  - For large quadrats, aim for a center of gravity representative of the habitat; if not representative, re-randomize.
  - If a plot must extend in linear features, adjust sizes and document changes clearly.
- Vegetation sampling protocol:
  - Standardized recording sheet (with nested quadrats) and a 5% cover category system for species.
  - Species lists include crops, grasses, forbs, sedges/rushes, ferns, and bryophytes/lichens; use a predefined common species list and allow unlisted species with notes.
  - When identification is uncertain, record acceptable species combinations to maintain consistency with previous surveys.
  - Use sketches of plots and surrounding context; collect unidentified species for later verification.

## Sampling program (including freshwater biota)
- Two freshwater biota sampling programs per square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) described in a separate handbook.
  - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP) focusing on water beetles; two standing-water samples per square (prefer vegetated waters).
- Stand-up water habitat categories to be sampled: lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, calcareous/acid flushes, sphagnum bogs, and animal/track-derived pools.
- Each sample point is mapped on the same FAB map; samples are preserved and labeled with essential metadata for transport to Merlewood.

## Photography
- Take photographs of every vegetation plot to document appearance and landmarks; plot number signposted on a board at the plot edge and integrated into photographs.

## Procedures subsequent to the survey
- End-of-day checks: verify that all features are recorded; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless data damage necessitates it.
- Return FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly for processing and archiving.
- Documentation emphasizes consistency, replicability, and traceability for future resurvey efforts.

## Quality control and standardization
- Emphasis on standardizing data collection across observers to minimize recording variation, which affects statistical accuracy of change data.
- The Field Handbook provisions and accompanying definitions are critical prerequisites for consistent data capture.
- Permanent markers, standardized forms, and clear coding guidelines underpin reliable longitudinal comparisons.

## Outputs and impact for data use
- Produces a rich, coded, geo-referenced dataset combining ground-truth vegetation data with remote sensing inputs.
- Enables creation of land cover maps, change detection analyses, and ecological modelling.
- Supports data sharing and re-use for broader policy, planning, and research purposes, particularly for organisations with broad remits (e.g., local councils, private sector).
