The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the sampling framework used for the field survey element of Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Connects to the ITE Land Classification and preserves value of time-series data for detecting change.
- Important for guiding monitoring design, data collection, and country-specific environmental reporting.

## Core concepts and origins
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
- Use of the ITE Land Classification to carve GB into land classes (strata) that reflect environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Sampling unit: 1 km square (with surrounding context squares allocated for classification).

## Chronology of the Countryside Survey (CS) sampling framework

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification & Field Survey)
  - ISA-based classification produced 32 land classes from environmental variables using 1228 centre 1 km squares; four surrounding squares per centre classified as well.
  - Final framework: 6039 km squares classified; 256 squares (8 per class) surveyed in the field.
  - National estimates computed as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the area occupied by that class.

- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384 squares); still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - Aimed at landscape features and habitat mapping; results published later.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - First Land Cover Map of GB linked to the programme; repeat vegetation quadrats collected.
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- Developments following CS1990
  - Recognition that GB-wide classification needed updating to classify every square; new surrogates used for climatic, geological, and physiographic factors.
  - Best simulations yielded 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classification; non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes, preserving overall class characteristics.

- 2000 (CS2000)
  - Planning highlighted need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland) and upland habitat estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation used where necessary; 40 strata created.
  - Added 19 squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; additional Wales and England adjustments to maintain sampling balance.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve statistical accuracy for uplands in England and Wales.

## Separate country estimates and country-wide changes

- England & Wales vs Scotland reporting
  - CS1990 used a cross-country classification for national estimates; CS2000 introduced country-unit-specific classifications (England with Wales; Scotland) to improve country-level accuracy.
  - Wales-specific adjustments: added Welsh-class sub-divisions and extra Welsh squares to ensure adequate Wales-only reporting.
  - Isle of Man replacements to maintain country-specific sampling integrity.

## CS2007: Welsh-only reporting and further refinements

- Wales-specific expansion and England adjustments
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only estimates post-devolution; 43 additional Welsh squares added.
  - Land Classes subdivided into five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing total strata to 45.
  - England did not receive equivalent extra squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) have only 4 squares each, deemed acceptable per scoping studies.
- Wales-focused sampling and country maps introduced to reflect updated framework.

## National estimates and data considerations

- Note on consistency
  - Changes in Land Classification affect national estimates; two approaches exist: using the latest country-specific classification or maintaining the original classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - The document advocates using the latest classification for internal survey consistency, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability considerations.

## Upland module

- CS2000 introduced an upland module with additional squares (about 30) in upland/marginal upland classes to improve precision in England and Wales.

## Data quality, governance and dissemination (implications for monitoring frameworks)

- Although primarily methodological, the strategy implies:
  - The need for careful metadata and transparent allocation of samples to Land Classes.
  - Ensuring adequate representation across countries and land classes to support robust country-specific estimates.
  - Planning for data sharing and reproducibility by documenting classification changes and sampling densities.
