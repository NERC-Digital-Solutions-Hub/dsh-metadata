# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field sampling framework and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify Countryside Survey samples from 1978 to 2007.
  - Aims to enable robust, time-series estimates of habitat extent and change across Great Britain, with increasing emphasis on country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales) for policy relevance.

- Core concepts and methods
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) grouped into land classes to form sampling strata.
  - Sampling unit: 1 km grid squares; initial approach used centre squares with surrounding concentric squares to assign class.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to define vegetation-based groups that informed the land-class framework.
  - National estimates are derived by combining within-class habitat measurements with the total area occupied by each class.

- Key milestones in the sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - Land Classification: 32 classes derived from 1228 classified centre 1 km squares (plus surrounding squares classified by ISA-derived keys).
    - Field sample: 8 squares per class, total of 256 squares.
    - National habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square within each class multiplied by class area.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Increased sample: 12 squares per land class (total 384 squares).
    - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; urban and sea corrections applied.
    - Field survey: 508 squares; repeated habitats and vegetation quadrats from 1978.
    - National estimates based on the revised system; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998/2000 (Revised Land Classification; CS2000)
    - Extended classification to cover all GB squares with surrogates for climatic, geological and physiographic factors.
    - New need for country-specific estimates led to “Separate country estimates” (England with Wales vs Scotland).
    - Sub-division and aggregation of Land Classes created 40 strata; added 19 squares to ensure representation, plus additional balancing squares (11 more for England-Wales balance).
    - Additional upland habitat module planned to improve upland estimates.
  - 2007 (Developments for Wales-only Reporting; CS2007)
    - Welsh-only reporting requirements led to Wales-specific refinements.
    - New Welsh subclasses created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45 (then 43 additional Welsh squares added for Wales representation).
    - England squares adjusted to maintain overall balance; Wales received expanded sampling to support Wales-only reporting.
    - Revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland; Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling adjustments
  - CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-specific strata and additional samples to ensure adequate representation.
  - Wales-specific refinements in CS2007 to support Wales-only environmental policy requirements.

- Uplands module
  - CS2000 included surveying an additional module in uplands and marginal uplands (30 extra squares) to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - This addressed under-sampling concerns due to country-based reporting requirements.

- Practical outputs and data management
  - Outputs include maps and tables showing the distribution of sample squares and land classes, and the resulting estimates of habitat areas by class and by country unit.
  - Data handling emphasized quality assurance, documentation, and storage/upload to appropriate portals to enable broader reuse.

- Notable figures and tables referenced
  - Maps of original and revised ITE Land Classification (1978, 1990, CS2000, CS2007) and sample square distributions.
  - Tables detailing the numbers of squares surveyed per class and per survey, and the evolution of sampling rates (e.g., 1:x) across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.
  - Summary notes on the rationale for changing classifications and ensuring consistency of national estimates across surveys.

- Acknowledgements and context
  - Recognises the collaborative development between DETR/DOE, CEH, and ITE, with statistical guidance informing the 2007 adjustments for Wales.
  - Emphasizes the long-term value of a consistent, stratified sampling framework for monitoring biodiversity, land use, and habitat change over time.

- Relevance for environmental analysis
  - Provides a rigorous, repeatable methodology for tracking environmental health indicators over time.
  - Supports policy-relevant reporting by enabling country-specific estimates (England & Wales, Scotland, Wales) and by incorporating upland habitat assessments.
  - Highlights ongoing challenges and opportunities for enhancing data value and accessibility by linking datasets and enabling broader data use.
