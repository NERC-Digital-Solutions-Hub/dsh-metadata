# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations; applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH), Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity of sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and precision of release
- Access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for coarse location identification.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require exceptionally justified needs; CEH may preprocess to avoid releasing locations; exceptional releases require demonstration that IP/data confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data inside survey squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.

## Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate purpose.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other duties.
- End of licensing period requires written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data should not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have somewhat lighter IP/confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases; license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- Denied approvals follow the UK Act and Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Organisations are advised to consult CEH before using CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
