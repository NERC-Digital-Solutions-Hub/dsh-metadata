# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aims and audience
  - Use standardized, time-series data to monitor environmental health and policy performance.
  - Targeted at organisations with defined monitoring duties; emphasizes broadly consistent, transparent approaches.

- Data philosophy and quality
  - Emphasizes understanding, verifying, quality-assuring, cleaning, and transforming data from established sources.
  - Outputs include mapped and charted indicators of environmental health; emphasis on reproducibility and comparability over time.
  - Standardized field handbook and coding to minimise observer variation; quality control is integral to the 1990 cycle.

- Data management and sharing
  - Created datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; datasets should be combinable with other data to maximise value beyond single-use outputs.

- Survey design and timeline
  - Two-tier, multi-year program linking top-down remote sensing with bottom-up field verification.
  - 1990 plan expands to 512 sites (an increase of 128 from prior cycles), with a two-stage sampling design to link land-cover maps with ground-truth vegetation and landscape data.
  - Previous surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) inform standard definitions, sampling units, and change detection; 1990 resurvey aims to capture ongoing countryside change and to improve baselines for modelling and evaluation.

- Planning and logistics
  - Six teams drawn from six ITE Research Stations; about 85 squares per team.
  - Each square: approximately three survey days; flexible scheduling; travel-based logistics to minimise overtime (time off in lieu for large overtime).
  - Randomized and proportional allocation of plots to reflect landscape types; clear procedures for relocating or replacing squares if permissions fail.

- Equipment and data collection tools
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, site maps, and project handouts.
  - Weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, marker plates, photography equipment, and safety gear.
  - Station-level maps and owner/tenant information for permissions and contact.

- Permissions and access
  -Permissions to access all parts of a square are essential; letters issued to landowners in advance; face-to-face confirmation on-site where possible.
  - If access is refused, predefined procedures (abandon square, or adapt survey on accessible parts) are followed to minimise wasted effort.
  - Emphasis on engaging farmers/landowners for background information and smoother data collection.

- Data recording: FAB structure
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with sampling covered comprehensively in Section 7).
  - FAB pages must be neat and complete; consistent square numbering; field notes and comments encouraged for ambiguous cases.

- Mapping and coding (6.1)
  - Large-scale mapping (6" maps at 1:10,000) with data codes to annotate features; a two-tier coding system (primary and secondary) with a preference to dominant primary codes.
  - Boundaries: clearly delineated boundaries (actual and interpreted) with a “no longer present” code for former boundaries.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) as guidance: assists feature identification and boundary updates; marks on maps are guidance and subordinate to ground truth.

- Data Recording Booklet (FAB) details (6.1.2)
  - FABs must be completed neatly; square series numbers on every page; use of pencil recommended; units separated by land-use and vegetation delineations.
  - Ownership and farmer information captured for background; dynamic ratings of owner/cooperation used for navigation and future surveys.
  - Field notes and a schematic sketch accompany FAB entries; an accompanying photographic record is required.

- Vegetation sampling and sampling framework (6.2)
  - Permanent, standardised plots and sampling to enable reliable change detection over time.
  - Permanent markers (metal plates) used to relocate plots; precise relocation is essential for long-term monitoring.
  - Permanent markers and plots are logged with distance and orientation relative to stable landscape features.

- General method for vegetation recording (6.2.2)
  - Standardized plot sizes and nested subplots:
    - Large 200 m2 quadrats with nested 4 m2 subplots.
    - Five large quadrats per square and five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats within semi-natural vegetation types.
  - Recording process includes:
    - Header: land use, physiography, slope, aspect, shading, grazing, etc.
    - Species list with presence and percent cover (5% intervals, nested quadrats recorded sequentially).
    - Sketches of plot layout and measurements; photographs to accompany plots.
  - Special attention to complex mosaics; use of dominant primary codes when multiple covers are present.

- Plot types and layout (6.2.3)
  - Quadrats
    - Five 200 m2 large quadrats positioned randomly within the square.
    - Five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats placed in distinct land-cover types not represented by large quadrats.
  - Linear plots (up to 5 per square per type)
    - Boundary (B), Hedgerow (H), Streamside (S/V), Roadside (R/V) plots.
    - Location rules emphasize proximity to the relevant feature and non-overlapping placements.
  - Special rules for relocation and prior survey squares (1978 rules) to maintain comparability.
  - Permanent marking and orientation guidelines for all plots.

- Species identification and data integrity (6.2.5)
  - Surveyors should aim for species-level records; where difficult, predefined combinations are acceptable to preserve consistency with past surveys.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are limited to a fixed list for consistency; a large list of common species is provided for identification.
  - Emphasis on avoiding over- or under-estimation of cover; maintain consistent observer practices.

- Freshwater biota sampling (7)
  - Dual sampling streams: freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP/N Newcastle University).
  - Each square yields two samples from standing waters when possible; aims to capture representative aquatic habitats (lakes, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.).
  - Samples collected with sieves, preserved in formalin, labelled with square, date, surveyor; rapid transport to Merlewood.

- Photography (8)
  - Print films used for vegetation plots; plots photographed to capture general appearance and landmark context.
  - Plot number marked on a board placed at plot edge; board positioned to cover marker plate.

- Procedures after fieldwork
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no omissions; data can be transcribed to fresh maps only in exceptional circumstances.
  - FABs and samples transported back to ITE stations promptly for processing and analysis.

- Endnotes and contacts
  - The document anchors on the Countryside Survey 1990 as revised in 1991; primary contact and station details provided for further information.
