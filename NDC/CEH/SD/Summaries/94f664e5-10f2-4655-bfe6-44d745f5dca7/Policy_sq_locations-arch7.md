# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data are publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and the anonymity of square locations, which supports sampling integrity, landowner goodwill, and ongoing environmental policy relevance.

## Partners

- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential

- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and securing landowner permission for surveys.
- Confidentiality supports the public interest by maintaining the CS program’s reliability for informing policy.

## When and how locations may be released (level of precision)

- Approximations (whether squares fall within predetermined areas such as country, county, ITE Land Class, or Environmental Zone) can be released.
- Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10x10 km grid square) may be released under licence when precise location is valuable.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only released in VERY exceptional circumstances, and only after demonstrating that external data and IP protections require such treatment. Pre-processing analysis by CEH is preferred to avoid releasing precise locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could enable square identification and are treated with the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit locations.

## Conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational duties.
- At licence end, organisations must confirm in writing that location data was secure and has been destroyed.
- Data or derived information must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases: similar licensing terms but do not require the same stringent IP protections as six-digit releases; also include a clause prohibiting attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Licensing terms and project requirements

- Licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data are issued by CEH on behalf of NERC and must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, CEH will follow Act and Regulations procedures.
- Licences include clauses reflecting confidentiality and usage restrictions.
- Four-digit releases have slightly lighter IP protection requirements compared with six-digit releases, and include explicit prohibitions on locating exact square positions.

## Responsibilities and administration

- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional-release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
- CEH will provide annual reports to CS partners with summaries of access applications and decision justifications.
- CEH aims to support reasonable pre-processing analyses within CS partnership; requests from non-partner organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as a collaborative partner or for a fee, depending on the arrangement.
