# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document outlines the development and application of the ITE Land Classification as the sampling framework for Countryside Survey field work from its inception in 1978 up to 2007.
- It explains why stratified, random sampling was chosen, how land classes were defined, and how samples were allocated to produce national and country-level habitat estimates.
- It also covers updates to the classification and sampling framework to enable Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting, plus an upland habitat module to improve precision in upland areas.

## Core concepts and purpose

- Purpose: Provide a rigorous, map-based sampling framework to survey GB countryside habitats and support national, regional, and country-specific environmental reporting.
- Stratified random sampling: To avoid bias and ensure representation across ecological variation, using the ITE Land Classification to define strata.
- Spatial units: Field sampling relies on 1 km squares, with classifications and samples distributed across the classified landscape to derive national estimates.
- Output focus: Generates spatially framed estimates of habitat areas and changes that can be mapped and analyzed in GIS.

## Timeline of Land Classification developments and sampling

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and field survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to create 32 land classes from environmental attributes.
  - Centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid (1228 squares classified); four surrounding squares allocated to classes.
  - Total classified and allocated squares: 6039 km^2; sampled 8 squares per class (256 samples).
  - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in each class × area of that class.
- 1984 – Second field survey
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total); continued use of 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
  - Classification revised to cover all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Linked with first Land Cover Map of GB; included repeat of previous quadrats and additional habitat data.
- 1998 – Revised Land Classification and fourth field survey
  - Need to report separately for Scotland led to extending classification to 40 classes.
  - 569 squares surveyed; Scotland reporting formalized; separate national results framework introduced.
- 2007 – Revised Land Classification and fifth field survey
  - Wales-only reporting requirements led to further adjustments.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England-Wales, Scotland) creating 45 strata.
  - Additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; some English classes retained smaller sample sizes.
  - Uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.

## Sampling frame and allocation details

- Land Classification as the backbone: The distribution of land classes drives sampling design and stratification.
- Sample sizes by survey year:
  - CS1978: 256 samples (8 per class, 32 classes originally).
  - CS1984: 384 samples (12 per class; 32 classes).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (All Squares classification; national estimates updated).
  - CS2000: Expanded to accommodate country-unit reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) with ~30–30+ samples per major classes and a total GB sample of 569.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused expansion and England adjustments; total GB samples increased in some classes to sustain country-specific precision.
- Sampling rate: Presented as 1:x (e.g., 1:460 for some classes in England; rates vary by class and country).
- Separate country estimates: To support England & Wales together and Scotland reporting, the framework was subdivided (country-unit versions) and, when necessary, classes aggregated within countries to maintain adequate sample sizes.

## Wales and upland and national reporting considerations

- Wales-only reporting: Implemented by subdividing land classes into Welsh-English country units, increasing Wales’ sampling emphasis and ensuring Wales-relevant habitat estimates.
- Scotland reporting: Implemented earlier by CS1990 and maintained with subsequent adjustments.
- Upland module: An extra survey component (approximately 30 squares) added in CS2000 to improve statistical precision for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Isle of Man: Previous samples replaced to maintain country-unit reporting integrity.

## Data products and interpretation for GIS use

- Land Classification maps: Revised land-class maps (Figure references in the document) show the spatial scheme used for sampling and stratification, essential for map-based data products.
- Sample distribution by class and country: Tables provide the number of squares per class, per country, and sampling rates, enabling GIS-driven estimation and visualization of habitat extents.
- National vs country estimates: The methodology emphasizes that estimates can be produced consistently across surveys, but classification changes can affect comparability; the document discusses approaches to maintain consistency.

## Key caveats and notes

- Classification evolution: Changing land classifications across surveys affects cross-survey comparability; the preferred approach is to use the latest classification for GB estimates within a survey era, while recognizing historical alignment challenges.
- Representation and precision: Some classes, especially in Wales and England, required additional sampling to ensure adequate representation and precision for country-specific reporting.
- Data interpretation: National habitat estimates rely on the combination of class areas and mean habitat areas per class, not solely on raw square counts.
