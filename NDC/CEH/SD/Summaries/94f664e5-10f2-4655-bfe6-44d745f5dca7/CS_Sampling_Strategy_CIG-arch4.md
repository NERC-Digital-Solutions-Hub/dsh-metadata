# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007 and its evolution from the ITE Land Classification developed over 30 years.
  - Emphasises a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative ecological data at national and country levels.

- Core concepts
  - Stratification to reduce bias: land is carved into discrete strata (ITE Land Classes) based on environmental attributes to ensure representative sampling.
  - Land Classification lineage: started with 32 classes (1978), expanded to 40 (1990), and to 45 with country-specific refinements (2000; Wales and Scotland reporting adjustments; 2007 updates).
  - Sampling units and rules: primary sampling units are 1 km squares; initial designs used centre squares with surrounding squares classified; sample sizes per class chosen to balance statistical reliability and practicality.
  - Time-series and comparability: national estimates can be derived using different classification schemes; notes warn that changing classifications affects consistency, with guidance on using the latest vs original schemes.

- Timeline and key developments
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification & field survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total) for vegetation and soils.
    - Central concept: stratified random sampling across land classes to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; added link to first Land Cover Map from satellite data.
    - National estimates began aligning with a more comprehensive square coverage; some squares reclassified.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th field survey)
    - Classification expanded to enable separate Scottish reporting; total classes increased to 40.
    - Results published in 2000 (CS1990-based) and later works.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Wales reporting introduced; 64 Welsh squares, new country-unit framework created (England with Wales vs Scotland).
    - Additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; separate country estimates formalised; uplands module planned.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs driven further; country-unit subdivisions expanded to five Welsh-class sub-divisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to strengthen Wales representation; adjustments in English class counts to maintain overall balance.
    - Wales continued emphasis for country-specific habitat status and policy needs.

- Country reporting, Wales, and uplands
  - Wales: Wales-focused sampling expanded for 2007; Welsh-class sub-divisions created; increased Welsh representation to support Wales-only environmental reporting.
  - England and Scotland: separate country estimates refined through class sub-division and aggregation; additional squares added to maintain precision.
  - Uplands module (CS2000): 30 extra Squares placed in upland/marginal upland land classes to improve habitat estimates where separate upland reporting is required.

- Sampling design details and outputs
  - 1 km square framework underpinning all surveys; class-based stratification drives sample allocation.
  - Tables and figures (e.g., Tables 2 and 3; Figures 4–7) document numbers of squares, strata distributions, and country-specific sampling frameworks across surveys.
  - Outputs include national habitat estimates and land-use/habitat change data; CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 reports summarise results and methodologies.

- Data governance, comparability, and notes
  - National estimates can be produced using different Land Class schemes; the 2006 scoping study cautions about consistency across surveys.
  - For consistency within an individual survey, latest classifications are preferred; for cross-survey comparability, baseline (1990) classifications may be used.
  - Documentation emphasises the need to interpret time-series data in light of classification changes and sampling-representativeness adjustments.

- Outputs and publications
  - Countryside Survey 1990: main report (CS1990, vol.2).
  - Accounting for nature: assessing habitats in the UK countryside (CS1990-derived methods).
  - Countryside Survey UK results: 2007 (CS2007) published as a UK-wide report with country-specific analyses.
