COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Overview
  - A comprehensive field-based program to update and monitor land use, vegetation, and landscape features across Britain.
  - Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/8 and 1984) and a 1988 revisiting, with enhanced data capture, standardization, and collaboration for long-term monitoring.
  - Emphasizes standardized field recording, quality control, and a consistent data lineage to support scientific evaluation of ecological systems and change over time.

- Data governance and standards (Data Stewards focus)
  - Standardization: a Field Handbook defines guidelines to minimize observer variation and ensure consistent data collection across teams and years; a central principle is reproducibility and comparability of results.
  - Documentation and provenance: data are organized into Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) that combine maps, recording forms, ownership, and habitat descriptions; every page records the square series number and location details.
  - Metadata and definitions: accompanying definitions and a defined code system (primary vs secondary codes, alpha codes) enable compact yet informative data capture; rules exist for handling ambiguous or complex classifications.
  - Data quality control: explicit emphasis on pre-survey planning, in-field coding discipline, and post-survey checks; quality control is integral to the 1990 cycle to reduce recording variance.
  - Longitudinal design and permanence: plots are permanently marked (metal plates or field-boundary references) to enable accurate relocation in future surveys; many plots are relocated or redesigned only when necessary to reflect land-use change.
  - Data lifecycle and return: FABs and samples are collected and returned to Merlewood (ITE) for processing and analysis; the workflow prioritizes timely and secure data transfer.

- Data collection framework and structure
  - Survey design:
    - 512 squares scheduled for 1990; six groups of survey teams, each handling about 85 squares.
    - Aims for balanced coverage and proportional sampling across land-cover types; new sites add 128 squares to reach 512, with a mix of revisited and newly surveyed locations.
    - Each square allocation and scheduling is managed by station coordinators to ensure flexibility, travel efficiency, and appropriate workload.
  - Core data components:
    - Mapping and recording quadrats (plots), plus sampling (vegetation, land cover, and habitat types).
    - Permanence and traceability elements (permanent markers, sketches, photographs) to support future localization.

- Data capture formats and coding (FAB)
  - Data codes:
    - A hierarchy of primary and secondary codes to annotate vegetation, land cover, boundaries, and features; alpha codes may encode multiple numeric codes to save space while preserving detail.
    - Universal coding rules include handling boundaries (e.g., 999 for no longer present), order of codes (dominant land use first), and avoiding ambiguous symbols (uppercase for alpha codes; avoid X/0 to prevent confusion).
  - Sectional structure of FABs:
    - Ownership and landowner contact details; status of permissions; farm/landowner information (owner vs tenant indicators) and cooperative potential.
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal features (inland, coastal, cliff, river, lake, ditch, bank, etc.).
    - Agriculture/Natural vegetation: cover types, species codes (with a long list of common GB species), proportions, and habitat descriptors.
    - Woodlands/forestry: woodland codes tied to the woodlands sheet, with detailed canopy, age, management, and provenance information.
    - Boundaries: description and coding of walls, fences, hedges, banks, verges, and boundary conditions (stockproof, gaps filled, laying, bracken presence, etc.).
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built-cover types for curtilages and urban-like features, plus roads, tracks, verges, and other man-made elements; color coding and descriptive notes to accompany map features.
    - X Universal codes: mapping-only codes (e.g., 888 new to map; 999 no longer on map) for standardizing map updates.
  - Vegetation sampling and plots:
    - General method: quadrats (large 200 m2 with nested smaller quadrats) and linear plots along hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, etc.
    - Quadrat setup: permanent markers adjacent to quadrats; orientation aligned to cardinal directions; nested sampling within quadrats with progressive species recording and 5% cover category estimates.
    - Plot types and relocation: rules for locating and relocating large quadrats, boundary plots, hedgerow plots, streams/river plots, roadside plots, and extra verge plots; relocation guidelines account for land-use change and maintain sampling continuity.
  - Species and bryophytes:
    - A fixed list of common GB species (plants, grasses, forbs, woody taxa, bryophytes, and lichens) enumerates preferred identifications; where necessary, combinations of close species are allowed to maintain consistency.
    - Mosses and lichens have a defined subset for recording, with a structured list to ensure comparability with past surveys.
  - Sampling and biodiversity:
    - Vegetation sampling includes both large and small quadrats, along with multiple linear plots per square to capture gradients at boundaries and linear features.
    - Freshwater biota sampling (two samples per square) and NELUP sampling are described (standing water and flowing water biota), with explicit procedures and transport in formalin-preserved bottles.
  - Photography:
    - Every vegetation plot photographed to document appearance, landmarks, and key features; plot number labeling on boards for easy field cross-referencing.

- Data quality assurance and standardization (Data Stewardship aspects)
  - Observer consistency: standardization across years and teams is reinforced via the Field Handbook, accompanying definitions, and explicit field procedures.
  - Documentation discipline: neat FABs and legible recording are emphasized to avoid data interpretation errors; field sketches and measurements accompany each entry.
  - Permanent marking and relocation: a robust system to relocate plots over time supports longitudinal analyses and change detection.

- Data lifecycle and monitoring design
  - Longitudinal monitoring: re-survey of plots and quadrats over time to quantify changes in land cover, vegetation composition, and landscape features.
  - Permanence and plate-based relocation: markers ensure repeatability across surveys; 128 newly surveyed squares complement the 384 previously sampled sites to provide broad temporal coverage.
  - Data integration goals: alignment of field data with remote sensing and land-use mapping to enable bottom-up field validation and top-down projection.

- Practical considerations and challenges (from the archetpe lens)
  - Key challenges include obtaining complete user needs, timely data access from landowners, diverse systems and formats, large data transfers, and dealing with legacy databases.
  - The program directly addresses these by enforcing standardized handbooks, explicit permissions procedures, and a formal data recording and archival process to support discoverability and reuse.

- End-to-end workflow (high-level)
  - Planning and permissions: secure access and establish local ownership/background information prior to fieldwork.
  - Field data capture: collect mapping data, quadrat and plot data, vegetation and boundary codes, ownership and farmer information, and photos; collect freshwater biota samples where applicable.
  - Post-field processing: organize FABs, transfer data and samples to ITE Merlewood, and prepare for analysis and long-term monitoring.
  - Documentation and archival: maintain a consistent data lineage, with permanent markers and clear mapping references to support future reuse and verification.
