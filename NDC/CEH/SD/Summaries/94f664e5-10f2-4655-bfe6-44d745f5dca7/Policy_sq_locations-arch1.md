# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and aim
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Objective: maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.

- Current Countryside Survey partners
  - Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
  - Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs
  - Natural England
  - Welsh Government
  - Scottish Government
  - Northern Ireland Environment Agency
  - Forestry Commission
  - Countryside Council for Wales
  - Scottish Natural Heritage

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Essential for future surveys’ scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

- When release is possible and precision levels
  - Approximated locations: four-digit grid references (10x10 km) released under licence.
  - Precisely identifying six-digit grid references: allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH conducts pre-processing to avoid release if possible.
  - Spatial data inside survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated as equivalent to location data and subject to same exceptional-release terms.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, secure storage, and restricted access to named individuals.
  - Licences are finite-term and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to plan visits, identify landowners, or verify landowner compliance.
  - If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equal to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have fewer IP-protection requirements than six-digit releases; even then, restrictions apply to prevent identifying exact square locations.

- Licensing and governance
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior authorised official from the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, actions follow Act and Regulations.
  - CEH will provide an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.

- Operational considerations and guidance
  - CEH aims to support pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe for CS partners; case-by-case for other organisations.
  - Partners and potential users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data.
  - CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - You can access approximate (four-digit) location information under licence for eligible projects.
  - Access to precise (six-digit) locations requires exceptional justification and CEH pre-processing.
  - Any data use must respect confidentiality, avoid revealing precise square locations, and adhere to licensing terms and destruction requirements at project end.
