Countryside Survey 1990

- Purpose and context
  - Aims to update rural land-use and ecological datasets and monitor changes over time; integrates ground-truth field data with aerial/remote-sensing approaches.
  - Builds on earlier ITE land classification surveys (1977/8 and 1984) and prepares a resurvey in 1990 to link top-down and ground-truth data, enabling pattern detection and trend analysis.
  - Emphasizes standardised, comparable field recording across observers to minimise variability and support scientific evaluation.

- Study design and sampling
  - 512 squares are surveyed in 1990, grouped into six station-based teams; each square averages three survey days.
  - 128 new squares introduced; 128 previously surveyed squares re-recorded to enable change detection.
  - A two-tier data collection approach: broad mapping/recording (FAB) plus vegetation sampling; permanent plot markers facilitate future relocations.

- Data collection and recording structure
  - Three core elements: mapping (spatial annotation on 1:10,000 maps), recording quadrats (vegetation), and sampling (vegetation, soils, etc.); a separate sampling chapter covers freshwater biota.
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) consolidate data for each square, including ownership, physiography, land use, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and other features.
  - Data are coded using a comprehensive system of primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, boundaries, vegetation, habitats, and man-made features; codes support compact map annotation and detailed attribute capture.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) supplements field data, marking boundaries, isolated features, and potential no-longer-present elements; API guidance is used when ground evidence conflicts.

- Data schema and coding framework
  - Codes cover a wide range of themes: Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural vegetation, Boundaries, Buildings/Structures/Communications, and Universal codes.
  - Vegetation data include cover types, species (with a core list of ~200 common species), and, where necessary, species combinations due to identification challenges; bryophytes and lichens are captured from a restricted list.
  - Notable mapping conventions:
    - Primary vs secondary codes; use dominant or most representative codes first.
    - Boundaries include fences, walls, hedges, and other feature types; “no longer present” boundaries are coded 999.
    - Minimum mappable units and lengths define what is recorded; certain features (e.g., bracken) have separate handling.
  - Woodland and trees are described using woodland-specific codes; age, canopy cover, and condition are captured with appropriate qualifiers; dual-use (e.g., trees within fields) is recorded as separate blocks.
  - Buildings, curtilages, verges, tracks, and roads are coded with a mix of built-environment and land-use categories; colour coding is provided for complex built-up areas.

- Vegetation sampling (6.2)
  - Quadrats and plots:
    - Large 200 m2 quadrats (valley plots): nested 4 m2 quadrats to capture ground cover; five additional nested plots progressively examine smaller areas; permanent markers facilitate relocation in future surveys.
    - Five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in diverse land-cover types per square.
  - Plot layout and relocation:
    - Quadrats are positioned to reflect habitat “center of gravity” and avoid bias; relocation rules apply when land use changes or plots are displaced.
    - In linear features (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides), up to five linear plots per type are recorded with precise placement relative to feature center.
  - Laying out and recording:
    - Each plot is mapped with nested quadrats and species recorded in a standardized fashion; cover is estimated in 5% bands; a sketch and measurements accompany each recording.
    - Permanent marks (metal plates) identify quadrats; if placement cannot be near the plot, nearby landmarks or field boundaries are used and documented.
  - Species data and identification rules:
    - A core list of ~200 plant species is used; where identification is difficult, acceptable species combinations are allowed to preserve consistency across surveys.
    - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list with fixed codes; unlisted species can be added with notes.
  - Plot types and relocation rules:
    - Quadrats: 5 x 200 m2 large quadrats; 5 x 4 m2 quadrats in semi-natural vegetation.
    - Linear plots: boundary, hedgerow, streamsides, and roadsides; five plots per type where feasible.
    - 1978 rules for locating linear plots are used or updated as needed; plots are relocated to reflect landscape changes while preserving categorization.

- Freshwater sampling (7)
  - Two freshwater biota sampling programs per square:
    - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) per a separate handbook.
    - Freshwater biota from standing water (NELUP) focusing on water beetles; two samples per square from vegetated standing waters where possible.
  - Sampling points are mapped on the same FAB/maps; samples are collected with a sieve, preserved with formalin, labeled, and transported to Merlewood.

- Photography and documentation
  - Print photography documents vegetation plots, landmarks, and map features; plot numbers are clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge to aid relocation.

- Permissions, logistics, and field operations
  - Permissions from landowners/farmers are sought well in advance; if access is denied, fieldwork may be aborted or adapted per guidelines.
  - Equipment and responsibilities:
    - FABs, aerial photographs, maps, weatherproof clipboards, marker plates, sampling gear, and field identification resources are organized across Merlewood and local ITE stations.
  - Planning and flexibility:
    - Travel time, days away, and scheduling are managed to optimize time and cost; no overtime pay is provided at first, with time-off-in-lieu for extensive overtime.

- Procedures after survey and data handling
  - Daily review of FABs to ensure complete coverage; post-survey data transfer to ITE stations is planned promptly.
  - Emphasis on data standardization, consistent metadata, and the ability to relocate fixed plots in future resurvey cycles.

- Data leadership implications and takeaways
  - The survey defines a robust, standards-driven approach to large-scale environmental data collection, emphasizing:
    - Consistent, repeatable data capture across observers.
    - A comprehensive coding framework enabling rich, multi-layered data products (maps, FABs, biodiversity lists, and habitat descriptions).
    - Clear data governance practices around permissions, ownership, and data sharing with stakeholders (including farmers and partners).
    - Built-in capabilities for long-term monitoring and trend analysis through permanent markers, relocation rules, and standardized methods.
  - For data leaders, this work demonstrates how to design, document, and manage large ecological datasets that support cross-agency collaboration, integration with remote sensing, and iterative product development while maintaining data quality and reproducibility.
