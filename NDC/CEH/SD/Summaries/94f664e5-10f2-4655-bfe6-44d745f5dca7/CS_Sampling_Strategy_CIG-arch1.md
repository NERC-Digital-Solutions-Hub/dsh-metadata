# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The aim is to describe the field survey sampling framework used in Countryside Survey up to 2007, showing how the ITE Land Classification has evolved to stratify sampling and enable national and country-level estimates.
- Core idea: use stratified random sampling based on an environmental Land Classification to ensure samples represent the whole GB countryside and its variation.

## Key concepts and foundations

- Stratified sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation (multi-factor strata beyond simple altitude or terrain).
- ITE Land Classification developed from Quadrat-based vegetation work to classify land areas by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and later to 1 km square units for national sampling.
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares across GB, with a central square selected for initial classification and surrounding squares included for each classified unit.

## Development and progression of the ITE Land Classification

- Early work (1970s): 1 km square classification developed from environmental attributes using multivariate analysis (Indicator Species Analysis) on a limited dataset.
- 1978 (first Countryside Survey): 32 land classes created from central squares; 4 surrounding squares per classified square added; total ~6,039 km^2 represented; eight samples per class (256 total) for national estimates.
- 1984: second field survey expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) to refine national estimates; results published using the 1978 classification.
- 1990: Land Classification revised to incorporate all GB squares (all-squares classification); 508 squares surveyed; added land cover mapping; results published for CS1990; national estimates still linked to the 1990 framework.
- 1998–2000: Regional and country-level needs led to a revised Land Classification with 40 classes to improve regional estimates and support Scotland-only reporting.
- 2000 CS: Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); sub-division and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata; extra squares added to ensure representation; upland habitat sampling introduced.
- 2007 CS: Wales-only reporting required; new country-unit classes created (five new Welsh/England subdivisions); total of 45 strata; additional Welsh squares added to ensure six per Welsh class; some English classes reduced in square count but still adequate; overall revised maps and sampling framework published.

## Country-specific adjustments and upland emphasis

- Separate country estimates: adjustments to allow reporting by England with Wales and Scotland, with class sub-divisions and aggregations to maintain representation within each country unit.
- Wales-focused refinement: sub-divisions for Wales (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and additional Welsh squares to improve precision for Wales-only reporting.
- Uplands module (CS2000 onward): 30 additional squares placed in upland/marginal upland land classes to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.

## Sampling framework and outputs

- Table-like summaries (CS2000 and CS2007) show:
  - Number of squares by Land Class (grouped into 1e, 2e, 3e, etc.).
  - Strata-area totals and the number of sample squares per survey (1990 vs 2000; 2000 vs 2007).
  - Sampling rates (1:x) reflecting how many GB squares are represented by each sample square within each class and country unit.
- Maps referenced (Figures 4–7) illustrate revised Land Class maps and sample square distributions for England with Wales and Scotland, and for the overall Countryside Survey sampling framework.
- National estimates: calculated as the mean area of habitat per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land-class area; later cross-validated or adjusted when classifications changed.

## Note on consistency and national estimates

- A 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the Land Classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey consistency.
- For a given survey, it is preferred to use the latest country-specific classification to maintain internal consistency, even though cross-survey comparability might favor using the original classification; table 4 presents counts under the original (1990) Land Classification for comparison.
