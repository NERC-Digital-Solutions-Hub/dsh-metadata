# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions for surveys.
- Public-interest justification; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Location data can be released to help identify if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references require CEH pre-processing analysis to avoid unnecessary release; exceptional access may be granted under licence if IP/confidentiality requirements exceed CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite for specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties after expiry.
- End-of-licence destruction confirmation required in writing.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; no use to plan landowner visits or verify compliance.
- Where requested, licensees may need to provide evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- Release terms prohibit attempts to derive precise locations or misrepresent the data’s intended use.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with agreed clauses; licences signed by an authorised senior official.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for CS partner use; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy; CEH may assist as a scientific lead in defined requirements or collaborative efforts, with negotiation on involvement and payment.
