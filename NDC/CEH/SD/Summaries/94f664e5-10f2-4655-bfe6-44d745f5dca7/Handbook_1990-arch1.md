# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Aim and Context
- Monitor changes in the rural environment to update land use databases and support ecological understanding.
- Build on the ITE Land Classification System and earlier surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) to enable trend analysis and bottom-up field data linked to top-down remote sensing.
- Implement a two-tier approach: ground-truth field survey plus satellite imagery to produce a land cover map and track patterns over time.
- Emphasize data quality, standardisation, and making datasets discoverable with metadata.

## Study Design and Sampling
- Sample framework: 512 sites (squares) divided into six groups, each surveyed by teams from six ITE Research Stations.
- Each square typically yields about three days of work; travel planning prioritises efficiency (no mandatory overtime; time off in lieu for large overtime).
- 1990 survey scales: 128 new squares; 128 previously surveyed squares relocated or re-surveyed; total 512 squares to be revisited.
- Data collection aims to capture land cover, landscape features, and vegetation with an emphasis on comparability across years.

## Equipment and Field Setup
- Core equipment provided by Merlewood: FAB field assessment booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, project handouts, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear, measuring tools, navigation aids, and surveyor identity.
- Local ITE Station contributions: location maps, basic tools, camera and lenses, first-aid, personal gear.
- Field procedures require careful marking, mapping, and documentation to ensure future relocation of plots.

## Permissions and Access
- Permissions are crucial for full-square coverage and respectful farmer/landowner engagement.
- Pre-survey letters then on-site verification of access; maintain courtesy and gather background information.
- If permission is refused for any part of a square, predefined contingency rules apply (replacement square, partial survey, or abandonment with reporting).

## Data Recording and FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
- The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling is covered in Section 7.
- FABs integrate map data with field observations; they must be completed neatly to avoid data loss in analysis.
- Each FAB includes ownership details, farmer information, physiography, land use, and a page-by-page structure guiding data entry and interpretation.
- The FAB supports multi-layer coding to describe features (primary codes and secondary codes) and mandates a logical ordering of codes (e.g., a boundary type followed by its attributes).

## Mapping and Coding System
- Mapping is the most geographically comprehensive element, using enlarged maps (6") with a structured box of codes to annotate features.
- Codes are primarily numeric with supporting alpha codes to compress data on maps (e.g., boundary types, land uses, vegetation types).
- Two code types: primary (essential) and secondary (supplementary). Every feature must have at least one primary code; avoid excessive primary codes unless necessary.
- Boundaries: clearly mark actual versus interpreted boundaries; note any boundaries that no longer exist (code 999).
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API): optional, guidance-only marks to aid boundary and feature identification; conflicts with ground data take precedence.
- Universal codes exist to map areas not present or no longer present on maps (888 to 999).

## Vegetation Data Recording (6.2)
- Vegetation is recorded using standardized plots with a clear hierarchy of plot types and sizes:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m2 (5 x 200 m2 nested quadrats) for detailed vegetation data.
  - Small quadrats: 5 x 2 m2 inside semi-natural vegetation for finer resolution.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (1 m wide bands).
- Plot placement aims to minimize bias and reflect habitat diversity; permanent markers (metal plates) are used to enable accurate relocation.
- Data collection includes a full species list (with common, repeatable combinations where species are hard to distinguish), cover percentages in 5% increments, and notes for unusual or ambiguous cases.
- Aerial photography and field sketches support location and measurement accuracy; everyone records observations for traceability and future re-surveys.
- Permanently mark quadrats and linear plots; document distances, bearings, and notable landscape features for relocalization.

## Plot Types and Relocation Rules
- Quadrats: large (200 m2) and small (2 m x 2 m) with nested sub-quadrats for comprehensive composition.
- Linear plots: hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides, with strict relocation rules when plots were previously mapped (1978/1984) and when land-use changes occur.
- Relocation involves using boundaries, hedgerows, banks, or nearby landmarks to locate the original plot precisely; if a square no longer supports a plot, choose a nearby permissible location following predefined guidelines.

## 6.2.5 Species Identification Guidelines
- Field surveyors aim to identify species to the species level where possible, but defined acceptable combinations exist for particularly difficult taxa to maintain consistency with earlier surveys.
- A curated list of common species and combinations helps ensure comparability across years and sites.

## Freshwater and Sampling (Section 7)
- Two freshwater biota sampling streams from each square:
  - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sampling) following a separate handbook.
  - NELUP sampling: freshwater biota (primarily water beetles) from standing waters.
- Sampling targets reflect the main habitat types within each square: lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, flushes (calcareous/acidic), sphagnum bogs, and wet depressions.
- Each square records two standing-water samples, with careful labeling and preservation (formalin) for transport to Merlewood.

## Photography
- Print films capture vegetation plots to document appearance and key landscape features.
- Plot numbers are clearly marked on a board placed at plot edges to aid later interpretation.

## Procedures Subsequent to Surveys
- End-of-day data review to ensure no features are omitted; avoid re-transcription unless map/data damage requires it.
- FABs and samples are transported to ITE Stations promptly for processing.

## Data Quality, Access, and Metadata
- Emphasis on standardization of field recording to reduce observer bias and ensure statistical reliability of change data.
- Quality control measures implemented during the 1990 survey; clear documentation and accompanying definitions to support reproducibility.
- Data sources, methods, and metadata are prepared to support discoverability and reuse in future analyses.
