# Simulated winter wheat and maize above-ground dry matter, soil organic matter and soil water at a site near Changwu, China, 19832015 and future climate scenarios to 2049

## Overview
- Model-generated dataset using the SPACSYS model at a historic site on the Loess Plateau, Changwu, China (35.52°N, 107.68°E).
- Observed crop yields for validation: winter wheat (1993–2004) and maize (1983–2015).
- After validation, the model was run for 2015–2049 under future climate scenarios to predict daily:
  - Above-ground dry matter (leaves, stems, grains)
  - Daily soil water content in multiple soil layers
  - Soil organic carbon stocks in topsoil and subsoil
- Management assumptions: ploughing before wheat in September, before maize in April; fertiliser N rate of 20.7 g N/m2 for wheat and 14.7 g N/m2 for maize (urea assumed).
- Outputs are supplied as 248 CSV files, each named with a consistent pattern.

## Data Structure and File Naming
- File naming pattern: crop name + 'sim' + weather data name + variable name
  - Crop: wheat or maize
  - Weather data name: historic or a named future SSP-RCP scenario
  - Variable name: Yield, DM (dry matter), SW (soil water), or SOM (soil organic carbon stocks)
- Example: wheatsimhistoricDM.csv (winter wheat daily above-ground DM under historic weather)
- File types and contents:
  - *Yield.csv*: harvest date and grain yield (dry, g/m2)
  - *DM.csv*: date; leaf_DM, stem_DM, grain_DM (daily DM accumulations, g/m2)
  - *SW.csv*: date; multiple columns 0_10_cm, 10_20_cm, 20_40_cm, 40_60_cm, 60_80_cm, 80_100_cm, 100_140_cm, 140_180_cm, 180_220_cm, 220_260_cm? (proportion of soil water content per layer; layer thicknesses shown in headings)
  - *SOM.csv*: date; 0_40_cm and 40_100_cm (daily soil organic carbon stocks, g C/m2)
- Six SSP-RCP future scenarios used: SSP119, SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, SSP434, SSP585
- For each scenario, five ensemble members: r1i1p1f1, r2i1p1f1, r3i1p1f1, r4i1p1f1, r8i1p1f1

## Variables and Measurements
- Yield: grain yield (dry) in g/m2
- DM: daily dry matter accumulation
  - leaf_DM, stem_DM, grain_DM (g/m2)
- SW: daily soil water content by depth interval (layer-specific proportions)
- SOM: daily soil organic carbon stocks by depth interval (0–40 cm; 40–100 cm)

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Site location: Loess Plateau, China
- Time frame:
  - Validation uses observed yields from 1983–2015 (maize) and 1993–2004 (wheat)
  - Simulations cover 2015–2049 under multiple climate scenarios
- Management details embedded in simulations: ploughing timing (wheat September; maize April) and fertiliser application rate and form (urea)

## Data Quality, Provenance, and Access
- Validation: model-lifted to historic data prior to projecting future scenarios
- Reference for model: SPACSYS model description (Wu et al., 2007)
- Output provenance: 248 CSV files generated by researchers (K. Gongadze and H. Yang)
- Notes for data users: dataset is model-generated with explicit management assumptions and climate scenario inputs; consider limitations of model-based projections and scenario uncertainty

## How Data Supports Analysis and Data Products
- Suitable for creating self-serve dashboards comparing:
  - Yield, DM by crop and scenario
  - Soil water dynamics across soil depths
  - Soil organic carbon stock changes over time
- Potential data products:
  - Scenario comparison matrices (wheat vs maize)
  - Temporal trend visualizations of DM and soil moisture
  - Layer-by-layer soil water and SOM heatmaps
- Data integration opportunities:
  - Merge files by crop, scenario, and ensemble member for comprehensive comparisons
  - Aggregate daily data to seasonal or annual summaries for policy or planning contexts

## Considerations for Use
- This is a model-based dataset; results depend on SPACSYS structure and assumed management (ploughing dates, fertiliser form/rates)
- Climate scenarios involve inherent uncertainties; interpret differences across SSP-RCPs and ensemble members with caution
- Ensure proper handling of date formats and depth-layer labeling when merging across files
