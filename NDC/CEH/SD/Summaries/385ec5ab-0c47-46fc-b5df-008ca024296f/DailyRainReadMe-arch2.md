# Dailyrain.csv

## Overview
- Daily rainfall data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes conducted in 2016.
- Weather data collected from a meteorological station at the sites (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK) using a tipping bucket rain gauge.

## Data Content
- Includes daily rainfall totals (mm) corresponding to:
  - 1) spring semi-improved site
  - 2) summer semi-improved site
  - 3) autumn semi-improved site
  - 4) autumn improved site

## Data Structure
- Headers:
  - Site: Semi-Improved or Improved pasture
  - Season: spring, summer, or autumn (for semi-improved) or autumn (for the improved site)
  - Date: dd/mm/yyyy
  - Rainfall: daily rainfall totals (mm)
- File name: Dailyrain.csv

## Data quality, standards, and usage
- Data described with standardized headers and units (mm of rainfall).
- Data should be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as needed before analysis.
- Outputs are typically presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.
- Reuse note: If data are reused, ensure full citation.

## Usage and citations
- Designed for monitoring environmental conditions and supporting analysis of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Useful for integrating rainfall data with other environmental datasets or N2O-related studies in upland environments.

## Notes
- Instrument: tipping bucket rain gauge
- Data headers specify units and formatting to support consistent analysis
- The dataset emphasizes standardization and accessibility for broader use and verification.
