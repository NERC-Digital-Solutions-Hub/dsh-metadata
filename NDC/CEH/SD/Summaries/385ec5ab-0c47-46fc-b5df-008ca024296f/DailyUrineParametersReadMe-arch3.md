- Data processing and filtering
  - Observations with zero urination events were excluded.
  - Two replicate sheep were removed due to infrequent urine events (sheep 1 and 5).

- Calculations and assumptions
  - For daily N excretion, daily volume, and daily frequency, calculations assume the time spent in the urine collection apparatus represents a 24-hour period.
  - Time spent in collection apparatus is typically between 10:00 and 16:00.

- Data fields (headers)
  - Site: Semi-improved or improved pasture
  - Season: Season of collection (spring, summer, or autumn at the semi-improved site; autumn at the improved site)
  - Sheep_ID: Identifier for the replicate sheep
  - Date: Date of urine collection (dd/mm/yyyy)
  - DailyNExcretion: Calculated daily nitrogen excretion based on time spent in the collection apparatus
  - DailyVol: Estimated daily urine volume (liters per sheep per day) based on time spent in the collection apparatus
  - DailyFrequency: Estimated frequency of urine events (urine events per sheep per day) based on time spent in the collection apparatus
