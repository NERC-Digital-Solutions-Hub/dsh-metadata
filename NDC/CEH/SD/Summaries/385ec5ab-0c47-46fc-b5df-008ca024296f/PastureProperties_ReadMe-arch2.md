# PastureProperties.csv

## Overview
- Data describe the properties of pasture fed to Welsh Mountain ewes during urine collection experiments.
- Two study sites at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales:
  - Semi-improved upland pasture (270 m a.s.l.) with NVC classifications U4 and MG6.
  - Lowland improved Lolium multiflorum pasture.
- Urine collection trials conducted in 2016:
  - Semi-improved site: spring, summer, and autumn.
  - Improved site: autumn.
- Forage samples (n = 4) were collected per season per site and analyzed for comprehensive nutritional content.

## Data collection and analyses
- Primary measurements:
  - Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content (via TruSpec Analyzer).
- Additional nutritional analyses (Sciantec Analytical):
  - Crude protein, neutral detergent fibre (NDF), sugar, ash, metabolizable energy (ME), digestible organic matter (D), acid detergent fibre (ADF), oil by acid hydrolysis (OAH), and neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (NCGD).

## Data headers / schema
- Season: spring, summer, or autumn (per site).
- Site: semi-improved or improved pasture.
- N: pasture nitrogen content (% of dry weight).
- CN: pasture carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
- Protein: crude protein content (g kg-1 pasture dry weight).
- NDF: neutral detergent fibre (g kg-1 pasture).
- Sugar: sugar content (g kg-1 pasture).
- Ash: ash content (g kg-1 pasture).
- ME: metabolizable energy (MJ kg-1 pasture).
- NCGD: neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (g kg-1 pasture).
- D: digestible organic matter (%).
- ADF: acid detergent fibre (g kg-1 pasture).
- OAH: oil by acid hydrolysis (g kg-1 pasture).

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized pasture properties linked to nitrogen cycling, enabling assessment of potential N2O emissions and overall environmental health across upland and lowland systems.
- Supports cross-site comparisons and seasonal analyses for monitoring environmental performance.

## Limitations and considerations
- Limited to two sites and 2016 data; sample size per season per site is small (n=4 forage samples).
- Caution when generalizing beyond the studied sites and time frame.
