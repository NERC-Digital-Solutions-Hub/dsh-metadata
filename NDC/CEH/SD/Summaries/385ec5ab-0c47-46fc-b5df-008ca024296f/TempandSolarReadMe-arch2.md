# TempandSolar.csv

## Overview
- Temperature (AirTemp in °C) and solar radiation (SolarRadiation in W/m²) data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes conducted in 2016.
- Trials/sites: spring semi-improved, summer semi-improved, autumn semi-improved, and autumn improved.
- Weather data sourced from a meteorological station at the sites (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK).
