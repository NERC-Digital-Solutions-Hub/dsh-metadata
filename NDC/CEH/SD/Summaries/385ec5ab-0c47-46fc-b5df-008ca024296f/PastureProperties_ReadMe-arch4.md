# PastureProperties.csv

## Overview
- Data describe the properties of pasture fed to Welsh Mountain ewes during urine collection experiments.
- Two study sites at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (coordinates provided).
- The dataset supports understanding forage quality and composition in relation to the urine collection studies.

## Study design and sites
- Site 1: Semi-improved upland grassland (270 m a.s.l.), NVC classifications U4 and MG6.
- Site 2: Lowland improved pasture (Lolium multiflorum).
- Sampling periods: Spring, Summer, and Autumn 2016 at the semi-improved site; Autumn 2016 at the improved site.
- Forage samples: n = 4 per season per site.

## Data fields and units
- Season: Spring, Summer, or Autumn (season of forage collection).
- Site: Semi-improved or Improved pasture.
- N: Pasture nitrogen content (% of dry weight).
- CN: C:N ratio of the pasture.
- Protein: Crude protein content (g kg-1 pasture dry weight).
- NDF: Neutral detergent fibre content (g kg-1 pasture).
- Sugar: Sugar content (g kg-1 pasture).
- Ash: Ash content (g kg-1 pasture).
- ME: Metabolizable energy (MJ kg-1 pasture).
- NCGD: Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (g kg-1 pasture).
- D: Digestible organic matter (%).
- ADF: Acid detergent fibre (g kg-1 pasture).
- OAH: Oil by acid hydrolysis (g kg-1 pasture).

## Data collection and analysis methods
- Total carbon and nitrogen content analyzed via TruSpec® Analyzer (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI).
- Nutritional analyses (crude protein, NDF, sugar, ash, ME, D, ADF, OAH, NCGD) conducted by Sciantec Analytical (Cawood Scientific Ltd., North Yorkshire, UK).
