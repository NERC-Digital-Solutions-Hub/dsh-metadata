# UnknownsUplandLowlandMetabolomics.csv

## Overview
- Metabolomics dataset of sheep urine collected in autumn from two pasture types: semi-improved and improved (n = 4 per site).
- Samples processed by syringe filtering (<0.2 μm), flash-frozen, stored at -80 °C, then shipped on dry ice to UC Davis for untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Analysis performed with ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel) to obtain peak intensity values for all identified compounds.
- Data includes headers for Sample (sheep ID and collection site), Season (site), and numeric identity values for unidentified compounds with corresponding peak intensities.

## Data content and structure
- Data consists of peak intensity values from untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Headers include:
  - Sample: sheep ID + site of urine collection
  - Season: site of collection (semi-improved or improved pasture)
  - Numeric headers: unidentified compound IDs with their peak intensities as values
- Blank correction performed using procedural blanks of ultrapure water.
- Samples stored at -80 °C prior to shipment.

## Methods
- Sample collection: autumn, from sheep at semi-improved and improved pastures.
- Processing: syringe filtration ( < 0.2 μm ) and flash freezing; blanks analyzed and corrected.
- Analysis: untargeted primary metabolism profiling via GC-TOF-MS (ALEX-CIS) at UC Davis.

## Metadata and provenance
- Project: Uplands-N2O

- Data description emphasizes citation if data are reused.

## Quality, limitations, and considerations
- Small sample size per site (n = 4) may limit statistical power and generalizability.
- Untargeted approach yields many unidentified compounds (numerical IDs); only peak intensities are provided, with identification status not fully described.
- Data provenance and processing steps are documented, but detailed metadata (e.g., animal IDs, exact collection times, site characteristics) are not specified.

## Access, reuse, and governance
- When reused, datasets must be fully cited with the authors and project information.
- No explicit licensing mentioned; attribution and provenance guidance provided.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Data as a usable asset for cross-site metabolomics and environmental/management studies related to N2O.
- Opportunities to integrate with broader data ecosystems (e.g., animal, pasture, and metabolomics datasets) to support comprehensive data strategies.
- Key actions to maximize value:
  - Enhance metadata coverage (collection times, site specifics, animal-level data, sample handling details).
  - Improve data standardization for interoperability (clear status of identified vs unidentified compounds).
  - Establish data quality checks and documentation to facilitate reuse and discovery.
  - Ensure discoverability and proper citation pathways in data catalogs, with clear provenance and licensing information.
