- Data description: Metabolomics of sheep urine data. Metabolomic profiles determined from syringe-filtered (<0.2 μm) and flash-frozen urine samples from sheep collected in spring (n=5) and summer (n=5) on a semi-improved site.
- Quality control: Procedural blanks of ultra-pure water were syringe-filtered and used for blank correction.
- Storage and transport: Samples stored at -80 °C before shipment on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center (UC Davis) for analysis.
- Analytical method: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis via ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD).
- Data content: Peak intensity values for all identified compounds from the untargeted analysis.
- Data structure: Headers include:
  - Sample: indicates season and sheep ID
  - Season: spring or summer 2016
  - Other headers: identified compounds with corresponding peak intensity values
- Data use notes: If reused, data must be fully cited.
- Intended for: Providing a standardized metabolomics data output to support environmental monitoring and related analyses.
