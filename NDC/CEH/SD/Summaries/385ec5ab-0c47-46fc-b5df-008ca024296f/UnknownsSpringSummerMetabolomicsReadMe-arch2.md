UnknownsSpringSummerMetabolomics.csv

## Overview
- Metabolomics dataset derived from sheep urine at a uplands site, focusing on spring vs summer 2016.
- Sample size: 5 sheep per season (n = 5 spring, n = 5 summer).
- Untargeted primary metabolism analysis performed on the urine samples.

## Data collection and processing
- Sample handling: urine was syringe filtered (< 0.2 μm) and flash frozen.
- Procedural blanks: ultra-pure water blanks were filtered and used for blank correction.
- Storage: samples stored at -80 °C before shipment.
- Analysis: shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis.
- Instrumentation: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD) for untargeted analysis.

## Data contents and structure
- Data type: peak intensity values for unidentified compounds from untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Key headers:
  - Sample: encodes season and sheep ID.
  - Season: spring or summer 2016.
  - Other headers: numerical identifiers for unidentified compounds with corresponding peak intensities.

## Data quality and provenance
- Blanks used for correction; data described as blank-corrected.
- Procedures and storage described to support reproducibility and quality assurance.

## Data use and alignment with monitoring goals
- Provides standardized metabolomics data that can be used to compare environmental-related metabolic signals across seasons.
- Data can be analyzed to identify seasonal differences in unidentified metabolites and potentially integrated with other environmental datasets.
- Facilitates data reuse with clear citation requirements if shared or repurposed.

## Considerations for analysts monitoring the environment
- Focus on verifying data quality, normalization, and potential cross-sample comparisons between spring and summer.
- Potential outputs include statistical comparisons, visualizations (e.g., heatmaps, seasonal profiles) of unidentified metabolite intensities.
