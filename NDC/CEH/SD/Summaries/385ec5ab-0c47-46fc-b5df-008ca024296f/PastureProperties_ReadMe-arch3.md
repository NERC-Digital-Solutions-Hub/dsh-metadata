# PastureProperties.csv

## Purpose and scope
- Data describe properties of pasture fed to Welsh Mountain ewes during urine collection experiments.
- Aims align with evaluating environmental and nutritional factors related to pasture, extrapolated to inform monitoring of grazing systems.

## Study design and site details
- Project: Uplands-N2O, grant NE/M015351/1.
- Study sites: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13′N, 4°0′W).
  - Semi-improved upland grassland (270 m above sea level) comprising NVC classes U4 and MG6.
  - Lowland improved pasture (Lolium multiflorum) at <100 m elevation.
- Sampling periods: Spring, Summer, Autumn 2016 at semi-improved site; Autumn 2016 at the improved site.
- Forage sampling: four samples per season/site.

## Measured variables and methods
- Analytical approach: Total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content measured with TruSpec analyzer (Leco Corp.).
- Nutritional analyses performed by Sciantec Analytical (Cawood Scientific Ltd.):
  - Crude protein
  - Neutral detergent fibre (NDF)
  - Sugar
  - Ash
  - Metabolizable energy (ME)
  - Digestible organic matter (D)
  - Acid detergent fibre (ADF)
  - Oil by acid hydrolysis (OAH)
  - Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (NCGD)
- Data headers and meanings:
  - Season: Spring, Summer, or Autumn.
  - Site: Semi-improved or Improved pasture.
  - N: Pasture nitrogen content (% dry weight).
  - CN: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio.
  - Protein: Crude protein content (g per kg pasture dry weight).
  - NDF: Neutral detergent fibre (g kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - Sugar: Sugar content (g kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - Ash: Ash content (g kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - ME: Metabolizable energy (MJ kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - NCGD: Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (g kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - D: Digestible organic matter (%).
  - ADF: Acid detergent fibre (g kg⁻¹ pasture).
  - OAH: Oil by acid hydrolysis (g kg⁻¹ pasture).

## Data provenance and metadata
- Clear documentation of sites, sampling periods, and analytical providers.
- Explicit definitions for all data headers to support data quality checks and interoperability.

## Data sharing, reuse and governance
- Data usage note: If data are reused, ensure full citation.
- Context implies emphasis on data quality, open sharing of underlying data where possible, and provenance from originators.
