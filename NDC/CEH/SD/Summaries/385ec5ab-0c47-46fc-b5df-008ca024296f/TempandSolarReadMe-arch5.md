# TempandSolar.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of temperature and solar radiation data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes conducted in 2016 under the Uplands-N2O project (Grant NE/M015351/1).
- Trials/sites are: spring semi-improved, summer semi-improved, autumn semi-improved, and autumn improved.
- Weather data collected from a meteorological station at each site (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Recording intervals: generally half-hourly; autumn improved site data recorded hourly.

## Data Content and Structure
- Variables:
  - TimeDate: date and time in dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm format.
  - SolarRadiation: incoming solar radiation in W m-2.
  - AirTemp: air temperature in degrees Celsius.
  - Site: semi-improved or improved (as applicable to each trial).
  - Season: spring, summer, or autumn (as applicable to each site).
- File: TempandSolar.csv.
- Data describe measurements used for analyzing temperature and solar inputs during the trials.

## Metadata, Standards, and Documentation
- Units specified: SolarRadiation in W/m^2; AirTemp in °C; TimeDate in dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm.
- Time zone not specified—needs clarification for precise temporal alignment across sites.
- Data description provides key fields and measurement intervals; additional metadata (sensor types, data quality checks, missing value handling) is not detailed and may require supplementation.

## Data Quality and Stewardship Considerations
- Data collection intervals vary by site (half-hourly generally; hourly for autumn improved), which should be harmonized or documented for cross-site analyses.
- Potential data quality issues to address (not specified in the document): missing values, outliers, time alignment, and metadata completeness (e.g., station identifiers, sensor calibration).
- Documentation should capture data governance aspects: data ownership (authors and project), versioning, and any embargo or access restrictions.

## Access, Sharing, and Reuse
- Data should be uploaded to appropriate data portals and catalogued for discoverability.
- Ensure clear licensing/status for sharing; maintain the ability to update datasets and communicate any limitations on data sharing.

## Governance and Responsibilities
- Primary responsibility lies with the authors and project team for data provision, metadata completeness, and updates.
- Maintain provenance records, ensure reproducibility, and provide proper citations in any reuse.
- Align with broader data stewardship needs to support discoverability, standardization, and interoperability across datasets from large collections.
