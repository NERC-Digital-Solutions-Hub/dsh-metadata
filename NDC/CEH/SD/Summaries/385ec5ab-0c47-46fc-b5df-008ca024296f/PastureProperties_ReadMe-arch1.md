## Study location and design
- Sites: Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13′N, 4°0′W)
  - Site 1: Semi-improved upland grassland (270 m above sea level), National Vegetation Classification (NVC): U4 and MG6
  - Site 2: Lowland improved pasture (Lolium multiflorum), <100 m a.s.l.
- Sampling period
  - Semi-improved site: spring, summer, and autumn 2016
  - Improved site: autumn 2016
- Subjects: Pasture fed to Welsh Mountain ewes during urine collection experiments
- Sample collection: forage samples (n = 4) per season per site

## Data collection and analysis
- Primary measurements
  - Forage samples analyzed for total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content (via TruSpec Analyzer, Leco Corp.)
  - Nutritional analyses conducted by Sciantec Analytical (Cawood Scientific Ltd.)
- Analyzed variables (nutritional properties)
  - Crude protein content
  - Neutral detergent fibre (NDF)
  - Sugar
  - Ash
  - Metabolizable energy (ME)
  - Digestible organic matter (D)
  - Acid detergent fibre (ADF)
  - Oil by acid hydrolysis (OAH)
  - Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (NCGD)

## Data headers and meanings
- Season: Season of sample collection (spring, summer, or autumn)
- Site: Semi-improved or improved pasture
- N: Pasture nitrogen content (% of dry weight)
- CN: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio of the pasture
- Protein: Crude protein content (g kg-1 pasture dry weight)
- NDF: Neutral detergent fibre content (g kg-1 pasture)
- Sugar: Sugar content (g kg-1 pasture)
- Ash: Ash content (g kg-1 pasture)
- ME: Metabolizable energy (MJ kg-1 pasture)
- NCGD: Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (g kg-1 pasture)
- D: Digestible organic matter (percent)
- ADF: Acid detergent fibre (g kg-1 pasture)
- OAH: Oil by acid hydrolysis (g kg-1 pasture)

## Potential uses and considerations for analysts
- Analyze correlations between pasture composition (N, CN, protein, NDF, ADF) and digestibility/energy metrics (D, ME, NCGD)
- Compare semi-improved vs. improved pasture across seasons to assess how management and vegetation types influence nutritional quality
- Explore seasonal variation (spring to autumn) within each site
- Consider the limited sample size (n = 4 per season/site) when interpreting statistical significance and generalizability
- Data provenance and citation: clearly cite the grant and authors when reusing the dataset for analyses or publications
