# UplandLowlandMetabolomics.csv

## Overview
- Metabolomics dataset of sheep urine comparing upland and lowland pasture settings, collected in autumn.
- Sample size: 8 total (4 from semi-improved site, 4 from improved site).
- Purpose: untargeted primary metabolism analysis to quantify metabolite peak intensities.

## Data collection and processing
- Sample handling: urine collected from sheep, syringe-filtered (<0.2 μm), flash-frozen individually.
- Blanks: procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) processed and blank-corrected.
- Storage and shipping: samples stored at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center (UC Davis).
- Analytical method: untargeted primary metabolism analysis using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.).
- Data output: peak intensity values for all identified compounds.

## Data structure and content
- Headers:
  - Sample: sheep ID and site of urine collection.
  - Site: semi-improved (upland-like) or improved (lowland-like) pasture.
  - Remaining headers: identified metabolite compounds with corresponding peak intensity values.
- Data represents identified compounds from the untargeted analysis and their intensities.

## Provenance and citation
- Project: Uplands-N2O; Grant NE/M015351/1.

- Reuse note: if data are reused, ensure full citation to the original source.

## Relevance for environment-monitoring analytics
- Provides standardized metabolomics outputs that can be integrated with other environmental datasets (habitat type, management practices, climate data) to assess ecosystem health indicators over time.
- Raw peak intensities facilitate cross-study comparisons and meta-analyses.

## Quality, limitations, and cautions
- Small sample size (n=4 per site) limits statistical power and generalizability.
- Untargeted data reflect relative peak intensities; not absolute metabolite concentrations.
- Site classification is based on pasture management (semi-improved vs improved), linked to upland/lowland context implied by the dataset title.
