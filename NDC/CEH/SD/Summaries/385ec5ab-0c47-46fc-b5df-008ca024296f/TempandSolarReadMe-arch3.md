# TempandSolar.csv

## Overview
- Dataset of temperature and solar radiation data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes conducted in 2016.
- Four site-season combinations: spring semi-improved, summer semi-improved, autumn semi-improved, and autumn improved.

## Data content and structure
- Weather data collected from a meteorological station installed at each site (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK).
- Variables captured: TimeDate (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm), SolarRadiation (W m-2), AirTemp (°C).
- Site factor indicates Semi-improved or Improved; Season factor indicates spring, summer, or autumn (semi-improved) and autumn (improved).
- Data description notes half-hourly intervals for most sites and hourly intervals for the autumn improved site.

## Temporal resolution and site details
- Temporal granularity: half-hourly data (except autumn improved site at hourly intervals).
- Locations correspond to semi-improved vs. improved pasture and seasonality (spring, summer, autumn).

## Project and authors
- Project: Uplands-N2O; Grant NE/M015351/1.
- Authors: Karina A Marsden, Lucy Lush, Jon A Holmberg, Mick J Whelan, Andrew J King, Rory P Wilson, Alice F Charteris, Laura M Cardenas, Davey L Jones, Dave R Chadwick.
- Data usage note: If data are reused, ensure full citation.

## Data use and metadata considerations
- Data originate from a defined instrumented weather station, supporting transparency and reproducibility.
- The dataset includes explicit metadata on site type and season, plus measurement intervals, aiding integration with environmental monitoring frameworks.
- Potential reuse considerations: ensure consistency of temporal resolution across sites when aggregating and verify metadata completeness for site and sensor details.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Provides core environmental health measures (air temperature and solar radiation) needed for evaluating environmental conditions in monitoring programs.
- Useful for calibrating models or indicators related to animal trials and environmental exposure.
- Highlights data governance needs typical of monitoring programs: provenance, access to metadata, and clear citation requirements for reused data.
