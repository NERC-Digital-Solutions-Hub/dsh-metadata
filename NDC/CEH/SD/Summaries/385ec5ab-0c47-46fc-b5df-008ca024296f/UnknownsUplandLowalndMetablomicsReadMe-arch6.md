- Data description: Metabolomics of sheep urine; untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Sampling design:
  - Sites: autumn samples from semi-improved pasture and autumn samples from improved pasture.
  - Replication: n = 4 per site (total n = 8).
- Sample handling and processing:
  - Urine collected, syringe filtered (< 0.2 μm), flash frozen.
  - Procedural blanks of ultra-pure water processed and blank corrected.
  - Frozen samples stored at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis.
- Analytical method:
  - Instrument: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD) for untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Data content:
  - Peak intensity values for all identified compounds from the untargeted analysis.
  - Data headers:
    - Sample: sheep ID and site of urine collection.
    - Season: site (semi-improved or improved).
    - Other headers: numerical identity values for unidentified compounds; following rows contain the corresponding peak intensities.
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Data are blank corrected.
  - Small sample size (n = 8) and untargeted with unidentified compound identities, which may limit interpretation.
- Usage notes:
  - If data are reused, ensure full citation.
  - Data can be used to compare urinary metabolomic profiles across upland pasture conditions and to analyze unidentified metabolites (based on their peak intensities and numerical identifiers).
