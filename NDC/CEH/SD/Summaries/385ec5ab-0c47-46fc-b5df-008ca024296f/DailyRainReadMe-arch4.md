# Dailyrain.csv

- Overview
  - Daily rainfall data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes conducted in 2016.
  - Trials span four site/season configurations, reflecting different pasture management types (semi-improved vs. improved).

- Data content
  - Trials/sites:
    - 1) Spring semi-improved
    - 2) Summer semi-improved
    - 3) Autumn semi-improved
    - 4) Autumn improved
  - Temporal coverage: 2016 data with daily measurements.
  - Data fields (headers):
    - Site: Semi-Improved or Improved pasture
    - Season: Spring, Summer, Autumn (for semi-improved) or Autumn (for improved)
    - Date: dd/mm/yyyy
    - Rainfall: Daily rainfall total in mm

- Data provenance and format
  - Weather data sourced from a meteorological station at the sites (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK) using a tipping bucket rain gauge.
  - Data format implied as CSV with the described headers.

- Metadata and usage
  - If data are reused, citation is required.
  - Structured tabular data suitable for integration with other trial data (e.g., N2O measurements) to assess environmental context.

- Implications for data strategy
  - Enables linkage of rainfall context to experimental measurements across multiple trials.
  - Emphasizes need for clear provenance, station details, and measurement method to support data quality assessment and discoverability.
