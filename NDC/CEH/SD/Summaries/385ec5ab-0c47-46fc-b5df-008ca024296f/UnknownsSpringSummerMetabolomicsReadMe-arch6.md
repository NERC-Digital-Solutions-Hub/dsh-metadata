# UnknownsSpringSummerMetabolomics.csv

## Overview
- Metabolomics dataset describing the urine of sheep from spring and summer 2016 (n = 10 total; 5 spring, 5 summer) on a semi-improved site.
- Untargeted primary metabolism analysis focusing on unidentified compounds.
- Data consists of peak intensity values for unidentified metabolites, produced via GC-TOF-MS (ALEX-CIS) at UC Davis after processing.

## Data collection and processing
- Sample collection and handling:
  - Sheep urine collected in spring and summer 2016.
  - Samples syringe-filtered (< 0.2 μm) and flash-frozen; stored at -80 °C before shipment on dry ice.
- Quality control:
  - Procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) underwent the same syringe filtration and were blank corrected.
- Analysis method:
  - Untargeted primary metabolism analysis performed using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel).

## Data structure
- Data headers:
  - Sample: corresponds to the season of collection and the sheep ID.
  - Season: spring or summer 2016.
  - Remaining headers: numerical identity values for unidentified compounds; rows contain corresponding peak intensities.

## Data quality and provenance
- Blank correction applied to data.
- Samples stored at -80 °C and shipped on dry ice to West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis.
- Focus is on unidentified metabolite peaks from untargeted analysis; compound identities are not provided.

## Access, usage, and attribution
- Data use requires full citation if reused.
- Suitable for exploring untargeted metabolomic patterns in sheep urine and for integration with related datasets.
- Users should be cautious about the unidentified nature of the peaks and interpret results accordingly.
