- Data reuse note: If data are reused please ensure it is fully cited

- Purpose
  - Daily rainfall data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes, conducted in 2016
  - Site/season combinations:
    - 1) spring semi-improved site
    - 2) summer semi-improved site
    - 3) autumn semi-improved site
    - 4) autumn improved site

- Data source
  - Weather data from a meteorological station at the sites (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK)
  - Station uses a tipping bucket rain gauge

- Data structure
  - Headers:
    - Site: Semi-Improved or Improved pasture
    - Season: spring, summer, or autumn (for semi-improved) or autumn (for improved)
    - Date: dd/mm/yyyy
    - Rainfall: daily rainfall totals in mm
  - Temporal resolution: daily

- Geospatial context
  - Data tied to four upland trial sites in Wales with differing pasture types
  - Suitable for GIS analyses by linking to site polygons or coordinates (not provided in dataset metadata)

- Provenance and quality
  - Authored by listed researchers
  - Weather data provenance: Skye Instrument station
  - Reuse requires full citation

- Temporal coverage
  - Year 2016

- GIS-ready considerations
  - Link rainfall records to site-level spatial features for mapping by date or season
  - Standardize site naming and date formats for integration with other GIS layers
  - Assess and document data gaps or missing values
  - Align with other datasets (e.g., N2O measurements) across the four site-season contexts
