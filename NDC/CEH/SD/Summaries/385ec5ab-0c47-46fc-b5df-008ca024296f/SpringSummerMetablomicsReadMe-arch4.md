- Data description
  - Topic: Metabolomics of sheep urine
  - Samples: spring (n = 5) and summer (n = 5) from sheep on a semi-improved site
  - Processing: syringe filtering (< 0.2 μm) and flash freezing of individual urine samples
  - Blanks: procedural blanks of ultra-pure water filtered the same way; blanks are blank corrected
  - Storage and shipment: stored at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice to UC Davis West Coast Metabolomics Center
  - Analysis: untargeted primary metabolism analysis using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.)
  - Output: peak intensity values for all identified compounds

- Data structure and headers
  - Sample: encodes season and sheep ID
  - Season: spring or summer 2016
  - Other headers: identified compounds; corresponding peak intensity values beneath each header

- Data provenance and processing notes
  - Sample handling includes collection by season, storage, and standardized preparation
  - Data represents identified compounds from untargeted analysis; blanks corrected

- Data quality and limitations
  - Small sample size (n = 5 per season)
  - Details on replication and broader metadata beyond season and sheep ID are limited

- Use and reuse considerations
  - Data are suitable for meta-analyses or comparative metabolomics across seasons
  - Clear citation required when reused
  - Metadata supports discoverability via header mappings to compounds and sample identifiers

- Relevance to data governance for data leaders
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: collection, blank correction, storage, shipping, untargeted analysis, and structured data output
  - Highlights importance of provenance, metadata clarity (season, sheep ID, compound intensities), and data provenance for reuse within wider research networks
