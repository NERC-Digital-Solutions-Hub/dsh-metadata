  - Data reuse note: If data are reused please ensure it is fully cited

- Data description and scope
  - Type: Metabolomics data from sheep urine
  - Purpose: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis
  - Seasons and sample size: Spring (n = 5) and Summer (n = 5) on a semi-improved site
  - Sample handling: Urine samples syringe filtered (< 0.2 μm), flash frozen; procedural blanks of ultra-pure water also filtered; data blank corrected
  - Storage and transport: Frozen at -80 °C, shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis
  - Analysis method: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD)

- Data content
  - Contains the peak intensity values of all unidentified compounds from the untargeted primary metabolism analysis

- Data structure and headers
  - Sample: Indicates season of collection and sheep ID number
  - Season: Spring or Summer of 2016
  - Remaining headers: Numerical identity values for unidentified compounds; rows contain corresponding peak intensity values

- Data quality and processing
  - Blank correction applied based on procedural blanks
  - Samples organized by season and sheep, with chemical features represented as peak intensities

- Usage notes and citation
  - Data intended for reuse should be fully cited
  - Provides relatively small, unidentified-feature–level metabolomic data suitable for integration with other datasets or GIS-enabled visualization if linkage to spatial metadata is available

- Additional context
  - Site description: Semi-improved site (spatial context may enable landscape-scale interpretation when combined with location data)
