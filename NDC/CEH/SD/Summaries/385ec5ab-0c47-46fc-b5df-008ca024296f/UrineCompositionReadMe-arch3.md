- Data description and purpose:
  - Contains chemical composition of urine from Welsh Mountain ewe sheep and associated metadata.
  - Aims to support environmental health monitoring related to nitrogen cycling and potential environmental impacts of grazing systems.
  - Data captured to inform policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decision-making on management of nitrogen excretion and related processes.

- Sampling and laboratory workflow:
  - Samples filtered on ice through Whatman No. 1 (11 μm) to remove large particulates; subsamples stored at -20 °C before analysis.
  - pH and electrical conductivity (EC) measured with standard electrodes.
  - Total nitrogen (TN) and dissolved organic carbon (TOC) measured with a Multi N/C 2100S analyzer.
  - Urea measured via the enzymatic method of Orsenneau et al. (1992).
  - Nitrate (NO3−) and ammonium (NH4+) measured colorimetrically (Mulvaney 1996; Miranda et al. 2001).
  - Free amino acids measured fluorometrically (Jones et al. 2002).
  - Allantoin, creatinine, uric acid, hippuric acid, and benzoic acid measured using HPLC (Varian Pro Star 310; specific column details provided).
  - Potassium (K+), sodium (Na+), and calcium (Ca2+) measured with a flame photometer.
