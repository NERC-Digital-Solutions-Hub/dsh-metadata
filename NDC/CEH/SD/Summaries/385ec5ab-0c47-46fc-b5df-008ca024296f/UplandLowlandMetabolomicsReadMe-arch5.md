## Overview
- Project: Uplands-N2O
- Grant number: NE/M015351/1
- Authors: Karina A Marsden, Lucy Lush, Jon A Holmberg, Mick J Whelan, Andrew J King, Rory P Wilson, Alice F Charteris, Laura M Cardenas, Davey L Jones, Dave R Chadwick
- Data purpose: Metabolomics profiles of sheep urine, produced to enable untargeted primary metabolism analysis and downstream comparisons between site types.

## Data Description
- Data type: Metabolomics dataset (CSV) containing peak intensity values for identified compounds from untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Sample scope: Autumn-collected urine from sheep at two pasture sites:
  - Semi-improved site (n = 4)
  - Improved site (n = 4)
- Data corrections: Procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) were syringe filtered and blank-corrected.
- Storage and transport: Frozen at -80°C; shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis.
- Analysis method: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD).
- Data content: Peak intensity values for all identified compounds; header structure includes:
  - Sample: Sheep ID and the site of urine collection
  - Site: semi-improved or improved pasture
  - Remaining headers: Identified compounds with corresponding peak intensity values

## Data Processing and Provenance
- Processing status: Data resulting from untargeted analysis; blank correction applied to remove procedural blank effects.
- Dataset format: CSV file (UplandLowlandMetabolomics.csv) suitable for import into common analytical workflows.
- Metadata cues: Includes project/grant details, authorship, sampling design, site classification, and data processing steps (blank correction, storage/shipping).

## Data Governance and Reuse
- Citation: If data are reused, ensure full citation to the original project and authors; data sharing and reuse should acknowledge the grant and contributors.
- Reuse relevance: Useful for comparative metabolomics studies, site-based metabolic profiling, and method benchmarking for untargeted primary metabolism analyses.
- Metadata gaps to capture for stewardship: Instrument specifics beyond GC-TOF-MS, compound identifications (levels of confidence), normalization steps (if applicable), and any subsequent data processing or normalization performed after peak intensities.

## Accessibility and Notes
- Data availability: Provided as a CSV with explicit headers describing samples, site, and metabolite intensities.
- Important considerations for stewardship: Maintain linkage to provenance (project, grant, authors), ensure ongoing discoverability, and preserve blank-corrected status to support reproducibility.
