# PastureProperties.csv

- Purpose: Dataset describing pasture properties fed to Welsh Mountain ewes during urine collection experiments, with data suitable for exploring relationships between forage composition and nitrogen cycling in grazing systems.

- Study locations and context:
  - Two study sites at Henfaes Research Station, Abergwyngregyn, North Wales (53°13′N, 4°0′W).
  - Site 1: semi-improved upland grassland at ~270 m a.s.l., NVC types U4 and MG6.
  - Site 2: lowland improved Lolium multiflorum pasture, <100 m a.s.l.
  - Urine collection trials conducted in spring, summer, and autumn 2016 at the semi-improved site; autumn 2016 at the improved site.

- Sampling design:
  - Forage samples (n = 4) collected per season at each site.
  - Seasons correspond to collection timing (spring, summer, autumn).
  - Autumn sampling conducted at both sites (semi-improved and improved).

- Analyses and methods:
  - Forage samples analyzed for total carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) content using a TruSpec® Analyzer.
  - Samples also sent to Sciantec Analytical (Cawood Scientific Ltd.) for nutritional analysis, including:
    - Crude protein (protein)
    - Neutral detergent fibre (NDF)
    - Sugar
    - Ash
    - Metabolizable energy (ME)
    - Digestible organic matter (D)
    - Acid detergent fibre (ADF)
    - Oil by acid hydrolysis (OAH)
    - Neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (NCGD)

- Data fields and units:
  - Season: spring, summer, or autumn (season of forage collection)
  - Site: semi-improved or improved pasture
  - N: pasture nitrogen content (% of dry weight)
  - CN: carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
  - Protein: crude protein content (g/kg dry weight)
  - NDF: neutral detergent fibre content (g/kg dry weight)
  - Sugar: sugar content (g/kg dry weight)
  - Ash: ash content (g/kg dry weight)
  - ME: metabolizable energy (MJ/kg dry weight)
  - NCGD: neutral cellulase gammanase digestibility (g/kg dry weight)
  - D: digestible organic matter (%)
  - ADF: acid detergent fibre (g/kg dry weight)
  - OAH: oil by acid hydrolysis (g/kg dry weight)

  - Project: Uplands-N2O
  - Grant number: NE/M015351/1
  - Authors: Karina A Marsden et al.
  - Note: If data are reused, ensure full citation.

- Potential applications for data support:
  - Investigating relationships between pasture composition (N, C, CP, NDF/ADF, ME, etc.) and nitrogen excretion/usage in grazing systems.
  - Supporting data products that enable stakeholders to explore pasture quality and its implications for productivity and environmental impacts.
  - Integrating with other datasets to build self-serve analyses or dashboards on forage quality across seasons and pasture types.

- Limitations and considerations:
  - Limited to two sites and a specific year (2016); sample size per season is relatively small (n=4 forage samples per site per season).
  - Data collected primarily for urine collection experiments; context is essential for interpretation of N and related metrics.
