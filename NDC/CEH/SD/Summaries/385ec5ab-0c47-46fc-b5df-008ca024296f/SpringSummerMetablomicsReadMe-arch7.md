- Data description: Metabolomics dataset of sheep urine samples; untargeted primary metabolism analysis via GC-TOF-MS
  - Samples: spring (n=5) and summer (n=5) from a semi-improved site
  - Processing: syringe-filtered (<0.2 μm), flash-frozen, blanks processed with ultra-pure water; data blank-corrected
  - Storage and analysis: stored at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice to West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis
  - Instrument: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.)
  - Output: peak intensity values for all identified compounds
- Data structure
  - Headers: Sample (season + sheep ID)
  - Season header: spring or summer 2016
  - Compound headers: identified metabolites; values are peak intensities beneath each header
- Data provenance and reuse
  - Data should be fully cited if reused
- Additional notes relevant to GIS Specialists
  - Location: site described as semi-improved; no explicit geographic coordinates provided
  - Potential map-ready attributes: sample point identifiers (season, sheep ID) linked to metabolite intensities
  - Possible GIS applications: visualize spatial distribution by season or animal, compare metabolite profiles across samples, integrate with environmental or management data if spatial coordinates become available
  - Data quality considerations: blank correction performed; sample handling and storage details documented; instrument method and analysis approach specified
