  - Reuse note: If data are reused please ensure it is fully cited

- Data description and collection
  - Focus: Metabolomics of sheep urine
  - Sampling: autumn, at two pasture types
    - Semi-improved site (n = 4)
    - Improved site (n = 4)
  - Sample preparation: syringe filtering (< 0.2 μm) and flash freezing of individual urine samples
  - Blank controls: procedural blanks of ultra-pure water filtered identically; blanks corrected in data
  - Storage: samples stored at -80°C prior to shipping
  - Shipment: shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis
  - Analysis: untargeted primary metabolism analysis using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD)

- Data content and structure
  - Data type: peak intensity values for all identified compounds from the untargeted analysis
  - Data headers
    - Sample: corresponds to sheep ID and site
    - Site: semi-improved or improved pasture
    - Other headers: identified compounds from the primary metabolism analysis
    - Values: peak intensity values beneath each compound header

- Data processing and quality considerations
  - Blank correction applied to data
  - Data described as raw peak intensities from untargeted analysis; no further processing details provided

- Data governance and reuse considerations
  - Data provenance and citation: explicit instruction to fully cite data if reused
  - Metadata and accessibility implications: dataset describes methodological context (sample handling, storage, instrument, and site classification) to support interpretation and reuse

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks (for archetype perspective)
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: collection, preparation, storage, analysis, and data reporting
  - Highlights need for clear metadata ( Sample, Site, compound identifiers) to enable data provenance and comparability
  - Illustrates handling of blanks and quality control in metabolomics data
  - Emphasizes documentation of sampling design (two sites with replication) for environmental health monitoring decisions
  - Underlines reuse barriers and citation requirements to ensure traceability of data sources
