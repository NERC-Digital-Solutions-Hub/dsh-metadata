- Reuse note: If data are reused please ensure it is fully cited

- Filtering and data preparation
  - Data were filtered to exclude observations with zero urination events.
  - Two replicate sheep were filtered due to infrequency of urine events (sheep 1 and 5).

- Daily calculations and time basis
  - For daily N excretion, volume and frequency calculations were made assuming the time spent in urine collection (typically between 10:00 and 16:00) is representative of a 24 h period.

- Data headers / fields
  - Site: Semi-improved or improved pasture
  - Season: Season of collection being spring, summer or autumn at the semi-improved site and autumn at the improved site
  - Sheep_ID: Number assigned to replicate sheep
  - Date: Date of urine collection in dd/mm/yyyy
  - Vol_ml: Individual urine event volume in ml
  - NContent: Individual urine event N content in g N l-1
  - Nexcreted: Total N excreted in each urine event in g N

- Data usage notes
  - The dataset is structured around urine events per sheep and is used to infer daily N excretion under the stated time-basis assumption.
  - Nexcreted is provided per urine event; daily totals are derived from the described daily calculation method.
  - Ensure proper citation of the original study when reusing the data.
