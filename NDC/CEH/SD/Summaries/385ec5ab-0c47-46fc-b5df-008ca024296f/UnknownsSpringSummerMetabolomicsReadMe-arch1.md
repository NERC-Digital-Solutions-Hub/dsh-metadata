# UnknownsSpringSummerMetabolomics.csv

- Metabolomics dataset describing urine from sheep on a semi-improved site, comparing spring and summer 2016 (n = 5 sheep per season).
- Purpose: untargeted primary metabolism analysis focusing on unidentified metabolite peaks.

## Data collection and processing

- Samples: urine from individual sheep collected in spring and summer 2016.
- Sample handling: syringe-filtered (<0.2 μm), flash-frozen; stored at -80 °C before shipping.
- Shipping: transported on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis.
- Analysis method: untargeted primary metabolism analysis using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD).
- Data treatment: procedural blanks of ultra-pure water were syringe-filtered and blank-corrected.

## Data structure and contents

- Data type: peak intensity values for unidentified compounds from the untargeted analysis.
- Headers:
  - Sample: combines season and sheep ID number.
  - Season: spring or summer of 2016.
  - Other headers: numerical identity values for unidentified compounds; each row contains peak intensities under these headers.
