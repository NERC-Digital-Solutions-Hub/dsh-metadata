## Overview
- Metabolomics data of sheep urine for untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Samples collected in autumn from two pasture conditions: semi-improved site (n = 4) and improved site (n = 4).
- Contains peak intensity values for all identified compounds, plus numerical IDs for unidentified compounds.

## Data Collection and Processing
- Sample collection: urine from sheep, syringe filtered (<0.2 μm) and flash frozen.
- Procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) were syringe filtered and used for blank correction.
- Frozen samples stored at -80 °C before shipping on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis.
- Analysis: untargeted primary metabolism using ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.).

## Data Structure and Variables
- Data headers:
  - Sample: combines sheep ID and site of urine collection.
  - Season: indicates the site, either semi-improved or improved pasture.
  - Other headers: numerical identity values for unidentified compounds from the primary metabolism analysis.
  - Values beneath headers: peak intensity values for each compound.
- Data represents untargeted metabolomics with both identified and unidentified compounds.

## Context and Potential Uses
- Enables comparison of urinary metabolite profiles between semi-improved and improved pasture sites.
- Suitable for identifying correlations between site conditions and metabolite intensities, and for developing predictive insights from metabolomic patterns.

## Quality, Limitations, and Considerations
- Small sample size (8 samples total; 4 per site) limits statistical power and generalizability.
- Presence of unidentified compounds requires further identification for biological interpretation.
- Data are blank-corrected, but additional normalization or batch effect assessments may be needed.
- Data may require integration with supplementary datasets or metadata for robust analyses.
