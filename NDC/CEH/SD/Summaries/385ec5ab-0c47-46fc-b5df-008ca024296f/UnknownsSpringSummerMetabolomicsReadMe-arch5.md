# UnknownsSpringSummerMetabolomics.csv

## Overview
- Project: Uplands-N2O
- Grant number: NE/M015351/1
- Authors: Karina A Marsden, Lucy Lush, Jon A Holmberg, Mick J Whelan, Andrew J King, Rory P Wilson, Alice F Charteris, Laura M Cardenas, Davey L Jones, Dave R Chadwick
- Data reuse note: if data are reused please ensure it is fully cited

## Data Content
- Field: Metabolomics of sheep urine
- Type: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis
- Samples: spring (n=5) and summer (n=5) from a semi-improved site
- Sample preparation: syringe filtering (<0.2 μm) and flash freezing; procedural blanks of ultra-pure water filtered identically and blank corrected
- Storage: -80 °C before shipping
- Transport: shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis
- Instrument: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD)
- Data content: peak intensity values of all unidentified compounds from the untargeted analysis
- Data headers: 
  - Sample: corresponds to season of collection and the sheep ID
  - Season: spring or summer 2016
  - Other headers: numeric identity values of unidentified compounds; values are peak intensities beneath headers

## Metadata and Data Quality
- Data are blank-corrected using procedural blanks
- Unidentified metabolites; no compound identifications provided in this dataset
- Clear association of samples to season and sheep ID for traceability

## Data Governance and Access
- Emphasizes that data should be cited fully if reused
- Documentation includes data collection, processing, and storage steps to support reproducibility

## Data Management Notes for Stewards
- Ensure completeness of metadata (season, sample IDs, unidentified peak intensities)
- Consider providing or linking processing details (blank correction workflow, normalization, and any quality checks)
- Maintain provenance: associate dataset with the grant NE/M015351/1 and authors
- Plan for data sharing updates or expansions and note any access limitations due to unidentified compounds

## Usage and Limitations
- Suitable for reanalysis of untargeted metabolomics signal intensities
- Limitation: lack of compound identifications; small sample size (10 samples) may constrain interpretation
- Reuse requires proper citation as specified in the dataset description
