## Data description
- Dataset contains temperature and solar radiation data for four urine collection trials with Welsh Mountain ewes, conducted in 2016
- Trials/sites: 1) spring semi-improved site, 2) summer semi-improved site, 3) autumn semi-improved site, 4) autumn improved site
- Weather data source: meteorological station installed at the sites (Skye Instrument, Llandrindod Wells, UK)

## Data collection specifics
- Time resolution: half-hourly measurements; autumn data for the improved site recorded hourly
- Location context: sites characterized as Semi-improved or Improved
- Seasons covered: spring, summer, autumn (semi-improved) and autumn (improved)

## Variables and formats
- TimeDate: date and time of measurement (format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm)
- SolarRadiation: incoming solar radiation (W m-2)
- AirTemp: air temperature (°C)

## Site and season coding
- Site category: Semi-improved or Improved
- Season assignment: spring, summer, autumn for semi-improved; autumn for the improved site

## Data quality and usage notes
- Data should be cited fully when reused
- Data collected from a designated meteorological station at the trial sites
- Designed to support analyses relating temperature and solar radiation; applicability to broader analyses (e.g., environmental or N2O-related questions) should consider context and metadata
