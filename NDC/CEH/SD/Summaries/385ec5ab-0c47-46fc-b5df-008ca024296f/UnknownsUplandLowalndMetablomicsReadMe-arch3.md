## Overview
- Project: Uplands-N2O (Grant NE/M015351/1)
- Authors: Karina A Marsden; Lucy Lush; Jon A Holmberg; Mick J Whelan; Andrew J King; Rory P Wilson; Alice F Charteris; Laura M Cardenas; Davey L Jones; Dave R Chadwick
- Purpose: Metabolomics of sheep urine to capture untargeted primary metabolism profiles
- Data type: Peak intensity values from untargeted metabolomics analysis of urine samples

## Sampling and Experimental Design
- Sites and seasons: Autumn samples from semi-improved pasture and improved pasture
- Sample size: 8 sheep total (n = 4 per site)
- Collection and handling:
  - Syringe filtering of urine (< 0.2 μm)
  - Flash freezing individual samples
  - Procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) filtered and blank corrected
  - Storage at -80 °C prior to shipment

## Analysis Method
- Instrumentation: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.)
- Center: West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis
- Analysis type: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis

## Data Description and Structure
- Content: Peak intensity values for all identified compounds from untargeted analysis
- Data headers:
  - Sample: Sheep ID and collection site
  - Season: Site type (semi-improved or improved pasture)
  - Remaining headers: Numerical identities of unidentified compounds; values are corresponding peak intensities

## Data Quality and Processing
- Quality steps:
  - Blank correction performed on procedural blanks
  - Samples stored and shipped under cold-chain conditions to preserve integrity

## Metadata and Data Sharing 
- Citation: If data are reused, ensure full citation
- Transparency: Includes explicit metadata (sample, site, season, compound identifiers, intensities)
- Data availability implications: Raw data are tied to identifiable samples and unidentified compounds; sharing considerations noted through established metadata and citation requirement

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Potential use: Serves as a metabolomic indicator layer to monitor environmental health and pasture-management effects on animal biochemistry
- Utility for policy evaluation: Could inform assessments of land-use practices on metabolic responses, contributing to environmental health monitoring dashboards
- Scope and scale considerations: Small sample size (n=8) and presence of unidentified compounds limit generalizability; data would benefit from expanded sampling and clear labeling of identifiable compounds for robust monitoring

## Limitations and Considerations for Governance
- Sample size and representativeness limit broader inferences
- Unidentified metabolites reduce interpretability; ongoing annotation needed
- Metadata clarity (site definitions, exact locations, animal IDs) critical for reproducibility
- Data sharing balance: explicit citation request but open-data considerations require alignment with governance processes and stakeholder expectations
