## Overview
- Project: Uplands-N2O (Grant NE/M015351/1)
- Authors: Karina A Marsden, Lucy Lush, Jon A Holmberg, Mick J Whelan, Andrew J King, Rory P Wilson, Alice F Charteris, Laura M Cardenas, Davey L Jones, Dave R Chadwick
- Objective: Metabolomics profiling of sheep urine to support environmental monitoring within upland management contexts
- Comparison: Autumn samples from semi-improved pasture (n=4) and improved pasture (n=4)

## Data collection and quality assurance
- Sample collection: Urine from sheep, autumn season, across two pasture types
- Processing: Syringe-filtering (<0.2 μm) and flash-freezing of individual urine samples
- Blanks: Procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) processed identically and used for blank correction
- Storage and transport: Frozen at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center, UC Davis

## Analytical method
- Instrumentation: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc.)
- Approach: Untargeted primary metabolism analysis
- Output: Peak intensity values for all identified compounds

## Data content and structure
- Data contains: Peak intensity values for identified compounds from untargeted metabolism analysis
- Headers:
  - Sample: Sheep ID and site of urine collection
  - Season: Site classification (semi-improved or improved pasture)
  - Remaining headers: Numerical identity values for unidentified compounds with corresponding peak intensities

## Data handling and provenance
- Citation: If reused, data must be fully cited
- Data stewardship: Dataset includes processed metabolomics output; intended for storage and upload to appropriate data portals

## Relevance for environmental monitoring (Analysts Monitoring the Environment)
- Provides standardized metabolomic outputs linked to pasture management contexts, enabling assessment of environmental health indicators over time
- Demonstrates a clear data processing workflow (blank correction, untargeted analysis, standardized metadata) suitable for integration with other environmental datasets
- Highlights the potential to combine this metabolomics data with additional environmental data to enhance the value of monitoring datasets and improve data accessibility for downstream users
