## Overview
- Project: Uplands-N2O
- Grant number: NE/M015351/1
- Authors: Karina A Marsden, Lucy Lush, Jon A Holmberg, Mick J Whelan, Andrew J King, Rory P Wilson, Alice F Charteris, Laura M Cardenas, Davey L Jones, Dave R Chadwick
- Data description: Metabolomics of sheep urine; untargeted primary metabolism analysis.
- Samples: autumn collection from semi-improved site (n=4) and autumn collection from improved site (n=4).
- Data processed: procedural blanks (ultra-pure water) were syringe filtered and blank corrected. Samples stored at -80 °C and shipped on dry ice to the West Coast Metabolomics Center at UC Davis for analysis.
- Instrument: ALEX-CIS GC-TOF-MS (Gerstel Inc., Linthicum, MD).

## Data collection and processing
- Sample handling: urine collected from sheep, filtered (<0.2 μm), flash frozen; stored at -80 °C; shipped on dry ice.
- Analysis: untargeted primary metabolism analysis performed at UC Davis.
- Quality control: procedural blanks used for blank correction.
- Output: peak intensity values for all identified compounds from the untargeted analysis.

## Data structure and content
- Data contains peak intensity values for identified metabolites.
- Headers:
  - Sample: corresponds to the sheep ID and site.
  - Site: semi-improved or improved pasture.
  - Remaining headers: identified compounds; each column contains the corresponding peak intensity values.
- Data provenance: subset of samples and method described above; data derived from untargeted metabolomics via GC-TOF-MS.

## Reuse and attribution
- If data are reused, ensure full citation.
- Original project and grant information should accompany any downstream use.

## Notes for data use
- Clear linkage between sample identifiers and site conditions (semi-improved vs. improved) is provided.
- Organization of data supports self-serve exploration of metabolite profiles by sample and site.
