# hydroscape_lakedistrict_xrf_cores_qc.csv

- This document describes the QC results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials co-measured with core sediments to assess instrument reliability and the accuracy of elemental identifications.
- The dataset includes element concentrations measured in standard reference sediments alongside their certified values, enabling recovery calculations and quality assessment.

## What the file contains

- Core_run_and_reference_sediment_used: names of core reference sediments used (e.g., JLK1 Terashima et al. 1990; LKSD2 Lynch et al. 1990) and run details.
- Run_Code and Description: identifiers and dates for each run.
- Element concentrations (expressed as % dry mass or µg/g dry sediment):
  - Major elements: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti
  - Trace elements: V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb
- Table 1 format notes: some elements listed with units (e.g., V_µg_g, Cr_µg_g) and occasional labeling for concentration type.

## Table 2 — Certified reference values

- Provides certified (reference) concentrations for each element for the two reference sediments (JLK-1 and LKSD2).
- Examples of certified values (for context):
  - Na: 0.78 (JLK-1), 1.41 (LKSD2)
  - Mg: 1.05 (JLK-1), 1.03 (LKSD2)
  - Al: 8.85 (JLK-1), 6.5 (LKSD2)
  - Si: 26.7 (JLK-1), Not Cert. (LKSD2)
  - Ti: 0.4 (JLK-1), 0.35 (LKSD2)
  - V: 117 (JLK-1), 77 (LKSD2)
  - Fe: 4.84 (JLK-1), 4.3 (LKSD2)
  - Pb: 43.7 (JLK-1), 44 (LKSD2)
- Not Cert entries indicate elements without certified values for a given sediment.

## Data quality and interpretation

- Recovery concept: the difference between XRF-measured values and certified values, expressed as a percentage (recovery).
- A recovery of 95–105% is considered very good, indicating strong agreement between measured and certified values and thus reliable instrument performance and measurement accuracy.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring

- Demonstrates a standardized approach to QC for environmental elemental analysis, enabling consistent evaluation of instrument performance over time.
- Provides traceable data through comparison with established reference materials, supporting the credibility of environmental health assessments derived from XRF data.
- Data are suitable for storage and sharing in monitoring portals, aligning with best practices for transparent, auditable environmental datasets.
