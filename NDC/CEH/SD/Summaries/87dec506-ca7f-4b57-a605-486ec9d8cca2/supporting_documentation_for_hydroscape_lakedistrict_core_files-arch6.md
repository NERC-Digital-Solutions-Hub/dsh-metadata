# Headings used to record the stratigraphic data collected for each core

- Overview
  - Describes the headings (columns) used to record stratigraphic data for each core.
  - Data are organized as a matrix: rows correspond to contiguous core-depth intervals; columns (determinands) hold measurements or metadata.
  - Blanks indicate no measurement; associated files consist of multiple CSVs named with lake WBID and project code.

- Data structure and key determinands
  - Core metadata and depth
    - Sub_ID: internal unique ID for each core slice
    - Top_Depth_cm, Bottom_Depth_cm: depth interval boundaries from sediment–water interface
  - Sediment mass and density
    - DW: percentage of dry weight after drying
    - LOI_550: loss on ignition at 550°C for 2 hours
    - LOI_950: loss on ignition at 950°C for 2 hours
    - wetd: mass per unit volume (g cm^-3) of wet sediment
  - Radioisotopes and dating
    - Pb210_Total, Pb210_Total_err

- Data quality, availability, and usage considerations
  - Data may be patchy or provided in multiple formats across cores and lakes
  - Blanks indicate missing measurements; users should merge datasets carefully
  - Data are structured to enable self-serve exploration, dashboards, pivot tables, and reports
  - Outputs may be promoted and iterated based on user feedback; early prototypes may be shared
