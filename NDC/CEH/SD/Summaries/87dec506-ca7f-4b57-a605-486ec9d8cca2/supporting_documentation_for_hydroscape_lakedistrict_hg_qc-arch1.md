# This document describes the table headings showing the results of measurements of reference sediment (LKSD2) and procedural blanks processed and run with the core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS) following reduction with SnCl2

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the table headings for results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks alongside core sediment samples analyzed by CV-AFS after SnCl2 reduction.
- Mercury concentrations are measured at UCL Geography.

## Analytical method and QA context
- Core sediments are freeze-dried and digested in aqua regia at 100°C for 2 hours in rigorously acid-leached 50 mL tubes.
- Mercury determined by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS) after SnCl2 reduction.
- Reference material LKSD2 (certified Hg = 160 ± 19 ng/g) used as a standard; LKSD2 and related blanks are processed in the same run as the core sediments.
- Laboratory standard solutions and quality control blanks are measured every five samples to monitor instrument stability.

## Table structure and fields (Lake_District_Hg_Core_Runs)
- Tube_Code: Code identifying each run (e.g., LKSD2…).
- Reference_Sediment_mass_g: Mass of reference sediment weighed out (approximately 0.2 g).
- Hg_ng_g: Mercury concentration in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg_µg_g: Mercury concentration in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured_blank_ng_ml: Mercury concentration measured in procedural blank (ng/mL).
- Description: Name of the Hg core runs processed through the CV-AFS instrument.

## Reference material and provenance
- LKSD2 reference sediment used as a standard; its certified Hg value is 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction elements prepared using concentrated HNO3 and HCl.
- Primary reference for LKSD materials: Lynch, J. (1990), Geostandards Newsletter.
