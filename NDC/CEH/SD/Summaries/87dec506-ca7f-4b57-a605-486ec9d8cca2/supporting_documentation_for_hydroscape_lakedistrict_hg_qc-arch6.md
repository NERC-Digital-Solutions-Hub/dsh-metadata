## Purpose and scope
- Describes the table headings showing results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks processed and run with core sediments measured by CV-AFS after reduction with SnCl2.

## Methods
- Mercury concentrations measured at UCL Geography.
- Freeze-dried core samples digested in aqua regia at 100°C for 2 hours in rigorously acid-leached 50 ml polypropylene digestion tubes.
- Standard reference material LKSD2 sediment with certified Hg value 160 ± 19 ng g⁻¹; method uses partial extraction with concentrated HNO3 and HCl.
- LKSD2 reference sediment and aqua regia sample blanks run as samples; reported as Hg_ng_g, Hg_µg_g, and Measured_blank_ng_ml.
- Laboratory standard solutions and QA/QC blanks measured every five samples to monitor machine stability.

## Data structure / Columns
- Lake_District_Hg_Core_Runs: table of Hg core runs through the CV-AFS machine.
- Tube_Code: identifier for each Hg core run (e.g., LKSD2…).
- Reference_Sediment_mass_g: mass of reference sediment weighed out (approximately 0.2 g).
- Hg_ng_g: mercury concentration in sediment expressed as ng/g.
- Hg_µg_g: mercury concentration in sediment expressed as µg/g.
- Measured_blank_ng_ml: mercury concentration measured in the procedural blank (ng/ml).
- Description: name of the Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.

## Reference materials / provenance
- LKSD2 reference sediment with certified Hg value of 160 ± 19 ng/g.
- Partial Extraction elements referenced to Lynch (1990): LKSD-1, LKSD-2, LKSD-3, LKSD-4, STSD-1, STSD-2, STSD-3, STSD-4.

## Notes for users
- Data reflect CV-AFS measurements following SnCl2 reduction.
- Useful for validating Hg content in lake sediment cores and for assessing blank corrections and instrument stability via QA/QC practices.
- Provides a structured description of how table columns relate to the measurement workflow and quality controls.
