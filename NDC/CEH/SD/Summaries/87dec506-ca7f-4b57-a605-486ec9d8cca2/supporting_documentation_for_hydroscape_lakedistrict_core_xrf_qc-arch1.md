## Overview
- Describes quality control (QC) results for XRF measurements of standard reference sediments co-measured with core sediments.
- Presents measured element concentrations in the reference samples and compares them to published certified values.
- Defines recovery as the percentage difference between XRF-measured values and certified values; a recovery of 95–105% is considered very good.
- Includes references for the reference materials used.

## Table 1: Core_run_and_reference_sediment_used
- Columns describe the running of core sediments with reference sediments.
- Key identifiers:
  - Sample ID (UCL): includes reference sediment types (e.g., JLK1 = Terashima et al. 1990; LKSD2 = Lynch et al. 1990).
  - Run_Code and Description: details of the run date and sediment combination.
- Element concentrations reported as:
  - % dry mass: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti
  - µg/g dry sediment: V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb
  - Additional entries show Mn and Fe as %dry mass or µg/g equivalents depending on the element.
- Purpose: provide contemporaneous measurements of a reference sediment alongside the core sample to assess measurement reliability.

## Table 2: Certified reference values
- Lists published certified concentrations for each element in the reference sediments.
- For each element, two certified reference values are provided:
  - JLK-1 (Terashima et al. 1990)
  - LKSD2 (Lynch et al. 1990)
- Values are given in the same units as Table 1 (percent dry mass for some elements; µg/g for others).
- Some elements have “Not Cert” indicating no certified value available for that sediment.
- Example elements include: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb.

## Recovery and data quality
- Recovery is the percentage difference between the XRF-measured value and the corresponding certified value.
- A recovery range of 95–105% indicates very good agreement and high measurement reliability.

## Notes on interpretation and limitations
- Not Cert values indicate missing certified references for those specific element-sediment combinations.
- Some elements are reported in different units (percent dry mass vs. µg/g), requiring careful alignment when comparing to Table 2.
- The QC framework relies on matching core measurements with reference sediments to verify instrument accuracy and detect potential drift over time.
