## Overview
- Describes the table headings for mercury measurement results from reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks in core sediments measured by CV-AFS after SnCl2 reduction.
- Mercury analyses performed at UCL Geography on freeze-dried core samples digested in aqua regia at 100°C for 2 hours in acid-leached tubes.
- Uses LKSD2 reference sediment (certified Hg value 160 ± 19 ng g⁻¹) and reports both sample and blank measurements.
- Includes quality control with laboratory standards and blanks every five samples.
- Context: supports standardized reporting of mercury data for environmental monitoring and policy assessment.

## Methods
- Sample preparation: freeze-dried core sediments digested in aqua regia (50 mL tubes) at 100°C for 2 hours.
- Analytical technique: Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS) following SnCl2 reduction.
- Reference material: LKSD2 sediment with certified Hg value; used alongside aqua regia blanks as part of the run.
- Quality control: laboratory standards and QA blanks measured every five samples to monitor instrument stability.

## Table headings and data fields
- Tube_Code: identifier for each core run (e.g., LKSD2…).
- Reference_Sediment_mass_g: mass of reference sediment weighed (~0.2 g).
- Hg_ng_g: mercury concentration in sediment (ng/g).
- Hg_µg_g: mercury concentration in sediment (µg/g).
- Measured_blank_ng_ml: mercury concentration measured in the procedural blank (ng/mL).
- Description: name of Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.

## Reference material and quality assurance
- LKSD2 reference sediment serves as a certified standard; provides a benchmark for results.
- Procedural blanks and aqua regia blanks are treated as samples to monitor contamination and method performance.
- Lynch (1990) is cited for the LKSD-2 reference material and related standards.

## Data handling and monitoring relevance
- Emphasizes standardized data generation and reporting to enable consistent environmental health assessments over time.
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals to support transparency and re-use.

## Challenges and opportunities for analysts
- Increase the value of datasets by integrating Hg core data with other environmental datasets.
- Improve access to underlying data to enhance reproducibility and reuse.
