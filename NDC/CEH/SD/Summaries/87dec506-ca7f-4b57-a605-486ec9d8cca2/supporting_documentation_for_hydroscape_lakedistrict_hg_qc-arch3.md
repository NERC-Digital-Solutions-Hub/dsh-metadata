# hydroscape_lakedistrict_hg _cores_qc.csv

- Overview
  - Documents the table headings for the results of measurements of reference sediment LKSD2 and procedural blanks, processed with core sediments measured by Cold Vapour Atomic Fluorescence Spectroscopy (CV-AFS) following SnCl2 reduction. Mercury concentrations were measured at UCL Geography.

- Methods
  - Core samples: freeze-dried, digested in aqua regia at 100°C for 2 hours in rigorously acid-leached 50 ml tubes.
  - Reference material: LKSD2 sediment with certified Hg value of 160 ± 19 ng g-1; prepared using concentrated HNO3 and HCl.
  - Quality control: LKSD2 reference sediment and procedural blanks run as samples; laboratory standards and QC blanks measured every five samples to monitor instrument stability.
  - Instrumental workflow: samples processed through CV-AFS after SnCl2 reduction.

- Data structure and content
  - Table columns: Tube_Code, Reference_Sediment_mass_g, Hg_ng_g, Hg_µg_g, Measured_blank_ng_ml, Description.
  - Description: names the Hg cores run through the CV-AFS machine.
  - Units: Hg concentrations reported as ng/g and µg/g; blanks reported as ng/mL; reference sediment mass in grams.

- Provenance and references
  - Uses LKSD2 reference material with a certified Hg value sourced from Lynch (1990) Geostandards Newsletter. Full citation provided for the LKSD reference materials.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured QA/QC approach for environmental mercury measurements, including:
    - Use of certified reference material for accuracy assessment.
    - Inclusion of procedural blanks and regular standards to monitor instrument stability.
    - Clear documentation of sample preparation, digestion method, and measurement technique.
    - Transparent data structure with explicit metadata (sample tube, mass, concentrations, blanks, and description) to support reproducibility and governance.

- Metadata and data governance considerations
  - Emphasizes the importance of linking results to a certified reference (LKSD2) and maintaining detailed method notes.
  - Highlights data transparency through reporting of blanks and multiple concentration units, aiding verification and sharing.
