## Overview
- This document describes the quality control (QC) results from XRF measurements of standard reference materials co-measured with core sediments.
- Purpose: to assess the reliability of element identification and the machine's performance during operation.
- Data include measured element concentrations for a reference sediment alongside the core sediment samples, and published certified (reference) concentrations for the reference sediments.

## Table 1: Core_run_and_reference_sediment_used (description of measurements)
- Name and description of sediments used: core standard sediment runs such as JLK1 (Terashima et al., 1990) and LKSD2 (Lynch et al., 1990).
- Run information: sample IDs (UCL), run codes, and run dates.
- Reported concentrations (expressed as):
  - % dry mass for Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti
  - µg/g dry sediment for V, Cr, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb
  - Units and columns are provided for a wide suite of elements to evaluate measurement accuracy.
- Purpose: provide the measured elemental concentrations for comparison with certified reference values.

## Table 2: Certified reference values (Published totals)
- Provides published (certified) total concentrations for the reference sediments used in Table 1.
- Reference sediments covered: JLK-1 and LKSD2.
- Elements included: Na, Mg, Al, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Br, Rb, Sr, Y, Nb, Ba, Pb.
- NotCert entries indicate elements without certified values for a given reference sediment.
- Recovery metric: the difference between XRF-measured values and certified values is expressed as a percentage (recovery). A recovery of 95–105% is considered very good.

## Quality assessment and interpretation
- The document uses recovery (measured vs. certified) to evaluate measurement reliability.
- Values and their agreement with certified references help validate the XRF measurements used for subsequent GIS-based mapping and analysis.
