# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) greenhouse gas fluxes in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Aim and scope
- Provides environmental health measures focused on greenhouse gas fluxes to scrutinize ecosystem function and inform policy decisions.
- Targets coastal ecosystems (saltmarsh and mudflat) in the UK to support carbon and broader greenhouse gas budgeting.

## Monitoring design and study scope
- Locations and habitats
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes (saltmarsh and mudflat habitats; contrasting sediment types: clay soils)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands, West Plain (saltmarsh and mudflat habitats; sandy soils)
  - Coordinates and site-level descriptions provided to reflect habitat diversity, inundation, creek structure, and vegetation differences.
- Sampling and temporal coverage
  - Field campaigns conducted in winter and summer 2013.
  - One replicate in each of seven out of twenty-two quadrats for CO2, N2O, and CH4 flux measurements.
- Variables observed
  - CO2 fluxes analyzed as community Net Primary Productivity (NPP) and Benthic Community Respiration (BCR); CH4 and N2O fluxes measured under darkness.
  - Ancillary variables: Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), air temperature, and atmospheric pressure.

## Methods and data processing
- Observation procedures
  - CO2 fluxes measured with a benthic chamber inserted ~1.5 cm into sediment; coupled to an infrared gas analyzer.
  - Each quadrat had two incubations: ambient light and darkness to derive NPP and BCR.
  - CH4 and N2O fluxes derived from headspace gas samples (20 mL) at five time points during the dark incubation.
- Analytical techniques
  - CH4: Gas chromatography with Flame Ionisation Detector (FID).
  - N2O: Electron Capture Detector (GC system described).
- Data processing and flux calculations
  - CO2: Fluxes derived from linear regression of CO2 mole fraction over time; GPP calculated as NPP + BCR.
  - CH4/N2O: Fluxes obtained via linear regression of gas concentration vs. time or hierarchical nonlinear regression (depending on transport regime).
  - Standardization: Fluxes expressed per unit area and volume, adjusting for temperature, pressure, and molar gas constants to yield units of μmol CO2 m-2 h-1, nmol N2O m-2 s-1, and nmol CH4 m-2 s-1.
- Metadata and data structure
  - Detailed field descriptions include season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale, record, date/time, chamber size, PAR, air pressure, air temperature, and flux values.
  - Data flags and formats: NA values indicate unperformed measurements; datasets stored as text for CO2 fluxes and CSV for CH4/N2O, with Excel as an accessible interim format.

## Data management, quality assurance, and governance
- Data quality and checking
  - Explicit quality control steps indicated; data are checked and transformed for analysis (e.g., regression fits, standardization).
- File formats and accessibility
  - CO2 data: text files from data loggers; CH4/N2O data: CSV from GC; processed in Excel.
  - Metadata and field descriptions accompany the dataset to support reuse and interpretation.
- Data governance considerations
  - Clear documentation of methods, units, and processing enhances transparency and reproducibility.
  - While public sharing barriers are noted in the archetype narrative, this dataset provides comprehensive metadata and standard formats to ease potential sharing and governance review.

## Key variables and outputs (highlights)
- Primary flux metrics
  - CO2: Net Primary Productivity (NPP), Benthic Community Respiration (BCR), and Gross Primary Productivity (GPP = NPP + BCR).
  - CH4 and N2O: Fluxes expressed per unit area and time, derived from headspace gas analyses.
- Supporting measurements
  - PAR, air temperature, and air pressure recorded to contextualize flux calculations.
- Unit normalization and siting details
  - Fluxes standardized for chamber area, temperature, pressure, and molar volume; site- and habitat-specific metadata enable cross-site comparability.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Provides quantitatively derived greenhouse gas fluxes from coastal ecosystems, informing coastal carbon budgeting and ecosystem service assessments.
- Standardized methods and rich metadata support comparability across sites and time, aiding policy decisions on coastal management, restoration, and climate accounting.
- Demonstrates integration of field measurement, laboratory analysis, and statistical processing into a defensible monitoring product.

## Limitations and considerations for interpretation
- Temporal and spatial coverage
  - Data from 2013 winter and summer; limited replicates (seven of 22 quadrats) may affect generalizability beyond studied periods and sites.
- Data richness and completeness
  - Some fields indicate NA where measurements were not performed; data completeness should be considered in policy analyses.
- Data sharing and governance
  - Public data sharing barriers highlighted, though the dataset provides comprehensive formats and metadata to facilitate governance reviews and potential sharing under appropriate policies.
