# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and scope
  - A citizen science-style monitoring program to record plant species in fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories).
  - Goals include learning where wild plants grow, tracking habitat condition, and using plants as indicators to inform UK government and policy.
  - Data are used to assess change over time with annual feedback to participants.
  - Run by BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife; supported by additional partners and NERC UK-SCAPE funding.

- Survey design and data structure
  - Up to 30 indicator species per fine habitat; species lists provided for broad categories when fine-scale identification is difficult.
  - Three survey levels:
    - Wildflower Level: fewer species overall.
    - Indicator Level: all indicator species (robust data).
    - Inventory Level: Indicator Level plus all other vascular plants.
  - All species recorded whether flowering or not.
  - Data entry is online (www.npms.org.uk) with an NPMS App available; paper forms also possible.

- Plots and sampling framework
  - Minimum recommended: 5 plots per allocated kilometre square (3 square plots and 2 linear plots by default; flexibility allowed).
  - Plot types:
    - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); each plot within a single NPMS habitat; aim to sample across different habitats.
    - Linear plots: 1x25 m, following linear features (e.g., hedgerows, margins, water edges); start at feature-grid intersections.
  - Ponds and flushes can be surveyed as linear or square plots; treat accessible features as part of the sampling.
  - Pre-selected plot locations are provided on maps; if inaccessible, self-selected plots (Protocol A) are allowed but should be representative, not biased toward species-rich patches.
  - Multiple squares: if surveying several squares, you may alternate years; maximum of 5 squares per surveyor.

- Plot setup and relocation
  - Emphasis on consistent relocation across years using permanent features, sketches, GPS, and photos.
  - Field sketches with orientation and permanent features help future re-location.
  - Equipment: tape measures, corner markers, forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
  - Documentation of plot location is essential; include grid references or GPS coordinates.

- Recording methodology within plots
  - For each plot, record:
    - Species present and their abundance as percent cover (Domin scale).
    - Percent bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional data (encouraged where possible): vegetation height classes, woodedness (dense trees/shrubs, scattered trees, hedgerow, or none), plot photos, aspect, slope, and management/grazing indicators.
  - Extra species entry option if target species are largely absent; useful for broad-scale analyses but not feeding into habitat-quality metrics.
  - For mixed habitats or edge cases (e.g., flushes, springs, aquatic margins), follow habitat-specific guidance to maximize habitat representation within plots.

- Data handling, access, and support
  - All data should be uploaded online; if online entry is not possible, forms can be mailed.
  - Access rights vary by UK nation; participants should obtain necessary permissions for private land and follow national codes of conduct and biosecurity practices (clean equipment to prevent pest/pathogen spread).
  - Support is available via NPMS contact channels; FAQs and resources are on the NPMS website.

- Habitat types and descriptions (high-level)
  - NPMS covers 11 broad habitat categories, each with 28 fine habitats. Examples include:
    - Broadleaved woodland (dry deciduous, wet woodland) and hedgerows of native species.
    - Native pinewood and juniper scrub.
    - Arable field margins.
    - Lowland grassland (dry acid, dry calcareous, neutral damp, neutral pastures/meadows).
    - Upland grassland (montane acid and montane calcareous).
    - Heathland (dry and dry montane).
    - Bog and wet heath (blanket bog, raised bog, wet heath).
    - Marsh and fen (acidic and base-rich fens/flushes/mires/springs).
    - Freshwater (nutrient-poor/ rich lakes and ponds; rivers and streams).
    - Rock outcrops, cliffs and screes (inland and montane).
    - Coast (coastal saltmarsh, dunes, vegetated shingle, machair, maritime cliffs).
  - Habitat descriptions guide which species lists to use and how to interpret habitat changes over time.

- Practical considerations and safety
  - Some plots may be unsafe (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas); do not survey unsafe locations.
  - Access may vary by country; follow local outdoor access codes and landowner permissions.
  - Biosecurity and personal safety are priorities: inspect gear and footwear between visits; carry a first-aid kit and communicate plans to a buddy or supervisor when possible.

- Next steps for participants
  - Register and enter data online; download the NPMS app for mobile entry.
  - Use the map, plot sketches, photos, and GPS to ensure plots can be relocated in future years.
  - Select plots in representative habitats without bias toward unusually species-rich patches where possible.
  - Follow habitat-specific instructions for plot layout, plot size, and species lists to ensure robust, comparable data over time.

- Contact and additional resources
  - Support email and phone provided for questions.
  - FAQs and resources are available on the NPMS website; data submission and access guidance available in the guidance notes.
