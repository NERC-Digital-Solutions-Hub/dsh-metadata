# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- Aims to collect statistically robust data on where wild plants grow, how habitats change, and to provide indicators for UK government environmental assessments, with annual feedback to participants.
- Run by a partnership of BSBI, CEH, JNCC, and Plantlife; supported by National Museums Northern Ireland and DAERA; UK-SCAPE support acknowledged.

## How the survey works

- Focuses on plant recording in 28 fine NPMS habitats, grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.
- Up to 30 indicator species per habitat (depending on survey level); species lists provided in the NPMS Species Lists booklet.
- Survey levels:
  - Wildflower Level: fewer species recorded (subset of Indicator Level)
  - Indicator Level: robust data using habitat-indicator species
  - Inventory Level: collects all vascular plants present in each plot (overlaps counted)
- Visit cadence: two surveys per year (late spring/early summer and late summer); initial recon visits recommended in the first year.
- Data entry: online at www.npms.org.uk (preferred); NPMS App available; offline forms accepted by post.
- Data submission helps annual habitat reporting and long-term change detection.

## Habitats and species lists

- 28 fine NPMS habitats, mapped into 11 broad categories (see Table 6 in guidance).
- Broad categories include: Broadleaved woodland (Dry deciduous woodland, Wet woodland, Hedgerows), Native pinewood & juniper scrub, Arable field margins, Lowland and Upland grassland, Heathland, Bog & wet heath, Marsh & fen, Freshwater, Rock outcrops/cliffs/scree, and Coast.
- For each broad category, NPMS provides Wildflower and Indicator species counts (e.g., Broadleaved woodland Wildflower 49, Indicator 75; Arable field margins Wildflower 15, Indicator 30).
- Habitat descriptions help identify appropriate species lists and aid habitat-based analyses.

## Plots and plot types

- Plot geometry:
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (woodlands: 10x10 m)
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m
  - Ponds/flushes may be surveyed as linear or square plots, depending on size and accessibility
- Plot allocation:
  - Aim for a minimum of 5 plots per allocated kilometre square; 3 square plots and 2 linear plots recommended per square, but flexible
  - Prefer to place plots in different NPMS habitats within the square
  - Up to 25 pre-selected plot locations provided; use these where they align with NPMS habitats
- Plot relocation:
  - Clear guidance on how to relocate plots in future years (sketches, photos, permanent features, compass directions)
  - Protocol A allows self-selected plots in representative areas to avoid bias
- Accessibility and safety considerations may prevent using some pre-selected plots (safety, access restrictions, disease restrictions)

## Recording in plots

- For all plots, record:
  - Species present (as per relevant habitat list; Inventory Level records all vascular plants)
  - Abundance: percent cover using the Domin scale (1–10, mapped to % cover)
  - Additional percentages: bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen
- Optional but recommended data:
  - Vegetation height classes and scores
  - Woodedness (dense cover, scattered trees/shrubs, hedgerow, none)
  - Plot photos (consistent orientation), field sketches with compass direction
  - Optional attributes: Aspect, Slope, Management, Grazing intensity (with standardized categories)
- For aquatic habitats (lakes, ponds, rivers):
  - Survey from the bank; record vegetation within 1 m of shoreline along 25 m length
  - Do not enter deep water; avoid fluctuating water bodies
- Special habitat notes:
  - Arable margins: linear plots extend 1 m into cultivated area; margins with permanent strips placed at boundary between strip and crop
  - Hedgerows: 25x1 m plot positioned 1 m from hedge center when possible
  - Rivers/streams: margins along bank; plots encompass emergent and submerged vegetation

## Data entry and management

- Enter data online through the NPMS website; if not possible, post monitoring forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.
- Data capture includes plot location (GPS or grid reference) and the plots surveyed.
- Support and FAQs available on NPMS website; contact support@npms.org.uk for assistance.

## Access rights and responsibilities

- Respect countryside users, landowners, and the environment; seek permission on private land where required.
- Follow country-specific access codes (England/Wales Countryside Code; Scotland Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland guidance).
- Biosecurity: clean mud and debris from footwear/equipment between visits to reduce pest/pathogen spread.

## Health and safety

- Volunteer health and safety is the responsibility of the participant.
- Check weather forecasts; abandon if conditions are unsafe.
- Some plots may be inaccessible due to safety concerns; do not survey unsafe areas.
- Recommend buddy system, mobile phone, first-aid kit, and appropriate clothing.

## Support, resources, and tooling

- Training days and workshops available; data can be entered via the NPMS app or online portal.
- Resources include a separate FAQ document, Species Lists booklet, and field guidance notes.
- A field sketch and photo documentation are encouraged to support plot relocation over years.
