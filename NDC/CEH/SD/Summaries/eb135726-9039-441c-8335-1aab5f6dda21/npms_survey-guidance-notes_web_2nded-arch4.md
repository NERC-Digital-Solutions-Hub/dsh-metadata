# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- Aimed at monitoring plant distribution, habitat condition, and environmental state across 28 fine NPMS habitats (11 broad categories) using statistically robust data to inform government and policy, with annual feedback to participants. 
- Run by a partnership of BSBI, CEH, JNCC and Plantlife, with support from NI and DAERA; CEH acknowledges UK-SCAPE funding.

## Data Governance, Lifecycle and Access

- Data collected by volunteers through standardized plots and habitat-specific species lists; three survey levels (Wildflower, Indicator, Inventory) to balance effort and robustness.
- Data entered online via npms.org.uk (with an optional NPMS App) or via paper forms; annual monitoring forms and a Species List booklet accompany fieldwork.
- Metadata and provenance are emphasized: plot location, habitat assignment, year, and survey level are recorded; plots should be relocatable using sketches, photos, compass/GPS references.
- Extra species entry allows recording non-target species for broader analyses; target species feed into habitat quality/trends, while extra data feed general plant change analyses.
- Accessibility and data sharing are supported by guidance and contact channels; safety, ethics, and biosecurity considerations are embedded in the process.

## Survey Design and Sampling Protocols

- Plots are designed for statistical robustness: fixed plots in NPMS habitats with 3 square plots (mostly 5x5 m; 10x10 m in woodlands) and 2 linear plots (1x25 m) per kilometre square, with a minimum recommended set of 5 plots.
- Habitats are categorized into 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories); identify fine habitat when possible to select the correct species list, but broad categories are provided when fine classification is difficult.
- Survey levels progress from Wildflower to Indicator to Inventory, increasing species coverage and data robustness.
- When multiple squares are allocated, survey frequency can be staggered (minimum annually per square; total limit of up to 5 squares per surveyor).

## Plot Selection, Location and Relocation

- Pre-selected plot locations on provided maps guide where to survey, with up to 25 pre-selected plots; Protocol A (self-selection) is allowed to represent average habitat conditions while avoiding bias toward rich areas.
- Plots should be located within a single habitat type and, ideally, across multiple NPMS habitats within a square.
- Locating plots uses map shading, aerial imagery, and ground features to ensure relocatability; important features and sketches/photographs aid year-to-year relocation.
- For self-selected plots, relocateable features should be emphasized over specimen-rich hotspots to maintain dataset representativeness.

## Field Methods: Recording and Plot Layout

- Square plots: 5x5 m (woodland plots 10x10 m); position first side to align with permanent features when possible; SW corner (or chosen corner) can be recorded for GNSS-based relocation.
- Linear plots: 1x25 m, following a ground feature; start at the intersection with a gridline; some plots (e.g., ponds) are linear by nature.
- Vertical plots: For rock outcrops or screes, 2 m high x 12.5 m long; follow safety guidance.
- Ponds, flushes, and waters have special plotting rules; survey from the bank and avoid deep water; ensure plottable area is adequate.
- Equipment and field practices include markers, tapes, GPS/compass, photos, sketches, and field notes; photos and sketches can be uploaded to the NPMS site to support relocation.

## Data Recording: Species, Coverage and Additional Info

- Species presence is recorded within the habitat-specific NPMS lists; Inventory Level includes all vascular plants, while Wildflower/Indicator levels focus on target species.
- Abundance is estimated as percent cover (Domin scale) for each species, with attention to overlapping canopies and layers.
- Additional covers to estimate: bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, moss/lichen (each with Domin-based scoring).
- Optional data: vegetation height classes, woodedness (dense/ scattered/ hedgerow/ none), plot photos, and environmental attributes (aspect, slope, management, grazing) with standardized categories and scales.
- Documentation and forms: field forms, species lists, and guidance notes accompany fieldwork; digital submissions preferred for efficiency and consistency.

## Data Entry, Quality, and Use

- Online data entry is encouraged for timely aggregation and annual reporting; support is available via support@npms.org.uk.
- Paper forms are an alternative submission method; each plot requires a single form that can cover both visits in a year.
- Data quality relies on consistent plot relocation, correct habitat classification, and adherence to the Domin scale for cover calculations.
- Data use supports annual habitat state reporting and long-term monitoring of plant communities and habitat change across the UK.

## Safety, Access, and Responsibilities

- Surveyors must respect countryside users, protect the environment, and act responsibly; safety is a priority.
- Access rights vary by region; follow national guidance (England/Wales: Countryside Code; Scotland: Outdoor Access Code; Northern Ireland: guidance by NI Environment Agency).
- Seek landowner permission where required; NPMS provides a letter for introductions to landowners.
- Biosecurity measures to prevent spread of pests/pathogens between visits; clean footwear and equipment between sites.
- Inaccessible or unsafe plots should be avoided; keep friends informed of plans and carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit.

## Habitat Categories, Species Lists and Interpretation

- 28 fine NPMS habitats mapped to 11 broad categories; if known, use fine habitat lists; otherwise use broad category lists.
- Examples of broad categories include Dry deciduous woodland, Wet woodland, Arable field margins, Lowland grassland, Upland grassland, Heathland, Bog and wet heath, Marsh and fen, Freshwater, Rock outcrops, and Coast.
- Domin scale and plot-reliable interpretation guidance are provided (e.g., 50x50 cm area equals 1% cover for 5x5 m plots; 1x1 m equals 1% for 10x10 m plots).
- Detailed habitat descriptions and species associations are documented in the NPMS materials and resources.

## Support, Resources and Contacts

- Support, FAQs, and resources available on the NPMS website; updates and community discussion via NPMS social channels.
- Key contact: NPMS Support (support@npms.org.uk); Volunteer Coordinator address for data submission (NPMS, Plantlife, Salisbury).

## Summary of Practical Steps for Data Leaders

- Align NPMS data collection with a robust data lifecycle: standardized plots, habitat-specific species lists, three survey levels, and rigorous relocation metadata.
- Leverage online data entry and the NPMS App to standardize data capture and facilitate annual reporting.
- Maintain clear data governance: habitat classification, plot location, survey year, and level; document methodology and any deviations.
- Prioritize data quality and reproducibility by ensuring plots are relocatable, using sketches/photos, and recording target vs. extra species data as appropriate.
- Incorporate safety, access, and biosecurity considerations to minimize risk and protect data integrity across fieldwork networks.
