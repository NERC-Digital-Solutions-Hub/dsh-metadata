# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

## Aim and scope
- An ambitious survey to monitor plant distributions and habitat condition across 28 fine NPMS habitats (grouped into 11 broad categories).
- Uses plant species as indicators to assess habitat quality and track changes over time.
- Provides statistically robust data to inform UK governments and delivers annual feedback to participants.

## Participants and organizational context
- Run by a partnership: BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife; with support from NI and DAERA.
- Volunteers participate in defined kilometre squares and submit data through standardized surveys.
- A dedicated NPMS support team offers guidance, training, FAQs, and contact options.

## Data governance, standards, and provenance
- Data collected via standardized plot-based surveys with clear habitat assignment and species lists.
- Three survey levels (Wildflower, Indicator, Inventory) determine the number of species recorded per plot.
- Data quality emphasis: accurate habitat typing, consistent metadata (plots, GPS, photos, sketches), and careful recording of species presence and abundance.
- Habitat classification informs the appropriate NPMS species lists; 28 fine habitats mapped to 11 broad categories.
- Protocols support data comparability over time and across sites, enabling robust temporal analyses.

## Survey design and data collection workflow
- Plots: 5x5 m square plots (10x10 m in woodlands) and 1x25 m linear plots; each plot should lie within a single NPMS habitat.
- Plot selection: aim for 3 square plots and 2 linear plots per kilometre square; use pre-selected locations but apply Protocol A to self-select plots when necessary to represent typical habitat conditions.
- Plot relocation: detailed sketch, compass direction, GPS coordinates, and photos to facilitate future re-surveys.

## Habitat types and plotting guidance (summary)
- 28 fine NPMS habitats organized into 11 broad categories (e.g., Broadleaved woodland; Native pinewood; Arable field margins; Lowland grassland; Upland grassland; Heathland; Bog and wet heath; Marsh and fen; Freshwater; Rock outcrops; Coast).
- Habitat descriptions guide species lists selection and survey methods (e.g., arable margins, hedgerows, standing waters, springs, flushes, wetlands, coastal habitats).
- Some habitats require specialized plotting (e.g., vertical plots for rock faces, 1x25 m linear plots for water margins, ponds, and streams).

## How to record in plots
- Use habitat-specific NPMS species lists; Inventory Level records all vascular plants; other levels record reduced subsets (Wildflower or Indicator levels).
- For each plot:
  - Record which species are present.
  - Estimate percentage cover for each species using the Domin scale (1–5–10 scale equivalents explained in guidance).
  - Record percent bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional but encouraged: vegetation height, woodedness, plot aspect, slope, management, and grazing indicators with described scoring schemes.
  - Take a plot photo from a consistent vantage point each survey.
- Extra species entry: an optional field to note additional species of interest not on target lists.
- Data entry: enter online at npms.org.uk (registration required); if offline, submit monitoring forms by post.

## Plot layout, relocation, and field methods
- Square plots: consistently 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands); align sides with permanent features when possible; mark corners and photograph surroundings.
- Linear plots: 1x25 m, following a linear habitat feature; start at gridline intersection and extend along the feature; photograph and sketch as for squares.
- Special habitats: ponds/flushes may be surveyed as linear or square plots; ensure plots maximize NPMS habitat representation when small.
- Ponds, lakes, rivers, and other water bodies: survey from the bank; avoid entering deep water; irrigate survey length as needed.
- Sketch maps and GPS: keep field sketches with compass orientation and permanent features; upload to NPMS data entry system; GPS recommended as a supplementary tool.

## Data entry, access, and support
- Data submission: online entry is encouraged for annual reporting and time-series analyses; alternative submission by post is available.
- Support: NPMS support email and phone numbers provided; a separate FAQ document available on the NPMS website.
- Access and rights: follow country-specific access codes (England/Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland) and obtain permissions as required; a landowner introduction letter is available for download.

## Health, safety, and biosecurity
- Survey participants are responsible for their own safety; assess weather and site risks; avoid unsafe areas.
- Work with a buddy when possible; carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, and appropriate clothing.
- Biosecurity: clean mud and debris from footwear and equipment between visits to prevent spread of pests and pathogens.

## Support, training, and ongoing improvements
- Workshops and training days are offered; keep up to date via the NPMS website and social channels.
- FAQs and additional resources are provided to help with methodology and data submission.

## Appendix: Detailed habitat descriptions (highlights)
- Broadleaved woodland: includes dry deciduous woodland, wet woodland, and native hedgerows; focus on native species and characteristic ground flora.
- Native pinewood & juniper scrub: emphasizes Caledonian forest and juniper scrub; avoid plantations where possible.
- Arable field margins: margins alongside annually cultivated crops; where permanent strips exist, survey boundary areas.
- Lowland and upland grasslands: detailed distinctions among dry acid, dry calcareous, neutral damp, and neutral pastures/meadows; upland variants include montane acid and calcareous grasslands.
- Heathland: dry and montane variants; management and grazing influence species composition.
- Bog and wet heath: blanket bog, raised bog, and wet heath with attention to hydrology and peat depth.
- Marsh and fen: includes acidic and base-rich fens, flushes, mires, and springs; differences guided by water chemistry and hydrology.
- Freshwater: nutrient-poor and nutrient-rich lakes/ponds; rivers and streams; sampling from banks with attention to water body's condition.
- Rock outcrops and montane rocks: plotting on base of cliffs and rocky crests; careful in montane regions.
- Coast: coastal saltmarsh, dunes, vegetated shingle, machair, and maritime cliffs/slopes; heightened caution near tides and erosion-prone areas.

Note: Domin scale and plotting specifics are provided to standardize percent cover assessments and ensure data comparability across years and sites.
