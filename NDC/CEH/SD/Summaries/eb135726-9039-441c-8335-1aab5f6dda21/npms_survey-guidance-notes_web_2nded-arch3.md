# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- A nationwide scheme to monitor plant life in specific habitats to learn where wild plants grow, track habitat condition, and provide evidence for policy and future decisions.
- Run by a partnership of BSBI, CEH, JNCC, Plantlife, with support from National Museums NI and DAERA; funded by UK organisations (UK-SCAPE/NERC support noted).
- Provides volunteers with training, guidance, and annual feedback on results; data contribute to state-of-habitat reporting and inform government and conservation actions.

## How the monitoring works

- Focus: abundance of plant sets within fixed plots across 28 fine NPMS habitats, which are grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.
- Habitat targeting: ideally identify the fine habitat; if uncertain, use broad category lists. Species lists are provided for both broad and fine habitats.
- Survey levels (for data depth and effort):
  - Wildflower Level: recording fewer target species.
  - Indicator Level: uses all indicator species chosen for habitat quality.
  - Inventory Level: like Indicator Level plus recording all other vascular plants present.
  - At all levels, record whether species are flowering or not.
- Plots and layout:
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m (for features like field margins, hedgerows, waters, etc.).
  - Plots should be within a single NPMS habitat; aim to sample multiple habitats per square when possible.
  - Preferrably locate plots in pre-selected locations, but Protocol A allows self-selected plots to better represent typical habitat.
  - Ponds/flushes may be included as linear or square plots; survey priority given to accessible plots.
- Data entry and management:
  - Enter findings online at npms.org.uk when possible; an NPMS app is also available.
  - If online entry is not possible, survey forms can be posted to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator.
  - Extra species entry is available online if target species are scarce; this data is useful for broader analyses but not for habitat-quality indices.
- Plot placement and relocation:
  - Aids to relocation include map features, sketches, photos, compass directions, and stable reference points.
  - GPS can improve accuracy but should complement, not replace, field notes and sketches.
  - Where plots change habitat over time, use the current habitat’s species list for each survey; continue monitoring plots even if they temporarily fall outside the scheme.
- Survey frequency and scope:
  - Each allocated 1 km square should be surveyed at least three square plots and two linear plots, with flexibility based on square characteristics.
  - If surveying multiple squares, you may alternate years, ensuring at least one square is surveyed each year; maximum five squares per surveyor.
  - In the first year, an initial reconnaissance visit may help locate plots.
- Handling non-detects and accessibility:
  - If NPMS habitats or plots are unsafe or inaccessible, do not survey; safety takes priority.
  - If some pre-selected plots are not in NPMS habitats, you can mark them as “not in scheme” and revisit in future years.
  - If plots fall outside habitat definitions, continue monitoring with available NPMS lists as long as feasible.
- Recording details within plots:
  - For each plot, record present species and estimate their percent cover using the Domin scale.
  - Also record: percent bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional: vegetation height, woodedness, plot photos (same position each time), plot aspect, slope, management, and grazing intensity.
  - Management and grazing are described with categories to capture human influence on habitats.
- Plot design specifics:
  - Square plots: 5x5 m; woodland plots are 10x10 m.
  - Linear plots: usually 1x25 m; some habitats may require vertical plots (2 m high x 12.5 m for rock outcrops/screes).
  - Ponds and flushes: special plotting rules to maximise NPMS habitat representation while maintaining safety.
- Data handling and accessibility:
  - Data entry supports annual reporting and long-term trend analysis.
  - Forms and guidance are available on the NPMS website; printable and downloadable resources accompany the survey notes.

## What to record and how

- Core: presence/absence of target species; percent cover per species (Domin scale); percent cover of bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
- Extra data (optional but recommended when possible):
  - Vegetation height classes with scores.
  - Woodedness categories (dense, scattered, hedgerow, none).
  - Plot photos (taken from the same position each survey).
  - Additional site attributes: aspect, slope, management actions (e.g., grazing, cutting), grazing intensity.
- Data submission:
  - Use online entry when possible; if not, submit paper forms by post.
  - Data completeness, including plot location (grid reference or GPS), is important for long-term analyses.

## Habitat types and alignment

- NPMS uses 28 fine habitats, grouped into 11 broad categories (e.g., Broadleaved woodland, Native pinewood & juniper scrub, Arable field margins, Lowland/Upland grasslands, Heathland, Bog & wet heath, Marsh & fen, Freshwater, Rock outcrops, Coast).
- Where possible, use fine-scale habitat classifications to select the most relevant species list; when unsure, apply the broad category, noting its broader species list.
- Habitat descriptions and corresponding indicator/wildflower species counts are aligned with established British habitat guides.

## Access, health, safety, and governance

- Access rights and responsibilities vary by UK region; follow national codes (Countryside Code, Scottish Outdoor Access Code, NI guidance).
- The NPMS provides letters of introduction to landowners to facilitate access where possible.
- Biosecurity: clean footwear/equipment between visits to reduce spread of pests/pathogens.
- Health and safety: surveyors are responsible for their own safety; assess weather, terrain, and potential hazards; avoid high-risk areas; consider buddy systems and carry communication equipment.
- Data governance: outputs support policy and habitat reporting; data sharing occurs under appropriate governance with involvement from partners and sponsors.

## Support and contacts

- Support and training information available via NPMS website, with dedicated contact emails and phone numbers for survey assistance and data entry support.
