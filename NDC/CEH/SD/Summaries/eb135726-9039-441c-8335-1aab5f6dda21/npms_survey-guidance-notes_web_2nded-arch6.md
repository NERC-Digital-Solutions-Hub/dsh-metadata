# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- The NPMS is a plant-recording survey focused on 28 fine NPMS habitats (which roll up into 11 broad habitat categories) to track where wild plants grow, how habitats change, and to provide evidence for government bodies. Volunteers receive annual feedback on results. The scheme is led by BSBI, CEH, JNCC and Plantlife, with support from NI and DAERA.

- What data are collected
  - For each habitat, up to 30 indicator species (finer lists exist; broader lists available when needed).
  - Three survey levels of data detail: Wildflower Level, Indicator Level, and Inventory Level (Inventory Level includes all vascular plants in a plot).
  - Additional non-plant observations optional (e.g., vegetation height, woodedness, aspect, slope, management, grazing).

- Data collection framework
  - Plot types: 
    - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
    - Linear plots: 1x25 m (often along features like hedgerows, margins, rivers).
    - Ponds and flushes can be sampled as square or linear plots depending on size and access.
  - Habitat assignment:
    - Identify the NPMS habitat (fine) if possible; otherwise use the broad category list.
    - If a plot transitions to a habitat not covered by NPMS, continue recording with the closest appropriate NPMS list for as long as possible.
  - Plot allocation and relocation
    - Each survey is in a registered kilometre square with pre-selected plot locations on a map.
    - Protocol A allows self-selected plots to represent typical habitat, aimed at unbiased placement.
    - Plots should be relocatable in subsequent years; document precise position through sketches, photos, GPS coordinates, and compass directions.
  - Data entry and submission
    - Enter data online at npms.org.uk (primary method); NPMS App also available for data entry.
    - Monitoring forms accompany the guidance and can be downloaded.
    - Each plot requires a dedicated form; the same form can be used for two visits if surveying twice in a year.
    - Location data (grid reference and/or GPS) is essential when submitting.

- Survey timing and frequency
  - Visitors survey plots twice per year: late spring/early summer and late summer.
  - In the first year, a reconnaissance visit may help locate plots and get to know the square.
  - If surveying multiple squares, intervals are allowed (minimums per year can vary), with a maximum of five squares per surveyor.

- How to lay out and record plots
  - Square plots: fixed sizes; create a right-angled square, mark corners, photograph the plot, and sketch its position and orientation.
  - Linear plots: start at the intersection with a gridline; lay out along the feature; photograph and sketch; document the exact length when habitats are shorter than the plot.
  - Tools recommended: measuring tape/cord, markers, NPMS forms, clipboard, GPS/compass, camera, pencils.
  - Relocation aids: place plots near permanent features; record orientation and notable ground features; use pre-selected locations where possible.

- Special habitat instructions
  - Arable field margins: extend 1 m into the cultivated edge; follow rules for permanent strips or edges.
  - Road verges: sample only where they correspond to NPMS habitats.
  - Hedgerows: sample ground flora 1 m from hedge center if possible; otherwise sample outer 1 m.
  - Standing waters and rivers: sample from the bank; 25 m along the bank and 1 m out; avoid water entry and heavily fluctuating water bodies.
  - Springs and flushes: use plots that maximize the NPMS habitat proportion (50% minimum); confine recording to flush/spring areas when other habitats are present.

- Recording in plots
  - For each plot, record which species are present and estimate their abundance as percent cover using the Domin scale (1–10 scale on the back of the guidance).
  - Also record percentages of bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
  - Optional data: vegetation height classes, woodedness, plot photos, and other site attributes (aspect, slope, management, grazing) with defined categories.
  - Inventory Level requires recording all vascular plants in the plot, including shrubs and trees overlapping the plot.

- Data validation and handling missing data
  - If target species are absent in a plot, record the available species and note habitat context; an online “Extra species entry” allows recording other notable species outside the target lists.
  - If plots become non-NPMS habitats, continue data collection with the closest relevant NPMS list to maximize long-term change detection.
  - If access is not possible or a plot is unsafe, mark as not in scheme or skip; documentation helps future resilience of the dataset.

- Habitat types and indicators (summary)
  - 11 broad habitat categories with 28 fine NPMS habitats, including:
    - Broadleaved woodland (dry deciduous woodland, wet woodland, hedgerows)
    - Native pinewood & juniper scrub
    - Arable field margins
    - Lowland grassland (dry acid, dry calcareous, neutral damp, neutral pastures/meadows)
    - Upland grassland (montane acid and montane calcareous)
    - Heathland (dry, dry montane)
    - Bog & wet heath (blanket bog, raised bog, wet heath)
    - Marsh & fen (acidic fens/flushes/mires/springs; base-rich variants)
    - Freshwater (nutrient-poor/ nutrient-rich lakes/ponds; rivers and streams)
    - Rock outcrops, cliffs & screes (inland and montane)
    - Coast (coastal saltmarsh, dunes, vegetated shingle, machair, maritime cliffs)
  - Habitat descriptions and examples are provided to aid correct classification and species list selection.

- Data use, access, and support
  - Data contribute to annual reporting on habitat state and long-term habitat change.
  - Guidance, FAQs, and support are available via the NPMS website; contact support@npms.org.uk for assistance.
  - Access rights differ by country within the UK; guidance aligns with local access codes (England/Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
  - A landowner introduction letter is available to help obtain access when needed.
  - Biosecurity: clean gear to prevent spillover of pests/pathogens between sites.

- Health and safety and ethics
  - Surveyors are responsible for their own safety; check weather forecasts; avoid unsafe locations; consider working with a buddy.
  - Carry a mobile phone, first-aid kit, appropriate clothing, and keep to public rights of way and accessible land.
