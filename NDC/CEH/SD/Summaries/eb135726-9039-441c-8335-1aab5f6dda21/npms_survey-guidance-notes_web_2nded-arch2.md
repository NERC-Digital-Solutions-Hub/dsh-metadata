# National Plant Monitoring Scheme

- A nationwide scheme to monitor plant communities in specific habitats (NPMS habitats) to assess habitat condition and inform policy over time.
- Led by a partnership: Botanical Society of Britain and Ireland (BSBI), Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), Plantlife; with support from National Museums Northern Ireland and DAERA.
- Provides participants with annual feedback and aims to produce statistically robust data on plant abundance and habitat change.

## How the survey works

- Focus on 28 fine NPMS habitats, which are grouped into 11 broad NPMS categories.
- Record abundance of up to 30 indicator species per habitat (or all species at inventory level); species lists are habitat- and level-specific (Wildflower, Indicator, or Inventory).
- Data collected include species presence and percent cover using the Domin scale; additional habitat features (bare ground, litter, rock, moss) are recorded.
- Data entry is online via npms.org.uk; paper forms are available if needed and can be mailed.

## Survey levels

- Wildflower Level: record fewer species (subset of Indicator Level species).
- Indicator Level: record all indicator species for robust habitat-quality data.
- Inventory Level: record all vascular plants present in each plot (including overlapping shrubs/trees).

## Plots and layout

- Plots are fixed within NPMS habitats to enable long-term change detection.
- Plot types:
  - Square plots: 5x5 m (10x10 m in woodlands).
  - Linear plots: 1x25 m (for sampling linear habitats like margins, hedgerows, streams).
- Habitat-specific plotting:
  - Most plots in a year should be in different fine NPMS habitats; aim for representation across habitat types.
  - Ponds or flushes can be included; such plots count toward minimums if accessible.
- Plot locations are aligned with pre-selected plot locations on your map; Protocol A allows self-selected plots when pre-selected locations are unsuitable.
- Location accuracy is important for relocation; include sketches, photos, and compass directions to aid future re-surveys.

## How to record in your plots

- For each plot, use the relevant NPMS habitat species list (except Inventory Level, which records all vascular plants).
- Record:
  - Species presence.
  - Abundance as percent cover using the Domin scale.
  - Percent bare ground, litter, bare rock/gravel, and moss/lichen.
- Optional information (encouraged where possible):
  - Vegetation height, woodedness, plot photos, aspect, slope, management, and grazing.
- Take a plot photo from the same position each year to document change.
- If species or habitats are not present, recording fewer species can still be valuable; an “extra species entry” option is available for additional observations.

## Plot relocation and tracking

- Include a sketch map with plot orientation and permanent features to aid relocation.
- Mark or pace out plot boundaries; GPS coordinates can be used as a supplement but not a replacement for field notes.
- For water-related plots, survey from the bank and avoid entering deep water; ponds with fluctuating levels may be excluded.

## Plot selection details

- Protocol A (Self-selecting plots): place plots in representative areas within a habitat rather than the most-species-rich spots; avoid obvious disturbances to reduce bias.
- Linear plots are positioned to intersect features (e.g., margins, hedgerows, streams); two accessible linear plots per square are recommended.
- If pre-selected plot locations are not suitable, alternative options include surveying around a nearby feature (e.g., a flush) or increasing the number of linear plots.

## Data submission and support

- Enter data online at www.npms.org.uk; register if new to the site.
- If online submission is not possible, post forms to the NPMS Volunteer Coordinator at Plantlife, Salisbury.
- Support and FAQs are available via the NPMS website; contact support@npms.org.uk for assistance.

## Access rights, biosecurity, and safety

- Respect countryside access rights and others’ interests; follow local codes (England/Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland).
- Obtain permission to access private land where required; carry a letter of introduction if helpful.
- Biosecurity: clean mud from footwear/equipment between visits to minimize pest/pathogen spread.
- Health and safety: assess weather, avoid unsafe surveying conditions (steep slopes, cliffs, tidal areas); work with a buddy if possible; carry a mobile phone and first-aid kit; wear appropriate clothing and footwear.

## Habitat types (11 broad categories; 28 fine NPMS habitats)

- Broadleaved woodland (Dry deciduous woodland, Wet woodland, Hedgerows of native species) and related fine habitats.
- Native pinewood & juniper scrub (Conifer woods and juniper scrub) and guidelines on native pines versus plantations.
- Arable field margins.
- Lowland grassland (Dry acid, Dry calcareous, Neutral damp, Neutral pastures and meadows).
- Upland grassland (Montane acid, Montane calcareous).
- Heathland (Dry heathland, Dry montane heathland).
- Bog & wet heath (Blanket bog, Raised bog, Wet heath) with notes on degradation and management impacts.
- Marsh & fen (Acidic fens/flushes/mires/springs; Base-rich fens/flushes/mires/springs).
- Freshwater (Nutrient-poor lakes/ponds; Nutrient-rich lakes/ponds; Rivers and streams).
- Rock outcrops, cliffs & screes (Inland rocks and scree; Montane rocks and scree).
- Coast (Coastal saltmarsh, Coastal sand dunes, Coastal vegetated shingle, Machair, Maritime cliff tops and slopes).

- Each broad category includes guidance on typical habitats, key indicator species, and notes on regional variation, management impacts, and distinctive subtypes.

## How to interpret and use results

- NPMS outputs are designed to detect change in plant communities and habitat condition over time.
- Data collected feed annual reporting on habitat state and change, supporting government and policy evaluations.

## Special notes

- If plots fall outside NPMS habitat definitions in a given year, continue monitoring with the NPMS species list for as long as possible to maximize data on habitat change.
- Empty or null returns are allowed and can be revisited in future years.
- Access limitations, health and safety considerations, and land-management contexts may require flexibility in plot placement and survey frequency.
