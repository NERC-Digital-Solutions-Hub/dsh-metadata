# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Overview
- ESRI Shapefile (MH_Vegetation.shp) containing polygons of vegetation types digitized from Moor House National Nature Reserve vegetation map.
- Original field mapping carried out in 1960–1961; final map consolidated around 16 vegetation units from an initial ~30 units.
- Data produced by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, with the original map created by Eddy, Welch, and Rawes (1960–1965).
- Vegetation types and codes based on McVean and Ratcliffe (1962); nomenclature follows Clapham et al. (1952).
- Documented in Document Version 1 (18/1/2013) with references for further detail.

## Data contents
- Polygons representing areas of vegetation.
- Attributes:
  - VEG (text): vegetation type description.
  - SYMBOL (numeric): code representing the vegetation description.
- Classified into 16 mapped units (scaling decisions made for clarity).

## Spatial and technical details
- Scale: Mapped at 1:10560 (6 inches to the mile base map).
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36).
- Projection: Transverse Mercator, Great Britain.

## Data lineage, methods, and governance
- Mapping performed onto a base map at approximately 1:10560; field work in 1960–1961 with subsequent re-evaluation leading to 16 units.
- Original map produced by Eddy, Welch, and Rawes; vegetation descriptions aligned with McVean & Ratcliffe (1962).
- References for detail and nomenclature: Clapham et al. (1952); Eddy, Welch & Rawes (1968); McVean & Ratcliffe (1962); Environmental Change Network resources.

## Vegetation unit codes (example mappings)
- 2 SPHAGNETO-JUNCETUM EFFUSI: Common along stream/valley drains; Juncus effusus, Polytrichum commune, Sphagnum recurvum.
- 3 TRICHOPHORO-ERIOPHORETUM: Blanket bog with Trichophorum cespitosum and Eriophorum vaginatum; Calluna vulgaris may be prominent.
- 4 SANDSTONE SCREE: Scree vegetation; high bryophyte/lichen presence due to soil absence.
- 10 MADE GROUND: Mapped disturbance from mining/quarrying.
- 60 JUNCETUM SQUARROSUS SA (sub-alpinum): Species-poor, dominated by Juncus squarrosus.
- 69 CALCAREOUS SPRINGS: Emergent vegetation around limestone springs; zoned and species-rich.
- 117 CALLUNEO-ERIOPHORETUM: Uneroded bog with Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum; burn-related facies.
- 120 FESTUCETUM: Grass-dominated by Festuca spp.
- 129 ERODING BOG: Blanket bog with >30% erosion; recolonisation partial.
- 132 PTERIDIETUM: Bracken-dominated communities.
- 136 AGROSTO-FESTUCETUM: Dry, species-rich, heavily grazed grasslands.
- 140 SPHAGNETO-CARICETUM ALPINUM: Slopes with organic soils; Sphagna and Carices, etc.
- 149 NARDETUM SUB-ALPINUM: Species-poor, dominated by Nardus stricta.
- 161 ERIOPHORETUM: Blanket bog dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum.
- 171 RECOLONISED PEAT: Areas of peat recolonised by vegetation.
- 203 FLUSHED GLEYS: Vegetation on base-rich flushed gley soils.

## Data use considerations for data leaders
- Provides a capable geospatial vegetation dataset with clear provenance, classification scheme, and a well-documented lineage.
- Useful for cross-referencing legacy vegetation data with modern GIS assets, policy planning, and ecological assessments.
- Highlights a need for robust metadata, including classification mapping, provenance, and cross-walks to current standards.
- Consider opportunities to:
  - Update metadata to explicitly document data quality, gaps, and any access constraints.
  - Link the historic classification (McVean & Ratcliffe; Clapham et al.) to modern vegetation schemes.
  - Ensure discoverability by aligning with data catalogs and potential integration with partner datasets.
