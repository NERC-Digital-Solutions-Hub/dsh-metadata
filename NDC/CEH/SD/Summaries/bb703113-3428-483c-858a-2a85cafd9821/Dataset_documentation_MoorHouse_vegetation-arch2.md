# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Overview
- ESRI Shapefile MH_Vegetation.shp containing polygons representing vegetation areas.
- Digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology from the Moor House National Nature Reserve vegetation study.
- Original map created by Eddy, A., Welch, D., & Rawes, M. (1960–1965) at the Nature Conservancy's Moor House Field Station.
- Mapping scale: 1:10560 (6 inches to the mile); field mapping conducted in 1960–1961.
- Final map consolidates roughly 30 units into 16 units for clarity.
- Classification and nomenclature follow established botanical references:
  - McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) for vegetation descriptions.
  - Clapham, Tutin & Warburg (1952) for nomenclature.
- See listed references for further detail; related literature from 1968 (Plant Ecology) and Environmental Change Network.

## Spatial and data details
- Format: ESRI Shapefile; contains polygon geometries.
- Attributes:
  - VEG: text description of vegetation type.
  - SYMBOL: numeric code corresponding to vegetation description.
- Spatial reference: British National Grid (OSGB1936), projection: Transverse Mercator—Great Britain.
- Extent and coordinate system designed for compatibility with British ecological mapping efforts.

## Vegetation units and codes
- The dataset maps vegetation types with numeric SYMBOL codes and descriptive names, including examples:
  - 2 SPHAGNETO-JUNCETUM EFFUSI
  - 3 TRICHOPHORO-ERIOPHORETUM
  - 4 SANDSTONE SCREE
  - 10 MADE GROUND
  - 60 JUNCETUM SQUARROSUS SA (sub-alpinum)
  - 69 CALCAREOUS SPRINGS
  - 117 CALLUNETO-ERIOPHORETUM
  - 120 FESTUCETUM
  - 129 ERODING BOG
  - 132 PTERIDIETUM
  - 136 AGROSTO-FESTUCETUM
  - 140 SPHAGNETO-CARICETUM ALPINUM
  - 149 NARDETUM SUB-ALPINUM
  - 161 ERIOPHORETUM
  - 171 RECOLONISED PEAT
  - 203 FLUSHED GLEYS
- Descriptions emphasize ecological and floristic characteristics, often noting dominant species and habitat conditions (e.g., bogs, springs, scree, mining-disturbed ground).
- The full list and descriptions reference McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) and related sources.

## Provenance and references
- Original map authors: Eddy, A.; Welch, D.; Rawes, M. (1960–1965).
- Later mapping and detailing work by Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Botanical nomenclature follows Clapham, Tutin & Warburg (1952).
- Further detail available in Eddy, Welch & Rawes (1968) and related literature.
- Environmental Change Network cited as a related data reference.

## Data use and accessibility
- Data are stored as an ESRI Shapefile with clearly defined fields (VEG and SYMBOL) for interpretation.
- Provides a standardized, documentation-backed classification framework suitable for GIS analysis and historical baseline comparisons.
- Designed to be integrated with other datasets to enhance value and enable broader data accessibility.

## Relevance to environmental monitoring
- Delivers spatially explicit, standardized vegetation classifications suitable as a historical baseline for habitat monitoring and policy assessment.
- Clear provenance and methodological notes support reproducibility and comparability over time.
- The maintained metadata and explicit classification scheme facilitate integration into broader environmental health assessments.

## Limitations and considerations
- Historical data dating from 1960–1965; may not reflect current vegetation conditions.
- 16-unit simplification replaces the original ~30 units, potentially reducing fine-grained detail.
- Classification references are historic; users should consult primary sources for detailed definitions and species composition.
- Coordinate system is OSGB36; ensure re-projection when integrating with datasets in other coordinate systems.
