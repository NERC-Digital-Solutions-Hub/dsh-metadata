# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Document overview
- ESRI Shapefile containing polygons representing vegetation types in Moor House NNR, northern Pennines, England.
- Digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology from the Moor House vegetation study.
- Original map created by Eddy, Welch, and Rawes (1960–1965) at the Nature Conservancy Moor House Field Station.

## Data format and content
- File: MH_Vegetation.shp
- Columns:
  - VEG: text description of vegetation type (per McVean and Ratcliffe, 1962)
  - SYMBOL: numeric code for vegetation description
- Versioning and mapping conventions:
  - Resolution: mapped at 1:10560 (6 inches to the mile)
  - Base map alignment: on a base map scaled 1:10560
  - Final map grouped into 16 vegetation units for clarity

## Spatial reference and coordinate system
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36)
- Projection: Transverse Mercator, Great Britain
- Extent and scale details:
  - Extent/coverage corresponds to Moor House NNR
  - Projection used: British National Grid OSGB1936

## Mapping methodology and units
- Field mapping conducted in 1960–1961; mapping informed by physiognomy to approximate units from McVean and Ratcliffe (1962)
- Initially around 30 units; final map consolidates into 16 units for clarity

## Vegetation types and codes (illustrative examples)
- SPHAGNETO-JUNCETUM EFFUSI, SYMBOL 2: stream/river valleys with gleyed peaty silts
- TRICHOPHORO-ERIOPHORETUM, SYMBOL 3: blanket bog below 600 m with high water table
- SANDSTONE SCREE, SYMBOL 4: vegetation among scree with limited soil
- MADE GROUND, SYMBOL 10: disturbed ground from mining/quarrying
- JUNCETUM SQUARROSUS SA (sub-alpinum), SYMBOL 60: species-poor unit dominated by Juncus squarrosus
- CALCAREOUS SPRINGS, SYMBOL 69: vegetation around springs/flushes, often zoned and species-rich
- CALLUNETO-ERIOPHORETUM, SYMBOL 117: uneroded bog dominated by Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum
- FESTUCETUM, SYMBOL 120: grasslands dominated by Festuca spp.
- ERODING BOG, SYMBOL 129: blanket bog with substantial surface erosion and recolonisation
- PTERIDIETUM, SYMBOL 132: bracken-dominated communities
- AGROSTO-FESTUCETUM, SYMBOL 136: dry, species-rich, heavily grazed grasslands
- SPHAGNETO-CARICETUM ALPINUM, SYMBOL 140: slopes with Sphagna and Carices
- NARDETUM SUB-ALPINUM, SYMBOL 149: species-poor tussocks of Nardus stricta
- ERIOPHORETUM, SYMBOL 161: blanket bog with Eriophorum vaginatum
- RECOLONISED PEAT, SYMBOL 171: areas recolonised by vegetation
- FLUSHED GLEYS, SYMBOL 203: vegetation on base-rich flushed gley soils

## Provenance, references, and metadata
- Primary references:
  - Clapham, Tutin & Warburg (1952)
  - Eddy, Welch & Rawes (1968) Plant Ecology
  - McVean & Ratcliffe (1962)
- Related data and context:
  - Environmental Change Network references provided for further detail
- Nomenclature follows Clapham et al. (1952) in botanical names

## Implications for monitoring and governance
- Provides a standardized spatial dataset of vegetation types suitable for long-term monitoring and trend analysis.
- Metadata and provenance are explicit, supporting data quality checks and reproducibility.
- The 16-unit consolidation offers a balance between detail and usability for policy evaluation and reporting.
- Potential considerations for reuse:
  - Legacy data specifics (1960s mapping) may require modernization or harmonization with newer datasets
  - Ensure alignment of vegetation units with current monitoring objectives and metadata standards
  - Access to original data and documentation is critical for evaluation and data governance
