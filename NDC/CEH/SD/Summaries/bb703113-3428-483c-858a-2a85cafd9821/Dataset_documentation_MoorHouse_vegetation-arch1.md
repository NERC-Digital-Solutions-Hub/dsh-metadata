# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Overview
- ESRI Shapefile (MH_Vegetation.shp) containing polygons for vegetation areas digitized from Moor House NNR vegetation study in the northern Pennines, England.
- Original map created by Eddy, Welch, and Rawes (1960–1965) at the Nature Conservancy's Moor House Field Station.
- Data representing vegetation types and codes derived from historical classifications.

## Data Format and Spatial Reference
- Format: ESRI Shapefile
- Attributes:
  - VEG: text description of vegetation type (per McVean and Ratcliffe, 1962)
  - SYMBOL: numeric code for vegetation description
- Resolution: Mapped at 1:10560 (6 inches to the mile base map)
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB1936)
- Projection: Transverse Mercator (Great Britain)
- Extent: Moor House region within the British National Grid

## Mapping Details and Data Provenance
- Mapping base: scale 1:10560; units chosen subjectively to reflect physiognomy
- Field work: conducted in 1960 and 1961
- Unitization: initially about 30 units; final map grouped into 16 units for clarity
- Data source: Centre for Ecology & Hydrology digitized the vegetation from the original map
- Original references for classification and nomenclature included in the record

## Vegetation Codes and Descriptions (sample)
- SYMBOL 2: SPHAGNETO-JUNCETUM EFFUSI — typically along stream/river valleys; drainage of alluvium impeded; soils are gleyed peaty silts; dominant species include Juncus effusus, Polytrichum commune, Sphagnum recurvum
- SYMBOL 3: TRICHOPHORO-ERIOPHORETUM — often with Calluna vulgaris; blanket bog below 600 m with high water table
- SYMBOL 4: SANDSTONE SCREE — vegetation among scree; lack of soil; bryophytes/lichens dominating
- SYMBOL 10: MADE GROUND — areas disturbed by mining/quarrying
- SYMBOL 60: JUNCETUM SQUARROSUS SA (sub-alpinum) — species-poor; constant species Juncus squarrosus
- SYMBOL 69: CALCAREOUS SPRINGS — near limestone outcrops; variable yet often species-rich
- SYMBOL 117: CALLUNO-ERIOPHORETUM — uneroded bog dominated by Calluna vulgaris and Eriophorum vaginatum or seral post-burn
- SYMBOL 120: FESTUCETUM — grasslands dominated by Festuca spp.
- SYMBOL 129: ERODING BOG — blanket bog with substantial surface erosion and recolonization
- SYMBOL 132: PTERIDIETUM — bracken-dominated communities
- SYMBOL 136: AGROSTO-FESTUCETUM — dry, species-rich grasslands; heavily grazed
- SYMBOL 140: SPHAGNETO-CARICETUM ALPINUM — slopes with organic-rich soils; moss carpets with Carices and Eriophorum
- SYMBOL 149: NARDETUM SUB-ALPINUM — species-poor; dominated by Nardus stricta
- SYMBOL 161: ERIOPHORETUM — blanket bog dominated by Eriophorum vaginatum
- SYMBOL 171: RECOLONISED PEAT — areas recolonised by vegetation
- SYMBOL 203: FLUSHED GLEYS — vegetation on base-rich flushing gleys
