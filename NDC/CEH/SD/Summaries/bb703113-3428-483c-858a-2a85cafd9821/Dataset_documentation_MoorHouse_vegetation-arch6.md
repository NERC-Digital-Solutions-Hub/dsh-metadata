# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Overview
- ESRI Shapefile MH_Vegetation.shp containing polygons that depict vegetation areas, digitized by the Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Based on the vegetation map of Moor House National Nature Reserve in the northern Pennines, England.
- Original mapping conducted by Eddy, Welch, and Rawes (1960–1965) at the Nature Conservancy's Moor House Field Station.

## Data Format and Content
- Format: ESRI Shapefile with polygons for vegetation areas.
- Attributes:
  - VEG: text field with vegetation type description (per McVean and Ratcliffe, 1962).
  - SYMBOL: numeric code representing the vegetation description.
- Final dataset consolidates about 30 units into 16 mapped units for clarity.
- Resolution/Scale: Mapped at 1:10560 (6 inches to the mile).

## Spatial Reference and Mapping Details
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36).
- Projection: Transverse Mercator, Great Britain.
- Extent/Coverage: Great Britain, with data aligned to the British National Grid.

## Data Schema: Vegetation Codes and Descriptions
- Each SYMBOL code corresponds to a vegetation description. Examples include:
  - SYMBOL 2: SPHAGNETO-JUNCETUM EFFUSI
  - SYMBOL 3: TRICHOPHORO-ERIOPHORETUM
  - SYMBOL 4: SANDSTONE SCREE
  - SYMBOL 10: MADE GROUND
  - SYMBOL 60: JUNCETUM SQUARROSUS SA (sub-alpinum)
  - SYMBOL 69: CALCAREOUS SPRINGS
  - SYMBOL 117: CALLUNETO-ERIOPHORETUM
  - SYMBOL 120: FESTUCETUM
  - SYMBOL 129: ERODING BOG
  - SYMBOL 132: PTERIDIETUM
  - SYMBOL 136: AGROSTO-FESTUCETUM
  - SYMBOL 140: SPHAGNETO-CARICETUM ALPINUM
  - SYMBOL 149: NARDETUM SUB-ALPINUM
  - SYMBOL 161: ERIOPHORETUM
  - SYMBOL 171: RECOLONISED PEAT
  - SYMBOL 203: FLUSHED GLEYS
- Nomenclature follows Clapham et al. (1952); refer to Eddy, Welch & Rawes (1968) for detailed treatments.

## Mapping Methodology and Provenance
- Base mapping conducted at 1:10560 scale; units chosen to reflect general physiognomy where possible.
- Field work completed in 1960–1961; final map grouped originally ~30 units into 16 units for clarity.
- Original publication context: ECO/plant community references include McVean & Ratcliffe (1962) and related flora literature.

## Usage Considerations and Data Quality
- Data represent historical vegetation classifications (1960s) and may require caution for contemporary analyses.
- Patchy data and historical formats; potential need for harmonization with newer datasets.
- The dataset is suitable for exploring vegetation types and supporting ecological or policy-oriented analyses, with self-serve capabilities through the shapefile and its attribute table.
