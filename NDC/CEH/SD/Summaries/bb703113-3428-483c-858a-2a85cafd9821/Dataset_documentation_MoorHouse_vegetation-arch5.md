# Vegetation map of the Moor House National Nature Reserve

## Overview
- ESRI Shapefile MH_Vegetation.shp containing polygons representing vegetation areas digitized from the Moor House National Nature Reserve vegetation map (northern Pennines, England).
- Original map created by Eddy, A., Welch, D., & Rawes, M. (1960–1965) at the Nature Conservancy's Moor House Field Station; digitized by Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Mapping reflects vegetation types and classifications from mid-20th century surveys.

## Data format and structure
- Format: ESRI Shapefile (MH_Vegetation.shp)
- Attributes:
  - VEG: text description of vegetation type (per McVean and Ratcliffe, 1962)
  - SYMBOL: numeric code representing vegetation description
- Resolution: mapped at 1:10560
- Spatial reference: British National Grid (OSGB36); Projection: Transverse Mercator Great Britain
- Extent: Great Britain
- Mapping units: final map grouped into 16 units (originally around 30 units) for clarity

## Provenance and mapping history
- Base mapping scale and units chosen to reflect physiognomy of the region.
- Field work conducted in 1960 and 1961; after review, final map consolidated into 16 units.
- Vegetation types and codes follow established nomenclature and sources cited in the document.

## Attribute details
- VEG: Description of vegetation type according to McVean and Ratcliffe (1962)
- SYMBOL: Numeric code corresponding to the vegetation description

## Methods and quality
- Mapping conducted on a base map at 1:10560 with units aligned to physiognomy where possible.
- Field work occurred in 1960–1961; final classification consolidated into 16 units for clarity.
- Botanical nomenclature follows Clapham et al. (1952); references include Eddy, Welch, and Rawes (1968) and McVean & Ratcliffe (1962).

## Data governance and usage notes
- Dataset represents historical vegetation classifications; users should consider changes since mapping (ecology, land use, climate effects) when applying to current analyses.
- Metadata includes core dataset characteristics (format, projection, resolution, extent, lineage, and classification system). Ensure metadata completeness and compatibility with current data catalogs.
- Data stewardship considerations:
  - Validate metadata completeness (lineage, methods, scale, projection, and taxonomy).
  - Assess interoperability with modern vegetation classification schemes.
  - Clarify data availability, licensing, and any update plans or lack thereof.
  - Preserve provenance from original fieldwork to digitization.
