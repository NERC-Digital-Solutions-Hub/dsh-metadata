# TERN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA)

## Overview
- Provides a map-like listing of raingauge sites across two catchments: TERN CATCHMENT and PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT, both labeled as RAINGAUGE (RNGA).
- CATCHMENT: TERN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA) includes waterways such as Bailey Brook, Sleap Brook, Coal Brook, River Roden, Soulton Brook, River Tern, River Meese, Platt Brook, and River Strine, with a TE10 reference and a distance scale (0, 10, 20, 5 km) shown.
- CATCHMENT: PANG LAMBOURN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE (RNGA) lists Lonco Brook, Strine Brook, and Back Brook.

## Data context for Data Support
- Identifies specific raingauge locations within two catchments, enabling data gathering of rainfall data by catchment area.
- Associates raingauge sites with nearby watercourses, supporting spatial alignment of rainfall data with hydrological features.

## Data product opportunities
- Potential to create self-serve dashboards or time-series reports showing rainfall by catchment and by stream/brook associations.
- Map-based visualization combining raingauge locations with catchment boundaries and waterways.
- Facilitates data integration across catchments for broader analyses and reporting.

## Data quality and preparation considerations
- The text suggests map-like data with possible OCR/format artifacts (e.g., TE10 reference, scale indicators, and stray symbols), so verification of site names and coordinates is advisable.
- Standardize naming and ensure consistent geospatial referencing across both catchments for reliable integration and sharing.

## Next steps for implementation
- Validate and geocode raingauge site locations to align with GIS layers for both catchments.
- Link each site to metadata (measurement frequency, start/end dates, data quality flags).
- Develop data products (dashboards, charts, and maps) to enable end-users to explore rainfall data across the two catchments.
