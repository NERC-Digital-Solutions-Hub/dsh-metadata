# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS

## Overview
- LOCAR programme collected continuous rainfall data at 6 sites across the Frome and Piddle, Pang and Lambourn, and Tern catchments.

## Variable measured
- Rainfall, measured in millimetres (mm).
- Recording frequency: 15-minute intervals.

## Sites and identifiers
- FP13 Higher Came Farm (Frome/Piddle Catchment)
- FP35 Lower Wraxall Farm (Frome/Piddle Catchment)
- PL14 Grimsbury Wood (Hermitage) (Pang/Lambourn Catchment)
- PL16 Highfield Farm (Pang/Lambourn Catchment)
- PL29 West Ilsley (Pang/Lambourn Catchment)
- TE10 Bowling Green (Tern Catchment)

## Timeframe
- Periods of varying length between November 2002 and May 2007 for the different sites.

## Measurement method
- Automatic tipping bucket rain gauge:
  - Funnel collects precipitation into a small seesaw-like bucket.
  - The bucket tips after a pre-set amount of precipitation, releasing collected water.
  - Tips are converted into 15-minute rainfall data values and stored on a connected logger.

## Data collection and stewardship
- The Catchment Service Team in each catchment installed, maintained, and downloaded data from the rain gauges at the respective sites.

## Data quality and status
- The data are raw and have not been quality controlled.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation
- Provides baseline rainfall measurements essential for hydrological modelling, flood risk assessment, and calibration/validation of models within the LOCAR framework.
- Useful for detecting temporal and spatial rainfall patterns across multiple catchments.

## Data governance, access, and metadata considerations
- Current description notes raw data and lack of QA, indicating a need for quality assurance, metadata enrichment, and potential data governance steps before routine use.
- Public sharing of underlying data could be a barrier if metadata are incomplete or if data are not standardized.

## Practical considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
- Ensure documentation includes metadata standards, QA procedures, and data provenance.
- Address data gaps and ensure consistent timeframes across sites for comparability.
- Plan for data accessibility, versioning, and clear data-sharing policies to enhance reuse in policy evaluation.
