# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Continuous recording rain gauges were installed at 6 sites within LOCAR across the Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments.
- Data collected as rainfall measurements at 15-minute intervals, spanning 2002 to 2007 (periods vary by site).

## Data Details
- Variable measured: Rainfall
- Units: Millimetres (mm)
- Measurement frequency: 15 minutes
- Sites (site code and name):
  - FP13 — Higher Came Farm (RNGA)
  - FP35 — Lower Wraxall Farm (RNGA)
  - PL14 — Grimsbury Wood (Hermitage) (RNGA)
  - PL16 — Highfield Farm (RNGA)
  - PL29 — West Ilsley (RNGA)
  - TE10 — Bowling Green (RNGA)
- Catchment designations:
  - FP — Frome/Piddle Catchment
  - PL — Pang/Lambourn Catchment
  - TE — Tern Catchment
- Time period: Rain gauges recorded at 15-minute intervals for differing durations at the various sites between November 2002 and May 2007.
- Measurement method: Automatic tipping bucket rain gauges; funnel collects precipitation, a seesaw-like bucket tips after a set amount of rainfall, tips converted to 15-minute rainfall values and stored on a connected logger.
- Data source and coverage: Data were collected by the Catchment Service Team in each catchment, responsible for installation, maintenance, and regular downloading of loggers.

## Data Collection and Stewardship
- Responsible personnel: Catchment Service Teams in each catchment.
- Data handling: Gauges logged data automatically; raw data collected from loggers.

## Data Quality and Limitations
- Data status: Raw data and have not been quality controlled.

## Governance and Actions for Data Stewards
- Metadata considerations: Site codes, site names, catchment associations, and measurement configuration (15-minute interval, RNGA type) are essential for discoverability and reuse.
- Quality assurance needs: As data are raw and not quality controlled, a QA process is recommended before sharing or reuse to ensure reliability and comparability across sites.
- Interoperability: The dataset spans multiple sites with consistent measurement methods but may require harmonization when integrated with other datasets or systems.
