# TERN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA)

## Overview
- Document lists raingauge sites within the Tern catchment (RNGA) and associated watercourses.
- Watercourses and features named include Bailey Brook, Sleap Brook, Coal Brook, River Roden, Soulton Brook, TE10, River Tern, River Meese, Platt Brook, River Strine, and Back Brook.
- A map-like scale is indicated (0–20 km, with 5 km increments) to contextualize locations.

## Data context and purpose
- Serves as a catalog of raingauge sites and their hydrological context within two catchments.
- Provides baseline geographic references (rivers and brooks) for rainfall data collection and integration.

## Data governance and sharing considerations
- Data should be stored, shared, and kept up to date to support discoverability and reuse.
- Likely need for standard metadata, format consistency, and clear documentation of data sources.
- Potential need to document data availability, limitations, and any embargoes or proprietary constraints.

## Metadata considerations for Data Stewards
- Capture: catchment name, raingauge site name, associated watercourse, and spatial coordinates.
- Include: measurement type, data availability dates, data quality flags, and version history.
- Ensure interoperability with relevant portals and catalogues.

## Challenges relevant to Data Stewards
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Timely acquisition of data from creators.
- Aligning metadata and standards across multiple systems and formats.
- Handling large or complex datasets and reconciling outdated databases with bespoke solutions.

## Suggested actions for governance
- Define a standard data schema for raingauge datasets (fields for site, catchment, watercourse, coordinates, data type, dates, provenance, and quality).
- Establish procedures for data intake, validation, cleaning, and transformation before sharing.
- Create a publishing and update workflow to ensure ongoing currency and rights management.
- Upload and catalogue the datasets in relevant data portals with clear metadata and access terms.
