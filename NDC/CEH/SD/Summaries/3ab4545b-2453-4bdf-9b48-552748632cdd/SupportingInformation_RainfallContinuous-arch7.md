# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Rainfall data from six LOCAR rain gauges across four catchments: Frome/Piddle (FP), Pang/Lambourn (PL), and Tern (TE) catchments.
- Sites: Higher Came Farm FP13, Lower Wraxall Farm FP35, Grimsbury Wood (Hermitage) PL14, Highfield Farm PL16, West Ilsley PL29, Bowling Green TE10.
- Recording period: November 2002 to May 2007.
- Temporal resolution: 15-minute intervals.

## Data details
- Variable: Rainfall (millimetres, mm).
- Data type: Raw rainfall values corresponding to 15-minute intervals.
- Data format: Time-stamped rainfall measurements from automatic gauges.

## Measurement and data collection
- Instrument: Automatic tipping bucket rain gauges (funnel collects precipitation into a seesaw-like bucket; each tip yields a 15-minute rainfall value).
- Data handling: Tips converted to 15-minute rainfall values and stored on a connected logger.
- Responsibilities: Catchment Service Teams in each catchment installed, maintained, and downloaded data.

## Data quality and limitations
- Data are raw and have not been quality controlled.
- Site-specific recording periods vary; data may have gaps or differing durations across sites.

## GIS and visualization considerations
- Suitable for map-based visualization of rainfall at 15-minute intervals across multiple sites.
- Prior to advanced analysis, data may require quality control and cleaning; consider integrating with other hydrological datasets.
