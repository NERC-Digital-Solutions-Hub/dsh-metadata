# TERN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA)

- Purpose
  - Visualize raingauge sites within the Tern catchment (RNGA) to support GIS-based rainfall analysis and map-based data visualization.

- Coverage and sections
  - Tern Catchment: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA)
  - Pang Lambourn Catchment: RAINGAUGE (RNGA)
  - Includes surrounding hydrographic features and networks relevant to the raingauge context.

- Spatial features listed
  - Brook and river names: Bailey Brook, Sleap Brook, Coal Brook, River Roden, Soulton Brook, River Tern, River Meese, Platt Brook, River Strine, Lonco Brook, Back Brook.
  - TE10 grid reference indicator (UK national grid reference system).
  - Scale information shown as kilometres (0, 10, 20, 5 km).

- Data context for GIS use
  - Raingauge locations associated with specific catchments.
  - Spatial relationship to named watercourses within the two catchments.

- GIS considerations and actions
  - Import raingauge sites as point features; obtain or derive precise coordinates.
  - Create or verify layers for rivers/streams and assign appropriate attributes (names, catchment associations).
  - Ensure consistent coordinate reference system (e.g., OS grid) and integrate TE10 references as needed.
  - Address potential data integration needs when combining data from multiple catchments with differing resolutions or standards.

- Intended audience and applications
  - Policy colleagues, clients, and the public; use in map-based data products to explore rainfall data across catchments.
