# LOCAR BASELINE DATASETS LOCAR

## Overview
- Continuous rainfall data collected as part of the Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) Programme.
- Data collected at 6 sites across the Frome/Piddle, Pang/Lambourn, and Tern catchments between 2002 and 2007.

## Data details

- Variable measured
  - Rainfall (units: millimetres, mm)
  - Measurement frequency: every 15 minutes

- Spatial coverage
  - Sites (with codes): Higher Came Farm (FP13), Lower Wraxall Farm (FP35), Grimsbury Wood (Hermitage) (PL14), Highfield Farm (PL16), West Ilsley (PL29), Bowling Green (TE10)
  - Catchment codes: FP = Frome/Piddle, PL = Pang/Lambourn, TE = Tern
  - RNGA denotes Rain gauge

- Temporal coverage
  - Measurements occurred at each site for varying periods between November 2002 and May 2007

- Measurement method
  - Automatic tipping bucket rain gauge
  - Setup: funnel → seesaw-type bucket; tipping after a set amount of precipitation yields a 15-minute rainfall value
  - Data stored on the connected logger

## Data collection and stewardship

- Responsibility
  - Catchment Service Teams in each catchment installed, maintained, and downloaded data from the rain gauges

- Data quality and provenance
  - Data are raw and have not been quality controlled

## Implications for data management and use (Data Leaders)

- High-resolution data (15-minute intervals) across multiple sites enable detailed hydrological analysis but require careful QA and harmonization
- Metadata provided is minimal (site codes, catchment, and basic measurement method); additional metadata (calibration, sensor history, data gaps) would improve discoverability and usability
- Data gaps exist due to varying observation periods across sites; planning needed for uniform temporal coverage if used for comparative analyses
- Data governance considerations include documenting data lineage, ensuring updates/maintenance logging, and establishing standards for future data integration and quality control
