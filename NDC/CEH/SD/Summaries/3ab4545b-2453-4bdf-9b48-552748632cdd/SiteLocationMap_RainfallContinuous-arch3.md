## Overview
- A map-like document listing raingauge sites (RNGA) across two catchments: Tern Catchment and Pang Lambo urn Catchment.
- Identifies the waterways included within each catchment where rainfall data may be used for hydrological monitoring.

## Spatial and scale context
- Includes a distance scale (0, 10, 20, 5 km) indicating geographic extent for the depicted catchments and raingauge sites.

## Implications for monitoring framework design
- Provides the spatial layout of raingauge coverage across two catchments, supporting selection of rainfall data sources for hydrological monitoring.
- Highlights key tributaries and rivers that contribute to catchment-scale hydrology and should be considered in data integration.

## Data and governance considerations for authors of monitoring frameworks
- Data availability: ensure rainfall data from RNGA raingauges is accessible, timely, and complete.
- Metadata: capture and share metadata for each raingauge site (location, sensor type, measurement intervals).
- Data quality and standards: establish quality assurance/quality control, data transformations, and consistent reporting formats.
- Data sharing and governance: balance openness with data provenance and governance requirements; plan for sharing underlying data used in analyses.
- Avoiding silos: integrate data across listed waterways and catchments to enable coherent assessment of environmental health indicators.
