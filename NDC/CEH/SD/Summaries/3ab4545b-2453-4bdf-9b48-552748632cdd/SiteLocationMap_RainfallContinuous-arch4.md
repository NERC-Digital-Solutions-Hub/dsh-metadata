# TERN CATCHMENT: RAINGAUGE SITE (RNGA)

## Overview
- A map-like schematic of raingauge networks across catchments, highlighting the RNGA site.
- Describes two catchments: Tern Catchment and Pang Lambourn Catchment, each with listed watercourses.

## Content / Data Assets
- Tern Catchment: raingauge site (RNGA) linked to multiple watercourses:
  - Bailey Brook, Sleap Brook, Coal Brook, River Roden, Soulton Brook, TE10, River Tern, River Meese, Platt Brook, River Strine.
- Pang Lambourn Catchment: raingauge (RNGA) with:
  - Lonco Brook, Strine Brook, Back Brook.

## Spatial Context and Layout
- Includes a scale indicator (0, 10, 20, 5 km) suggesting geographic extent and distance context.
- Represents the spatial arrangement of catchments and associated streams.

## Metadata and Data Quality Considerations
- The document provides names and spatial relationships but no measurement data, coordinates, or metadata.
- Lacks details on coordinate reference system, data frequency, data formats, or quality indicators.
- Needs standardized metadata to ensure discoverability and reusability.

## Data Governance and Use
- Useful for data discovery, governance, and planning across catchments.
- Supports understanding of network structure and potential data gaps for rainfall measurements within RNGA.

## Next Steps for Data Leaders
- Create a catalog entry for the RNGA raingauge network including:
  - Catchment name (Tern; Pang Lambourn)
  - Raingauge site (RNGA)
  - Associated watercourses (listed above)
  - Coordinates and CRS
  - Data type (rainfall time series), frequency, units
  - Metadata, data quality indicators, and update schedule
- Ensure discoverability and accessibility of the dataset.
- Facilitate coordination with the wider data community to align standards and practices.
