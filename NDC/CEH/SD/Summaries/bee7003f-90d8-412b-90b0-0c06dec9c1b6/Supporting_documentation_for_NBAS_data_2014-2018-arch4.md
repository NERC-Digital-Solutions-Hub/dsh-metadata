# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from North Basin of Windermere 2014 to 2018

## Overview
- Long-term, fortnightly monitoring dataset for the North Basin of Windermere (Cumbria, England) spanning 2014–2018.
- Variables include surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).
- Water samples are integrated from 0–7 m and collected from a boat at the deepest lake location.
- Data are provided with units: TEMP (°C), OXYG (% air-saturation), SECC (m), ALKA (µg CaCO3/L), and other chemical concentrations in µg/L or related units.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Fortnightly sampling regime; measurements taken from January 2014 through the end of 2018.
- Sampling location: deepest part of Windermere North Basin, from a marked buoy.
- Data are raw and have not yet been quality controlled or calibrated.
- Data integrity checks performed via double entry and visual verification; missing data attributable to weather or staff availability.

## Data structure and variables
- Data delivered as comma-separated values (CSV).
- Columns include:
  - Date: date of measurement.
  - Description (Variable): variable name (e.g., TEMP, OXYG, SECC, ALKA, pH, NH4N, NO3N, PO4P, TOTP, SIO2, TOCA).
  - Value: measured value for each variable.
  - Sign (if<LOD): indicates values below detection limit with a “<” symbol.
  - Additional description fields detailing units and measurement context.
- Variables cover surface physical/chemical properties and phytoplankton chlorophyll a concentration.

## Quality control and data provenance
- Raw data not quality controlled or calibrated; subject to future QC steps.
- Immediate data integrity supported by double-entry verification and visual checks.
- Notes on detection limits via < (below detection) indicators for applicable measurements.

## Access, format and metadata
- CSV format with clearly defined variable descriptions, units, and detection-limit indicators.
- Integrated sample depth (0–7 m) and sampling methodology described to support proper interpretation and reuse.

## Funding and impact / recent publications
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme.
- Dataset has supported multiple publications in climate reporting and ecological research, including:
  - State of the Climate 2018 (Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society)
  - Studies on environmental DNA distribution and long-term ecological data
  - Research on early warning indicators and phenological sensitivity
  - Broader literature on climate change effects on inland water bodies and ecosystem dynamics

## Implications for data leadership and governance
- Demonstrates the importance of capturing a comprehensive suite of aquatic variables for long-term monitoring and system-wide data thinking.
- Highlights need for:
  - Ongoing quality control plans and calibration protocols to transition raw data into trusted, fit-for-use datasets.
  - Detailed metadata and data dictionaries to ensure discoverability and correct interpretation by policy colleagues and external partners.
  - Data stewardship practices to maintain data provenance, versioning, and updates beyond the initial 2014–2018 window.
  - Clear accessibility pathways and documentation to enable co-ownership and wide dissemination across networks and communities of practice.
