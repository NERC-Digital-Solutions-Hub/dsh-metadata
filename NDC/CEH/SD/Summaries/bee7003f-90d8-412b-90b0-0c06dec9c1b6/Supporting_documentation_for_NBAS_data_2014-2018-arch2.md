# Supporting Document Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from North Basin of Windermere 2014 to 2018

- Overview
  - Long-term, fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere (Cumbria, England) covering 2014–2018.
  - By collecting multiple environmental variables to support evaluation of ecological health and policy performance over time.

- Variables and units included
  - Surface temperature (TEMP): degrees Celsius (°C)
  - Surface oxygen saturation (OXYG): percent air-saturation (%)
  - Secchi depth (SECC): metres (m)
  - Alkalinity (ALKA): micrograms per litre as CaCO3 (µg CaCO3 L⁻¹)
  - pH: unitless
  - Ammonium (NH4N): µg N per litre
  - Nitrate (NO3N): µg N per litre
  - Soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P): µg P per litre
  - Total phosphorus (TOTP): µg P per litre
  - Dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2): µg SiO2 per litre
  - Phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA): µg per litre

- Sampling regime and collection methods
  - Fortnightly sampling at the North Basin from 2014 to 2018.
  - Water samples integrated from 0 to 7 m depth.
  - Measurements taken from a boat at a buoy located at the deepest part of the lake.
  - Data represent multiple variables collected in a consistent sampling framework.

- Data structure and format
  - Data provided as comma-separated values (CSV) with:
    - Date: measurement date
    - Variable, Description: measured parameter (as listed above)
    - Value, Description: measured value
    - Sign (if<LOD): indicates values below detection limit with a < sign

- Quality control and data provenance
  - Raw data presented; not yet quality controlled or calibrated.
  - Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
  - Missing data attributed to weather conditions or staff shortages.

- Temporal coverage
  - January 2014 through the end of 2018.

- Data handling and accessibility
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals (per monitoring practice for accessibility and reuse).

- Funding and provenance
  - Funded by Natural Environment Research Council, award NE/R016429/1, under the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.

- Use and impact
  - Demonstrated use in climate and ecological research (examples include studies on climate state reporting, long-term ecological indicators, and lake ecosystem dynamics).
  - Dataset supports analyses of environmental conditions and aid in monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
