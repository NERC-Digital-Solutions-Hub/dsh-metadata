- Variables and units:
  - TEMP: surface temperature (°C)
  - OXYG: surface oxygen saturation (% air-saturation)
  - SECC: Secchi depth (m)
  - ALKA: alkalinity (µg CaCO3 per L)
  - pH: pH
  - NH4N: ammonium (µg N per L)
  - NO3N: nitrate (µg N per L)
  - PO4P: soluble reactive phosphate (µg P per L)
  - TOTP: total phosphorus (µg P per L)
  - SIO2: dissolved reactive silicon (µg per L)
  - TOCA: phytoplankton chlorophyll a (µg per L)
- Sampling regime: integrated water sample from 0–7 m, collected from a boat at a buoy in the deepest part of the lake.
