# Surface temperature, surface oxygen, water clarity, water chemistry and phytoplankton chlorophyll a data from North Basin of Windermere 2014 to 2018

## Overview
- Long-term, fortnightly monitoring dataset from the North Basin of Windermere in Cumbria, England.
- Measured variables: surface temperature (TEMP), surface oxygen saturation (OXYG), Secchi depth (SECC), alkalinity (ALKA), pH, ammonium (NH4N), nitrate (NO3N), soluble reactive phosphate (PO4P), total phosphorus (TOTP), dissolved reactive silicon (SIO2), and phytoplankton chlorophyll a (TOCA).
- Sample type: integrated water sample from 0 to 7 meters collected from a boat at the deepest part of the lake.
- Timeframe: January 2014 to end of 2018.
- Data are downloadable and intended to be shared publicly through relevant data portals and catalogues.

## Data content and structure
- Data format: comma-separated values (CSV) with the following structure:
  - Date: measurement date.
  - Variable, Description: name and units of each measured parameter (e.g., TEMP in °C, OXYG in % air-saturation, SECC in metres, ALKA in µg CaCO3 per litre, pH, NH4N in µg N per litre, NO3N in µg N per litre, PO4P in µg P per litre, TOTP in µg P per litre, SIO2 in µg per litre, TOCA in µg per litre).
  - Value, Description: measured values for each variable.
  - Sign (if<LOD), Description: indicator if the value is below the detection limit (a < sign).
- Quality notes: some values are below detection limits and are marked accordingly.

## Quality control and data quality
- Data are raw and have not yet undergone formal quality control or calibration.
- Data have been double-entered and visually checked.
- Missing data primarily due to weather conditions or staff shortages.

## Sampling regime and collection methods
- Part of a long-term monitoring program with fortnightly sampling cadence.
- Samples collected from a buoy at the deepest part of the North Basin, Windermere.
- Water chemistry values reflect samples integrated from 0 to 7 meters.
- Measurements span January 2014 through 2018.

## Data management and stewardship
- Data collection funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- Dataset is intended to be uploaded to relevant data portals and catalogues, enabling discovery and reuse.
- Documentation and metadata accompany the dataset to support reuse, including data structure and variable definitions.
- Potential use cases include long-term ecological and climate-related studies, with references to the dataset in published works.

## Access, usage, and provenance
- The dataset has been used in multiple recent publications, illustrating its value for climate and ecological research (examples include works related to climate state reporting, environmental DNA studies, and ecological responses to climate variability).
- Users should account for the raw status of the data (not QC’d) and consult accompanying metadata for variable definitions, units, and detection-limit indicators.

## Limitations and caveats
- Raw data not yet quality controlled or calibrated; subsequent analyses should consider planned quality assurance steps.
- Some measurements are below detection limits and flagged accordingly.
- Data reflect a specific lake basin and sampling depth, which may influence comparability with other datasets or basins.

## Funding and provenance
- Funding: Natural Environment Research Council (award NE/R016429/1) as part of the UK-SCaPE programme delivering National Capability.
- The dataset supports and is cited in several publications across climate and ecological research areas, indicating broad provenance and reuse potential.
