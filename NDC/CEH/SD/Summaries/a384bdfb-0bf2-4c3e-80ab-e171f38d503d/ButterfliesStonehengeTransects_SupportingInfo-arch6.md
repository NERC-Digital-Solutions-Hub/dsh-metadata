Raw data sets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape between 2010-2011

## Purpose and scope
- Provides information relating to raw Lepidoptera data collected at the Stonehenge Landscape during 2010-2011.
- Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies’ PhD thesis (Landscape Connectivity: a key to effective habitat restoration in lowland agricultural landscapes, 2014).
- Documents background, data collection methods, and quality assurance; data are raw counts of Lepidoptera and nectar/flowering data; includes pivot-table and exploratory analyses (not all results shown).

## Study site
- Location: National Trust Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, SW UK.
- Context: landscape-scale grassland restoration and re-creation project.
- Habitat mosaic during 2010-2011: chalk grassland fragments on slopes and ancient burial mounds, recreated grasslands of various sowing years (2000–2012), semi-improved pasture, arable farmland, and woodland.
- Land-use history: seed harvested from nearby donor patches on Salisbury Plain; restoration aimed at protecting archaeological features and ecological value.

## Lepidoptera surveys (2010)
- Method: transect surveys adapted from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates 1993).
- Protocol: walk 200 m transects, observe 5 m on either side and ahead; record Lepidoptera species and behavior; nectar plants recorded if observed feeding.
- Survey design: 17 transects across different habitat patches; field season June–September 2010; three survey occasions per transect to randomize timing.
- Habitat types surveyed: chalk grassland fragments, older and newer grassland recreations, arable land, chalk fragments on barrows, barrow groups, adjacent matrix habitats.

## Habitat quality assessment
- Measurements along transects: vegetation height/density (drop-disc method), percent bare ground, percent dead vegetation.
- Nectar resources: number and percentage of flowering units; total nectar flowering units; nectar by family (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae).
- Data collection included weather: hourly conditions from Boscombe Down meteorological station (nearest station ≈6.5 km away).
- Repetition: habitat and matrix quality surveys conducted three times during the field season (with a few exceptions noted).

## Plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature
- Plant names follow Stace (2010) and related flora references.
- Lepidoptera names follow Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field identifications reference Field Studies Council guides for butterflies and day-flying moths.

## Key taxonomic and flowering plant datasets (Lepidoptera and plants)
- UK-2: Lepidoptera species surveyed, including scientific name, common name, and abbreviated codes (e.g., Ads.sta for Forester, Pie.bra for Large White, etc.).
- UK-3: Flowering plant species with scientific names, common names, and abbreviated codes (e.g., Agr.eup for Agrimony, Cam.glo for Clustard Bellflower, etc.).
- UK-4 to UK-6: Key to Lepidoptera data columns, including species codes, sex, date, transect, segment, replicate, weather variables, and behavioral categories (Flying, Nectar, Dispute, Courting, Mating, Basking, Resting, Total).
- 2010 Resources (UK-6): Data columns for transect location, start/end grid references, transect length, and associated metadata.
- UK-7: Location-specific data for Lepidoptera 2011, including transect locations, grid references, sheltered/exposed status, and transect codes.
- UK-8 to UK-9: 2011 data columns and resource data, including date, transect, replicate, side of transect, quadrat details, drop disc, bare ground, dead vegetation, flowering units, nectar and family-specific nectar counts, and notes.

## Lepidoptera data collection details (2010)
- Sheets and tables outline:
  - Location names, transect codes, grid references (Start/End SU and BNG), transect lengths (mostly 200 m).
  - Specific transect codes for each location (e.g., Luxenborough Bank 1a, Full-moon Bank 1b, Winterbourne 1c, etc.).
- Data entries cover:
  - Field measurements per transect segment (1–10) with replicate data where applicable.
  - Behavioural observations (Flying, Nectar, Dispute, Courting, Mating, Basking, Resting) and total counts.

## Lepidoptera data collection details (2011)
- 120 m transects recorded with location codes (WSG, Fargo, Full, Lux), side of chalk fragment (East/West), sheltered or exposed, and grid references (BNG/SU).
- Additional habitat notes: Chalk vs. Restorations vs. Arable; matrix types and sowing year where applicable.
- Detailed transect metadata includes start and end grid references, transect length, and segment structure for field data capture.

## Data columns and organization
- 2010 data (Lepidoptera 2010; Resources 2010) columns cover:
  - Date, transect, segment, replicate, temperature, wind, cloud cover, Lepidoptera counts by behavior (Flying, Nectar, Dispute, Courting, Mating, Basking, Resting), and a total.
  - Resource measures: drop disc, flowering units, bare ground, dead vegetation, nectar totals, and family-specific nectar (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae).
- 2011 data (Lepidoptera 2011; Resources 2011) columns cover:
  - Date, location, replicate, transect number, west/east side, habitat type, matrix type and notes, species, sex, nectaring plant, and sampling totals with granular readings.

## Data quality assurance
- Quality checks included searching for outliers and anomalies; cross-referenced occurrences with species knowledge and production of pivot tables and exploratory analyses (results not shown).
- Emphasizes robust data cleaning and verification to ensure reliability across the landscape-scale dataset.
