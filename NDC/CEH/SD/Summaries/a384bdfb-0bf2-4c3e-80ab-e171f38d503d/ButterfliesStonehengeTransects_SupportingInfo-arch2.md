# Stonehenge Landscape Lepidoptera Data 2010-2011

- Purpose: Present raw datasets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape for 2010-2011, including associated botanical data and data quality checks. Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies's PhD work (2014).

## Study Site and Context

- Location: National Trust Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, SW UK.
- Landscape features: Mosaic of chalk grassland fragments, grassland restoration fields (sown 2000–2009), semi-improved pasture, arable land, and woodland.
- Restoration backdrop: Grassland creation from donor patches to protect archaeological features while restoring ecological value.
- Timeframe: Surveys and data collection conducted during 2010 and 2011.

## Data Collection Methods

- Lepidoptera surveys (2010)
  - Method: Transect surveys adapted from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates, 1993).
  - Procedure: Walk 20 m segments; record Lepidoptera within 5 m on either side and ahead; nectar plants recorded if observed feeding.
  - Transects: 17 transects, each 200 m long, across diverse habitat patches (older/newer grassland recreations, arable, chalk fragments on slopes, barrows, adjacent pastures).
  - Schedule: Three survey occasions across the field season (June–September 2010).
  - Metadata: Transect descriptions, habitat types, and planning table mapping locations to patches.
- Habitat quality assessment
  - Habitat transects: Five 20 m habitat transects; matrix transects: four 20 m quadrats per transect.
  - Measurements: Vegetation height/density (drop-disc method), bare ground, dead vegetation.
  - Nectar resources: Number and percent cover of flowering units; totals by plant families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae).
  - Data handling: Equivalent 1 m x 1 m quadrat area created by randomly omitting one habitat quadrat for comparability.
- Weather data
  - Source: Closest meteorological station (Boscombe Down, Amesbury), hourly weather data during survey periods.
- Plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature
  - Plants: Follows Stace (2010), New Flora of the British Isles.
  - Lepidoptera: Follows Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field IDs from Field Studies Council guides.
- Key tables and species coding
  - Lepidoptera species: Full listing with scientific name, common name, and abbreviated species code (e.g., Ads.sta = Forester; Pie.rap = Small White).
  - Flowering plants: Comprehensive table of species with codes for data entry.
- Data sheets and structure (2010)
  - Sheets: Lepidoptera 2010; Resources 2010.
  - Data columns cover location, transect, start/end grid references, transect length, species observations, behaviours (flying, courting, mating, etc.), nectar contacts, and plant resources.
  - UK-4 to UK-6 documentation include locations, transect codes, start/end references, and data column keys.
- Data sheets and structure (2011)
  - Sheets: Lepidoptera 2011; Resources 2011.
  - Location and transect metadata capture 120 m transects; side of chalk fragment (West/East) and Shelter (Sh) or Exposed (Ex) conditions; grid references.
  - Data columns expand to include date, temperature, wind, cloud cover, replicate, transect, segment, species, sex, nectaring notes, and quadrat-level habitat/plant data (for 2011 sheets UK-8/UK-9).
- Data sheets and structure (general)
  - UK-7 to UK-9: Documentation of the 2011 dataset structure, including location codes (e.g., WSG, Fargo, Full, Lux), transect details, and 20 m segments.

## Data Content and Coding

- Lepidoptera data
  - Entries include: species, code, date, transect, segment, replicate, temperature, wind, cloud cover, and behavioural states (flying, nectar feeding, dispute, courting, mating, basking, resting), plus totals.
- Nectar and plant resources
  - Records flowering units by plant family (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae) and overall nectar resource totals.
- Spatial and transect metadata
  - Location codes, habitat types (chalk fragments, restoration fields, arable, barrow groups), transect lengths, and grid references (SU/BNG coordinates).

## Data Quality Assurance

- QA approach: Searched for outliers and anomalies using species occurrence expectations; applied pivot tables and exploratory analyses (not all results shown).
- Reproducibility: Standardised transect methods and replication schemes across years; metadata and nomenclature standardized to enable cross-site comparisons and longitudinal analyses.

## Outputs and Use

- Outputs enabled by standardised formats (reports, maps, charts) and clear presentation of environmental health indicators.
- Designed to improve accessibility of underlying data to support broader data usage and policy scrutiny.
- Aligns with monitoring responsibilities and analytical approaches typical of environmental analysts.
