# Stonehenge Landscape Lepidoptera Data 2010-2011

- Overview
  - A record of raw datasets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape during 2010–2011.
  - Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies’ PhD work on landscape connectivity and habitat restoration; includes both Lepidoptera counts/behaviours and botanical data (flowering units and percent cover).
  - Data quality checks were performed to identify outliers and anomalies using species occurrence expectations and exploratory analysis.

- Study Site
  - National Trust Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Landscape features a mosaic of chalk grassland fragments, grassland restoration fields sown from 2000–2012, arable land, pasture, and woodland.
  - Restoration aimed to protect archaeological features while restoring ecological value.

- Data Collected and Methods
  - Lepidoptera Surveys
    - Conducted on NT land using transect methods adapted from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme.
    - 17 transects, each 200 m (2010) or 120 m (2011), across various habitat patches and restoration ages.
    - Survey protocol: walk 5 minutes per 20 m segment, record Lepidoptera counts by species within 5 m on either side and ahead; nectar plants recorded if observed nectaring.
    - Surveys occurred three times during the field season (June–September 2010; 2011 details in dedicated sheets).
    - Habitat types included chalk grassland fragments, older/newer grassland re-creation fields, arable land, barrows, and adjacent semi-improved pastures.
    - Data structure includes species, sex, and behavioural categories (flying, nectaring, disputes, courting, mating, basking, resting) per transect segment.
  - Habitat Quality
    - Vegetation characteristics measured: vegetation height/density (drop-disc method), bare ground, and dead vegetation.
    - Nectar resources quantified as flowering units overall and by plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae); expressed as counts and cover percentages.
    - Weather data collected (nearest-hour conditions from Boscombe Down) to contextualise counts.
    - Quality surveys repeated across the field season (except for a few specified transects).
  - Plant and Lepidoptera Nomenclature
    - Plant names follow Stace (2010); Lepidoptera follow Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field identifications guided by Field Studies Council guides.
  - Key Tables and Data Columns
    - Lepidoptera species list with codes and common names (UK-1 to UK-2 tables).
    - Flowering plant species list with codes and common names (UK-3 table).
    - Data column keys detailing survey date, transect, segment, replicate, weather variables, behavioural states, and total counts (UK-5 to UK-9 tables).
  - 2010 and 2011 Sheets
    - Lepidoptera 2010 and 2011 sheets provide transect locations, start/end grid references, transect lengths, and survey metadata.
    - Resources sheets capture habitat/vegetation metrics, nectar resources, bare ground, dead vegetation, and quadrat-level data.
    - 2010 and 2011 sheets include detailed column definitions for all measured variables (e.g., species codes, nectar plant codes, measurement units).

- Data Quality Assurance and Documentation
  - Outliers and anomalies were investigated using species-expected occurrence data and pivot/exploratory analyses.
  - Metadata and data dictionaries are embedded in the sheets (e.g., Lepidoptera species codes, plant species codes, measurement units, and column descriptions) to support reproducibility and auditability.

- Data Structure and Accessibility
  - Data organized into multiple sheets/files:
    - Lepidoptera 2010 and 2011: location codes, transects, sides (east/west), shelter/exposure, grid references, and survey results by segment and replicate.
    - Resources 2010 and 2011: quadrat-level habitat metrics, nectar resource counts, and plant family breakdowns.
    - UK-5 to UK-9: key to data columns and detailed descriptions of each data field.
  - Some data governance considerations noted:
    - Public sharing of datasets can be a barrier; metadata sufficiency and data provenance are critical for reuse in monitoring frameworks.
    - Data quality controls and standardised metadata are essential to enable cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant reporting.

- Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks and Policy Evaluation
  - Provides raw, longitudinal data linking Lepidoptera community metrics to landscape context (habitat type, restoration age, and spatial arrangement).
  - Integrates biological response data with habitat quality indicators (vegetation structure and nectar resources) and abiotic context (weather).
  - Supports assessment of landscape-scale restoration outcomes, connectivity, and habitat suitability for pollinators.
  - Emphasizes rigorous data collection protocols, standardized nomenclature, and comprehensive metadata—key for reproducible monitoring and governance.
  - Highlights data-ownership, sharing, and governance considerations that influence the use of environmental datasets in policymaking and public reporting.
