# Stonehenge Landscape Lepidoptera Data 2010-2011

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides raw data sets on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape during 2010-2011.
  - Includes botanical data (flowering units and % cover) and is accompanied by data quality assurance notes (outliers/anomalies examined; references to supporting methods).

- Study site
  - National Trust Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Landscape features a mosaic of chalk grassland fragments, grassland re-creation fields (established 2000–2012), semi-improved pasture, arable land, and woodland.
  - Restoration aim linked to landscape-scale ecological value and archaeological feature protection.

- Data collection methods
  - Lepidoptera surveys via transect methods adapted from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates 1993).
  - 2010: 17 transects, each 200 m long; surveys conducted on three occasions across the field season (June–September); 5 minutes per 20 m segment; record counts by species and flight path; nectar plants recorded if observed feeding.
  - Habitat categories surveyed include chalk grassland fragments, grassland re-creation fields of various ages, arable land, barrows, adjacent semi-improved pasture.
  - Weather data (hourly nearest meteorological station) captured; surveys repeated three times (with minor exceptions).

- Habitat quality and plant resources
  - Habitat quality quantified using vegetation height/density, bare ground, and dead vegetation across habitat and matrix transects.
  - Nectar resources measured via flowering units, with breakdown by nectar plant families (Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae) and total flowering units.
  - Data collection includes both habitat transects and adjacent matrix quadrats (0.5 m x 0.5 m, with a randomly omitted quadrat for comparability to 1 m x 1 m area).

- Datasets and structure
  - Data organized into multiple sheets/files, including:
    - Lepidoptera 2010 and Lepidoptera 2011: location, transect codes, dates, times, segment-level observations, and behavioural states (Flying, Nectar, Dispute, Courting, Mating, etc.), plus totals.
    - Resources 2010 and Resources 2011: transect-level environmental/vegetation measures (drop disc, bare ground, dead vegetation, total flowering units, nectar counts, and family-specific nectar totals).
    - Location and transect metadata sheets (UK-4 to UK-9 equivalents) detailing transect names, start/end grid references, and transect lengths (generally 200 m for many sites; 2011 surveys include 120 m transects with location codes such as WSG, Fargo, Full, Lux, etc.).
  - 2010 data: transects and grid references provided (start/end coordinates) with 200 m lengths for most sites.
  - 2011 data: transects described with location codes, sides of chalk fragments (West/East), sheltered vs. exposed classifications, grid references, and transect numbers.

- Nomenclature and codes
  - Lepidoptera species listed with scientific and common names, plus short species codes for data sheets.
  - Flowering plant species similarly codified with scientific names, common names, and codes.
  - Nomenclature follow standard references (Stace 2010; Langmaid et al. 1989; Heath & Emmet 1985; etc.).

- Data quality and QA
  - Data quality assurance conducted by checking outliers and anomalies through literature-informed expectations, pivot tables, and exploratory analysis (details not shown in the summary).
  - Weather and time-of-survey variability accounted for by recording proximity to meteorological data and scheduling surveys across different times of day and season.

- Key usage and relevance for data leadership
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data governance for ecological datasets: clear study framing, standardized transect methods, comprehensive metadata, and structured data sheets for cross-season comparability.
  - Supports landscape-scale analysis of habitat restoration impacts on Lepidoptera, including linkages between habitat quality, nectar resources, and butterfly/moth presence and behaviour.
  - Provides granular codes and tables that enable reproducibility, re-use in related connectivity studies, and integration with broader data networks (e.g., cross-referencing with the associated PhD thesis and management plans).

- References and data sources
  - Methodology and references include Pollard & Yates (1993) for transect methods; Carvell (2002), Hardy et al. (2007) for nectar resources; Stace (2010); Langmaid et al. (1989); Heath & Emmet (1985); and related field guides and flora references.
