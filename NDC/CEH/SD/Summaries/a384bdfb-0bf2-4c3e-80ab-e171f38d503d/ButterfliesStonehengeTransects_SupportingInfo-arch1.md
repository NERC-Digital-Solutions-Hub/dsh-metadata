# Stonehenge Landscape Lepidoptera Data 2010-2011

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides raw data on the behaviour and distribution of Lepidoptera (butterflies and day-flying moths) at the Stonehenge Landscape for 2010–2011.
  - Adapted from Grace Twiston-Davies’s PhD thesis on landscape connectivity and habitat restoration.
  - Includes Lepidoptera counts and flight-path determined behaviours, plus botanical data (flowering units and  crop/vegetation coverage) in quadrats.
  - Data quality assurance performed (outliers/anomalies checked via pivot tables and exploratory analysis).

- Study site
  - National Trust Stonehenge Landscape within the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, Wiltshire, UK.
  - Context: landscape-scale grassland restoration/creation project (seed harvested 2000 from donor calcareous grassland; established on ex-arable fields up to 2012).
  - Habitats surveyed: chalk grassland fragments on slopes and barrows, grassland recreation patches of various ages, semi-improved pasture, arable land, and woodland.

- Lepidoptera surveys: design and methods
  - Based on transect surveys adapted from the Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (Pollard & Yates, 1993).
  - 2010 field season: 17 transects, each 200 m long; surveys conducted June–September 2010.
  - Survey protocol: walk transect at a steady pace; record Lepidoptera seen within 5 m on each side and ahead; nectar plant species recorded if observed feeding.
  - Transects covered diverse habitat types: chalk fragments, barrow groups, older/newer grassland recreations, arable, and semi-improved pasture; surveys conducted on three occasions to reflect seasonal/diurnal variation.
  - 2010 site and transect descriptions and codes are detailed (habitat type, transect code, and map references).

- Habitat quality and plant data collection
  - Habitat quality quantified along transects using:
    - Vegetation height and density (drop-disc method).
    - Percent bare ground and dead vegetation.
  - Nectar resources quantified via:
    - Number and percent cover of flowering units, total nectar flowering units, and by families (Dipsacaceae, Fabaceae, Asteraceae).
  - Weather data collected: hourly average conditions from Boscombe Down meteorological station (nearest station, ~6.5 km away).
  - Surveys replicated three times during the field season (with minor exceptions).

- Plant and Lepidoptera nomenclature
  - Plants: nomenclature follows Stace (2010) and related flora references.
  - Lepidoptera: nomenclature follows Langmaid et al. (1989) and Heath & Emmet (1985); field identifications guided by Field Studies Council guides.

- Data structure and key tables
  - Sheets and data tables organized to support analysis across time and habitat types:
    - Lepidoptera 2010 and Lepidoptera 2011: location, transect, segment, species, sex, date, time, weather, and behavioural observations (flying, nectaring, dispute, courting, mating, basking, resting; totals).
    - Resources 2010 and Resources 2011: habitat quality metrics (drop disc, bare ground, dead vegetation), nectar resources (flowering units, by family), and plant

    species tables (with scientific name, common name, and species code).
    - Lepidoptera 2010 (and 2011) sheets include transect start/end grid references, transect length, and locations.
  - Columns and codes are standardized across sheets (e.g., SPECIES, SPECIES CODE; SEX; TEMP; TRANSECT; SEGMENT; REP; NECTAR; TOTAL; and nectar family breakdowns).

- Key species and flowering-plant references
  - Comprehensive tables provide:
    - Lepidoptera species surveyed, with scientific name, common name, and three-letter species code (e.g., Ads.sta = Forester, Agl.urt = Small Tortoiseshell, etc.).
    - Flowering plant species list with scientific name, common name, and species code (e.g., Achillea millefolium = Yarrow; Centaurea nigra = Common Knapweed).
    - Flowering plant resource codes used in nectar measurements (e.g., Asteraceae, Fabaceae, Dipsacaceae categories).

- Data presentation and usage
  - Data entries include:
    - Lepidoptera observations by date, transect, segment, replicate, weather, and behavioural states.
    - Plant and habitat measurements per transect segment or quadrat (quadrats used to represent survey area in habitat versus matrix transects).
    - Nectar resource calculations per transect/segment, and breakdown by plant families.
  - Data quality and provenance are tracked; datasets are intended to be discoverable with metadata through portals.

- References and context
  - Methodological and taxonomic references include:
    - Pollard & Yates (1993) on Butterfly Monitoring Scheme methods.
    - Carvell (2002), Hardy et al. (2007) on nectar resources and habitat use.
    - Heath & Emmet (1985), Langmaid et al. (1989), and related field guides for Lepidoptera and flora.

- Accessibility and quality assurance
  - The dataset underwent quality assurance to identify and address outliers and anomalies using species occurrence knowledge and exploratory analyses.
  - Data collection and transformation aimed to enable cross-comparison between habitat and matrix transects; metadata ensures future discoverability and usability.
