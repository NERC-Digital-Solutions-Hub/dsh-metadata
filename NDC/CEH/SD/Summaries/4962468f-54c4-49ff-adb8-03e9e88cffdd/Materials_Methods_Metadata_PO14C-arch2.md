# Materials and methods, and metadata for Freshwater Particulate Organic Radiocarbon for Four Major UK Catchments, 2013-2014. Data taken from 'Aged riverine particulate organic carbon in four UK catchments' Adams et al, 2015 Science of the Total Environment.

## Objective and scope
- Provide materials, methods, and metadata for Freshwater Particulate Organic Radiocarbon (14C) across four major UK catchments for 2013–2014.
- Data drawn from Adams et al., 2015, enabling standardized assessment of environmental radiocarbon signals in riverine particulate organic carbon (POC).

## Field sites and catchment context
- Ribble catchment (north-west England): high population density (≈989 persons/km²); sub-catchments Hodder and Calder; flashy upper catchment response to rainfall; Calder includes major conurbations with historical industrial activity.
- River Conwy (North Wales): major drainage in a mountainous area; population density ≈49 persons/km²; high river response to storm events.
- Hampshire Avon (south England): population density ≈108 persons/km²; largely groundwater-dominated chalk aquifers; tidal-limit response limited during rainfall.
- River Dee (north-east Scotland): sparsely populated above tidal limit (≈4 persons/km²); upper tributary Gairn; mountainous, rapid response to rainfall and snowmelt.

## Sampling and analytical methods
- Water collection: 5 L samples from the tidal limit of each catchment; additional upstream samples in Ribble and Dee.
- Suspended particulate matter (SPM) isolation: repeated centrifugation (≈9600 rpm for 30 min) to concentrate ~100 mL of suspended solids with water.
- Organic carbon (OC) content: two approaches
  - Filter a known volume of water through pre-weighed GF/F filters; dry and reweigh to determine [SPM].
  - Analyze total carbon with elemental analyzers (Vario EL or Thermo Flash 2000) at CEH Lancaster and James Hutton Institute, respectively.
- 14C sample preparation: graphite targets produced by quantitative carbon recovery, CO2 cryogenic separation, and iron/zinc reduction to iron/graphite for accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).
- Isotopic corrections: measure δ13C using a dual-inlet mass spectrometer to correct 14C data to -25‰ VPDB; calibrate with international standards.
- Laboratories and facilities: most 14C analyses at SUERC (East Kilbride), with three smaller samples analyzed at UCIAMS (University of California Irvine) for small carbon loads (<500 μg).
- QA/QC: use size-matched process-background materials and known-age standards to verify accuracy and precision; reporting in absolute % modern carbon (pMC) with decay correction relative to AD1950; bomb-carbon considerations applied; overall analytical precision stated as 1σ.

## Data and metadata structure
- Dataset includes detailed column definitions (Catchment, Site, Flow, Lat, Long, Publication code, Date, d13CVPDB‰, 14C pMC, ±1σ PMC, [SPM], %OC, and related notes).
- Column explanations cover units (e.g., mg/L for [SPM], ‰ for d13C, pMC for 14C), data provenance, and contextual notes to support reuse and cross-study comparisons.

## Data handling, reporting and reuse
- Data are prepared for standardised reporting formats (maps, charts, tables) and for storage in appropriate data portals to ensure accessibility.
- Emphasis on data quality assurance, traceability of sampling and analysis, and documented metadata to facilitate downstream analyses and integration with other datasets.

## References and methodological grounding
- Boundary methods and calibration anchored to widely used radiocarbon protocols and isotope corrections:

- The dataset and methods build on Adams et al., 2015 (Aged riverine particulate organic carbon in four UK catchments) as the primary scientific context.
