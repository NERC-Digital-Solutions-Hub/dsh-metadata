# Freshwater Particulate Organic Radiocarbon for Four Major UK Catchments, 2013-2014

## Aim and scope
- Documents materials, methods, and metadata for freshwater particulate organic radiocarbon (PO14C) across four major UK catchments for 2013–2014.
- Builds on the dataset described in Adams et al. (2015) Science of the Total Environment, focusing on data provenance, quality, and usability for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Field sites and catchment descriptions
- Ribble catchment (north-west England): high population density (989 km−2); subcatchments Hodder and Calder; Calder includes Burnley and Blackburn; upper catchment shows rapid rainfall response (flashy regime).
- River Conwy (north Wales): major drainage with population density 49 km−2; mountainous topography; strong river response to storms.
- Hampshire Avon (south England): population density 108 km−2; largely groundwater-dominated due to chalk aquifers; tidal limit shows limited rainfall response.
- River Dee (north-east Scotland): sparsely populated above the tidal limit (4 km−2); upper catchment (Gairn) responds rapidly to rainfall and snowmelt (flashy regime).

## River sampling and analyses
- Sample collection: 5 L water samples from tidal limits; additional upstream samples in Ribble and Dee.
- Suspended particulate matter (SPM) extraction: repeated centrifugation to concentrate SPM (~100 mL slurry).
- Organic carbon measurement: two techniques to determine [SPM] and %OC; filtration through pre-weighed GF/F filters, drying and reweighing; total carbon analysis with Vario EL and Thermo Flash 2000 elemental analysers.
- 14C analysis: graphite targets prepared from CO2 via iron/zinc reduction; CO2 converted to iron/graphite; subset analyzed for δ13C using a dual-inlet mass spectrometer for δ13CVPDB correction.
- Laboratories: most measurements at SUERC (Scotland) AMS facility; three measurements at UCIAMS (UC Irvine) for small samples (<500 μg C).
- Radiocarbon reporting: results expressed as percent modern carbon (pMC); 100% modern defined relative to AD1950; bomb carbon considerations acknowledged; analytical precision given as 1σ.
- Isotopic corrections: δ13C corrections applied to 14C data; standardization against international references.

## Data, metadata, and provenance
- Detailed metadata structure for Riverine_PO14C_Raw_Data, including:
  - Catchment, Site, Flow, Lat, Long, Date, Publication code, d13CVPDB‰, 14C pMC, ±1σ PMC, [SPM], %OC, and related fields.
  - Clear definitions and units for each column to enable verification and reuse.
- Metadata supports data governance, traceability, and quality assurance across sites and laboratories.

## Data quality, QA, and governance
- Cross-lab QA: measurements conducted at multiple labs with size-matched standards and background materials; use of international reference materials to verify accuracy and precision.
- Corrections and calibrations: δ13C corrections applied; pMC values normalized to standard reference; age interpretations linked to established radiocarbon practices.
- Data presentation: results accompanied by uncertainty (1σ), clear documentation of methods, and transparent reporting formats to facilitate interpretation and policy use.

## References and methodological context
- Foundational methodological references for radiocarbon and isotope analyses:
  - Boutton et al. (1983)
  - Slota (1987)
  - Xu et al. (2004)
  - Stuiver & Polach (1977)
