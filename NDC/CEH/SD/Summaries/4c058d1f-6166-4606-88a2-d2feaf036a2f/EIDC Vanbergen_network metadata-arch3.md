# Insect visitation to flowering plants in birch woodland fragments (2009) - Data abstract

- A dataset documenting species identity and frequency of all insect-flower interactions recorded in 10 birch-dominated woodland fragments surveyed in 2009 (May–August).
- Two transects per site (50 × 2 m, 15 m apart, at least 50 m from edge), randomly placed; sampling occurred before flowering.
- Comparison across grazing treatments: five sites disturbed by cattle grazing and five undisturbed; livestock absent for 70–100 years at undisturbed sites; light-to-moderate grazing at disturbed sites with long-term history (mean 33 years).
- One site (Brathens) yielded insufficient data and is excluded from analyses, leaving replication n = 9.
- Data were used to inform two papers and were co-funded by the British Ecological Society and the NERC CEH Environmental Change Integrating Fund; subsequent paper development supported by CEH national capability projects.

## Study design and data collection

- Timeline: 20 May 2009 to 27 Aug 2009; focus on insect visitation to flowering plants in 10 birch woods located in the River Dee catchment, Aberdeenshire (approx. 57.036–57.058° N, -2.512–-2.962° E).
- Data collection included environmental context (wind speed and temperature) at the time of sampling using a Kestral 3000 meter.
- Variables captured:
  - Site name and geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Grazed vs ungrazed status
  - Wind speed and temperature at sampling
  - Sampling date
  - Insect taxonomy (order, family, species/RTU)
  - Plant species visited
  - Interaction frequency (number of visits)
  - Flowers per plant individual observed (flowers_N)

## Dataset structure and contents

- Size and structure: 13 columns, 2002 rows, 218 KB.
- Core columns (illustrative): Site, latitude, longitude, Date, Wind, Temp, Order, Family, Insect species, Flower Species, Interactions, Flowers_N, and Grazed/ungrazed status.
- Metadata mappings are explicitly defined for site, location, environmental measurements, taxa, and interaction metrics.
- One dataset component (Brathens) excluded from analyses due to insufficient visitation data.

## Metadata, provenance, and governance

- Clear metadata definitions accompany the dataset, including data collection circumstances (date, environmental conditions) and taxonomy references (binomial names or RTUs with supplementary material for taxonomic authority).
- Lineage and provenance: data collected specifically for ecological network analysis and used in related publications; coordinates and sampling context are documented to support reproducibility.
- Data sharing and openness: underlying dataset and metadata are documented, but the broader context notes that public sharing of datasets can be a barrier in some cases; the dataset itself is packaged with explicit metadata to facilitate reuse.

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations for monitoring

- Strengths: well-documented sampling design, environmental context, and taxonomic detail; explicit treatment of grazing status to enable comparisons.
- Limitations: Brathens site excluded due to insufficient data, reducing replication to nine sites; potential gaps in data for some variables (e.g., incomplete taxonomic resolution in RTUs); reliance on two short transects per site may limit broader generalizability.
- Metadata richness supports quality assurance and future data integration, but researchers should assess compatibility with other datasets (e.g., metadata standards, taxonomic harmonization).

## Applications for monitoring frameworks

- Provides a structured example of assembling ecological interaction data with explicit metadata, enabling monitoring of plant–insect networks across land-use gradients (grazed vs. ungrazed).
- Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: from field collection and environmental context to data curation, governance, and dissemination in support of scholarly outputs.
- Highlights the importance of documenting data provenance, sampling design, and metadata to support transparency, replication, and data reuse in policy-relevant monitoring.
