# Data abstract

- The dataset documents insect-flower interactions in 10 birch-dominated woodland fragments surveyed in 2009 (May–August) to quantify species identity and interaction frequency.

- Study design: two transects per site (50 × 2 m; 15 m apart, ≥50 m from the woodland edge) randomly placed in the center of each wood; five sites disturbed by cattle grazing and five undisturbed.

- Data scope and replication: one site (Brathens) had insufficient insect visitation data and was excluded from analyses, leaving replication of n = 9 sites for analyses.

- Location and timing: birch woodlands located in the River Dee catchment, Aberdeenshire, Scotland (coordinates provided in the dataset); data collected in 2009.

- Funding and provenance: data collection funded by the British Ecological Society and the NERC CEH Environmental Change Integrating Fund; subsequent paper development supported by CEH national capability projects.

- Dataset contents: 13 columns and 2002 rows, including:
  - Site name and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude)
  - Grazed vs ungrazed status
  - Environmental context at sampling: wind speed and temperature
  - Sampling date
  - Insect identity (order, family, species/RTU)
  - Plant flower species visited
  - Interaction frequency (how often each insect interacted with each plant)
  - Flower counts per plant individual (flowers_N)

- Metadata and definitions: clear definitions for each column, including units (e.g., wind in mph, temperature in Celsius), and links to supplementary material for taxonomic details.

- Related outputs: data used to prepare two Functional Ecology papers (2014 and 2016) on insect visitation networks, grazing effects, and plant mating systems; links to publications provided in the dataset documentation.

- Data utility for the Data Support archetype:
  - Enables construction of plant–insect interaction networks and analysis of how grazing disturbance influences network structure.
  - Supports data cleansing, integration with environmental variables (wind, temperature), and creation of self-serve dashboards or reports for exploring interaction patterns.
  - Demonstrates data provenance, quality considerations (patchy data at one site leading to exclusion), and the importance of metadata for reuse.
