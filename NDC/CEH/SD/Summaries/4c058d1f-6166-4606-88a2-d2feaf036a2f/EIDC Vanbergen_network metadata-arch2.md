# Data abstract

- This dataset documents insect-flower interactions recorded in 10 birch-dominated woodland fragments (Betula spp.) in the River Dee catchment, Aberdeenshire, during 2009 (May–August).
- The study compares sites with cattle grazing (disturbed) to undisturbed sites (long-term absence of livestock) to understand how land-use affects insect visitation networks and plant mating systems.
- One site (Brathens) lacked sufficient data and was excluded, leaving replication of nine sites for analysis.

## Study design and scope

- Two transects per site (50 m × 2 m), with transects 15 m apart and at least 50 m from the woodland edge.
- Sites randomly situated prior to flowering; five grazed and five ungrazed sites (grazing intensity: light to moderate, long-term presence).
- Data collection occurred over the core flowering period; funding supported dataset development and subsequent papers.
- The location range is 57.0581–57.0367°N, -2.9621–-2.5124°W in Aberdeenshire.

## Dataset content

- Structure: 13 columns, 2,002 rows, ~218 KB.
- Core fields include:
  - Site name and geographic coordinates (latitude, longitude)
  - Grazing status (disturbed by cattle grazing or not)
  - Environmental context at sampling: wind speed and temperature
  - Sampling date
  - Insect identity: order, family, species (binomial or recognizable taxonomic unit)
  - Plant identity: flowering plant species visited by insects
  - Interaction data: frequency of visitation between each insect and plant species
  - Flowers per plant individual observed (flowers_N)

## Metadata and variables

- Clear definitions accompany each column (site, date, wind, temp, order, family, insect species, interactions, flower species, flowers_N, etc.).
- Data annotations reference supplementary materials and published works for taxonomic authority and RTUs.

## Data provenance, funding, and lineage

- Fieldwork conducted May 2009 to August 2009 in birch woods along the River Dee drainage.
- Data underpin two related papers on network structure, mutualism, and grazing effects on insect visitation and plant mating systems.
- Funding and support acknowledged from the British Ecological Society and the NERC CEH Environmental Change Integrating Fund, with CEH national capability project backing subsequent analyses.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring

- Provides a standardized, QA-friendly dataset of plant–insect interactions suitable for monitoring ecosystem health and pollination networks over time.
- Enables analysis of how grazing disturbance influences ecological networks and plant reproductive dynamics.
- Outputs in the form of networks and related metrics support policy performance assessment and environmental health indicators.

## Data usage, sharing, and accessibility

- Data collected are linked to published analyses and supporting information (papers and online supplementary materials).
- Dataset is described with explicit metadata for reproducibility; replication is nine sites after exclusion of Brathens.
- Suitable for integration with other environmental datasets to increase analytical value beyond single-use applications, and to improve accessibility of underlying data for broader scrutiny.
