# Data abstract

- The dataset contains information on the species identity and frequency of all insect–flower interactions recorded in 10 birch woodland fragments in 2009 (May–August). Data were collected in two transects (50 × 2 m; 15 m apart; at least 50 m from the woodland edge) randomly located in the center of each wood, with five sites grazed by cattle and five undisturbed. One site (Brathens) yielded insufficient insect visitation data and is excluded from analyses (n = 9 replication).

- Structure and contents: 13 columns, 2002 rows, 218 KB. Records include site name and geographic coordinates, grazing status, wind speed, temperature at sampling, sampling date, plant species, insect species (binomial or RTU), interaction frequency, and a count of flowers per plant individual where insects were recorded visiting.

- Location and timing: Birch wood sites located in the River Dee catchment of Aberdeenshire (latitudes ~57.03–57.06, longitudes ~-2.96 to -2.51); data collection from 20 May to 27 August 2009.

- Environmental and measurement details: Wind speed and temperature recorded at time of sampling using a Kestral 3000 portable meter; sampling occurred during the flowering period prior to insect visitation recording in the center of each wood.

- Context and funding: Data collection funded by a British Ecological Society small grant (SEPG 1563/1968) and the NERC CEH Environmental Change Integrating Fund (NEC03463), with subsequent support from CEH national capability projects (NEC04654 & NEC05106). The dataset underpins two papers (one in press) and is linked to related Functional Ecology publications.

- Lineage and related outputs: Data collected 20 May–27 August 2009 in 10 birch-dominated woods in the River Dee catchment; used to prepare two papers (doi links provided in the metadata). The dataset has explicit provenance summarizing site/geography, sampling conditions, and taxonomic references.

- Metadata and definitions: Clear definitions for each column, including site, latitude, longitude, grazing status, date, wind, temperature, insect order and family, insect species/RTU, plant species, interaction frequency, and flowers_N (flower count per plant). Supplementary material provides taxonomic authorities when not listed in the database.
