# Carbon and nitrogen stocks in soil organic matter fractions along grassland-to-forest conversion chronosequences across Scotland

- Overview
  - Dataset of Carbon (C) and Nitrogen (N) stocks in soil organic matter fractions (kg/m2) for the top 0-5 cm and 5-20 cm mineral soil layers.
  - Context: grasslands and Scots Pine plantations established on former grasslands, across four clusters in Scotland.
  - Fractions analyzed: dissolved (DOM), mineral-associated (MAOM), free particulate (fPOM), and occluded particulate (oPOM) organic matter.
  - Aim: to determine how the quantity and form of C and N stocks change following afforestation of long-term grasslands.

- Data content and structure
  - File: SOM_fractions_C_N.csv
  - Variables (columns):
    - cluster (1=Alyth, 2=Limerigg, 3=Peebles, 4=Hawick)
    - veg (grassland GR or Scots pine plantation grades: YO, MI, OL)
    - LUT (land use type: grassland or Scots pine forest)
    - depth (soil layer: 0-5 cm or 5-20 cm)
    - plant_year (year Scots pines were planted on former grasslands)
    - age (age of Scots pines at sampling, 2018)
    - pH, sand, clay, silt
    - BD (bulk density, g/cm3)
    - rock (percentage rock in soil)
    - q_DOM_C_m2, q_DOM_N_m2 (C and N in dissolved organic matter, kg/m2)
    - q_fPOM_C_m2, q_fPOM_N_m2 (C and N in free particulate organic matter, kg/m2)
    - q_oPOM_C_m2, q_oPOM_N_m2 (C and N in occluded particulate organic matter, kg/m2)
    - q_MAOM_C_m2, q_MAOM_N_m2 (C and N in mineral-associated organic matter, kg/m2)

- Sampling design and scope
  - Study sites in the Scottish Central Lowlands and Southern Uplands.
  - Sampling conducted in Summer 2018 using soil corers.
  - Each site: three soil cores collected and pooled.
  - Total samples: 32 (two vegetation types across four clusters with three age categories for pines considered in design).
  - Four clusters sampled with both grassland and Scots pine plantation land uses.
  - Location references (latitude/longitude) provided for representative cluster-vegetation combinations.

- Methods and processing
  - Soil cores split into 0-5 cm and 5-20 cm layers.
  - Soil samples dried and fractionated into DOM, fPOM, oPOM, and MAOM.
  - Additional soil properties measured: pH, texture (sand, clay, silt), bulk density (BD), rock content.
  - Data authors are responsible for collection and interpretation.

- Potential uses
  - Assess total C and N stocks and their distribution across soil fractions.
  - Compare effects of afforestation on carbon storage between grasslands and Scots pine plantations.
  - Inform carbon accounting, soil health assessments, and forest-for-grassland management decisions.
  - Support models of soil carbon dynamics by providing depth- and fraction-specific stock data.

- Data considerations and notes
  - Single sampling event (2018) across defined clusters; limited temporal replication.
  - Geographical replicates are true to four Scotland clusters; latitude/longitude provided at cluster-vegetation level.
  - Units: C and N stocks expressed in kg/m2; concentrations, fractions, and depths clearly defined.
  - Data packaged in a single CSV to enable self-serve exploration and analysis.
