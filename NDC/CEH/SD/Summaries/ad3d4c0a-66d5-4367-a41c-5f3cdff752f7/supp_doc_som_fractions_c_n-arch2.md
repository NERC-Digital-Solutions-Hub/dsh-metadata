# Carbon and nitrogen stocks in soil organic matter fractions along grassland-to-forest conversion chronosequences across Scotland

## Overview
- Investigates how C and N stocks in soil organic matter fractions change during afforestation of long-term grasslands.
- Data cover four clusters across Scotland, comparing grasslands with Scots Pine plantations planted on former grasslands.
- Measurements include total stocks and the distribution across soil fractions for two depth intervals.

## Dataset content
- One CSV file: SOM_fractions_C_N.csv
- Key stock measures (in kg/m2) for C and N across soil fractions:
  - Dissolved organic matter (DOM)
  - Free particulate organic matter (fPOM)
  - Occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM)
  - Mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM)
- Depth layers: 0–5 cm and 5–20 cm
- Fractions measured for both C and N (e.g., q_DOM_C_m2, q_DOM_N_m2, q_fPOM_C_m2, q_fPOM_N_m2, q_oPOM_C_m2, q_oPOM_N_m2, q_MAOM_C_m2, q_MAOM_N_m2)

## Variables and structure
- Cluster: origin cluster (1 Alyth, 2 Limerigg, 3 Peebles, 4 Hawick)
- veg: vegetation type (GR grassland; YO, MI, OL Scots pine plantations of increasing age)
- LUT: land use type (Grassland or Scots pine forest)
- depth: soil layer (0–5 cm or 5–20 cm)
- plant_year: year Scots pines were planted on former grasslands
- age: age of Scots pines at sampling (2018)
- pH: soil pH
- sand, clay, silt: soil texture fractions (%)
- BD: bulk density of rock-free soil (g/cm3)
- rock: percentage rock content
- q_DOM_C_m2, q_DOM_N_m2, q_fPOM_C_m2, q_fPOM_N_m2, q_oPOM_C_m2, q_oPOM_N_m2, q_MAOM_C_m2, q_MAOM_N_m2: quantified C and N stocks per fraction (kg/m2)

## Sampling design and scope
- Aims to determine changes in total quantity and in the form (fractions) of C and N stocks following afforestation.
- Sampling occurred in summer 2018.
- 32 soil samples total, collected as three cores per site and pooled.
- Four geographical clusters across Scotland, each including grassland and Scots pine plantation sites.
- Three grassland/three plantation age categories per cluster (true geographical replicates).
- Samples fractionated into four soil OM fractions.

## Locations and replication
- Cluster 1: Grassland (56.633827, -3.2410629) and Scots pine plantation (56.735279, -3.2706253)
- Cluster 2: Grassland (55.896026, -3.8524698) and Scots pine plantation (55.914748, -3.7977104)
- Cluster 3: Grassland (55.646448, -3.1281129) and Scots pine plantation (55.613873, -2.9536157)
- Cluster 4: Grassland (55.366159, -3.0258238) and Scots pine plantation (55.37448, -3.0053828)

## Data quality and stewardship
- Data were collected and interpreted by the authors responsible for the study.
- Includes accompanying soil measurements (pH, texture, bulk density, rock content) to contextualize C and N stocks.
- Designed to be compatible with standardized environmental monitoring outputs (clear, structured format for integration and comparison).

## Potential analyses and uses
- Assess how afforestation alters total C and N stocks in soil and how these changes distribute across DOM, fPOM, oPOM, and MAOM fractions.
- Compare shallow (0–5 cm) versus deeper (5–20 cm) soil layers.
- Examine geographic-patterned differences across the four clusters and age classes.
- Integrate with other environmental datasets to enhance monitoring of soil carbon and nutrient dynamics under land-use change.
- Use in maps and charts to illustrate environmental health and policy-relevant changes over time.
