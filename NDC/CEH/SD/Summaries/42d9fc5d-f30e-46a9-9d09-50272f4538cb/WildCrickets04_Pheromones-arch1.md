# WildCrickets04_Pheromones Description of content

- A dataset detailing the pheromonal profile of cuticular hydrocarbons (CHCs) from the thorax of adult crickets, comprising 32 compounds.
- Columns include:
  - Year: the year the cricket was alive.
  - Tag: a two-character identifier read from video recordings via a plastic tag on the cricket's pronotum.
  - Sex: male (M) or female (F).
  - Peak1 to Peak40: 32 CHC peak scores corresponding to the analyzed compounds (note: there is a potential inconsistency between 32 compounds and Peak1–Peak40 naming; described as 32 columns representing 32 CHC peaks).
- Purpose: to capture individual chemical profiles for potential analyses of sex differences, temporal changes, and individual identification.
