# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

- Study purpose and scope
  - Long-term monitoring of actuarial (survival) and phenotypic traits in Gryllus campestris.
  - Project spans about a decade, with the title framing ten years and the body noting twelve consecutive years of monitoring.

- Study site and population
  - WildCrickets field site in Asturias, North Spain (9 km south of the Atlantic).
  - Meadow (~20,000 m2) with a population occupying ~800 m2 on the flat area.
  - Surrounding habitat includes meadows, orchards, eucalyptus plantations, chestnut and oak patches.
  - Population structure and habitat preferences: crickets avoid shady areas; limited migration due to surrounding terrain.

- Monitoring design and data streams
  - Long-term, continuous monitoring with standardized procedures.
  - Data streams include individual biology, behavior, and environmental context:
    - Individual-level data: unique ID tags, weight (±0.01 g), photos; samples for pheromone and DNA profiling.
    - Behavioral and ecological data: recordings of emergence, burrow use, singing, mating, spermatophore success, fights, predation, oviposition, and movement.
    - Environmental data: weather station measurements every 10 minutes plus seven additional surface sensors (in burrs and meadow).
    - Video-based data: 64–140 infrared cameras monitoring burrow entrances, recording 24/7 during the active season.
    - Complementary observations: direct checks of non-videoed burrows to ensure complete coverage.

- Sampling regime and field methods
  - Fieldwork conducted yearly with mowing in mid-March and again in July-August; maintenance mowing otherwise to keep grass short.
  - Weekly burrow searches from February until July to locate occupants.
  - Population monitoring protocols established for emergence and life cycle timing: adults emerge in spring; eggs hatch by mid-summer; last adults die by late June/early July.
  - Individual crickets captured shortly after adult emergence:
    - Weighing, photographing, and tagging with a unique PVC tag on the pronotum.
    - Tissue and chemical samples collected prior to release for later analyses.

- Data collection specifics
  - Cameras and data capture:
    - Installation of a network of cameras (increasing from 64 in 2006 to 140 by 2017) covering burrows and surrounding areas.
    - Video stored on a DVR system; cameras rotated to maximize coverage due to more burrows than crickets and more crickets than cameras.
    - Recording continues from first adult eclosion until two days without cricket activity, then cameras are removed for the year.
  - Behavioral metrics:
    - Quantification of singing activity (presence in 5-minute samples per hour).
    - Documentation of mating outcomes via spermatophore status.
  - Other fauna interactions: recording of burrow use and activity of other animals (slugs, isopods, beetles, spiders, bees) and predators (mammals, birds, insects).

- Instrumentation and environmental measurement
  - Weather monitoring: Davis Vantage Pro2 weather station with ten-minute interval data.
  - Micro-environment sensors: seven additional sensors placed on meadow surface and inside simulated burrows (PVC tubes) to capture microclimate effects.

- Calibration and data quality
  - All instruments factory-calibrated to ensure measurement accuracy.
  - Data quality control implemented in two stages:
    - Initial pass to separate burrows in use from empty burrows via rapid multi-camera review.
    - Detailed second-pass review of multiple cameras for event-level data (e.g., emergence, interactions, mating outcomes).
  - Data integration and storage:
    - Event data logged in spreadsheets during viewing, then consolidated into a MS Access database for processing.
    - Ongoing consistency checks to prevent errors (e.g., a cricket recorded as using two burrows simultaneously).

- Data processing workflow
  - Two-step per-day data extraction from video:
    - Step 1: quick pass to identify burrow usage.
    - Step 2: detailed review of events across selected cameras, with each event recorded in a structured dataset.
  - Post-processing in a relational database to support analysis and reporting.

- Key governance and methodological notes for monitoring frameworks
  - Integration of multiple data modalities (biological sampling, behavior, environmental context) over many years.
  - Use of unique identifiers (per burrow and per individual) to maintain longitudinal continuity.
  - Rigorous quality control and data consistency checks embedded in the workflow.
  - Standardized calibration and transparent documentation of instrumentation and sampling procedures.
  - Flexibility to adjust camera deployment while maintaining a long-running, comparable data record.
