# WildCrickets01-BasicTraits Description of content

- Purpose: This file includes basic information on each adult tagged individual in the population for the listed traits.
- Scope: Focuses on adult crickets that have been tagged and observed.

- Key fields and their meanings:
  - Year: The year when the cricket was alive.
  - Tag: A two-character code identifying the cricket in video recordings; a plastic tag is attached to the pronotum and readable in the video.
  - Sex: Male (M) or Female (F).
  - Emerged: The date when the cricket emerged as an adult (may be blank if unknown).
  - Tagged: The date when the cricket was caught for the first time and tagged.
  - Dead: The date when the cricket died, or the last time it was observed if death was not recorded.
  - ThoraxWidth: The width of the thorax measured from a picture taken from above.
  - BodyMass: The mass of the cricket at the date it was tagged.
  - Monitored: The number of days this individual cricket has been under observation.

- Data characteristics and notes:
  - Emerged can be blank if the emergence date is unknown.
  - Dates are used for temporal analyses (life events, tagging, mortality, monitoring duration).
  - ThoraxWidth and BodyMass are measured biology metrics; units are not specified in this description.

- Potential uses for analysts:
  - Track growth and maturation patterns (ThoraxWidth, BodyMass) by sex and year.
  - Analyze survival and life-history timing (Emerged, Tagged, Dead) and how they relate to monitoring duration (Monitored).
  - Identify patterns by tag identity and across years to support longitudinal studies using the video-tagged individuals.
