# Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

- Long-term field study to examine actuarial and phenotypic senescence in Gryllus campestris
- Twelve consecutive years of monitoring at WildCrickets, Asturias, North Spain, with a focus on comprehensive life-history and behavioural data

## Study site and population

- Location: WildCrickets field site, Asturias (North Spain), 9 km south of the Atlantic, at the bottom of a river valley
- Elevation: ~60 m to ~270 m above sea level
- Habitat: Meadows and orchards with eucalyptus plantations and patches of chestnut and oak; crickets concentrated in sunny meadow areas on the southeast slope
- Meadow and population scale: Meadow ~20,000 m2; cricket population occupies ~800 m2 on the flat portion
- Management context: Meadow mowed mid-MMarch and July-August; additional mowing from August–March; limited migration due to surrounding shade and roads

## Sampling regime and life-history context

- Species life cycle: Gryllus campestris is flightless and univoltine; adults emerge in spring, lay eggs from early May; eggs hatch by mid-summer; last adults die by end of June/early July; nymphs overwinter in diapause and resume growth in spring
- Longitudinal aim: Track actuarial and phenotypic aspects over multiple years with consistent sampling despite site management

## Collection methods

- Individual handling: Trap each cricket a few days after adult emergence; weigh to ±0.01 g; photograph; mark with a unique PVC pronotum tag (1–2 character code)
- Biological sampling: Cuticular hydrocarbons, a small haemolymph sample, and a small leg tip for pheromone and DNA profiling
- Identification framework: Tags linked to video via unique codes for longitudinal identification

## Monitoring infrastructure

- Cameras: Between 64 and 140 infrared day/night cameras installed per season to cover burrow entrances (多数 burrows observed; cameras moved to maximize data)
- Recording regime: Cameras operate continuously from first adult eclosion until two consecutive days with no cricket activity
- Weather and microclimate: Central weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) logs variables at 10-minute intervals; seven additional sensors placed on the meadow surface and inside simulated burrows (PVC pipes buried in ground)
- Data capture period: Monitoring and video recording conducted annually around the start of the adult eclosion period

## Fieldwork and instrumentation management

- Burrow tagging: Each burrow flagged with a unique identifier; direct observations conducted for non-videoed burrows to confirm occupancy and emergence timing
- Video review workflow: Post-event review to record emergence, encounters, singing, mating, oviposition, predation, and movement around the meadow
- Video storage: DVR system across multiple computers; continuous storage during active season; camera management to balance coverage and resources

## Calibration and instrumentation

- All instruments are factory calibrated to ensure measurement consistency across years

## Analytical methods and data processing

- Per-day data extraction: Two-step video analysis
  - Step 1: Broad pass to separate burrows in use from those empty (multi-camera view at high speed)
  - Step 2: Detailed review (typically 4 cameras at once; up to 9–16 under certain conditions) with event-based recording into a spreadsheet
- Data integration: Imported into MS Access database for subsequent processing
- Data completeness: Cross-checks to ensure consistency (e.g., no cricket recorded as occupying two burrows simultaneously)

## Quality control and data integrity

- Consistency checks: Access queries detect recording inconsistencies and ensure dataset integrity before use
- Data curation: Rigorous QC steps prevent erroneous event attribution and maintain reliable longitudinal data

## Key data products and observations

- Behavioral events captured: basking, moulting, singing, courting, mating attempts, spermatophore attachment/removal, fights, feeding, oviposition, and movement
- Reproductive and social metrics: Mating success via spermatophore presence; time spent singing as an index of courtship and activity
- Ecological context: Burrow occupancy dynamics and predation events; incidental recording of non-cricket fauna interactions around burrows
- Environmental context: High-resolution weather and microclimate data aligned with behavioral observations
- Data storage and accessibility: Behavioral data stored in an MS Access database; video data stored on DVR systems; ongoing methodological updates to accommodate increasing camera coverage over years

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and data stewardship

- Demonstrates standardized, repeatable data collection and processing workflows suitable for long-term environmental monitoring
- Emphasizes data quality assurance, traceability, and integration of multi-source datasets (behavioral, physiological, and environmental)
- Highlights ongoing challenges and opportunities for data value enhancement and broader data access for secondary analyses and policy evaluation
