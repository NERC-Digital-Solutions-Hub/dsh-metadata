# SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION: Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term study of actuarial and phenotypic senescence in Gryllus campestris over ten years at a wild field site in Asturias, North Spain.
  - Continuous monitoring of a cricket population in a defined meadow with extended historical use.

- Study site and population context
  - Location: WildCrickets field site in Asturias, near a river valley, with meadows, orchards, eucalyptus, and mixed tree cover.
  - Meadow size and layout: about 20,000 m2 total; cricket population occupies ~800 m2 on the flat portion near burrows.
  - Habitat characteristics: crickets avoid shaded areas; limited migration due to shade and roads; long-term meadow management practices (mowing schedule).

- Sampling regime and temporal framework
  - Monitoring span: twelve consecutive years with annual fieldwork cycles.
  - Management: mowing in mid-March and July-August; ongoing mowing between these periods to maintain short grass.
  - Burrow-focused monitoring: weekly searches Feb–July for burrow activity; adults emerge in spring, reproduce from May, with last adults dying by early summer.
  - Population tracking: each year, more burrows than crickets and more crickets than cameras; cameras repositioned to maximize data on individual behavior.

- Individual capture, marking, and sampling
  - Capture method: trap each adult soon after emergence using a cricket-specific device.
  - Individual identification: unique PVC tag attached to the pronotum; tags read via video.
  - Measurements and samples: weight (±0.01 g), photos, cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and a small leg tip sample for pheromone and DNA profiling.

- Data collection infrastructure and instrumentation
  - Video surveillance: installation of infrared day/night cameras (64 initially, increasing to 133–140 over time) to monitor burrow entrances continuously.
  - Coverage strategy: cameras assigned to burrows; dynamic reallocation to maximize informative coverage as occupancy changes.
  - Weather data: central weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) with ten-minute interval readings and seven additional surface sensors in meadow burrows.

- Calibration and data fidelity
  - Instrument calibration: all devices factory calibrated prior to use.
  - Data quality controls: ongoing calibration and cross-checks to ensure consistent data capture.

- Data capture and processing workflow
  - Data collection process: two-stage video analysis per day.
    - Stage 1: rapid pass to separate burrows in use from empty burrows (multi-camera review).
    - Stage 2: detailed review of selected cameras to document events (e.g., basking, moulting, singing, mating, spermatophore transfer, fights, oviposition, predation).
  - Event coding: identification of adult emergence, encounters, singing, matings, and other significant behaviors.
  - Data storage and integration: video and event data are consolidated into a database (MS Access) for downstream processing and analysis.

- Fieldwork and observational procedures
  - Burrow tagging: each burrow assigned a unique identifier for the season.
  - Non-videoed burrows: direct, periodic observations to identify occupants and verify emergence dates.
  - Post-processing review: researchers watch videos and log significant events after the season ends to ensure comprehensive data capture.

- Data management, discoverability, and updates
  - Data collection generates longitudinal, multi-modal data (video, tagging, biomaterials, environmental sensors).
  - Metadata and provenance are maintained through unique identifiers for burrows, cameras, and individuals.
  - Data are updated annually with new field seasons and reanalyzed as needed, maintaining a consistent long-term dataset.

- Key considerations for data leaders
  - Long-term data stewardship: robust, repeatable workflow across years, with clear documentation of methods.
  - Data integrity: multi-step QC processes to detect and correct inconsistencies (e.g., a cricket recorded in two burrows simultaneously).
  - Interoperability: integration of behavioral observations, biomarker data, and environmental variables for holistic analyses.
  - Reproducibility: explicit data processing steps and centralized storage to enable replication of analyses.
