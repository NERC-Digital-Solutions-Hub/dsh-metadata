SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION:
Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

## Overview
- Long-term field study monitoring actuarial and phenotypic senescence in Gryllus campestris.
- Twelve consecutive years of data collection at a meadow-based WildCrickets site in Asturias, North Spain.
- Aimed at linking life-history traits, behavior, and demographic patterns to senescence dynamics.

## Study System and Site
- Location: Meadow in Asturias, 9 km south of the Atlantic, valley bottom, near a railway line.
- Habitat: Measured at ~60–270 m above sea level; surrounds include meadows, orchards, eucalyptus, chestnut, and oak patches.
- Population space: Cricket population concentrates on ~800 m2 of the flat meadow area; overall meadow ~20,000 m2.
- Ecology: Gryllus campestris is flightless and univoltine; overwinter as late-instar nymphs; adults emerge in spring; eggs laid from early May; adults die by late June/early July; nymphs diapause in winter before a final instar and emergence.

## Population Monitoring and Sampling Regime
- Monitoring period: Annual cycle with mowing in mid-March and July–August; weekly burrow searches Feb–July.
- Individual tagging: Each cricket weighed (±0.01 g), photographed, and tagged with a unique PVC tag on the pronotum; tag code enables video-based identification.
- Biological sampling: Cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and a segment of hind leg tissue collected for pheromone and DNA profiling.
- Emergence and activity tracking: Direct observations supplement video when burrows lack cameras to ensure accurate emergence dating and activity logs.

## Data Collection Methods and Instrumentation
- Video surveillance: 64–140 infrared cameras installed annually around burrow entrances (increase from 64 in 2006 to 140 in 2017); cameras record 24/7 from first adult eclosion until two consecutive days with no activity.
- Video management: DVR and multiple computers; movement-triggered recording; cameras relocated to maximize capture of individual behavior.
- Weather and microhabitats: A central weather station logs data every 10 minutes; seven additional sensors around the meadow (surface and burrow-adjacent) to capture temperature variation.
- Direct observations: Burrows without camera coverage are checked every 1–2 days to confirm occupant identity and activity.

## Data Collected and Observables
- Individual-level data: ID, weight, photographic record, tag code; collected samples for chemical and genetic profiling.
- Behavioral data: Basking, moulting, singing, courtship, mating attempts, spermatophore attachment/removal, fights, foraging, oviposition, arrivals/departures, time spent in/out of burrows, predation events.
- Reproductive metrics: Presence/absence of spermatophore on females as a proxy for mating success.
- Community context: Recording of non-cricket burrow use and various predators (mammals, birds, insects, spiders).

## Data Processing and Analysis Pipeline
- Data extraction: Per-day, two-stage video processing.
  - Stage 1: Quick screening to identify burrows in use across multiple cameras.
  - Stage 2: Detailed viewing of selected cameras to log events; events recorded in MS Excel.
- Data integration: Logged events are imported into an MS Access database for downstream processing and analyses.
- Quality control: Consistency checks via Access queries to prevent conflicting records (e.g., same cricket assigned to two burrows simultaneously); data are only used after passing consistency checks.

## Calibration and Validation
- Instruments: Factory-calibrated cameras, weight scales, and weather sensors ensure measurement reliability.
- Validation workflow: Layered video review and cross-verification with direct observations to ensure event accuracy and occupancy records.

## Timeline and Scale of Deployment
- Pilot and expansion: 2005 pilot with 16 cameras; 2006 launch with 64 cameras; ongoing expansion and relocation of cameras to maximize data capture.
- Scale by 2017: 140 cameras deployed across the meadow, enabling comprehensive behavioral monitoring across burrows.
