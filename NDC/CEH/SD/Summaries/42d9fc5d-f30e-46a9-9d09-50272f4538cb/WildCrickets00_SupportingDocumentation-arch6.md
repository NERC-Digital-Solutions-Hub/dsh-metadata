# SUPPORTING DOCUMENTATION: Actuarial and phenotypic senescence in a wild field cricket ( Gryllus campestris ) population over ten years

## Context and study overview
- WildCrickets field site located in Asturias, North Spain, near a river valley with diverse surrounding land use (meadows, orchards, eucalyptus, patches of chestnut and oak).
- Population inhabits a meadow (~800 m2) within a larger ~20,000 m2 area; monitoring spans twelve consecutive years with a focus on actuarial and phenotypic senescence.
- Life cycle: univoltine cricket, overwinter as late-instar nymphs, adults emerge in spring, eggs laid from early May, diapauses in burrow entrances by autumn, with last adults dying by end of June/early July.
- Habitat features and management: meadow m mowing in mid-March and July–August; limited migration due to surrounding shade and roads/railway boundaries.

## Data collected and data types
- Individual-level data
  - Weight to ±0.01 g, photographs, unique PVC tag codes glued to pronotum.
  - Biological samples: cuticular hydrocarbons, haemolymph, and a small leg tip sample for pheromone and DNA profiling.
- Behavioral and life-history data
  - Burrow-level activity around entrances; daily presence/absence of crickets.
  - Singing activity: presence/absence in 5-minute samples each hour, used to estimate time spent singing.
  - Mating outcomes: presence of attached spermatophore.
  - Other behaviors: basking, moulting, courting, mating attempts, fights, predation events, oviposition, movements in/out of burrows.
  - Predators recorded (mammals, birds, insects, spiders) and interactions among individuals.
- Video data and instrumentation
  - Infrared day/night cameras installed at burrow entrances; typically 64 cameras initially, expanding over time to 140 by 2017.
  - Continuous 24/7 video recording during the active season; cameras relocated among burrows to maximize data capture.
  - DVR-based video storage on multiple computers adjacent to the meadow.
- Environmental data
  - Weather data from a central weather station (Davis Vantage Pro2) logging at 10-minute intervals.
  - Seven additional temperature sensors located on the meadow surface and inside simulated burrows (PVC pipes) for microhabitat context.
  
## Sampling regime and field workflow
- Each adult cricket is trapped after emergence, weighed, photographed, and marked with a unique tag before release.
- Direct burrow observations supplement video data to cover non-videoed burrows; adults or nymphs observed to infer emergence dates.
- Calibration and validation steps occur throughout the season to ensure accurate linking of individuals to events across burrows and cameras.

## Data collection methods and field instrumentation
- Trapping and tagging protocol designed for individual identification and subsequent longitudinal tracking.
- Laboratory sampling for molecular and chemical profiling to complement behavioral data.
- Camera network setup and management:
  - Deployment scales from 64 to 140 cameras over the study period.
  - Recording triggered by movement; continuous coverage during the breeding season.
- Weather and microclimate measurements:
  - Central weather station plus in-field sensors to capture meadow- and burrow-level temperatures.

## Data processing, analysis workflow, and data management
- Video data extraction (per-day basis) in two steps:
  - Step 1: Quick pass to identify burrows in use vs. empty burrows across multiple cameras.
  - Step 2: Detailed viewing of selected cameras (typically four at a time; sometimes more) with events recorded in a spreadsheet.
- Data integration and storage:
  - Processed data imported into a database (MS Access) for downstream analysis.
  - Use of spreadsheet-based event logging prior to database entry.
- Data quality control:
  - Consistency checks to detect errors (e.g., a cricket recorded in two burrows simultaneously).
  - Data not used until consistency across recordings and events is verified.

## Analytical methods and outputs
- Event extraction and daily summarization form the basis for downstream analyses of senescence and life-history traits.
- Behavioral metrics include quantified singing time and mating success, among other events documented from video and direct observations.
- The dataset supports actuarial and phenotypic analyses across multiple years, incorporating individual identity, life-history events, social interactions, and environmental context.

## Calibration, quality assurance, and data integrity
- All instruments are factory calibrated to ensure measurement accuracy.
- Ongoing quality assurance routines validate video data integrity and event consistency before use in analyses.
