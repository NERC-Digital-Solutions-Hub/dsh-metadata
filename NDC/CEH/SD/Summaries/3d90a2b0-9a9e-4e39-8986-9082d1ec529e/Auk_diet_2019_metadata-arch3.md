# The dataset:

- Purpose and scope
  - Contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR, off the east coast of Scotland.
  - Diet of these species has been studied at the Isle of May since the 1980s; limited prior studies in Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast (2006; 2017–2018) and East Caithness (2017–2018).
  - Aims align with standard, repeatable methods and protocols to assess diet, building on long-term seabird monitoring (IMLOTS) within the UK Seabird Monitoring Programme.

- Background and monitoring context
  - Seabird diet methods and calculations have been standardised since 1987.
  - The manual provides standardised protocols for assessing diet of common guillemot and razorbill.

- Field measurements and data collection
  - Primary method: observe prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to the colony or displaying to other adults.
  - Data collected from an observation position; field data recorded in notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and backed up on CEH servers; notebooks/sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Data quality is ensured through field staff training and defined protocols.

- Data handling, quality control, and governance
  - Databases are quality controlled at source.
  - Outputs undergo management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Administration).
  - All CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential scientific information in peer-reviewed literature with prior customer approval; underlying data shared appropriately.

- Diet data specifics by species
  - Common guillemot Uria aalge
    - Diet quantification methods have been consistent since 1987.
    - Chick provisioning observations: adults return with a single prey item to feed the chick; prey data collected from visual observations; displaying behavior also observed.
    - Field watching schedule: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast sites used two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) on 18/6–2/7/19 and 10/6–27/6/19 respectively.
    - Isle of May watches: dawn to dusk on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19; additional opportunistic observations (range 4/6–14/7/19).
    - Data recorded during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; opportunistic observations recorded only prey size and arrival.
    - Prey composition: majority are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring categorized as clupeids in the dataset due to identification challenges).
    - Prey size classification: five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) based on adult bill length; some items obscured during feeding, but presumed eaten; lengths estimated from prey on breeding ledges where possible.
    - Fish size data: too few gadoids detected to allow accurate size assessment; gadoids constitute a very small portion of the diet.
  - Razorbill Alca torda
    - Diet quantification methods remained consistent since 1987.
    - Chick provisioning observations: adults return with multiple fish in the bill to feed the chick; data collected from visual observations.
    - Field watching schedule: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast sites used two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) on 21/6–4/7/19 and 16/6–29/6/19 respectively.
    - Isle of May watches: dawn to dusk on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19; opportunistic observations (range 6/6–17/7/19).
    - Data recorded during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; opportunistic observations recorded only prey size and arrival.
    - Prey composition: majority are lesser sandeel or clupeids; clupeids include sprat and herring and are treated as clupeids in the dataset.
    - Prey size classification: five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using the bill length as a guide.
    - Prey number: recorded for razorbill observations (exact or broad categories for scene complexity).
    - Fish size data: too few gadoids detected to allow accurate size assessment; gadoids are a very small part of the diet.

- Output, data sharing, and data governance
  - Outputs linked to contracted deliverables and subject to planning and reporting governance within CEH.
  - Data and findings are disseminated through reports, charts, or dashboards; underlying data shared where appropriate.
  - Public sharing of datasets may be constrained by customer approvals and data governance considerations.
