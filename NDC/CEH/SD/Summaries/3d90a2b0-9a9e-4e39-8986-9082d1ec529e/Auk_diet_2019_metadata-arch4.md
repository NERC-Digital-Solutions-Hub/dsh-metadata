# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR, off eastern Scotland.
- Builds on long-running diet studies ( Isle of May long-term study; JNCC Seabird Monitoring Programme) with standardised methods since 1987.
- Aims to provide standard, repeatable diet assessment protocols for these two species.

## Background and standards
- Diet quantification methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987.
- For guillemot, diet data are collected from prey items carried in the bill during chick provisioning or display; for razorbill, prey items are collected when adults return with multiple fish.
- The manual facilitates consistent field sampling, data handling, and integration with the wider seabird monitoring framework.

## Field data collection and protocols
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff using defined protocols; data recorded in notebooks and field data sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and backed up on CEH servers.
- Notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Observations performed from fixed plots/observation positions at colonies, with data validated before entry.

## Data management and quality control
- Databases are quality controlled at the data source.
- Output and integrity are subject to management vetting within CEH, ensuring alignment with contracted deliverables and timely reporting.
- Encouraged publication of non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.

## Data elements and measurement details
- Common guillemot (Uria aalge):
  - Two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) during specific dates at East Caithness and Buchan Ness; dawn-to-dusk watches on the Isle of May with opportunistic observations.
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, and prey size; opportunistic data include prey size and species only.
  - Prey categorized into five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
  - Prey typically includes lesser sandeel and clupeids (sprat/herring treated as clupeids when field separation is not possible).
  - Some prey items observed during feeding to chicks may be unclassifiable by species/size; fish on ledges used to estimate size distributions.
  - Prey number recorded as exact counts or broad categories (few, moderate, many).
- Razorbill (Alca torda):
  - Similar two-hour watches at East Caithness and Buchan Ness; dawn-to-dusk watches on the Isle of May; opportunistic observations also recorded.
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, and prey number; opportunistic data include only prey size and species.
  - Prey predominantly lesser sandeel and clupeids; clupeids are treated as a single group in the dataset when species separation isn’t possible.
  - Prey size classified into the same five categories; some items may be unidentifiable or only partially observed during feeding.
  - Prey numbers recorded as exact counts or broad categories.

## Site-specific schedules and scope
- East Caithness SPA (58°12´42'N, 03°27´53'W) and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23´07'N, 01°52´09'W; 57°26´01'N, 01°49´03'W): two-hour watches during late June to early July 2019.
- Isle of May NNR (56°10´57'N, 02°33´17'W): dawn-to-dusk watches on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19; additional opportunistic observations between 4/6 and 14/7/19.
- Data collection practices align with long-term monitoring protocols to ensure comparability over years.

## Data limitations and considerations
- Separation of sprat and herring within clupeids is not feasible in the field; all clupeids are recorded as a single group.
- When adults feed prey to chicks, partial wing spreading can obscure prey view; some items may be classified only by size or left as “eaten” without species/size determination.
- Too few gadoids were available to support precise size assessments; nonetheless, gadoids constitute a very small portion of the diet.

## Outputs and dissemination
- Data quality, reports, and alignment with contracted deliverables are monitored by CEH leadership and administrative channels.
- Data and findings are eligible for peer-reviewed publication with customer approval and acknowledgement.
