# The dataset:

- This dataset contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at three sites off the east coast of Scotland: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR). Diet studies at these sites build on long-term work at the Isle of May and across UK seabird monitoring.
- Standardised methods for calculating diet have been used since 1987, aligned with the Isle of May Long-Term Study (IMLOTS) and the UK Joint Nature Conservation Committee seabird monitoring framework. The manual aims to provide repeatable protocols for assessing diet.

- Field measurements and data handling:
  - Data were collected by experienced staff in the field on notebooks and field sheets, then transcribed to spreadsheets and backed up on CEH servers; all notebooks and sheets are archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality controlled at source; outputs are vetted for management purposes. Non-confidential scientific information may be published with customer approval.

- Species-specific methods and observations:
  - Guillemot (Uria aalge)
    - Diet quantification methods have been standard since 1987.
    - During chick-rearing, adults return with a single prey item to feed the chick or to display to other adults (display). Prey composition data are collected from visual observations from an observation position.
    - Observation periods: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast—two-hour watches from 04:00–22:00 (East Caithness 18/6–2/7/19; Buchan Ness 10/6–27/6/19). Isle of May—dawn-to-dusk watches on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19, with additional opportunistic observations (4/6–14/7/19).
    - Recorded data during watches: time of arrival, prey species, and prey size. Opportunistic observations recorded prey size and prey species only.
  - Razorbill (Alca torda)
    - Diet quantification methods have been standard since 1987.
    - During chick-rearing, adults return with multiple fish in the bill to feed the chick. Data are collected from visual observations.
    - Observation periods: East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast—two-hour watches 04:00–22:00 (East Caithness 21/6–4/7/19; Buchan Ness 16/6–29/6/19). Isle of May—dawn-to-dusk on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19; opportunistic observations 6/6–17/7/19.
    - Recorded data during watches: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, and prey number. Opportunistic observations recorded prey size and prey number only.

- Prey identity and classification:
  - Across years, the vast majority of prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring). In the field, sprat and herring are not distinguished and are grouped as clupeids; on the Isle of May small sprat identifications are made based on size and timing relative to spawning, but all clupeids are reported as clupeids in the dataset.
  - Prey size is categorized into five classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using the adult bill length as a guide. Some prey items observed during feeding may be obscured, and some items presented to chicks are presumed eaten even if size/species cannot be determined.
  - For guillemot, too few gadoids were observed to accurately assess their sizes; gadoids comprise only a small portion of the diet at all three colonies.

- Data fields and reporting:
  - The number of prey items is recorded either as an exact estimate or as a broad category (few, moderate, many).

- Context and references:
  - Diet data and methods are linked to longstanding studies and publications (e.g., Harris & Wanless 1985, 1986; Wilson et al. 2004; Daunt et al. 2008; Thaxter et al. 2013; and subsequent regional studies in 2014, 2017–2018, and 2018). The dataset references specific prior work on diet and methodology.

- Data use and accessibility:
  - The dataset forms part of ongoing seabird diet assessment efforts and contributes to standardised, repeatable assessments of seabird feeding ecology. Data are curated to support reporting, interpretation, and potential public release through data portals with proper metadata.
