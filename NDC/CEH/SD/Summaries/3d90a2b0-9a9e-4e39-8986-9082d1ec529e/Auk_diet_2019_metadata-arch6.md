# The dataset:

- Scope and purpose
  - Dataset of prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR off the east coast of Scotland.
  - Diet has been studied at the Isle of May since the 1980s; limited prior diet studies at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast and East Caithness SPA.
  - Objective: provide standard, repeatable methods and protocols for assessing the diet of the two seabird species; methods standardized since 1987.

- Study sites and timing
  - East Caithness SPA (58°12´42'N, 03°27´53'W); Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA (57°23´07'N, 01°52´09'W; 57°26´01'N, 01°49´03'W); Isle of May NNR (56°10´57'N, 02°33´17'W).
  - 2019 field effort with site-specific watch schedules across these locations; Isle of May included dawn-to-dusk watches on 24/6/19 and 30/6/19 with opportunistic observations 4/6–14/7/19.

- Data collection methods
  - Core approach: observe prey carried in bills of breeding adults returning to colonies to feed chicks (and display in guillemot).
  - Observation positions used to record data; all fieldwork conducted by trained staff to defined protocols.
  - Data collection flow: field notebooks and data sheets → transcribed to spreadsheets; backups on CEH servers; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases are quality controlled at source.

- Field measurements and recording rules
  - Common guillemot (Uria aalge)
    - Recordings: time of arrival, prey species, prey size; during opportunistic observations, only prey size and arrival information recorded.
    - Prey composition: majority consists of lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring) which are difficult to separate in the field; all clupeids are grouped as clupeids.
    - Prey size classification: five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) guided by adult bill length.
    - Observational constraints: when adults feed chicks, wings/back arching may obscure view; items presented in this way treated as eaten; some prey size/species may be unidentifiable.
    - On-island ledges: fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size classes.
    - Gadoids: too few observed to accurately size-categorize; they constitute a very small part of the diet.
  - Razorbill (Alca torda)
    - Recordings: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number; during opportunistic observations, only prey size and number recorded.
    - Prey composition and classification rules mirror guillemot: majority are lesser sandeel or clupeids; clupeids grouped as such in data.
    - Prey size classification and observational limitations align with guillemot procedures.
    - Prey numbers: recorded either as exact counts or broad categories (few; moderate; many) due to difficulty in precise estimation.

- Data fields and classification
  - Prey items are assigned to one of five size classes.
  - Prey counts can be exact or categorized.
  - Species identification challenges: clupeids treated as a single group; sprat/herring may be distinguished in some cases but are generally grouped as clupeids.

- Data handling, quality, and outputs
  - Data quality: databases quality-controlled at source; field data are transcribed with checks; backups maintained.
  - Output and reporting: results and reports undergo management vetting to ensure alignment with contracted deliverables and timeliness; staff encouraged to publish non-confidential findings with customer approval.
  - Data dissemination: outputs intended to support ongoing monitoring and public understanding; prior customer approval required for publishing.

- Context and references
  - Background and methods have been standardized since 1987 as part of seabird monitoring and consistent with IMLOTS and JNCC practices.
  - Key references documenting diet quantification methods and prior findings across the Isle of May and other sites are listed to support methodology and interpretation.

- Notable considerations
  - Despite standardized methods, some uncertainty remains in species-level classification within clupeids and in sizing for certain prey due to observational limitations.
  - Opportunities for opportunistic observations exist and are documented with limited metadata (primarily prey size and number when applicable).
  - The dataset emphasizes self-contained, repeatable methodologies to enable comparisons across years and sites.
