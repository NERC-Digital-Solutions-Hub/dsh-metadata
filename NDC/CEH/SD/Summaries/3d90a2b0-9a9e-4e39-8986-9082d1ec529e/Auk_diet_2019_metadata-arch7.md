# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of prey items for common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at three sites off the east coast of Scotland: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR).
- Diet assessment follows standardized, repeatable methods established since 1987 to support seabird monitoring and reporting.

## Spatial and Temporal Coverage
- Sites and coordinates:
  - East Caithness SPA: 58°12´42"N, 03°27´53"W
  - Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA: 57°23´07"N, 01°52´09"W; 57°26´01"N, 01°49´03"W
  - Isle of May NNR: 56°10´57"N, 02°33´17"W
- Observation periods in 2019:
  - Guillemot: 04:00–22:00 watches at East Caithness (18 Jun–2 Jul 2019) and Buchan Ness (10 Jun–27 Jun 2019); Isle of May dawn to dusk on 24 Jun and 30 Jun 2019, with opportunistic observations 4 Jun–14 Jul 2019.
  - Razorbill: 04:00–22:00 watches at East Caithness (21 Jun–4 Jul 2019) and Buchan Ness (16 Jun–29 Jun 2019); Isle of May dawn to dusk on 24 Jun and 30 Jun 2019, with opportunistic observations 6 Jun–17 Jul 2019.

## Data Collection and Protocols
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff using defined protocols; data collected from observation positions and transcribed to spreadsheets; notebooks and field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh; data backed up on CEH servers.
- Databases quality controlled at the source; output and reporting vetted within CEH.

## Data Variables and Classification
- Guillemot (Uria aalge)
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size.
  - Opportunistic observations: prey size and prey species only.
  - Prey categorization: majority are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat/herring grouped as clupeids in the dataset).
  - Size classification: five categories (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
  - Note: when feeding to chicks, prey may be obscured; items presented are presumed eaten; size/species classification may be incomplete.
  - Prey counts: not specified for exact counts in the guillemot protocol; data include counts only where explicitly recorded in other contexts.
- Razorbill (Alca torda)
  - Recorded: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number.
  - Opportunistic observations: prey size and prey number only.
  - Prey categorization and size classification as for guillemot.
  - Note: clupeids treated as a single category; some individual species identification (e.g., sprat vs herring) not always possible in the field.

## Data Quality, Archiving, and Use
- Diet calculation methods standardized since 1987; data are intended to be repeatable and comparable across years.
- Data quality controlled at source; field data archived at CEH Edinburgh; reports and outputs undergo management vetting.
- Data and findings are eligible for non-confidential scientific publication with customer approval and acknowledgment.

## Outputs, Deliverables, and References
- Outputs linked to contracted deliverables; CEH staff encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval.
- References to foundational and related work spanning 1985–2013, establishing methodology and context for diet assessment in these seabird species (e.g., Harris & Wanless; Daunt et al.; Thaxter et al.; Wilson et al.).

## GIS Relevance and Potential Map-Based Products
- Spatially explicit data across three sites enable creation of map-based diet visualizations:
  - Spatial distribution of prey types (e.g., sandeel vs clupeids) by site and date.
  - Temporal trends in prey size categories and prey numbers for each species.
  - Site-specific comparisons of diet composition and feeding behaviours (e.g., display vs provisioning patterns).
- Potential products:
  - Species- and site-specific diet maps or heatmaps showing prevalence of major prey groups.
  - Temporal choropleth maps of prey size categories during the breeding season.
  - Interactive dashboards linking prey types to colony locations and observation periods.
- Data characteristics favorable for GIS:
  - Clear site coordinates and defined observation plots.
  - Time-stamped observations and, for razorbill, counts of prey items.
  - Standardized size classifications facilitating cross-site aggregation and comparison.

## Limitations and Considerations for GIS Use
- Field identification constraints: clupeids grouped as a single category; occasional species-level identification (e.g., sprat) limited.
- Opportunistic observations have reduced metadata (time may be missing for some entries) and may be less consistent than watch data.
- Some prey sizes and numbers may be unclassifiable due to vantage constraints when birds are feeding chicks.
- Data resolution varies by site and year, requiring careful harmonization when integrating across sites or years.
