# The dataset:

- Aim and context
  - Contains prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season at three Scotland east coast sites: East Caithness SPA, Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May NNR.
  - Diet of these species has been studied at Isle of May since the 1980s; limited previous diet studies at Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast and East Caithness to 2017–2018.
  - Background and long-term context linked to Isle of May Long-Term Study and the UK Seabird Monitoring Programme.

- Standardisation and methods (background)
  - Diet quantification methods have been consistent since seabird monitoring was standardised from 1987.
  - Standardised protocols exist to provide repeatable assessment of diet.

- Field measurements and data collection
  - Guillemot: observation of prey carried in bills returning to feed chicks (and display to adults); data from an observation position.
  - Razorbill: similar observation of prey carried in bills to feed chicks.
  - Scheduling and locations:
    - East Caithness and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast: two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) on specified dates in 2019 at active breeding plots.
    - Isle of May: dawn-to-dusk watches on specific dates, plus opportunistic observations across a broader date range.
  - Recorded details:
    - Guillemot: time of arrival, prey species, prey size. Opportunistic observations recorded only prey species and prey size.
    - Razorbill: time of arrival, prey species, prey size, prey number. Opportunistic observations recorded only prey species and prey size.
  - Prey identification:
    - Majority prey are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring indistinguishable in the field); some skeptically identified as sprat, but all clupeids are grouped as clupeids in the dataset.
  - Size classification:
    - Prey assigned to five size classes (very small, small, medium, large, very large) using adult bill length as a guide.
    - When feeding to chicks, displays can obscure prey view; presumed eaten when shown. Size/species could not always be classified.
    - For fish on breeding ledges, lengths estimated by size categories; too few gadoids observed to accurately assess sizes, but gadoids were a small part of the diet overall.

- Data handling, quality, and storage
  - Data collected on field notebooks and data sheets; transcribed to spreadsheets; backups on CEH servers; notebooks and sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
  - Databases quality controlled at source.
  - Output and reporting subject to management vetting within CEH; alignment with contracted deliverables; punctual reporting.

- Data access, publication, and use
  - CEH staff are encouraged to publish non-confidential findings in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgment.
  - Data and outputs are prepared to enable wider use while protecting confidential elements.

- Output interpretation and limitations
  - Prey composition dominated by lesser sandeel and clupeids; species-level identification for clupeids limited in field (sprat vs herring); occasional identification based on size/timing relative to spawning, but all treated as clupeids in the dataset.
  - Certain observations (e.g., display events, obscured prey views) limit precise classification of size and species for some items.
  - Data include both exact prey counts and broad categories (few, moderate, many) for the number of prey items.

- References and context
  - Cited studies spanning 1985–2013 that underpin the methods and interpretation of seabird diet data (e.g., Harris, Wanless, Daunt, Thaxter, Wilson).

- Particular challenges and opportunities (alignment with analyst role)
  - Increasing the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data sources to avoid single-use outputs.
  - Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
