# The dataset:

## Overview
- Dataset of prey items of common guillemot Uria aalge and razorbill Alca torda observed during the 2019 breeding season.
- Sites: East Caithness Special Protection Area (SPA), Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA, and Isle of May National Nature Reserve (NNR) off the east coast of Scotland.
- Aligns with long-term seabird diet studies; standard methods in use since 1987 for seabird diet assessment.

## Data Collection and Provenance
- Fieldwork conducted by experienced staff following defined protocols; notebooks and field data sheets used and then transcribed to spreadsheets; backups stored on CEH servers; notebooks/field sheets archived at CEH Edinburgh.
- Data quality controlled at source; databases quality controlled before use.
- Observation regimes:
  - Common guillemot: two-hour watches (04:00–22:00) at specified dates/plots; Isle of May dawn-to-dusk watches on selected dates; additional opportunistic observations.
  - Razorbill: two-hour watches with similar timing; dawn-to-dusk watches at Isle of May; opportunistic observations also recorded.
- Data handling and reporting:
  - Outputs subject to management vetting and tracking within CEH (Heads of Science Areas, Directors, Finance Admin).
  - Encouraged for CEH staff to publish non-confidential results in peer-reviewed literature with customer approval and acknowledgement.

## Data Structure and Contents
- Taxa: two seabird species — common guillemot (Uria aalge) and razorbill (Alca torda).
- Core data collected during watches (and opportunistic records):
  - Time of arrival (where recorded)
  - Prey species
  - Prey size class
  - Prey number (exact or broad category: few, moderate, many)
- Prey size classification: five categories (very small, small, medium, large, very large) based on adult bill length.
- For both species, majority prey items are lesser sandeel or clupeids (sprat and herring grouped as clupeids when field-identification is not possible).
- Species-specific notes:
  - Guillemot: data include prey items in the bill when returning to feed chicks or for display; opportunistic observations record prey size and prey species only (no time of arrival).
  - Razorbill: data include multiple prey items per trip; same caveats about display feeding as for guillemot; opportunistic observations record prey size and prey number only.
- Size and identification caveats:
  - When prey is fed to chicks, visibility can be obscured; some prey may be unidentified at the time of observation.
  - Gadoids were rare; sizes of observed gadoids were difficult to assess precisely.
  - Fish on breeding ledges used to estimate lengths within size classes.
- Data scope:
  - East Caithness SPA and Buchan Ness to Collieston Coast SPA observations span 04:00–22:00 during specified dates in 2019; Isle of May observations include dawn-to-dusk watches and opportunistic dates in 2019.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Documentation
- Diet quantification methods consistent with standard seabird diet protocols since 1987.
- Documentation and protocol details included in species accounts and data collection manuals; methods used to calculate diet are standardized across years.
- All data and field procedures are anchored to long-term monitoring programs (e.g., Isle of May Long-Term Study and UK Seabird Monitoring Programme).
- Data stewardship emphasizes traceability from field notebooks to final datasets; archival of original field sheets.

## Access, Use, and Publication
- Data management and quality control processes ensure integrity and alignment with contracted deliverables.
- Non-confidential findings are encouraged for publication in peer-reviewed venues, with prior customer approval and acknowledgment.

## Limitations and Considerations for Use
- Opportunistic observations yield limited fields (prey size and prey number); time of arrival may be missing for these records.
- Field identification cannot always distinguish sprat from herring; all clupeids are grouped together in the dataset.
- Some prey items are not fully classifiable by size or species due to observational constraints (e.g., display feeding obscures prey view).
- Estimation of prey sizes relies on reconstruction from ledge observations and may introduce uncertainty, especially for gadoids.
- Data represent specific breeding seasons (2019) and locations; findings may not generalize beyond these contexts without supporting data.
