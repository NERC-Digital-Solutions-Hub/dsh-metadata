# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2021

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for LCM2021, the ninth UK land cover map, produced annually.
  - Product comprises six geospatial datasets: three for Great Britain and three for Northern Ireland.
  - Datasets include a 10 m classified pixel dataset, a land parcel dataset, and a 25 m pixel rasterised land parcel dataset.
  - Aims to help users make informed decisions by describing data production, validation, and accuracy; supports monitoring state and change of UK countryside.

- Key concepts and terminology
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes: 21 classes derived from Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats.
  - Context Rasters: 10 m ancillary layers (e.g., height, slope, distance to features) to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Seasonal Composite Images: Sentinel-2-based four-season spectral mosaics, used with context rasters in classification.
  - Classification Scene: multi-layer input (seasonal image + context rasters) used for pixel classification.
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic training data derived from historical maps to train a Random Forest classifier.

- Data production workflow
  - Seasonal composites and context rasters
    - Seasonal Composite Images created from Sentinel-2 data (four seasons; 10 m resolution bands 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,8A,11,12).
    - Context rasters (GB): height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore and tidal masks, woodland mask.
    - Context rasters (NI): height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/freshwater/road, foreshore and tidal masks.
  - Classification Scenes and tiling
    - GB: 32 Classification Scenes using a modified OS 100 x 100 km tile grid to ensure manageability and regional phenology consistency.
    - NI: a single 40-band Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Image combined with NI context rasters (49-band Classification Scene).
  - Bootstrap Training and Random Forest
    - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCMs (LCM2018–LCM2020) with >80% purity parcels. Classified pixels are drawn per parcel for RF training.
    - Training uses balanced sampling (10,000 samples per class) to avoid dominance by common classes.
    - Software stack: bespoke UKCEH tool integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source).

- The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Land parcels (~0.5 ha MMU) derived from generalised national cartography to create discrete, real-world units.
  - Parcels facilitate noise reduction and enable change detection; parcel identifiers (gid) do not perfectly match LCM2015 if comparing by ID.

- Dataset descriptions and formats
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
    - Derived from mosaicked Classification Scenes; each pixel has two bands: the most-likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer) and the associated class probability/confidence.
    - Not generalized by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework, preserving fine landscape detail (but validation was performed against the 25 m Land Parcel dataset).
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
    - Parcel attributes include gid, _hist (histogram of class occurrences in the parcel), _mode, _purity, _conf, _stdev, _agg (aggregate class), and _n (pixel count).
    - GB parcels: ~6,741,288; NI parcels: ~902,248.
  - 25 m Pixel Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
    - Rasterised per parcel at 25 m; three-band rasters carry: dominant land cover class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
  - 1 km summary rasters
    - Derived from 25 m rasters; provide dominant class per 1 km pixel and percentage cover for both classes (21 bands) and aggregates (10 bands).
    - Note: rounding can cause sums to deviate from 100; coastal pixels may underrepresent certain classes due to resolution.
  - Coordinate systems and extents
    - Great Britain: OSGB 1936 / British National Grid, EPSG 27700.
    - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid (TM75), EPSG 29903.
  - Documentation of datasets
    - Official dataset names and extents are provided in Appendix 3; large-scale metadata available with each product.

- Validation and accuracy
  - Validation dataset: 35,182 points across all 21 classes.
  - Overall accuracy: 82.6% (95% CI 82.19% – 82.99%) when validated against the 25 m rasterised parcel data.
  - Validation approach combines GB countryside survey data, open data inventories, and bespoke validation points.

- Use considerations for GIS specialists
  - 10 m Classified Pixels offer rich detail (e.g., narrow features) but are not generalized by the parcel framework; best for specialists who understand the trade-offs.
  - Land Parcel products provide a stable, comparable structure for time-series analysis and change detection; differences in parcel IDs may affect cross-year comparisons if relying on gid alone.
  - 1 km and 25 m products enable scalable analysis and reporting, including summary statistics and broad-scale mapping.
  - The 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to, but not identical with, UK BAP Broad Habitats; Appendix 1–2 provide mapping nuances and potential confusions.
  - Seasonal composites and context rasters help reduce spectral confusion, but some classes (e.g., bog, peat-dominated areas) remain challenging and show inter-class confusion (documented in the appendices).
  - Data quality caveats: annual production aids change detection but requires careful interpretation to distinguish real change from sampling/algorithmic noise.
  - Output display guidance: Appendix 5–6 provide recommended colour recipes and QGIS symbology files (including color-blind-friendly version) for consistent visualization.

- Display, colour, and metadata
  - Appendix 5: Recommended color recipe for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes in maps.
  - Appendix 6: Color-blind friendly color recipe and accompanying QGIS symbol files (lcm_raster.qml and lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml) are provided to facilitate accessible visualization.
