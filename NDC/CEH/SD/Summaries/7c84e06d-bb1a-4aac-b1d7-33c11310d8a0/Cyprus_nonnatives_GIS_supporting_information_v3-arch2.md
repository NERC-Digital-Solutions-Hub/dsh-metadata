# Non-native plant species GIS data from Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas, October 2015 and March 2017

## Aim and scope
- Provides GIS data on woody non-native plant stands and related notes from Akrotiri (2015) and Akrotiri and Dhekelia (2017) in Cyprus Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs).
- Supports integration with quadrat data and forthcoming biodiversity data paper; data will be archived and linked to related outputs (e.g., BDJ paper, GBIF).

## Sampling and fieldwork methods
- 2015 (October): mapping of woody non-natives using GPS tablet-based mapping with ArcPad v10.2; field mapping oriented by satellite imagery; lead by AFM for access and project management.
- 2015 study area defined by Akrotiri-Kolossi road (west), Akrotiri forest (north), Mediterranean Sea (east), Akrotiri-Lady’s Mile Beach road (south).
- 2017 (March): mapping and predominant focus on quadrat recording; field team similar; includes Oxalis pes-caprae stands in Dhekelia.
- Typical data capture accuracy around 10–15 m (varies with forest canopy).

## Target species and data categories
- Primary focus in 2015: Acacia saligna, Casuarina cunninghamiana, Eucalyptus camaldulensis, E. gomphocephala, Symphyotrichum squamatum (syn. Aster squamatum).
- Other notable species recorded as target notes.
- 2017 additions: Oxalis pes-caprae; more emphasis on quadrat data.
- Recording categories: stands mapped with distinct categories; Casuarina and certain eucalypts grouped due to difficulty distinguishing juvenile or intimate mixtures.

## Data files and structure
- 2015 files (created 10/10/2015–24/10/2015):
  - Acacia_saligna_EIDC.shp
  - Eucalyptus_spp_areas_EIDC.shp
  - Mixed_species_areas_EIDC.shp
  - Symphyotrichum_squamatum_EIDC.shp
  - Target_notes_EIDC.shp
- 2017 files (created 04/03/2017–18/03/2017):
  - Acacia_saligna_2017_EIDC.shp
  - Oxalis_pes-caprae_2017_EIDC.shp
  - Target_notes_2017_EIDC.shp
- Table 1 describes attributes for the species/area shapefiles; Table 2 describes target notes shapefiles.
- Note: Quadrat data to be archived on GBIF and linked with the BDJ paper; detailed field notes in polygon attribute tables.

## Spatial reference and data projection
- Shapefiles use ETRS89 / ETRS-LAEA European grid (EPSG:3035).
- Proj4 string: +proj=laea +lat_0=52 +lon_0=10 +x_0=4321000 +y_0=3210000 +ellps=GRS80 +units=m +no_defs

## Data quality control
- Plant species determinations checked against standard Floras and guides in the field and via specimens; cross-checked by team members to unify determinations.
- Consultation with local experts (e.g., G. Hadjikyriakou) to confirm identification of non-native forestry plantings (e.g., Casuarina).
- Some species categorizations reflect field recording constraints (e.g., eucalypts and Casuarina treated together in mixed stands).

## Temporal coverage
- 2015 field data collection: 10 October 2015 – 24 October 2015.
- 2017 field data collection: 4 March 2017 – 18 March 2017.
- File naming reflects collection year and event (e.g., 2017_EIDC).

## Related work and data access
- Quadrat data to be archived with the Biodiversity Data Journal (BDJ) paper in preparation; forthcoming data paper (Peyton et al., In prep.) will provide more information and link quadrat data.
- ACS/EP: Data Centre hosting (NERC Environmental Information Data Centre, EIDC).
- References provide context on species and Cyprus flora; some determinations updated after fieldwork.
