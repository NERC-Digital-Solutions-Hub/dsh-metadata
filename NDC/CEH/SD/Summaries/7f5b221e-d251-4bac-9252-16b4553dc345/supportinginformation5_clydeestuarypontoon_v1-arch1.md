# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physio-chemical water properties: Estuary Transect measurements - 2021-2022

- Study aim and scope
  - Quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes and sinks of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Clyde estuary and compare anthropogenic vs non-anthropogenic sources.
  - Develop a model of the controls and mechanisms governing GHG production, transport, consumption, and release to the atmosphere.
  - Determine, under varying conditions (tidal regime, stratification, temperature, river flow), which sources and sinks are active and their mechanisms.
  - Part of the Clyde estuary study; includes eight longitudinal transect surveys published separately by the EIDC.

- Site and sampling framework
  - Location: Braehead pontoon, middle of the inner Clyde estuary, near the tidal weir (7.9 km upstream) separating fresh and saline zones.
  - Sampling period: seven occasions between August 2020 and May 2022, covering a tidal cycle under varying tides, river flows, and seasons.
  - Depths: surface samples and near-bed samples (0.5 m above bed; surface ~0.2 m below surface) to study depth-related variation in GHGs and water quality.
  - Environment and activity notes: pontoon in a dredged estuary channel; dredging activity occurred during the first survey and intermittently around the study period; sampling timed to cover ebb and flood tides when possible.
  - Data scope: includes measurements of GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O) and physio-chemical properties; accompanying long transects provide broader spatial context.

- Measurements and data collected
  - GHG concentrations and evasion:
    - Dissolved gas concentrations via headspace equilibration; partial pressures and calculated concentrations.
    - GHG evasion measured with a floating chamber (CH4 and CO2) using a GGA instrument; triplicate measurements over ~3 minutes per time point.
    - Evasion data recorded alongside wind speeds (2 m above pontoon).
  - Physio-chemical water properties:
    - Conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and DO saturation, pH, turbidity.
    - Sub-samples for total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N, total phosphorus (TP), and UV absorbance (ABS254 and SUVA254).
  - Derived metrics:
    - SUVA254 used as an indicator of aromaticity of DOC and potential anthropogenic influence.
    - Calculations to convert headspace data to dissolved gas concentrations and atmospheric partial pressures.

- Analytical methods and quality control
  - Gas analysis: Agilent 7890B GC with 7697A headspace autosampler; standards run with every sequence; typical analysis within 1 week of sampling.
  - Water chemistry analyses: filtration and sub-sampling for DOC, TDN, DIC, TP, nitrates, nitrites, ammonia using calibrated equipment (TOC-L, SEAL AQ2, UV/Vis spectrophotometer, etc.); multi-step colorimetric and digestion methods with standard calibrations.
  - Turbidity: measured with Thermo Scientific AQUAfast turbidity meter; three readings per sample.
  - Data processing: all samples processed under controlled lab conditions; standard addition and calibration routines employed for gas and chemical analyses.
  - Documentation: detailed metadata on sampling depth, time, coordinates, tidal conditions, river flow, and survey codes; data organized with explicit column definitions (Table 1/Appendix notes).

- Calculations and data units
  - Dissolved gas concentrations derived from headspace equilibrium using a mass-balance approach and temperature-dependent solubility coefficients (βT) and barometric pressure (PBAR).
  - Conversion from μmol/L to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law (RT factor).
  - Missing data noted with an asterisk in the CSV; some data gaps at CEP1 (August 2020) were limited to surface samples only.
  - Units and column definitions provided for all measured parameters (e.g., CH4(μmol/L), CO2(μmol/L), pH, DOC(mg/L), DIC(mg/L), TDN-N(mg/L), TP(mg/L), CH4(evasion in mg/m^2/d), CO2(evasion in g/m^2/d), etc.).

- Data scope, accessibility and limitations
  - Primary site-specific data: single-location transect at Braehead pontoon; provides high-resolution temporal data across tides and seasons but limited spatial extent.
  - Temporal resolution: seven surveys over nearly two years; captures ebb and flood tides and variable river flows.
  - Spatial scale: limited to parcel around Braehead pontoon; transect surveys provide broader context but are separate from this data subset.
  - Data gaps: surface-only data for CEP1; some measurements near bed not collected in CEP1; notes in the dataset clarify limitations.
  - Data management: analyses led by Alison Brown; data files described (CSV with detailed units and metadata); datasets designed to be discoverable with metadata, aligned with the accompanying CET/Environ. Inf. Data Cent. materials.
