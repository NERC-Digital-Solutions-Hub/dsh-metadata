# Supporting information Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physio-chemical water properties: Estuary Transect measurements - 2021-2022

## Aim and scope
- Document accompanying the Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physio-chemical water properties dataset, focusing on estuary transect measurements from 2021–2022.
- Main study objectives (contextual): quantify sources, concentrations, fluxes and sinks of GHGs within the Clyde estuary; develop a model of GHG production, transport, and release to the atmosphere; determine how tidal cycle, stratification, temperature, and river flow affect active sources and sinks.
- Specific aims for this component: assess how tidal cycle changes (depth, salinity, stratification, flow) impact water quality and GHG generation.

## Study area and sampling framework
- Location: Braehead pontoon, middle of the inner Clyde estuary; 7.9 km from the tidal weir (separating fresh and saltwater habitats).
- Dredging: ongoing in the estuary during the study period; last dredging in summer 2020.
- Temporal coverage: seven sampling campaigns between August 2020 and May 2022, designed to cover a full tidal cycle with ebb and flood phases.
- Spatial/vertical sampling: measurements taken at surface and near-bed (0.5 m above bed; surface ≈ 0.2 m depth above surface).

## Data collected and measured parameters
- Greenhouse gases: CO2, CH4, N2O concentrations; CH4 and CO2 evasion measured in situ.
- GHG evasion: measured using a floating chamber and ABB Microportable Gas Analyser (GGA); triplicate measurements over 3 minutes per timepoint; wind speed recorded to support evasion calculations.
- Physio-chemical water properties: conductivity, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and DO saturation, pH, turbidity.
- Nutrients and carbon species: total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), total dissolved carbon (TDC), dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N, total phosphorus (TP).
- Additional measures: absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA254) to infer DOM aromaticity; various data standards and units documented in Table 1 (CEP data).
- Headspace and ambient air sampling: conducted to enable dissolved gas determinations via headspace equilibration.

## Sampling regime and field procedures
- Sampling from outer side of the pontoon facing north; surface samples collected in 10 L plastic bucket; near-bed samples collected with depth measurement followed by lowering a depth sampler to 0.5 m above bed; samples filtered on the day after collection.
- In-field measurements: EC, temperature, DO, DO%, pH measured on-site; samples preserved for lab analyses (refrigerated) and processed subsequently.
- Water samples prepared for sub-sampling: filtration through GF/F 0.7 µm filters; sub-samples used for TDN, TDC, DOC, nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, TP, and absorbance analyses.
- Gas sampling protocol: headspace method for dissolved gases; ambient air samples collected at ~1 m above surface; CH4 and CO2 evasion measured with a floating chamber setup; triplicate measurements per survey where feasible.

## Analytical methods and quality assurance
- Gas analysis: headspace samples analyzed with a GC 7890B and headspace autosampler; standards run alongside samples for quantification of CO2, CH4, and N2O.
- Turbidity: measured with a Thermo Scientific AQUAfast turbidity meter (NTU).
- Nutrients and carbon analyses:
  - TDN, TDC, DOC via Shimadzu TOC-L; calibration with multiple standards; samples run in batches; consisting of filtered/unfiltered states.
  - SUVA254 determined from absorbance at 254 nm (UV/Vis spectrophotometry) to assess DOM character.
  - Nitrite-N, nitrate-N, ammonia-N measured with SEAL AQ2; standard colorimetric and reduction methods; sample preservation and handling described; caution noted for potential interference with ammonia due to hardness/precipitation at higher salinity.
  - TP measured with SEAL AQ2 after acid digestion (K2S2O8) and molybdenum-blue colorimetric determination.
- Data processing: analyses led by Alison Brown as part of an IAPETUS 2 DTP NERC-funded PhD; all data and methods referenced to the accompanying supporting information and Appendix.

## Gas calculations and interpretation
- Dissolved gas concentrations and partial pressures calculated using a mass-balance headspace equilibration approach.
- Core equation framework includes liquid-gas partitioning, gas concentrations after equilibration, and volumes of liquid and gas in the syringe.
- Conversion to common units (ppmv) achieved via the Ideal Gas Law (taking into account barometric pressure and temperature) and the relevant Bunsen solubility coefficients.

## Data characteristics, units, and limitations
- Missing data are indicated in the CSV as asterisks.
- Notable data gaps: CEP1 (August 2020) lacked near-bed measurements; certain surveys have depth-related or dredging-related notes that may affect measurements (e.g., dredging can mix saline layers into surface waters).
- A detailed table (Table 1) outlines units and column headings for the dataset, including depth, conductivity, temperature, pH, DO, turbidity, DOC, TDC, DIC, TDN, TP, SUVA254, nitrogen species, phosphorus, gas concentrations, CH4/CO2/N2O evasion, and comments.
