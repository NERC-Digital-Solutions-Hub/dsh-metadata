# Clyde Estuary greenhouse gas and physio-chemical water properties: Estuary Transect measurements - 2021-2022

- Objective and scope
  - Measure greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, N2O) and physio-chemical water properties in the Clyde estuary across a tidal cycle at the Braehead pontoon.
  - Seven sampling occasions from August 2020 to May 2022, spanning surface and near-bed waters under varying tidal, river-flow, and seasonal conditions.
  - Aimed to quantify sources, sinks, and fluxes of GHGs, understand controls on production/transport/atmospheric release, and determine conditions under which different sources/sinks are active.

- Study design and sampling regime
  - Location: Braehead pontoon in the inner Clyde estuary, mid-point between freshwater and saline influences; proximity to the tidal weir noted.
  - Sampling coverage: designed to capture an entire tidal cycle with ebb and flood tides; surface samples and near-bed samples (0.5 m above bed) where feasible; depth varied 3–7 m at site.
  - Measurements collected: 
    - In situ water quality parameters at surface and near-bed (conductivity, temperature, DO, DO%, pH).
    - Dissolved gases sampled via headspace method; ambient air samples collected at ~1 m above surface.
    - GHG evasion measured using a floating chamber with a gas analyser for CH4 and CO2 evasion.
    - Additional water chemistry analyses including turbidity, total dissolved carbon and nitrogen (TDC, TDN), DOC, DIC, nitrite, nitrate, ammonia, total phosphorus, and SUVA254 (aromaticity indicator).

- Analytical methods and QA
  - GHG analysis: headspace gas samples analyzed by GC with headspace autosampler; triplicate gas samples plus ambient air; standards run with each batch.
  - Water chemistry: turbidity meter; filtration and sub-sampling for TDN, TDC, DOC, DIC, NO2–, NO3–, NH4+, TP; TOC analyzer with calibration standards; absorbance at 254 nm for SUVA; nitrate/nitrite and ammonia via SEAL AQ2 with colorimetric methods; phosphorus via acid digestion followed by molybdenum-blue colorimetry.
  - Partial pressures and conversions: dissolved gas concentrations computed via headspace mass-balance; gas concentrations converted to ppmv using the Ideal Gas Law; temperature-adjusted solubility (βT) and barometric pressure used.
  - Data structure and units: comprehensive table of units (Table 1) and notes on missing data; some surveys had surface-only data (e.g., CEP1).

- Data handling, provenance and governance
  - Data processing and analysis primarily conducted by a named researcher as part of an NERC-funded PhD (IAPETUS 2 DTP).
  - Metadata and documentation linked to the survey codes, dates, depths, tidal conditions, and locations; photographs and appendix provide context.
  - Acknowledgments credit access to the Braehead pontoon and funding sources; underlying methodology and supporting information are documented to support reproducibility.

- Key findings and outputs (context)
  - The measurement framework enables estimation of GHG sources, sinks, and fluxes within the Clyde estuary, and supports development of a model for GHG production, transport, and atmospheric release under varying tidal and river conditions.
  - The design includes multiple lines of evidence (water chemistry, gas evasion, headspace analysis) to inform environmental health monitoring and policy-relevant decision making.

- Challenges, limitations, and data considerations for monitoring
  - Potential data gaps: some surveys had incomplete depth sampling (e.g., surface-only data for CEP1); missing data points are flagged in the dataset.
  - Data sharing and openness: public sharing of underlying datasets can be a barrier for some existing data sources; the study emphasizes the need for clear data governance and accessible metadata to enable reuse.
  - Field constraints: floating chamber evasion measurements may be influenced by wind and weather; measurements were not conducted in high-wind conditions due to methodological limitations.
  - Site-specific factors: dredging activity near the sampling location can affect stratification and mixing, potentially biasing measurements during certain surveys.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates end-to-end monitoring: clear objectives, systematic sampling across tidal cycles, robust analytical workflows, and transparent documentation.
  - Emphasizes data quality and transparency: calibration standards, replication, and detailed method descriptions support traceability and reproducibility.
  - Highlights data governance considerations: metadata completeness, explicit notes on data limitations, and alignment with data-sharing practices relevant to environmental health monitoring.
  - Provides a framework capable of informing future policy and management decisions by linking GHG dynamics to estuarine processes and anthropogenic influences.
