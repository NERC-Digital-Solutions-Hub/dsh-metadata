# Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007)

## Overview
- LCM2007 provides UK land cover information in multiple formats to meet different user needs.
- Designed to support data integration, analysis, and dissemination across user groups and workflows.

## Data formats and scales

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: polygons representing land parcels
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describes derivation
  - Minimum mappable unit: 0.5 hectares
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile
  - Coverage: United Kingdom

- Raster data
  - Five raster products
  - 25 x 25 meter raster: most likely Broad Habitat per pixel
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 km rasters summarizing the 25 m raster
  - Scales: 25 m and 1 km pixel sizes
  - Supply format: GeoTIFF
  - Coverage: United Kingdom

## Documentation and metadata
- Detailed metadata and attribute descriptions are available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- Specific references include:
  - Table 1: Attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the LCM2007 raster datasets

## Access, reuse, and stewardship considerations for data leaders
- Multiple formats enable integration into different data systems and workflows.
- Comprehensive documentation supports data quality assessment, provenance tracking, and proper metadata management.
- UK-wide coverage supports cross-system analysis and collaboration with partners.
- Users can select the appropriate resolution (vector for detail; raster for generalized habitat summaries) based on need.
- All formats are accompanied by metadata to aid discoverability and proper utilization.
