# Land Cover Map 2007

## Overview
- Land Cover Map 2007 (LCM2007) is available in multiple formats to suit different users and needs.
- Provides both vector and raster representations with detailed accompanying documentation.

## Data Formats and Coverage

- Vector data
  - Most detailed product: each polygon represents a land cover parcel.
  - Attributes describe land cover; metadata describes how information was derived.
  - Minimum mapable unit: 0.5 hectares.
  - Supply format: ESRI Shapefile.
  - Coverage: United Kingdom (UK).

- Raster data
  - Five raster products in total.
  - A 25 x 25 meter raster provides the most likely Broad Habitat for each pixel.
  - Four freely available 1 x 1 kilometer rasters summarize the 25 x 25 meter raster.
  - Supply format: GeoTIFF.
  - Coverage: UK.

## Metadata and Documentation

- Detailed metadata for raster formats available in the Land Cover Map 2007 Dataset Documentation.
- The documentation includes:
  - Table 1: Description of attributes of the LCM2007 vector dataset.
  - Table 2: Habitats, LCM2007 classes, and Broad Habitat sub-classes.
  - Table 3: Metadata information for the raster datasets.

## Access, Use and Governance Considerations for Data Stewards

- The dataset provides both richly described vector data (with derivation metadata) and raster data across multiple formats, supporting diverse user needs and interoperability.
- Comprehensive documentation and tables underpin data provenance, attributes, classifications, and metadata, aiding governance, quality assurance, and dataset discovery.
- UK coverage and defined minimum mapping unit (0.5 ha) are important for standardization and comparability across datasets.
