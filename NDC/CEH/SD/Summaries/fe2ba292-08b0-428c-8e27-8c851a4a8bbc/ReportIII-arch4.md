# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, located at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed to provide a broad context for related studies and enable year-to-year comparisons; baseline data from 1998 established.
  - Two 2001 disruptions: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions restricting site access (Feb–May 2001) and a change of site officer.

- Data Collected and Methods
  - Data types: Automatic Weather Station data; above-ground biomass measurements; soil pH (top 5 cm); botanical composition via Point Analysis; annual mowing and sampling events; vegetation surveys and related sub-plot measurements.
  - Experimental design: plots with treatments including Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen+Lime, and Biocide (plus a second Control); data collected across 1999–2001 with consistent protocols and measurement dates (Table 1 references and Fig. 1–6 illustrating links between treatments and outcomes).
  - Analyses: split-plot ANOVA for biomass across years (1999–2001) with year-by-treatment interactions; PCA on point-quadrat botanical survey to assess shifts in species composition; correlations between species abundance and biomass; examination of site heterogeneity across columns and blocks; assessment of soil pH changes due to lime and/or nitrogen.

- Key Findings
  - Weather
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; slight drop in average temperatures; higher soil moisture compared with previous years.
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions boost biomass; peak biomass occurs in July–August each year; 2001 biomass higher overall than 1999–2000, likely due to changes in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; significant year × treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
  - Soil pH
    - Lime raised surface pH; October 2001 pH ~6.19 in limed plots and ~6.38 in Nitrogen+Lime plots; nitrogen alone also raises pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots show no significant change since 1998 baseline.
  - Botanical composition
    - 2001 survey had 58% more total hits than 2000, indicating greater sward density, potentially from grazing removal in 1998.
    - Species shifts by treatment: Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments (except some controls); Festuca spp. increase across treatments; improved plots show greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, especially with nitrogen and/or lime.
    - Diversity: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) show 24 species; improved plots (N and/or L) show 18 species, suggesting a decline in diversity with fertility enhancement.
    - PCA shows clear separation between fertilised (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; major species associations align with improved pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in the improved plots.
    - Biomass correlations: higher biomass associated with increased relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; opposite trend for Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes; increased litter in N and/or Lime plots indicates faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial patterns: columns E and F exhibit more acidic conditions; central plots generally show higher biomass; a strong positive correlation exists between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, suggesting substantial site-wide heterogeneity that interacts with treatment effects.

- Data Governance and Archival Considerations (Data Leader Lens)
  - Consistent, documented data collection protocols across years enabled cross-year comparisons and integration of multiple data streams (biomass, pH, species composition, weather).
  - Data accessibility and metadata are critical, given multiple data types and year-to-year methodological shifts (e.g., change in personnel, shift to mechanical cutting).
  - External disruptions (FMD restrictions) and site management changes impacted data collection windows; need to capture such events in metadata and analyses to ensure comparability.
  - Site heterogeneity (spatial blocks/columns) must be incorporated into analyses (e.g., covariates or randomized block design) to avoid confounding treatment effects.
  - Inter-surveyor reliability was assessed and found not significantly different, supporting data quality; ongoing quality checks and clear species coding are essential for long-term data integrity.
  - The integrated data streams (biomass, pH, species composition, weather) illustrate the value of a data system that supports multi-parameter analyses and cross-study coordination.

- Implications for Data Strategy for Data Leaders
  - Maintain and extend standardized data schemas and protocols to ensure long-term comparability across years and researchers.
  - Ensure rich metadata that documents site conditions, management events, personnel changes, and any deviations from protocols.
  - Design analyses that account for spatial heterogeneity (blocks/columns) and their interactions with treatments.
  - Foster co-ownership and cross-team data use by documenting links between data streams (e.g., how pH changes relate to biomass and species shifts).
  - Prioritize data quality checks, including inter-surveyor calibration, to support reliable trend detection and cross-year analyses.
  - Plan for data governance that preserves accessibility and facilitates reuse across research groups and projects within and beyond the Soil Biodiversity program.
