# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- The Sourhope field data document describes long-term environmental monitoring focused on soil biodiversity, soil chemistry, and vegetation within hill farming systems, with integration into ECN and SERAD Micronet networks to inform policy and practice.
- It emphasizes a multi-parameter, long-term monitoring framework that links field measurements (vegetation and soil) to management treatments and environmental change, with data management and governance as core components.

## Overview of the current data excerpt

- Block 4 and Block 5 soil and vegetation data are presented, including detailed soil profile descriptions, soil chemical analyses, auger samples, and vegetation surveys.
- An ECOTRON soil site within Sourhope is included to illustrate ongoing, controlled monitoring alongside the main field plots.

## Data Collected (highlights)

- Soil profiles:
  - Block 4 and Block 5 show structured horizon sequences (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bg/BCg, Cg) with descriptors of texture, colour, structure, moisture, roots, and stones.
  - Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite; frequent igneous stones across horizons.
  - Depths sampled from surface to approximately 100 cm, with profile boundaries and horizon changes noted.
- Soil analyses (per horizon and auger samples):
  - Key metrics: %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2).
  - Observed ranges and patterns:
    - Surface horizons tend to be acidic (pH ~4.5–4.9) with high organic content (high LOI values, some horizons very high LOI).
    - %N and %C vary by horizon, often showing relatively higher %C in surface horizons; C:N ratios typically in the mid-teens to low twenties in major horizons.
    - Major cations Ca and Mg dominate extractable bases; Na generally low; K present in smaller amounts with horizon- and block-level variation.
    - Moisture loss and LOI are substantial in surface horizons, with declines deeper down the profiles.
  - Auger samples (Block 4 and Block 5) provide finer-scale variability data across sub-samples, including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH measurements.
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Plots 4A–4F and 5A–5F include per-plot species counts and presence/absence data across subplots, showing varying levels of species richness and community composition by plot and block.
  - Indicator species and community groupings are used to characterize vegetation structure and potential associations with soil properties.
- ECOTRON soil site:
  - Soil analysis (block within ECOTRON) includes weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, and pH values, illustrating a standardized monitorable micro-site within the larger Sourhope framework.
- Data management notes (implicit in the dataset):
  - Data are intended for archiving and sharing within the ECN/SERAD framework, with attention to metadata quality, data governance, and transparency of underlying datasets.

## Key Methods and Indicators

- Soil: horizon-by-horizon descriptions, granular soil chemistry (N, C, C:N, major cations), moisture loss, LOI, and pH measurements to characterize soil fertility and organic matter dynamics.
- Vegetation: plot-level species inventories and totals, sub-plot tallies, and indicator species analysis to link plant communities with soil and site conditions.
- Data integration: alignment of soil and vegetation data across blocks and plots to test hypotheses about biodiversity, productivity, and responses to site characteristics (e.g., substrate, moisture, and pH).

## Data Management, Access, and Governance

- Archiving: soil samples and related data are archived (e.g., CEH Merlewood), with supporting documentation in Appendices and related reports.
- Data sharing: outputs are presented in reports, charts, and dashboards; underlying data are intended to be shared with stakeholders, subject to governance and metadata standards.
- Metadata and accessibility: metadata quality and data openness are noted as potential barriers; the importance of standardized metadata and accessible data stores is emphasised for cross-study synthesis.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks

- Demonstrates the value of a long-term, multi-parameter approach that integrates soil chemistry, soil physical properties, and vegetation community data to evaluate ecosystem function and responses to management.
- Highlights the importance of consistent data governance, metadata quality, and data sharing to enable reuse for evaluation and policy decisions.
- Shows how controlled or observational data from ECN/SERAD-linked sites can inform climate change impact assessments and sustainable hill farming practices.
- Underlines the need for robust data archiving and cross-network alignment to maximize policy-relevant insights from field monitoring.

## Practical Considerations and Challenges

- Data gaps and metadata quality: variable metadata completeness can hinder site-wide verification and cross-study comparability.
- Access and silos: institutional barriers may limit timely data access and sharing.
- Data transformation: raw soil and vegetation data require standardization and appropriate transformations for synthesis.
- Communication: translating complex, multi-layer data (soil profiles, horizons, and multi-species communities) into clear policy messages remains a key challenge.

## Implications for Policy and Practice

- The integration of soil health indicators (organic matter, nutrient status, pH, moisture) with vegetation diversity provides a comprehensive basis for evaluating grassland management and soil health policies.
- Long-term datasets support trend analysis, climate-change implications, and evidence-based decision-making for sustainable hill farming.
- Emphasizes the need for transparent data governance, archival practices, and stakeholder engagement to maximize the utility of environmental monitoring for policy and practice.
