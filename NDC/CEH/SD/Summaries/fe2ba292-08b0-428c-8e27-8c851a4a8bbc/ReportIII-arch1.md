# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- A large, long-running field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, designed to monitor a broad set of variables to contextualize detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons.
- Core components include: experimental treatments (Control, Biocide, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime), above-ground biomass measurements, soil pH, botanical composition (Point Analysis), and weather via Automatic Weather Station; sampling conducted across 1999–2001 with emphasis on 2001.
- Key context factors in 2001: UK Foot and Mouth outbreak limited site access Feb–May; management plan largely maintained, but an officer change occurred in May 2001; one biocide application was missed early in the year.

## Experimental design and data collection
- Treatments: Control 1, Control 2; Nitrogen (N); Lime (L); Nitrogen & Lime (N&L); Biocide (B).
- Measurements:
  - Above-ground biomass harvested at five summer cuts per year (May–Sept); biomass weighted and transformed for analysis.
  - Soil surface pH measured at 0–5 cm (October 2001 vs baseline August 1998).
  - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001, with methodology consistent with 2000).
  - Weather data from site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2001).
- Analysis: split-plot ANOVA to compare treatments and years; PCA on botanical data; correlations between species abundance and biomass; consideration of spatial/column heterogeneity.

## 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather was generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average after the very wet 2000 year.
- 2001 climate: total rainfall ≈ 839 mm; radiation ≈ 3473 MJ m-2; average temperatures slightly cooler than 2000; soil moisture modestly higher in 2001.
- Implication: 2001 conditions did not introduce unusual stress; observed biomass and vegetation responses are largely attributable to treatments and management changes rather than anomalous weather.

## 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Consistent treatment hierarchy across sampling periods; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass increased notably relative to 2000, attributed to (a) a change in personnel and (b) switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- After normalising against the Control 1 (C1), nitrogen and/or lime treatments (N, L, N&L) showed sustained positive impacts on productivity; biocide had a smaller or less consistent effect.
- Statistical findings:
  - ANOVA on 2001 biomass showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.
- Interpretive cues:
  - Nitrogen and lime together produced the strongest biomass gains, with lime contributing to sustained yields via pH-mediated effects on productivity.
  - Biomass gains in the improved plots correlated with shifts in plant community composition (see 2.4).

## 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continually raised topsoil pH (0–5 cm) to about 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots by Oct 2001; nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).
- Implication: pH shifts under lime treatments likely underpin observed biomass responses and shifts in species composition.

## 2.4 Botanical composition
- Species richness and dominance shifted with treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris (dominant in 2000) declined across all 2001 treatments; Festuca spp. (ovina and rubra) increased across all treatments and were most prominent in N and Biocide (F. ovina) and N&L (F. rubra).
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) favored species associated with higher fertility (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis) relative to unimproved plots.
  - Unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) maintained higher relative presence of species linked to poorer pastures (Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, Bryophytes such as Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) and greater bryophyte presence.
- Diversity notes:
  - 24 species identified in the unimproved treatments vs 18 in the Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting potential early signs of reduced diversity in the most fertilized/improved plots.
- Multivariate patterns:
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) largely separated nitrogen and/or lime plots from controls/biocide plots; unimproved plots clustered together with bryophyte presence and acid-tolerant species.
  - Biomass-associated shifts: higher biomass plots showed increased frequency of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, and bryophyte-associated taxa as biomass rose.
  - Correlations between species abundance and biomass:
    - Positive: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis increase with biomass.
    - Negative: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, and bryophyte groups tend to decline as biomass increases.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## 3 Site heterogeneity
- Spatial variation observed:
  - Columns E and F tended to be more acidic; underlying heterogeneity exists across the site, with lower pH in some nitrogen- and lime-improved columns.
  - Biomass variation showed central plots (e.g., N&L 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B) attaining higher biomass, indicating spatial structure.
- pH-biomass relationship:
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant difference in biomass by block, suggesting site-wide treatment effects override some block-scale variation.
- Data caveats:
  - Some columns have higher proportions of specific treatments (e.g., Control or Biocide) that may influence local pH and community composition.

## Overall interpretation and implications
- Fertilization and liming (N and/or L) consistently promote above-ground biomass and drive predictable plant community shifts toward more productive species, aided by increased soil pH.
- The most fertile/improved plots tend to host species associated with productive pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and show reduced diversity of some less productive taxa, along with increased litter turnover.
- Spatial heterogeneity exists and interacts with fertility treatments, but the strongest signals come from the explicit nutrient and liming treatments.
- Management disruptions in 2001 (FMD restrictions and personnel change) complicate year-to-year comparisons, but the data still indicate robust treatment effects on biomass, soil chemistry, and vegetation composition.

## Data quality and accessibility notes
- Reproducibility across surveyors demonstrated; the July 2001 botanical survey aligned well between surveyors.
- Full data are presented with supporting tables and figures (e.g., biomass across years, soil pH changes, PCA plots, species abundance tables), with explicit reference to statistical transformations and ANOVA results to support interpretation.
