# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

## Overview and provenance
- Detailed soil profile descriptions and accompanying chemical data for Block 4 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope.
- Data elements are organized by horizon: LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx, etc., with depth ranges (cm).
- Each horizon has textual soil descriptions and a full set of analytical measurements, plus MLURI barcodes for traceability.
- Analyses cover total nitrogen (%N), carbon (%C), C:N ratio, cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg in meq/100g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI), and pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Horizon-by-horizon data are complemented by auger sample results and ecotron/plot context data.

## Data structure and identifiers
- Horizons (example from Block 4): LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm).
- Associated soil descriptions include color, structure, moisture, root presence, and boundary characteristics.
- Key identifiers:
  - MLURI Barcodes for horizons (e.g., FH 603951, H 603952, Ah 603953, AB 603954, Bs 603955, Cx 603956).
  - Horizon-specific measurements (Wt mg, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
- Block-level and site context:
  - Site coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and rock type recorded for Block 4.
  - Similar data present for Block 5 and ECOTRON plots for cross-block comparisons.

## Sampling methods and data types
- Field methods:
  - Profile pits excavated to depth ~100 cm with horizon delineation (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
  - Auger cores taken for 0–30 cm depth in a W-pattern per block (in Block 4 and Block 5), with horizon-specific sampling.
- Analytical data per horizon:
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio
  - Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g)
  - %Moisture loss, %LoI
  - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2)
  - Moisture-related and depth-related metadata
- Additional data:
  - Wt (mg) for each horizon sample
  - Auger sample data with analogous chemical and pH measurements
- Vegetation and ecotron context:
  - Vegetation survey data exist at subplot/plot level for Block 4 and Block 5, with species totals and per-plot tallies
  - Ecotron plot data include a separate soil analysis and vegetation survey

## Data quality, coverage, and limitations
- Depth-focused dataset with detailed horizon-level data for Block 4 and Block 5; some horizons/measurements may have missing entries (e.g., Na measurements shown as blanks in some horizons).
- Auger and profile data provide baseline soil chemistry, but coverage per block is not necessarily exhaustive; presence of variability between blocks noted.
- Some horizon labels (e.g., Cx, Bg, BCg) indicate complex horizonation, requiring careful interpretation and cross-referencing with site-specific metadata.
- Data are designed for long-term ecological interpretation and cross-site comparisons (ECN/Micronet integration), but site-specific sampling bias and edge effects should be considered.

## Archiving, provenance, and standards
- Horizon data are linked to MLURI barcodes, enabling traceability from horizon to sample to site.
- Data capture aligns with soil description standards (color, texture, structure, boundary) and quantitative soil chemistry panels.
- Archiving and long-term accessibility implied via standardized identifiers; suitable for integration with ECN/ Micronet datasets and broader soil biodiversity studies.

## Metadata and governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Spatial metadata: precise horizon depths, grid references, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material, and rock type.
- Temporal metadata: profile date (and sampling dates for auger cores), horizon designations, and any repeated measurements.
- Analytical metadata: methods implied by horizon data (e.g., extraction methods not specified here but should be captured), units (mg for weights, %N, %C, meq/100g for cations), and pH scales.
- Sample metadata: horizon identifiers, Wt mg, barcodes, and archival storage details.
- Data standards: consistent horizon nomenclature, uniform units, and crosswalks to standard soil classification schemas.
- Documentation needs: explicit annotation of missing data points, data gaps, and any anomalies per horizon/plot to guide downstream analyses.

## Value, uses, and actionable takeaways for Data Stewards
- Provides a rich, horizon-level soil profile with correlated chemical and physical data for upland soil-plant interaction studies.
- Enables long-term ecological analyses, benchmarking across blocks, and integration with ECN/Micronet datasets for cross-site soil studies.
- Demonstrates the importance of complete metadata, traceability via barcodes, and clear provenance in field-based soil datasets.

## Key actions for Data Stewards
- Ensure comprehensive metadata capture: precise spatial coordinates, horizon mappings, sampling dates, treatments, and barcode associations.
- Preserve raw and derived data: keep original horizon measurements and horizon descriptions; maintain derived statistics (e.g., C:N, pH values) with clear lineage.
- Facilitate data reuse: provide data dictionaries, species/horizon codes, and crosswalks to standard classifications; maintain clear documentation of units and methods.
- Maintain archival accessibility: preserve barcodes and horizon data in accessible repositories; ensure compatibility with ECN/Micronet data standards.
- Document limitations: annotate sampling coverage, potential biases, and any data gaps or anomalies to guide accurate downstream analyses.
