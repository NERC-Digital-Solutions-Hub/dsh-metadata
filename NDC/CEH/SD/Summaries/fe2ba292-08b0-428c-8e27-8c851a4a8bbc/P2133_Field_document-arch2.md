# Measurements of microarthropod community structure and diversity from an upland grassland experimental site [NERC Soil Biodiversity Programme]

- Purpose and context
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (1999) at Sourhope, Scotland, to simultaneously understand soil biota diversity and their functional roles in key ecological processes.
  - 24 projects funded to study soil structure, processes (C and N cycles), and microfauna to macrofauna, including microarthropods like mites and Collembola.

- Site, design, and treatments
  - Location: Sourhope Field Experiment, Cheviot Hills, upland semi-improved grassland (~350 m, ~1117 mm rainfall).
  - Experimental layout: five blocks downslope; each block with six plots (12 x 20 m).
  - Treatments: control, nitrogen fertiliser (N, ammonium nitrate), lime (CaCO3), and N plus lime; N applied in 1999–2000, lime in 1999 and 2000.
  - Management: site cut five times per year to 6 cm, with removals; sampling occurred on four dates: Nov 1999, Feb 2000, May 2000, Aug 2000.
  - Core sampling: soil cores (8 cm diameter, 10 cm depth; 5 cm depth for microarthropod counts in August) collected across blocks and plots; paired cores used for some soil condition measurements.

- Data collected and indicators
  - Microarthropods: abundance and species composition (mites and Collembola); diversity indices; biomass estimates.
  - Soil and root properties: microbial biomass carbon (fumigation-extraction), soil respiration (CO2), soil moisture, pH (water), organic matter (loss on ignition), total soil C and N, total root C and N, dry root biomass.
  - Above-ground productivity: annual above-ground biomass (ANPP) derived from multiple mowing events.
  - Depth and sampling: cores extracted to 5 cm (microarthropods) or 10 cm (some soil analyses); August cores included paired cores for both biological and soil measurements.

- Laboratory methods and analyses
  - Microarthropods isolated via Berlese-Tullgren funnels (96 h); specimens preserved in ethanol/glycerol; identification of mites and Collembola using standard taxonomic references.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon-Wiener index (H), evenness (J), and cumulative species richness (R) for microarthropods overall and by group (mites, Collembola); functional diversity index for predatory vs non-predatory mites.
  - Biomass and activity: microarthropod biomass calculated with published conversion factors; microbial biomass C from fumigation-extraction; basal soil respiration as microbial activity.
  - Plant and soil chemistry: total C and N in soil and roots via dry combustion (Carlo Erba NA 1500); pH (wet) and LOI for organic matter; soil moisture.

- Data structure and outputs
  - Four datasets provided:
    - Dataset 1040: Plant species data across treatments, depth to 10 cm, with fields for Sampling Unit ID (SUID), sampling date, block, main plot, sub-plot, cell, treatment, surface area, species name, etc.
    - Dataset 1041: Field microarthropod population density data (mites and Collembola numbers per square metre to 5 cm depth) with SUID, sampling date, block, plots, treatment, depth, and counts.
    - Dataset 1042: Field microarthropod species abundance data (counts of each species per 3 cm core across plots) with SUID, sampling date, depth, treatment, and species counts.
    - Dataset 1043: Field soils data (soil constituents and root data; C/N, microbial biomass C, respiration, pH, LOI, root biomass, moisture, etc.) with detailed field definitions and measurement methods.
  - Metadata include detailed field definitions, sampling design, unit descriptions, depth information, and data provenance.

- Quality control, caveats, and data usage
  - Quality assurance steps include numeric range checks, data formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
  - NERC provides no warranty on data accuracy or fitness for purpose; liability for use is disclaimed.
  - Data are designed to support monitoring over time and allow integration with other environmental datasets, with standardised formats and clearly documented methodologies.

- Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy assessment
  - Demonstrates a standardised approach to monitoring below-ground biodiversity and associated soil processes alongside above-ground productivity.
  - Enables time-series analysis of how soil microarthropod communities respond to nutrient and lime manipulations, linking biodiversity to ecosystem function.
  - Data outputs (diversity indices, biomass, soil chemistry, respiration) support assessment of soil health and ecological integrity over time.
  - Well-documented data structure and quality control facilitate data sharing and reuse, aligning with the aim to increase the value and accessibility of monitoring datasets.
