# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), focusing on above-ground productivity, plant diversity, and community structure as it responds to management.
  - Site-wide experiments link below-ground biodiversity with above-ground plant communities; monitoring includes productivity, species composition, and relative abundance.

- Experimental design and data sources
  - Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Plots: each block contains 6 main plots; main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots (S, T, U, V used for botanical sampling and other groups).
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4).
  - Management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept), insecticide application after mowing, and spring fertilizer applications (N and/or lime) over multiple years.

- Data collection and formats
  - Weather data: on-site Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, air/soil temperatures) since 1999; 2002 data partially missing due to station malfunction (replaced with Konza station data for missing periods).
  - Above-ground biomass: repeated 0.5 m2 vegetation samples per plot, collected before each mow, dried at 80 C, weighed; five summer cuts per year, 1999–2002.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 0.5 m2 point quadrats (July/August 1998) and annual 0.5 m2 point analysis in 2000–2002 using a 100-hole grid; species recorded at each hit; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Soil data: soil pH (5 cm depth) at multiple years; soil moisture measured in 2002 with a theta probe; additional soil and minirhizotron-related surveys in various years.
  - Additional surveys: vegetation cover, biomass by species in sub-plots, litter hits; extensive Appendix and Species lists document data structures.
  - Outputs and formats include figures (biomass trends; pH vs biomass), tables (ANOVA results), and multiple appendices (biomass by plot, species lists, PCA loadings).

- Key data findings (beginning to end)
  - Mowing effect
    - Dominant shift away from Agrostis spp. toward Festuca spp.; bryophyte expansion linked to consistent sward height (~6 cm) and reduced disturbance.
    - Stress-tolerant (S) species expand broadly; disturbance-prone SR/C-S-R groups decline with mowing and reduced grazing.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime improve productivity; plots with both N and lime show the strongest biomass gains.
    - Potential peak in productivity in N+L plots; soil pH approaches 7.0 in limed plots; higher pH coupled with lower soil moisture may stress plants under some conditions.
    - A shift toward competitive (C) and CSR-type species in fertilised plots; C-S-R dynamics are pH- and moisture-dependent.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Insecticide-treated plots show higher diversity signals in some years; possible links to reduced herbivory enabling palatable species to persist, though direct causation is cautious due to limited insectary data.
  - Trampling effect
    - 2002 C2 plots show reduced productivity plausibly due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments; sampling regime differences also influence results.
  - Biodiversity and functional grouping
    - Point analysis and PCA distinguish improved (fertilised) vs unimproved (unfertilised) plots; bryophytes increase more in unimproved plots.
    - Shannon diversity declines in 2002 for N+L plots, while other treatments show increases; CSR and SR/C-S-R group distributions shift across treatments.
    - Specific species-level trends: Festuca rubra expands in fertilised plots; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline since 2000; bryophyte hits rise across the site, especially Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus in several treatments.

- Data quality, gaps and caveats
  - 2002 weather data gaps due to station malfunction; Konza data used for missing periods.
  - 2002 C2 trampling potentially suppressed vegetation growth; sampling irregularities: Control 2 plots not surveyed in 2000–2001.
  bryophyte identification improved in 2002; minor taxonomic uncertainties in earlier years.
  Overall, site-level factors (e.g., mowing regime) interact with treatments, complicating attribution of effects to any single factor.

- Data products, outputs and potential analyses
  - Biomass: annual biomass by plot and treatment; Appendix 6 provides annualized biomass per plot and block means.
  - Statistical analyses: ANOVA results for treatment, year, and interaction (Table 1); detailed figures (e.g., biomass over time; treatment-normalized biomass).
  - Diversity and community structure: Shannon diversity indices by treatment (Figure 8); PCA of point-analysis data highlighting treatment groupings (Figure 5); functional-group composition (S, CSR, SR/CSR) trends (Table 2 and related figures).
  - Species and bryophyte datasets: Appendix 3 species list; bryophyte trends across years and treatments (Appendix 8 and related text).
  - Appendices and site activity logs (Appendices 1–7) document treatments, species lists, weather, biomass datasets, and annual activity.
  Potential data products for end users include dashboards or self-serve views of biomass by treatment and year, pH-moisture-biomass correlations, and functional-group composition over time.

- Practical data considerations for data support
  - Ensure alignment of biomass, soil, and botanical datasets by plot, sub-plot, block, and year for integrated analyses.
  - Document any data gaps (e.g., 2000–2001 Control 2 survey gaps; 2002 weather gaps) and data imputation decisions.
  - Maintain clear mappings of treatments to plot IDs (as per Appendix 2/Appendix 1) and consistent treatment labeling across years.

- References and supporting materials
  - Extensive appendices provide species lists, biomass data, weather records, and activity logs.
  - Core analyses referenced include community functional grouping (CSR framework) and multivariate analyses (PCA).
