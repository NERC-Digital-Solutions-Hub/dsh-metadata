# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- Four-year progress at the Sourhope (Scottish Borders) field site, focusing on above-ground biomass production (productivity), species composition and diversity within a large, controlled experiment.
- Five main site treatments (plus replication): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Insecticide (Dursban 4).
- Managed via monthly mowing to ~6 cm (1999–2002) and five summer cuts; insecticide applied after mowing to designated plots; nitrogen and/or lime added in spring to fertilised plots.
- Long-term data collection supports cross-project analyses (16 Phase I projects, 7–8 Phase II projects) with a wide suite of plant and bryophyte surveys, soil chemistry, and weather data.

- Key data collection approaches
  - 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for cross-project data sharing.
  - Regular on-site data streams since 1999: weather (Automatic Weather Station), above-ground biomass (0.5 m2 clippings), soil pH, soil moisture, and extensive point-quadrat surveys (1998 baseline; repeated 2000–2002) including bryophytes to species level (2002 enhancement).
  - 11621 soil samples accumulated since start; large-scale biodiversity and functional-type analyses (CSR framework).

- Major results by management regime
  - Mowing effects
    - Decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across all treatments since 2000; suggested site-wide response to mowing rather than treatment-specific.
    - Festuca rubra expands, especially in more fertile (+ lime, + nitrogen) plots; bryophyte expansion (mosses) observed with mowing and absence of grazing, linked to ~6 cm sward height.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground productivity; nitrogen + lime most productive, but signs of saturation/peaking in these plots (pH near 7.0; potential moisture limitation).
    - Soil pH elevation (via lime) strongly increases pH, particularly in upper soil; nitrogen alone has a smaller, positive effect.
    - Positive relationship between pH and productivity at the broad level; within N or lime treatments, the pH–productivity link weakens; with both N and lime, the relationship appears more complex (potential non-linear pattern).
  - Insecticide effects
    - Biomass/diversity patterns largely align with plant-herbivore interactions; while evidence is not conclusive, reductions in herbivory may favor certain palatable species and influence diversity indices.
  - Trampling effects
    - 2002 C2 plots show reduced productivity, likely due to trampling during peak 13CO2 pulse experiments.
  - Community structure and diversity
    - Shannon diversity index generally higher in fertilised plots but declines in N&L plots by 2002 (about -15% relative to baseline) while other treatments show increases.
    - Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increase across most treatments; bryophyte contribution to total hits rises from 6–11% (2000–2001) to ~20% (2002).
    - Point analysis shows higher hits of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum dominate unimproved plots.
  - Functional groups (CSR framework)
    - Three main functional groups tracked: stress-tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR), and stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderals (SR/CSR).
    - By 2002, CSR/SR-CS-R dominated in N and Lime plots; S (stress-tolerators) benefited most in unimproved plots; SR/CSR declines in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
    - Across years, 69–95% of live vascular plant hits were concentrated in these three functional groups.

- Data quality, gaps, and management notes
  - 2002 weather data included a temporary loss of data due to weather-station software failure (late July–early August; replaced by Konza station data for missing periods).
  - Bryophyte identification improved in 2002 (to species level), aiding higher-resolution Bryophyte analyses.
  - Baseline survey: 1998; ongoing point analyses in 2000, 2001, 2002; a consistent 0.5 m2 cell approach used across years for comparability.
  - Data volume and scope: 11,621 soil samples collected to date; large multi-project dataset requiring robust metadata and data provenance practices.

- Data access and documentation
  - Full project details and methods available via the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contacts; extensive appendices (site treatments, species lists, weather data, biomass time series, PCA results) accompany the main text.
  - Data products include annual and cumulative biomass per plot, species hits per treatment, bryophyte composition, and functional-group analyses.

- Implications for data leaders
  - Demonstrates value of long-term, multi-factorial, field-scale data for evaluating system-wide data strategy: integrating above- and below-ground processes, treatments, and cross-project collaboration.
  - Highlights importance of standardized, repeatable data collection (0.5 m2 cells, 25-point baseline quadrats, point analysis, biomass harvesting) and clear metadata (treatments, mowing regime, application dates, rates).
  - Shows need for transparent data provenance, documentation of data gaps (e.g., 2002 weather data loss) and data remediation (alternative data sources during outages).
  - Emphasizes relevance of data to users beyond ecology (policy relevance, land management), supporting co-ownership of data products and iterative dissemination of findings.
  - Underlines challenges in coordinating sector-wide data standards and practices across multiple projects and partners, reinforcing the case for shared platforms and cross-network collaboration.

- Takeaways for practice
  - Long-term, carefully documented experiments with multiple treatments can reveal complex interactions between management, soil chemistry, plant productivity, and community structure.
  - Functional-type analyses (CSR framework) provide a robust lens to interpret shifts in plant communities under varying nutrient, pH, and disturbance regimes.
  - Regular data quality checks, clear governance for missing data, and timely updates to metadata are essential in multi-project data ecosystems.
