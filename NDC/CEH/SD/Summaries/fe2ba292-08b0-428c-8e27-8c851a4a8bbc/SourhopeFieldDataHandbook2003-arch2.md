  - pH(H2O): ~4.45–4.82
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.64–4.05
- Observations: Acid to moderately acidic soils with notable organic content and a range of exchangeable cations, typical of upland/peat-influenced horizons.

## Vegetation Survey: BLOCK 4

- Subplots sampled across PLOT 4A and related subplots; species presence/absence recorded with totals for each subplot.
- Indications of diverse vegetation assemblages across the plot, with indicators including mosses and bryophytes in edge or moister microhabitats.
- Data support identification of multiple vegetation associations within Block 4, consistent with broader climate-soil-vegetation linkages used in monitoring and analysis.

## Block 5: SOIL AND VEGETATION DATA

- Site details: Rigg Foot, Sourhope; Block 5 with grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; brown forest soil with gleying characteristics; imperfect drainage.
- Soil profile descriptions: Depths from 0 cm to 100 cm, horizons including LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; mottling and structured horizons indicating a gleying pattern within Brown Forest soil context.
- Horizons and description highlights: From surface organic-rich horizons (Ah, AB) to deeper mineral horizons (Bg, BCg, Cg) with color and structure indicative of moisture regime and weathering.
- Chemical and physical properties (Block 5 auger samples; 5A–5F):
  - %N: ~0.53–0.62 across samples
  - %C: ~7.01–9.36
  - C:N: ~10.20–14.74
  - Ca: ~0.35–5.08 meq/100g
  - Na: largely below detection in several horizons
  - K: ~0.59–0.83 meq/100g
  - Mg: ~1.51–3.50 meq/100g
  - %Moisture loss: ~2.79–9.43
  - %Loss on Ignition: ~4.12–20.10
  - pH(H2O): ~3.53–5.20
  - pH(CaCl2): ~3.53–4.14
- Auger sample variability: Variation among horizons and blocks (5A–5F) reflecting depth, horizon sequence, and moisture regime; higher LOI in certain horizons indicating organic enrichment and soil development within the site.

## ECOTRON SOIL SITE

- Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT): Wt 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100g; Na 0.15 meq/100g; K 0.62 meq/100g; Mg 1.70 meq/100g; moisture loss 4.79%; LOI 17.42%; pH(H2O) 4.79; pHCaCl2 3.82.
- Vegetation survey: ECOTRON plots show presence/absence of a subset of species within a controlled-environment context, reflecting responses to experimental treatments and microclimate.

## Data management and monitoring context

- Data capture linked to standardized monitoring pipelines; samples and results are stored with MLURI barcodes and archived for long-term re-analysis.
- Outputs include soil chemical profiles, horizon descriptions, and vegetation inventories at multiple plots, enabling cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant trend analyses.
- Part of a broader environmental monitoring framework (ECN/Micronet) designed to link climate, soil chemistry, and vegetation under different management regimes, supporting interpretation of environmental health and management outcomes.
