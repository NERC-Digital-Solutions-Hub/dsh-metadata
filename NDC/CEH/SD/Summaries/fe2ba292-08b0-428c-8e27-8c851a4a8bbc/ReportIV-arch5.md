# SUMMARY

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground biomass, species composition, and diversity as influenced by mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide treatments.
  - Data collection has been extensive across multiple datasets and years (1999–2002), with ongoing fieldwork and data integration for Phase I and II projects.

- Key datasets and data sources
  - Above-ground biomass
    - Seasonal measurements (May–Sept) across plots and treatments; annual biomass totals and treatment-normalised comparisons.
    - Appendix 6 provides annual biomass per plot and mean block values; long-term trend shows general biomass increase from 1999, with nitrogen and lime combinations yielding the highest productivity.
  - Site treatments and management
    - Plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
    - Site-level management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm; insecticide application (Dursban 4) on insecticide plots; nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring.
    - Appendix 2 details treatment dates and application rates; Appendix 1 provides plot maps.
  - Botanical and biodiversity data
    - Point Analysis surveys (baseline 1998; 2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with a 100-hole grid; 25-point sampling per cell; bryophyte and vascular plant species lists (Appendix 3).
    - Shannon Diversity Indices and functional-group analyses (stress-tolerators S; C-S-R; SR/C-S-R) across years (2000–2002).
    - Appendix 8 presents percent rank abundance by species; PCA results (Figure 5) show separation of improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering distinctly.
  - Biomass and species-specific results
    - Biomass composition by functional groups; shifts in dominance with treatments (notably Festuca rubra in fertile plots; Agrostis spp. declines with mowing).
    - Bryophyte dynamics: increases across most treatments, with particular increases in unimproved plots; moss species (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) show treatment-dependent patterns.
  - Soil and microenvironment data
    - Soil pH (5 cm depth) measured since 1998; soil moisture (theta probe) measured in 2002 across sampling cells.
    - Strong pH–moisture relationship; higher pH generally associated with higher productivity in certain treatments, though specifics vary by treatment.
  - Weather and site activity
    - On-site Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2002): rainfall, radiation, and temperatures; 2002 notable for low rainfall in some months but overall higher annual rainfall; 2001/2002 milder winters.
    - 2002 data gaps due to weather-station malfunction (July–August and October–November); data substitutions used for affected periods.

- Data quality, methods, and analyses
  - Experimental design
    - Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks, each containing 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; random allocation of treatments; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells to support multi-group data collection.
  - Data collection protocols
    - Regular mowing and pre-mow biomass sampling; standardized nitrogen and lime application schedules; insecticide applications aligned with mowing.
    - Regular weather, soil, and plant surveys since 1998–1999; multiple complementary surveys (e.g., 5 cm soil pH, 25-point baseline quadrats, and annual point analyses).
  - Data analyses
    - Use of split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 6) to assess treatment, year, and interaction effects on biomass; significant treatment and year effects reported (p < 0.001 for many analyses).
    - PCA and ranking of species within treatments to explore community composition patterns (Figure 5; Appendix 8).
    - Shannon Diversity Indices tracked over time to quantify changes in community diversity across treatments (2000–2002).
  - Data completeness and provenance
    - Detailed appendices documenting treatments (Appendix 2), species lists (Appendix 3), automated weather data (Appendix 5), biomass data (Appendix 6), and rank analyses (Appendix 7–8).
    - Baseline data collected in 1998; long-running time series across years; some plots (e.g., Control 2) had limited sampling in certain years due to project logistics.

- Accessibility and dissemination
  - Primary data and project details are accessible via the Soil Biodiversity website; full project details available through the PI's and CEH contacts listed in the Introduction.
  - Appendices provide comprehensive datasets (species lists, biomass per plot, weather measurements, and analysis results) enabling reuse and secondary analyses.

- Notable findings relevant to data governance
  - Mowing (site-level disturbance reduction) and absence of grazing altered plant functional dynamics, promoting stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, while fertilisation (N and/or lime) boosted productivity but could shift functional group composition toward competitiveness.
  - Nitrogen and lime together generally yield the highest biomass, though potential moisture limitations and high soil pH may constrain long-term productivity in some plots.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are complex and not conclusively linked to herbivory; observed increases in diversity may reflect improved conditions for palatable species in initially infertile settings.
  - Trampling and 2002 plot-level data gaps (C2) emphasize the need for robust data capture and documentation of site activity to support interpretation of productivity changes.
  - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) is notable across treatments, particularly under mowing and reduced disturbance, with implications for biomass partitioning and habitat structure.
  - The CSR framework provides a useful lens for interpreting shifts in community structure under different fertility and disturbance regimes.

- Challenges and considerations for data stewardship
  - Incomplete picture of user needs and prioritisation of data outputs across diverse research groups.
  - Timely data collection and standardization across multiple treatments, years, and measurement modalities.
  - Handling diverse formats and large, multi-component datasets (biomass, species, soil, weather) and ensuring interoperability.
  - Data gaps due to external factors (foot-and-mouth restrictions in 2001; 2002 weather-station malfunction) and strategies for documenting and imputing missing periods.
  - The necessity of documenting data provenance, methodologies, and any reprocessing steps to facilitate future reuse and cross-study synthesis.

- Implications for data governance
  - Emphasizes structured, well-documented data management practices: standardized protocols, detailed metadata, robust versioning, and clear data lineage.
  - Highlights value of centralized data portals and project-level appendices to enable discovery and reuse by data users beyond the primary research teams.
  - Demonstrates the importance of recording experimental design, treatment allocations, and temporal sequencing to support meta-analyses and cross-project integration.
