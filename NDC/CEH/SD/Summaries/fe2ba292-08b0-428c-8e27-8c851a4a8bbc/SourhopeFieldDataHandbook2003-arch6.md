# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- A comprehensive, multi-block field dataset from Sourhope (Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003) focusing on soil profiles, soil chemistry, and vegetation across replicated plots.
- Includes detailed horizon descriptions, soil chemical/physical properties, and vegetation surveys, plus ecotron plots for controlled-environment studies.
- Blocks 4 and 5 (with associated auger samples, horizon data, and vegetation totals) plus an Ecotron plot dataset are presented, enabling cross-block comparisons and treatment-level analyses.

## Data Collection Design and Scope
- Site: Rigg Foot, Sourhope; long-term field site with five blocks used for biodiversity and soil-vegetation studies.
- Sampling design:
  - Soil profiles: horizon descriptions and chemical/physical measurements (0–30 cm auger composites and which horizon-specific pits described).
  - Auger sampling: multiple short cores per plot (examples 4A–4F, 5A–5F) for homogenized plot data (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH).
  - Vegetation surveys: per plot, with species counts or totals recorded (e.g., A–F subplots within plots, totals by plot).
- Data scope: horizon-level qualitative descriptions and quantitative lab analyses; block-by-block organization with Appendices and data files referenced (Twinspan.doc, Association.xls, Appendix A datasets).

## Data by Block

### Block 4
- Soil profile: horizons listed from LF (0–1 cm) through Cgx (61–95 cm) with detailed descriptions (fibrous textures, moisture, root presence, mineral content, stone presence).
- Soil analysis (Block 4 profile): weights, %N, %C, C:N ratios, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Auger samples (4A–4F): per-sample %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation survey (Block 4 plots 4A–4F): per plot, with counts across species (many entries indicate sparse or zero totals; some plots show counts for select species).
- Data characteristics: horizon-scale nutrient and acidity profiles; variability across horizons and subplots; presence of igneous stones and texture variation.

### Block 5
- Site details: coordinates NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; soil series SH 74714 Sourhope; major soil subgroup Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material igneous/andesite.
- Soil profile (Block 5): horizons LF (0–1 cm) through Cg (70–100 cm) with descriptive notes (fibrous, moist, root distribution, mottles, structure).
- Soil analysis (Block 5 profile): weights, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2) across horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg.
- Auger samples (5A–5F): per-sample %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2) across six cores.
- Vegetation survey (Block 5 plots 5A–5F): per plot, detailing species totals and occurrences; data show varied community composition across subplots.
- Data characteristics: deeper horizon transitions with prominent mottling and stone content; horizon-specific chemistry with notable C, N, Ca, and Mg gradients; horizon-wise moisture and pH variation.

## Ecotron and Supporting Datasets
- Ecotron soil site: dedicated plots with soil analyses (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2)).
- Ecotron vegetation surveys: per plot, listing species totals and counts, enabling comparison with conventional blocks.
- Data availability cues: references to separate data files (Twinspan.doc, Association.xls) and Appendix A block-by-block datasets, indicating structured data products for further analysis.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Considerations
- Patchy data coverage in Year 1 for subplots and horizon-specific measurements; some plots show zero or missing entries in vegetation totals.
- Horizon-level variability and substantial stone content (igneous stones) influence soil texture and interpretation.
- Block-to-block differences (e.g., Bg/BCg horizons, mottling, moisture status) require careful normalization when comparing across treatments or blocks.
- Data products and appendices are available to support replication, benchmarking, and cross-block analyses.

## Practical Implications for Data Support
- The collection provides a rich, multi-dimensional dataset linking soil health indicators (N, C, C:N, LOI, moisture, pH, base cations) with plant community structure across replicated plots.
- Enables exploration of how grazing history, lime, nitrogen, and other treatments influence soil properties and vegetation dynamics over time.
- Suitable for building self-serve data products (dashboards, pivot analyses) and for cross-block biodiversity and nutrient cycling studies, with baseline context from horizon- and plot-level data.
