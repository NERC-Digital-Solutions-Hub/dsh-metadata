# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview and context
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme focused on a large, long-term field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
- A Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) preceded measurements; the project provided context for various groups and facilitated year-to-year comparisons.
- Management and monitoring were affected in 2001 by foot-and-mouth restrictions (visitor access limited Feb–May 2001) and a change of site officer; core activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued under a defined 2001 Site Management Plan.
- Data collection and presentation emphasize links to other datasets and cross-year comparability; the report outlines measurement types, dates, and methods to aid data discovery and reuse.

## Data collected and structure
- Datasets cover weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with detailed measurement schedules and protocols.
- Weather data: Automatic Weather Station measurements (rainfall, radiation, temperatures at multiple heights, soil moisture) from 1999–2001; data downloaded and transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH, Merlewood.
- Above-ground biomass: Seasonal harvests across five mowing events per year; biomass weights (dry weight) summed per plot per year; analyses include log transformations and ANOVAs.
- Soil pH: Upper 5 cm soil pH measured over time, with liming and nitrogen treatments affecting pH.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001 and July 2000); species hits recorded per 0.5 m2 cell; 24 species observed in unimproved plots vs 18 in nitrogen/lime plots; species codes provided (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris, Fr = Festuca rubra, etc.); empirical data used for PCA and correlation with biomass.
- Data collection dates and frequency are itemized in Table 1; measurement methods are described (e.g., mowing schedule, Point Analysis protocol, mineral soil sampling).
- Data presentation references and outputs mirror Report II for cross-year compatibility and comparability.

## Experimental design and management
- Treatments (six): Control 1 (C1), Control 2 (C2), Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Biocide (B).
- Experimental structure: Blocks and subplots with multiple plots per treatment; annual biomass and soil measurements linked to these units.
- Management activities: Liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis; one biocide application was missed in May 2001, but subsequent applications proceeded.
- Site heterogeneity considerations: Spatial variation across the site (e.g., columns E and F showing more acidic plots) and a positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; central plots tended to yield higher biomass.

## Key datasets and variables (highlights)
- Automatic Weather Station data (1999–2001): rainfall, radiation, average temperatures at multiple heights, soil moisture.
- Biomass data: Seasonal maxima (July–August); treatment-specific biomass hierarchies; normalization to C1 to compare treatment effects; year-to-year differences analyzed with ANOVA (significant treatment-by-year interactions; nitrogen and/or lime promote biomass).
- Soil pH data: 0–5 cm soil pH; liming and nitrogen influence noted (limed plots and N&L plots show higher pH values; controls show little change since baseline 1998).
- Botanical data (Point Quadrat): species hit counts by plot; significant inter-year changes in species composition across treatments; PCA shows clear separation of improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; diversity measures indicate greater species richness in unimproved plots (24 species) than in nitrogen & lime plots (18 species).
- Biomass vs species composition: positive correlations between Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance with higher biomass; declines in Agrostis capillaris and bryophyte-associated species with higher biomass.
- Site heterogeneity metrics: biomass and pH variation across site columns; strong positive correlation between surface pH and biomass but no significant block-to-block biomass differences.

## Data quality, provenance, and governance considerations
- Data quality and consistency notes:
  - 2001 personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears likely influenced biomass measurements (substantial 2001 biomass increase); results are normalized to C1 to assess true treatment effects.
  - A first biocide application in 2001 was missed; subsequent treatments completed as planned.
  - Inter-surveyor reliability for Point Quadrat surveys in 2001 showed no significant differences between surveyors.
- Provenance and documentation:
  - Baseline and site descriptions referenced (Baseline Data Survey, Nov 1998).
  - Data management and dissemination are coordinated with CEH’s Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; weather data specifically routed to CEH.
  - Table 1 documents data collection events; Appendix 1 provides annual biomass details per plot.
- Metadata and taxonomy:
  - Species codes are explicitly defined; a glossary of species abbreviations and crosswalks is provided (e.g., Ac = Agrostis capillaris; Fr = Festuca rubra; etc.).
  - Documentation links to figures and tables (e.g., Figures 1–9 and Tables 1–6) to support reproducibility and cross-dataset integration.
- Data sharing and reuse:
  - The report is structured to facilitate cross-year data linkage, enabling researchers to compare their data with site-wide monitoring results.
  - Data dictionaries, measurement protocols, and treatment definitions are essential for reuse, as are the notes on site management events and disruptions.

## Data processing and analytical notes
- Analyses used:
  - Split-plot ANOVA for biomass across years (1999–2001) to identify treatment effects, with year interactions.
  - PCA (Genstat 5) on 2001 point quadrat data to explore associations among plots and species.
  - Correlation analyses between biomass and major species abundances.
- Key outputs referenced:
  - Table 4: ANOVA results for annual biomass by year and treatment.
  - Table 5: Inter-year ANOVA results for biomass (1999–2000 and 1999–2001).
  - Table 6: Rank abundances of species across treatments (2000 vs 2001).
  - Figures 1–9 illustrating biomass trends, pH changes, PCA results, and biomass vs species relationships.

## Glossary and codes (selected)
- Ac, Ao, Av, Cp, Cx, Cip, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs, Hl, Hm, Liv, Ll, Lm, Lp, Ls, Mc, Ns, Pa, Pp, Pt, Tr, Vm, Vc (various grass, sedge, herb, bryophyte species); other species observed are noted in text.

## Enduring implications for data stewardship
- Maintain comprehensive metadata for multi-year, multi-dataset site studies, including:
  - Clear treatment definitions, plot/subplot structure, and block layout.
  - Detailed measurement protocols, timing, and any deviations (e.g., missed biocide, FMD-related access restrictions).
  - Equipment and personnel changes that may affect data comparability (documented switches from manual to mechanical cutting; officer changes).
- Ensure data provenance is explicit, with links to baseline surveys, site management plans, and cross-reference tables/appendices.
- Preserve both raw and processed data, with data dictionaries and taxonomic crosswalks to support downstream analyses and reuse.
- Provide guidance for researchers re: leveraging cross-year data for meta-analyses, including caveats about year-specific anomalies and site heterogeneity.
