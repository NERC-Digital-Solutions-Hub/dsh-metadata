# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- Purpose and context
  - Detailed description of the Rigg Foot Sourhope field site, focusing on soil profiles, horizon morphology, and associated vegetation data.
  - Data collected to examine relationships between soil properties, microbial/plant communities, and biodiversity over time.
  - Includes multiple blocks (notably Blocks 4 and 5) with corresponding auger and profile analyses, plus an Ecotron/experimental subplot.

- Block 4: Soil profile and analyses
  - Horizon sequence and depths (selected):
    - LF (0–1 cm): fibrous, moist; no mineral grains; smooth boundary.
    - FH (1–4 cm): fibrous; abundant fine roots; sharp boundary.
    - H (4–8 cm): black color; amorphous; roots present; sharp boundary.
    - Ah (8–29 cm): dark reddish-brown, sandy silt loam; blocky structure; abundant fine roots; mineral and igneous stones present.
    - Abg (29–40 cm): pinkish grey with mottling; coarse sandy loam; distinct boundary.
    - B sg (40–61 cm): brown; sandy silt loam; mottles; blocky structure; many stones.
    - C gx (61–95 cm): reddish brown to brown; sandy clay loam; mottles; massive-to-platy structure.
  - Soil analysis (selected highlights):
    - %N and %C vary by horizon (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx) with C:N ratios typically in the mid-teens.
    - Ca, Mg exhibit horizon- and block-dependent variability; Na generally low; K and Mg vary across horizons.
    - Moisture loss and LOI indicate organic matter content highest near the surface (Ah/HF) and decreasing with depth.
    - pH values are acidic (roughly pH 4.6–4.8 in H2O; CaCl2 often lower).
  - Texture and structure:
    - Ah horizon: sandy silt loam; loose to friable.
    - Abg/ Bs horizons show mottling and variable structure from blocky to granular.
  - Key observations:
    - Surface horizons are acidic and humic with higher organic matter signals.
    - Drainage variation reflected in horizon mottling and structure.
    - Stones (andesite igneous) are common in several horizons.
  - Data notes:
    - Samples linked to MLURI barcodes; multiple depth-specific measurements (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH).

- Block 5: Soil profile and analyses
  - Site details:
    - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude around 315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage.
    - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
  - Horizon sequence and depths:
    - LF (0–1 cm): fibrous; moist; no stones.
    - FH (1–5 cm): semi-fibrous; roots; sharp boundary.
    - H (5–7 cm): black; semi-fibrous; roots.
    - Ah (7–25 cm): very dark brown; sandy silt loam; friable; many fine roots; stones present.
    - AB (25–35 cm): grey; coarse sandy silt loam; visible roots.
    - Bg (35–49 cm) and BCg (49–70 cm): mottled red-brown horizons; clay loams with strong mottling; moist; friable to firm.
    - Cg (70–100 cm): light reddish-brown to brown; clay loam; massive structure; deeper horizons less root penetration.
  - Soil analysis (selected highlights):
    - Horizon-specific %N and %C with C:N ratios typically in mid-teens.
    - Ca, Mg, K, Na vary by horizon; Na generally low; Mg often higher in shallower horizons.
    - %Moisture loss and LOI indicate substantial organic input near the surface and decreasing with depth.
    - pH values are acidic (pH 4.3–4.9 in H2O; CaCl2 generally slightly lower).
  - Data notes:
    - Auger samples (5A–5F) provide micro-scale profiles of %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH, etc.
    - Profiles complemented by horizon-by-horizon descriptions and related chemical data.

- Auger samples and auger data (Blocks 4 and 5)
  - Block 4 auger samples (A–F; 4A–4F) show horizon-level variability in:
    - %N and %C, C:N ratios, Ca, K, Mg, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH.
    - Relative depth-interval consistency: surface horizons higher in organic matter indicators; deeper horizons more mineral with varied exchangeable cations.
  - Block 5 auger samples (A–F; 5A–5F) indicate strong horizon-dependent shifts:
    - Higher %N and %C at Ah with decreasing N/C in deeper horizons.
    - Ca often higher in surface horizons with decreasing values down the profile; Mg and K show block- and horizon-specific patterns.
    - LOI and moisture loss track organic content; pH remains acidic across horizons.
  - Auger data provide fine-grained comparisons among plots and blocks for multivariate analyses.

- Ecotron soil site data (subset)
  - Soil analysis (Ecotron Plot 1):
    - Wt ~6.089 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83.
    - Ca ~2.76 meq/100g; Mg ~1.7 meq/100g; K ~0.62 meq/100g; Na ~0.15 meq/100g.
    - %Moisture loss ~4.79; LOI ~17.42; pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
  - Vegetation survey (Ecotron):
    - Species tallies show presence/absence of key taxa across subplots; dominant taxa and indicator species are listed similarly to Blocks 4 and 5.

- Vegetation data and classification
  - Block 4 vegetation (sample plot 4A):
    - Dominant species include Agrostis capillaris (Acp), Festuca ovina (Fr), Nardus stricta (Ns), Anthoxanthum odoratum (Ao), Poa pratensis (Pp).
    - Community classification largely Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland with Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus bryophyte subcommunity (NVC type U4d).
    - MO relaxed edge patterns show indicator species such as Deschampsia flexuosa, Deschampsia cespitosa, Agrostis canina, Holcus mollis, Ranunculus repens, Carex binervis, Juncus effusus.
    - Block 4–5 areas include a secondary model corresponding to NVC type U5b (Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile grassland, with Agrostis canina-Polytrichum commune subcommunity), particularly in moister, higher blocks where Nardus stricta dominates.
  - Block 5 vegetation:
    - Data show per-plot species totals with notable presence of Ac, Ao, Ns, Fr, Pe, Pp, Pt, Gs, Hm, Je, Lm, Ns, etc.
    - Block 5 surveys reflect similar upland grassland communities with variable species richness and patchiness along micro-topography.
  - Edge vs central plots show distinct indicator patterns, consistent with gradient in slope, moisture, and soil properties.

- Data management and structure
  - Data are organized with MLURI barcodes for horizons and auger samples; multiple data files referenced (e.g., Twinspan, Association.xls) and appendices for horizon-by-horizon data.
  - The dataset is designed to be discoverable and reusable via data portals with metadata, supporting reproducibility and cross-study analyses.

- Endnotes: purpose for data-driven analysis
  - The Sourhope site provides a multi-block, multi-horizon dataset linking soil chemical and physical properties to vegetation community composition.
  - This enables investigations of correlations between soil fertility, acidity, organic matter, and plant community structure, as well as potential predictive modeling for management under varying soil conditions and long-term biodiversity objectives.
  - The combination of profile data, auger datasets, and ecotron/vegetation surveys supports analysis of soil–biosphere interactions, nutrient cycling, and vegetation responses to micro-environmental gradients.
