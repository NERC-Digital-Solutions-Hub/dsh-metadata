# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - The Sourhope field experiment, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, is a large, long-term monitoring study at Sourhope Farm in the Scottish Borders.
  - The report provides a broad monitoring framework and year-to-year context to colleagues conducting more detailed studies, enabling cross-year comparisons (referencing the Baseline Data Survey, Nov 1998, and Report II).
  - Two 2001 site events affected management: (1) Government restrictions during the Foot and Mouth outbreak delayed access from February–May, though key management activities largely continued; (2) a change of officer in charge occurred in May 2001.
  - The aim is to maintain consistency of measurements and data presentation across years to support interpretation of treatment effects and site heterogeneity.

- Monitoring measures and methods
  - Measurements span meteorological, soil, vegetation biomass, and botanical composition data.
  - Data collection includes:
    - Automatic Weather Station data (daily/annual indicators: rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture) with 1999–2001 headline measures.
    - Above-ground biomass estimates from five summer cuts per year, using sub-plot harvests and subsequent drying/weighing; data analyzed after log transformation.
    - Soil pH measured in the top 5 cm, with liming and nutrient addition treatments tracked over time.
    - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) to determine species hits and relative abundance, with cross-checks for inter-surveyor consistency.
  - Treatments and layout:
    - Five main plots with varying inputs: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), and Biocide.
    - Biomass and botanical measures linked to these treatments to assess fertility and liming effects on productivity and community composition.
  - Data management and quality:
    - Weather data transmitted to a central Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
    - The 2001 botanical survey involved two surveyors responsible for roughly half of quadrats each; no significant inter-surveyor differences were found.
    - The ongoing approach follows the protocol from Report II to facilitate year-to-year comparability.

- Key results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; prior year was unusually wet.
    - Radiation levels and mean temperatures showed little change; soil moisture content slightly higher in 2001 than earlier years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - A consistent hierarchy of biomass by treatment across sampling periods; peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass was notably higher than in previous years, likely due to staff changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalising against C1 showed nitrogen and/or lime treatments driving greater biomass, with the combination of nitrogen and lime being especially productive.
    - ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots; a significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming raised topsoil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots 6.19, N&L plots 6.38.
    - Nitrogen application alone also raised pH to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline (Aug 1998) values.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - 2001 survey showed high consistency between surveyors; total hits in 2001 increased by 58% relative to 2000 across treatments.
    - Treatment differences in dominant species observed:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, remaining most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
      - Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in fertilised plots (Festuca rubra) and in N&L plots (Festuca ovina).
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and related species; unimproved plots retained species associated with poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity patterns: unimproved plots contained 24 species, while the nitrogen+lime plots contained 18, suggesting potential diversity decline with stronger fertility treatments.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of improved (N and/or L) plots from unimproved (Control/Biocide) plots; correlations showed biomass increases associated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while other species declined with higher biomass.
    - Biomass and species relationships: higher biomass correlated with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; litter frequency increased where nitrogen and/or lime were applied, indicating faster vegetation turnover with enhanced fertility.

- Site heterogeneity
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed across columns; columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic conditions, a pattern intensified in plots with nitrogen and/or lime in certain columns, suggesting underlying site-to-site variation.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Some plots acted as outliers with lower biomass across treatments; central plots tended to have higher biomass.
    - A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant differences were detected among blocks, indicating within-site heterogeneity rather than block-wide effects.

- Additional notes
  - The study includes a detailed data collection schedule, a summary of measurement dates, and extensive Appendix material (e.g., annual biomass data and species codes) to support cross-year analyses and reproducibility.
  - The 2001 findings highlight the importance of consistent management and documentation of personnel changes, as they can influence measured productivity and interpretation of treatment effects.
