# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Overview of the dataset
  - Detailed soil profile and associated analyses for BLOCK 4 at Rigg Foot, Sourhope, including field descriptions, horizon-by-horizon chemistry, moisture and loss-on-ignition measurements, pH, and sequence of horizons from LF to Cx.
  - Complementary data for BLOCK 4 auger samples (4A–4F) and ECOTRON PLOT data, plus vegetation survey data corresponding to plots and subplots.
  - Contextual data for BLOCK 5 and ECOTRON PLOT, illustrating multi-block soil and vegetation datasets within the Sourhope site.

- Data assets and structure
  - Soil profiles by horizon and depth
    - Horizons described: LF (0–1 cm), FH (1–4 cm), H (4–8 cm), Ah (8–29 cm), Abg (29–40 cm), B sg (40–61 cm), C gx (61–95 cm) for BLOCK 4; detailed color, texture, structure, moisture, roots, and boundary descriptions.
    - For BLOCK 5 onwards, additional horizon sets include LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg with corresponding depth ranges.
  - Soil chemistry and properties by horizon
    - %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2).
    - Auger samples (4A–4F; and 5A–5F in BLOCK 5) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH, etc.
  - Sample metadata and identifiers
    - MLURI Barcodes for each horizon (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and for auger samples; weights (Wt) in mg; site blocks and horizon labels.
  - Vegetation data
    - Plot- and subplot-level species presence/absence and totals; per-plot and per-subplot species lists; classification of dominant taxa and indicator species.
  - Ecotron and network context
    - ECOTRON PLOT soil analyses and vegetation surveys; integration with broader networks (e.g., ECN/SERAD Micronet context) implied by site documentation.

- Data collection methods and measurements
  - Field sampling
    - Systematic horizon sampling with defined depth ranges (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
    - Augered samples collected at multiple depths; standardized W-pattern soil cores for block-level profiling.
  - Chemical and physical analyses
    - Nitrogen, Carbon, C:N ratio, exchangeable cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture loss, loss on ignition, and pH measurements (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Vegetation sampling
    - Detailed plot and subplot surveys documenting species presence/absence and totals across multiple plots and blocks.
  - Data management
    - Data entries tied to horizon/plot/subplot identifiers; archiving of immediate and archival samples; metadata conventions (horizon-based data, standardized classifications).

- Data management, accessibility, and quality
  - Archiving and provenance
    - Immediate and archival soil samples stored with precise identifiers (MLURI Barcodes); long-term preservation considerations implied (e.g., -80°C archiving at CEH Merlewood for select samples).
  - Metadata and standards
    - Horizon-level data, block-level summaries, and standardized soil and vegetation descriptors enable cross-site comparability.
    - Use of consistent horizon naming and measurement protocols supports reproducibility and re-analysis.
  - Data governance and caveats
    - Block-level anomalies noted (e.g., across Blocks 4–5 and to a lesser extent Blocks 3–1) requiring caution in cross-block comparisons and analyses.
    - Data appendices include granular, horizon- and plot-level data to support re-analysis and cross-site integration.

- Endnotes and appendices
  - Appendix-like data extend to BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 soil profiles, auger samples, and vegetation surveys, with complete tables of measurements, species presence, and soil chemistry.
  - ECOTRON and network context sections provide linkage to broader environmental monitoring activities.

- Practical takeaways for Data Leaders
  - Establish clear, horizon-based data governance for long-term ecological datasets: define standardized horizon labels, consistent sampling protocols, and robust metadata schemas.
  - Ensure data provenance and reproducibility: link field sampling (plots, subplots, horizons) to analytical results and to archival storage, including long-term preservation of samples.
  - Leverage standardized classifications and analytical frameworks: maintain consistency with classifications (e.g., NV classifications, Twinspan-like groupings) to enable cross-site comparisons and integration with larger ecological datasets.
  - Plan for data quality management and anomaly handling: document block-specific deviations, anomalies, and ensure appropriate caveats are applied during analyses and interpretation.
  - Integrate with broader networks and data streams: align with ECN/SERAD Micronet contexts to situate site-specific results within ongoing environmental monitoring efforts.
