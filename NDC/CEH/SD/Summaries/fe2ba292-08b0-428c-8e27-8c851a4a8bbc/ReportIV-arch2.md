NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

## Aim
- Present a four-year integrated assessment of how management (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) and disturbance shape above-ground biomass, plant diversity, and functional composition at the Sourhope field site.
- Provide a consistent environmental monitoring narrative suitable for ecological health and policy-relevant insights.

## Site and management overview
- Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute farm, Scottish Borders.
- Timeline: Four years of intensive botanical monitoring (1998 baseline; 1999–2002 reporting).
- Treatments (replicated, plot-level within 5 blocks): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment),
  - Nitrogen (N), Lime (Lime), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L),
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4; biocide plots renamed in 2002).
- Common site management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept) across all plots; grazing excluded since April 1998; insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots.
- Data collected: above-ground biomass, species composition, diversity (Shannon index), point analysis of species hits, soil pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture, weather data; extensive appendices with species lists and treatment maps.

## Methods (incorporating site activity)
- Experimental design: Rigg Foot site with 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m sampling cells for targeted data collection.
- Data collection:
  - Biomass: harvest from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells in sub-plots prior to each mow; samples oven-dried and weighed.
  - Vegetation surveys: baseline 1998; annual July/August point quadrats (100-point grid within selected cells) to identify touched species; bryophyte separation intensified in 2002.
  - Soil: pH and moisture measurements; weather station data since 1999.
- Analyses: split-plot ANOVA for biomass by treatment/year; PCA on point-analysis data; assessment of functional groups via CSR (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal strategies).

## Key findings

### Biomass productivity
- Long-term trend: overall increase in biomass across treatments from 1999 to 2002, despite 2002 reductions relative to 2001.
- Fertilisation effect: nitrogen and/or lime markedly increases productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime (N&L) are the most productive.
- 2002 specifics: biomass fell in 2002 across most treatments (13.7% in N&L plots to 31.2% in Control 2), with slope position also influencing productivity (lower blocks showed larger declines).
- Control 2 plots underperform relative to Control 1 after 1999–2002.

### Plant community composition and diversity
- Dominant species: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis remain dominant; Festuca spp. increasing in fertile plots.
- Mowing effect: reduction of Agrostis spp.; Festuca rubra expands, especially under lime- and nitrogen-enriched conditions.
- Bryophyte expansion: mosses increasingly dominate across plots, correlating with mowing height (~6 cm) and absence of grazing.
- Diversity (Shannon index): significant treatment-driven changes since 2000; diversity gains in several plots with insecticide or lime, but declines or stagnation in nitrogen+lime plots from 2000–2002.
- Point-analysis hits: improved plots (fertilised) show higher frequency of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots show higher frequencies of Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophyte contribution: bryophyte hits rise over time, notably in unimproved plots; mosses contribute a growing share of total hits and biomass in several years.
- Functional groups (CSR framework):
  - Stress-tolerators (S): increase in unimproved plots (disturbance reduction and nutrient loss).
  - Competitive-stress-ruderals (CSR) and SR/CSR: expand in N&L plots; lime and N appear particularly important for shifting functional composition.
  - SR/C-S-R largely reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.

### Soil chemistry and moisture
- Soil pH: lime increases soil pH strongly to around 7.0 in limed treatments; nitrogen has a smaller positive effect.
- Soil moisture: strong negative correlation with pH (r ≈ -0.68); higher pH plots tend to have lower moisture content.
- Biomass-pH relationship: positive correlation between pH and biomass when considering all plots; within nitrogen- or lime-treated plots the relationship weakens or reverses (especially when both N and lime are applied).

### Insecticide and trampling effects
- Insecticide: observed increases in plant diversity in some insecticide plots, consistent with literature suggesting herbivore exclusion can alter plant communities; however, evidence linking insecticide to higher Shannon diversity is circumstantial and requires careful interpretation.
- Trampling (C2 plots): first-time sampling in 2002 coincided with intense activity for CO2 pulse experiments; likely contributed to reduced productivity in C2 plots relative to C1.
  
### Species groups and indicators
- Taxonomic shifts: notable reductions in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis since 2000; Festuca rubra increases particularly in fertile plots.
- Bryophyte dynamics: Bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) become more abundant, especially in unimproved plots; bryophyte dominance coincides with reduced vascular plant monocot hits in some years.
- Dominant functional categories across plots: three main functional groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) accounted for the majority of plant hits; 2002 data show strong treatment-driven differentiation among these groups.

## Implications for monitoring and management
- Data value and integration: long-term, multi-dimensional datasets (biomass, species hits, bryophyte dynamics, soil chemistry, moisture, and weather) enable cross-cutting analyses on biodiversity, productivity, and ecosystem processes.
- Data access and reuse: emphasis on making underlying data available for external use and combining with other data sources to enhance monitoring value.
- Functional perspective: CSR-based functional classification provides a robust framework to interpret how nutrient status and disturbance regime steer plant community strategies and ecosystem function over time.
- Policy relevance: results inform management of grassland systems under varying nutrient inputs and disturbance regimes, highlighting potential trade-offs between productivity and biodiversity (e.g., increased biomass with N&L versus reduced diversity and bryophyte expansion).

## Limitations and cautions
- The relationship between insecticide application and diversity remains inferential; direct causal links require further targeted experiments.
- 2002 weather irregularities (and a temporary weather-station malfunction) introduced data gaps; some 2002 measurements relied on substitute stations for portions of the period.
- Plot-scale results are context-specific (GWD sourhope hillside gradient; 6 cm sward; no grazing since 1998); extrapolation to other systems should be done with caution.

## Overall conclusion
- Regular mowing plus nutrient enrichment drives clear shifts toward higher productivity but altered community composition, including increased Festuca rubra and bryophyte abundance, and reduced Agrostis species.
- Soil chemistry (liming) and moisture interact to shape biomass responses, with high pH and drier conditions generally associated with higher productivity in fertilised plots, though moisture limitations can counteract gains during dry periods.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require further evidence; trampling during CO2 pulse activities likely reduced productivity locally.
- The programme demonstrates the value of standardized, site-wide environmental monitoring to diagnose how management and disturbance influence environment health and policy outcomes over time.
