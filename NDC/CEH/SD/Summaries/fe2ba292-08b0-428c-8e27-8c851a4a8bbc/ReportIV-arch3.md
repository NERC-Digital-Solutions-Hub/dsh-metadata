# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Aim and context
  - Four-year monitoring of a large field experiment at Sourhope to understand how above-ground productivity, plant composition, and diversity respond to management and how these relate to soil biodiversity processes.
  - Focus on links between above- and below-ground systems, with intention to inform policy and future monitoring decisions.

- Site design and management (methods)
  - Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope (Scottish Borders)
  - Experimental layout: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random.
  - Treatments (plots): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
  - Management regime: site-wide mowing every year May–September to about 6 cm; insecticide applied to insecticide plots after mowing; nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots in spring; 1999–2002 field operations recorded in appendices.
  - Research scope: 16 Phase I projects plus Phase II activities; data collected across multiple sub-plots and years with collaborative groups.

- Data collection and metrics (monitoring framework)
  - Above-ground productivity: regular harvests from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells; samples oven-dried and weighed.
  - Botanical monitoring: baseline survey (1998) and annual/seasonal point analyses (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with a 100-point frame; identification to species where possible; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
  - Species abundance and composition: tracking frequency of vascular plants and bryophytes; repeated across treatments and years.
  - Diversity and functional typing: Shannon diversity indices calculated; plants categorized using the CSR (Competitiveness, Stress-tolerance, Ruderal) framework; examination of dominant functional groups over time.
  - Soil and microclimate variables: soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth; soil moisture (theta probe) measured in 2002; on-site Automatic Weather Station records temperature, rainfall, radiation since 1999.
  - Additional data: litter counts, biomass distribution per plot, and species lists (Appendices with site activity, weather, and detailed species data).
  - Analyses: split-plot ANOVA (Genstat 6) for biomass by treatment and year, correlations between pH, moisture, and productivity, PCA on point-analysis data, and treatment-specific comparisons with appropriate post-hoc tests.

- Key findings (highlights from 2002)
  - Biomass and productivity
    - Biomass increased overall from 1999 to 2002, but 2002 productivity fell relative to 2001 across several treatments.
    - Nitrogen and Lime treatments markedly boost productivity; the combination (N&L) remains the most productive; Control 2 tends to be less productive than Control 1.
    - Productivity shows a slope-position effect: Block 1 (lower slope) experienced larger falls than blocks higher on the slope.
  - Fertilization and soil chemistry
    - Lime substantially raises soil pH, approaching about 7 in limed plots; nitrogen also raises pH but less strongly.
    - Higher pH plus reduced soil moisture in fertilized plots may contribute to moisture stress and potential chlorosis in some areas.
    - A positive link between soil pH and biomass is evident overall; however, the relationship weakens within plots receiving nitrogen or lime alone and may become negative when both N and lime are applied.
  - Community composition and functional change
    - Mowing and disturbance reduction promote stress-tolerant (S) and CSR shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups in fertilized plots (especially N&L).
    - Unfertilised plots favor stress-tolerant species; fertilised plots shift toward more competitive species (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) and away from some Festuca / Agrostis species.
    - Bryophytes expand across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to higher bryophyte hits and biomass in those plots.
  - Species and taxa responses
    - Improved plots show higher abundances of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; Festuca ovina declines; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis decline notably since 2000.
    - Point analyses reveal clear differentiation between improved and unimproved plots; bryophyte species (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) are reduced in N and Lime plots, but overall bryophyte presence increases on the site.
    - Shannon diversity declines in the N&L plots (about 15% drop vs baseline), while other treatments show modest increases.
  - Insecticide and trampling effects
    - Insecticide effects on diversity are not definitively established; observed patterns suggest possible positive diversity responses but require caution and further testing.
    - Trampling effects observed in the C2 plots during 13CO2 pulse work, likely reducing biomass locally.
  - Longitudinal and multivariate patterns
    - PCA of point-analysis data separates improved vs unimproved plots; treatment groupings align with limed and nitrogen-treated clusters.
    - Functional group analyses indicate dominance shifts consistent with changes in soil fertility and disturbance regime.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks and policy
  - Validates the value of a multi-metric, factorial design to disentangle effects of mowing, fertilization, insecticide, and trampling on productivity, composition, and biodiversity.
  - Demonstrates importance of integrating above-ground productivity data with species composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional trait frameworks (CSR) to interpret ecosystem responses.
  - Highlights potential policy-relevant trade-offs: fertilization increases yield but may reduce diversity; disturbance reduction (loss of grazing) shifts communities toward stress-tolerant and moss-dominated states.
  - Underlines need for robust data management and metadata, given the scale and longitudinal nature of the dataset; extensive appendices and data are publicly documented (via Soil Biodiversity website and CEH contacts).

- Data governance, access and documentation
  - The project provides comprehensive datasets across years (1999–2002) and multiple metrics, with detailed appendices (Appendices 1–8) including site activity, species lists, weather, biomass, and PCA results.
  - While data are documented and accessible through the Soil Biodiversity website and Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the report acknowledges broader monitoring-data governance considerations such as metadata completeness, data sharing barriers, and the need for transparent data stewardship.

- Takeaways for future monitoring frameworks
  - Maintain long-term, multi-metric monitoring that combines productivity, biodiversity, functional traits, and soil/ climate drivers.
  - Use factorial experiments to parse interactions between management actions and site conditions; document management dates and rates meticulously.
  - Employ standardized data processing (e.g., transformations for biomass, consistent diversity indices, CSR classification) and advanced multivariate analyses (ANOVA, PCA) to extract meaningful patterns.
  - Ensure comprehensive metadata and data-sharing practices to facilitate cross-site learning and policy translation.
