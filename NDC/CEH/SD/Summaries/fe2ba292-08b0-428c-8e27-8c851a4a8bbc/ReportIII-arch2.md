# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Large, intensive field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Purpose: provide a broad monitoring context for detailed groups to compare data over time; enable links between datasets and cross-year comparisons.
  - Monitoring includes Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass measurements, soil pH, and botanical composition via Point Analysis surveys.
  - Key events in 2001: Foot and Mouth disease restrictions limited site access (Feb–May 2001) with controlled resumption; site manager change in May 2001. Management activities (liming, N, pH measurements, biomass collection, mowing) largely continued per 2001 plan with one biocide application delayed.

- Data and Methods
  - Data sources and types:
    - Weather: continuous data from on-site Automatic Weather Station.
    - Above-ground biomass: five summer harvests per year, plots with sub-plots for treatment comparisons.
    - Soil pH: measurements in upper 5 cm soil profile.
    - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001, mirroring 2000 protocol) across plots/treatments; species identified and counted as “hits.”
  - Treatments and design:
    - Treatments include Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), Biocide, and Controls (1 and 2).
    - Five blocks with sub-plots S, T, U, V per plot; treatments replicated across blocks.
  - Analytical approaches:
    - ANOVA (Genstat 5) on biomass data (log-transformed) to test treatment and year effects, including inter-year comparisons.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on point-quadrat data to explore shifts in species composition by treatment.
    - Correlation analyses between biomass and plant species abundance, and between biomass and soil pH.
  - Data caveats:
    - Biomass measurements in 2001 may reflect a shift from manual cutting to mechanical mowing, contributing to higher biomass estimates.
    - Some data gaps occurred due to FMD restrictions and staff changes.

- Key Results
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation unchanged; slight cooling relative to previous years.
    - Soil moisture content higher than in earlier years.
  - 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments maintained across years; peak biomass typically in July/August.
    - 2001 saw a substantial biomass increase vs. 2000, likely due to personnel changes and the switch to mechanical shears.
    - Normalization against the Control 1 (C1) showed that nitrogen and/or lime treatments produced the greatest biomass gains; nitrate and lime combinations had strongest positive effect.
    - Statistical results:
      - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots.
      - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
      - No significant differences between blocks.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; Nitrogen + Lime plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots remained near baseline pH since 1998.
  - 2.4 Botanical Composition
    - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey recorded 58% more hits than in 2000, suggesting increased sward density (potentially from grazing stock removal in 1998).
    - Treatment differences in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris decreased across all treatments in 2001 (no longer dominant in most plots except Control 1 and Limed).
      - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; Festuca rubra particularly associated with N and/or Lime plots.
      - Improved pastures showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots retained species like Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta.
    - Diversity changes:
      - 24 species identified in unimproved (Control and Biocide) plots vs 18 species in Nitrogen + Lime plots; suggesting potential decline in species richness with greater fertility.
    - PCA findings:
      - Clear separation of N and/or Lime plots from Control and Biocide plots, indicating compositional shifts with fertility treatment.
      - Improved plots associated with higher frequency of Festuca rubra and related species; unimproved plots linked with a more bryophyte- and Nardus-dominated assemblage.
    - Biomass and species relationships:
      - Positive correlations: higher biomass strongly linked with presence of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
      Negative associations: increases in biomass coincide with declines in Agrostis vinealis, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
      Litter abundance increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- Site Heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition:
    - Some columns (E and F) exhibited more acidic conditions, partly due to plot composition (many Controls or Biocide).
  - Variation in vegetation biomass:
    - Outlying plots with lower biomass existed across treatments; higher biomass tended to cluster in central plots (e.g., certain Nitrogen and Lime plots).
  - Key relationship:
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, indicating fertility-related growth responses.
    - No significant biomass differences between blocks.

- Implications for Environmental Monitoring
  - Demonstrates value of standardized, multi-maceted monitoring (weather, biomass, soil chemistry, plant community) to detect treatment effects and spatial heterogeneity over time.
  - Data show how nutrient and liming treatments alter productivity and plant community structure, with potential impacts on biodiversity (diversity may decline in highly fertilized plots).
  - Highlights importance of consistent methodologies (e.g., mowing methods, survey protocols) to ensure year-to-year comparability, and the influence of external events (disease restrictions, staff changes) on data interpretation.
  - PCA and biomass–pH correlations illustrate how integrated analyses can reveal mechanistic links between soil chemistry, productivity, and community composition.

- Endnotes and Context
  - The report contributes to a baseline and time-series framework for soil biodiversity studies, enabling cross-study comparisons and policy-relevant interpretation of environmental health over time.
  - Acknowledges contributions from team members and site staff, and situates findings within the broader Soil Biodiversity Programme.
