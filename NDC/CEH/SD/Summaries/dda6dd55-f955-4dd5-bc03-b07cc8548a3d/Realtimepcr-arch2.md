# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- PCR amplifies a targeted DNA sequence to generate many copies quickly.
- The procedure outlines sample preparation and PCR execution to minimize contamination and template denaturation, ensuring high-quality amplified products.

## Safety
- Use universal precautions when performing PCR.
- Regularly maintain the PCR hood and record results in a dedicated file.

## A. Chemicals
- 10X concentrated PCR reaction buffer
- dNTPs
- Forward and reverse primers
- Taq polymerase
- 70% Ethanol
- 10% Sodium hypochlorite
- Autoclaved filtered deionized water

## B. Equipment
- PCR hood with UV light
- Thermal cycler
- Vortex
- Rotor
- Refrigerator (2–8°C)
- Refrigerator (-20°C)

## C. Other Supplies
- Parafilm
- Micropipettes (100-1000 µl; 10-100 µl; 2-20 µl; 0.5-10 µl)
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml; 200 µl)
- Gloves
- Ice
- PCR racks
- Glass marker

## D. PCR Protocol
- Set up all reaction mixtures in an area separated from DNA preparation or PCR product analysis.
- Prepare a dNTP mix with 10 mM of each dNTP; store aliquots at -20°C.
- Thaw 10x PCR Buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
- Prepare a master mix (contains all components except template DNA); include at least one negative control to detect contamination.
- Mix master mix thoroughly and dispense into PCR tubes; mix gently by pipetting up/down.
- Add template DNA (2.0 µl) to each tube with master mix.
- Program thermal cycler with heated lid per manufacturer instructions.
- Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each new template target or primer pair.
- Typical cycling program:
  - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
  - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 minute
  - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 minute
  - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
  - Cycles: 25–35
  - Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
  - Hold: 4°C
- Place tubes in the thermal cycler and start the program.
- Storage after cycling: hold at 4°C or store at -20°C for long-term storage.

### Table 1. Representative reaction composition (using Taq polymerase)
- 19.0 µl: Filtered deionized water
- 2.5 µl: PCR Buffer (10x) with MgCl2 (50 mM)
- 0.5 µl: dNTP mix (10 mM each)
- 0.4 µl: Primer A (10 pmol/µl)
- 0.4 µl: Primer B (10 pmol/µl)
- 0.2 µl: Taq Polymerase (5 U/µl)
- 2.0 µl: Sample

## E. Quality control of the method
- Include both positive and negative controls for each PCR sample set.
- Negative control: PCR reagents without any DNA; should yield no band. Presence of a band indicates contamination and requires redone samples using the same master mix.
- Positive control: DNA that yields a clear, distinct band; may require dilution to produce a clear, bright band.
- QA/QC determination:
  - Expected outcomes: proper negative control and positive control results; if controls meet expectations, the gel/run passes QA/QC.
  - If controls fail, the gel/run does not pass QA/QC and requires reprocessing or troubleshooting.
