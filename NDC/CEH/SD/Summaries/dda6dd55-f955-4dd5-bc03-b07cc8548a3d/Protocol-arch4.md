# Antibiotic susceptibility tests and resistance genes in Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Overview
- Objective: Analyze antibiotic resistance in E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems; test susceptibility to different antibiotic classes; detect known resistance genes via real-time PCR.
- Sample sources: humans (faecal samples), poultry (caecal samples), and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces); cattle faeces/manure when available.
- Study settings: rural households, small-scale rural poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district, and urban markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
- Ethics: written informed consent with right to withdraw; ethical approvals from icddr,b (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).

## Study design and data collection
- Data collection rounds: round 1 (Feb–Apr 2017) and round 2 (Aug–Oct 2017); water samples (Oct 2018).
- Data collection personnel: trained researchers from icddr,b.
- Sample size: no expected size effect and no formal sample size calculation.

## Laboratory methods
- Isolate selection: E. coli identified as resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- Susceptibility testing: disk diffusion; zone of inhibition measured in millimeters; interpretation as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant per CLSI guidelines (M100S, 2016).
- Molecular analyses: real-time PCR to test for presence of known resistance genes; DNA extraction and PCR performed per established SOPs.
- Procedures: standard operating procedures for susceptibility testing, DNA extraction, and real-time PCR provided in supporting documentation.
- Location of analyses: Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b.

## Data collection and quality control
- Data capture: either manual paper sheets or automated laboratory outputs; manual entries into Excel by an experienced icddr,b data manager.
- Quality checks: random re-checks against original data collection sheets by independent researcher; frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values with corrections as needed.

## Data structure and documentation
- Primary data file: Ecoliastgenes.csv.
- Coding note: "Not done" indicates a bacterial isolate was not tested for a particular gene because the isolate did not show resistance to the relevant antibiotic.
- Supporting documentation: Samplingstrategy.rtf, Microbiology.rtf, Dnaextraction.rtf, Realtimepcr.rtf, Susceptibility.rtf, VariablelistASTgenes.csv.
- References and standards: CLSI guidelines referenced (M100S) and disk diffusion SOP from WHO Global Foodborne Infections Network.
