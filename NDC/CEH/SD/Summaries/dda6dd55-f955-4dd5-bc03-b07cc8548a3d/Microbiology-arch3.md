# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe the workflow to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from study samples.

## Materials
- PBS solutions (for 10× and 1× preparations)
- Antibiotics: cefotaxime, meropenem
- Chromogenic media: CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, TBX, MacConkey agar
- Glycerol (for 30% TSB glycerol stocks) and LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
- Oxidase reagent, filter papers, sterile petri dishes, weighing dishes, test tubes, cryovials, media bottles, inoculation loops
- General lab equipment: refrigerators (2–8 °C), freezers (-20 °C, -80 °C), autoclave, water bath (40–100 °C), incubator (36 ± 2 °C), shaker

## PBS and media preparation
- Prepare 1 L of 10× PBS by dissolving salts in water, adjust to pH 7.4, and autoclave; dilute to 1× by adding 100 mL of 10× PBS to 900 mL water.
- Prepare 1 L of CHROMagar ESBL and 1 L of CHROMagar KPC media (each yields 50 plates):
  - Reconstitute and autoclave media, cool to 45–50 °C, add supplements as specified, pour into sterile plates, and store protected from light.
- Prepare 1 L TBX media (50 plates) and prepare MacConkey media with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and MacConkey with meropenem (0.5 mg/L):
  - Include stock antibiotic solutions; add appropriate volumes to cooled media to achieve final concentrations.
- Label plates with agar type, date, and sample ID; use or store under specified conditions.

## Sample processing and plating
- For fecal (human and poultry), solid waste and soil samples:
  - Weigh 1–5 g sample into 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex 1 min, settle 15 min.
  - Collect 1 mL of suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS.
  - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, and TBX plates (spread plating).
  - Incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
  - Identify presumptive E. coli colonies (dark pink to reddish on ESBL and KPC plates).
  - Subculture at least 3 isolates from ESBL onto MacConkey with cefotaxime and from KPC onto MacConkey with meropenem.
  - Prepare a culture sweep from MacConkey plates into TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80 °C.
- For tap/tubewell water:
  - Pass 2×100 mL water through 0.22 μm filters; place on mTEC plates with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and meropenem (0.5 mg/L).
  - Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
  - If colonies >200 CFU, dilute water sample the next day and inoculate again as above.
  - Count reddish-purple/magenta colonies; pick at least 3 isolates and subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics; store glycerol stock at -80 °C.
- For wastewater:
  - Take 20 mL wastewater; make 9-fold dilutions with NS.
  - Filtered onto two mTEC plates (cefPTaxime 1 mg/L, meropenem 0.5 mg/L); incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
  - Proceed with colony counting and subculture as above; store glycerol stock at -80 °C.

## Confirmation and identification
- API 20E confirmation:
  - Test one E. coli isolate per sample with API 20E to confirm identification and enable further genetic analysis.
  - If presumptive E. coli is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample.
- API-20E procedure (summary):
  - Perform oxidase test to confirm Enterobacteriaceae are oxidase-negative.
  - Prepare bacterial suspension and inoculate API-20E strip wells (CIT, VP, GEL require specific handling; ADH, LDC, ODC, H2S, URE require mineral oil overlay).
  - Incubate at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h (extend to 42 h if needed).
  - Read results using the API Reading Table; if fewer than 3 positive tests after initial incubation, incubate an additional 24 h.
  - Use API online identification for final organism ID.
  - If unidentifiable, perform additional tests (Nitrate Reduction Test and/or MacConkey growth) and interpret per guidelines.
- Reagents and reagent handling:
  - Follow first-use preparation steps for API reagents; handle and mix as specified; ensure correct interpretation of results and re-test steps if necessary.

## Data handling and storage
- Plate and sample metadata:
  - Record plate type, date, and sample ID on each plate; maintain traceability of isolates.
- Storage and preservation:
  - Keep glycerol stocks at -80 °C for long-term preservation; store prepared media under protected conditions.
- Confirmation data:
  - Use API-20E results to confirm E. coli isolates and to guide further genetic analyses.
