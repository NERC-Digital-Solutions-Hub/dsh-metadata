# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- PCR amplifies a targeted DNA sequence to produce many copies quickly. This procedure describes how samples are prepared and run to avoid contamination and template denaturation, ensuring high-quality amplified products.

## Safety
- Use universal precautions when performing PCR.
- Maintain the PCR hood regularly and record results in a dedicated file.

## Chemicals
- 10X concentrated PCR reaction buffer
- dNTPs
- Forward and Reverse primers
- Taq polymerase
- 70% Ethanol
- 10% Sodium hypochlorite
- Autoclaved filtered deionized water

## Equipment
- PCR hood with UV light
- Thermal cycler
- Vortex
- Rotor
- Refrigerator (2–8°C)
- Refrigerator (-20°C)

## Other Supplies
- Parafilm
- Micropipettes (various ranges: 100-1000 µl, 10-100 µl, 2-20 µl, 0.5-10 µl)
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, 200 µl)
- Gloves
- Ice
- PCR racks
- Glass marker

## PCR Protocol
1. Set up all reaction mixtures in an area separate from DNA preparation or PCR product analysis.
2. Prepare a dNTP mix containing 10 mM of each dNTP; store in -20°C aliquots.
3. Thaw 10x PCR Buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
4. Prepare a master mix (Table 1) containing all components except the template DNA; include at least one negative control lacking template DNA to detect contamination.
5. Mix the master mix thoroughly and dispense into PCR tubes; mix gently by pipetting up/down.
6. Add template DNA (2.0 µl) to each tube containing the master mix.
7. Program the thermal cycler with the heated lid according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
8. Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each template/primer pair for maximum yield and specificity. Typical program:
   - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
   - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 minute
   - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 minute
   - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
   - Number of cycles: 25–35
   - Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
   - Hold at 4°C
9. Run the thermal cycling program.
10. After cycling, store tubes at 4°C for short-term or -20°C for long-term storage.

### Table 1. Example reaction composition (using Taq polymerase)
- Water: 19.0 µl
- 10x PCR Buffer with MgCl2: 2.5 µl
- dNTP mix (10 mM each): 0.5 µl
- Primer A (10 pmol/µl): 0.4 µl
- Primer B (10 pmol/µl): 0.4 µl
- Taq Polymerase (5 U/µl): 0.2 µl
- Template DNA: 2.0 µl

## Quality control of the method
- Run both positive and negative controls for each PCR sample set.
- Negative control:
  - PCR reagents without DNA; should yield no band.
  - Any band indicates contamination and the affected samples must be redone.
- Positive control:
  - DNA expected to produce a clear band; if needed, dilute to achieve a bright, distinct band.
- QA/QC decision:
  - Correct positive and negative control outcomes indicate a pass; incorrect outcomes indicate a fail and require re-running the affected samples and master mix.
