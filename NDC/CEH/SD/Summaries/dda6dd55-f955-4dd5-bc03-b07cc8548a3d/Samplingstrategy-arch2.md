# Purpose To describe the sampling strategy and procedures for sample collection of human faecal, poultry caecal and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the study Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh.

## Overview
- Describes the sampling design, sites, sample types, and collection procedures for AMR transmission study in urban and rural Bangladesh.
- Two sampling rounds to capture seasonal variation: Round 1 in winter; Round 2 in summer.
- Settings include urban live poultry markets, commercial poultry farms, and rural households with domestic poultry.

## Sampling plan by site

- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 markets randomly selected; one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market; human faecal samples collected; environmental samples from municipal water supply, solid waste disposal sites, and wastewater downstream of markets; poultry cloacal samples and swabs from floors/pens.
  - Round 2: 20 additional markets (total 40 markets); same procedures as Round 1.

- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; at least one farm worker per farm; a non-poultry-exposed adult from the same village as a comparison; samples from drinking water, poultry caecal content, mixed pen faeces; downstream wastewater/pond/canal water and downstream river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional farms (total 40 farms); same procedures as Round 1.

- Rural villages
  - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages (2 per village); one high-exposure household (owning domestic poultry) and one low-exposure household per village; adult women sampled; environmental samples from tubewell water, soil in the household compound, poultry caecal/Poultry manure (where applicable); downstream pond water, wastewater, and downstream river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 new villages (total 40 households); same procedures as Round 1.

## Sample types and collection summary
- Human faecal samples
  - Rural households (high and low exposure), farms (high exposure and low exposure), urban markets (high exposure and low exposure).

- Poultry samples
  - Cloacal samples from poultry in rural households, farms, and urban markets.
  - Poultry pen litter from the same settings.
  - Poultry drinking water from water feeders (where applicable).

- Environmental and other samples
  - Animal manure (rural households, farms, markets)
  - Soil from compound areas
  - Solid waste from market waste areas
  - Wastewater from drains near farms/households/markets
  - Pond water and downstream river water
  - Tubewell water and tap water from households

- Note: Some sample categories include pooling or sharing constraints (e.g., water supply, wastewater and solid waste facilities shared in markets; hence only one sample per market in certain categories).

## Sampling procedures and handling

- General handling
  - Use new gloves for each sample.
  - Transport all samples on ice; process in laboratory within 12–24 hours of collection (timeframe varies by sample type).

- Human stool samples
  - Provide stool container to participant; collect within 2 hours of collection; store on ice.

- Poultry caecal samples
  - Randomly select chickens from mixed-age flocks (slaughtered on-site); caecal sample extracted and processed in lab.

- Poultry cloacal samples
  - Collected from live poultry across settings; handled with sterile tools.

- Poultry pen litter
  - Collect from three different areas on the floor; pool around 20 g; mix thoroughly; store on ice; transport to lab.

- Animal manure
  - Collect about 20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon; store on ice; transport to lab.

- Soil samples
  - Collect ~20 g soil from a frequently trafficked area (e.g., near kitchen/door) using autoclaved tools; store on ice; preserve a portion in LifeGuard solution in an eppendorf on ice.

- Solid waste samples
  - Collect from waste dumping areas near markets; pool ~20 g in sterile bag; mix thoroughly; store on ice; transport to lab.

- Water samples
  - River/pond/surface water: collect 500 ml from ~30 cm below surface with sterile bottle; cap securely; keep cool; transport to lab.
  - Tubewell water: flush pump for 5 minutes; collect 500 ml aseptically into sterile bottle; keep cool; transport to lab.
  - Tap water: run water to waste for 1 minute; sterilize tap exterior; collect 500 ml; cap and cool; transport to lab.

## Geographic and physicochemical data
- Downstream river sampling locations: GPS coordinates recorded; measure pH, temperature, and conductivity where applicable.

## Data quality and storage
- Standardised collection procedures and timing to enable comparability across sites and rounds.
- Samples transported to the laboratory under controlled conditions and processed within defined timeframes.
- Collected data and samples organized to support subsequent analysis of antimicrobial resistance dynamics across environmental and human consumers.
