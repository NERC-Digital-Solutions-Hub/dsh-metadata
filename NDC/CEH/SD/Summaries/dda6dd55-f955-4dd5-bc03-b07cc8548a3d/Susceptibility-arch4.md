# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

- Purpose
  - Describes the procedure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from the study.

- Data and Records (Data Leadership perspective)
  - Record sample details on the media plate (Lab ID, sample type, organism name).
  - Capture zone diameters (in mm) and interpret results as Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
  - Ensure results are verified by a Laboratory Supervisor and traceable to the QC process and references.

- Equipment
  - Incubator (35±2°C), weighing balance, water bath (45–50°C), biosafety cabinet, vortex mixer.

- Medium/Reagents
  - Sterile saline (0.85%), Mueller Hinton Agar plates (~4 mm depth), 70% alcohol.

- Other Supplies
  - Antibiotic discs, inoculating loop, sterile cotton swabs, gas burner, sterile petri dishes, labeling pen, sterile needle, ruler, Mac Farland 0.5 standard.

- Quality Control Strains
  - Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems); Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor tests).

- Procedures (condensed)
  - Record sample details on plate; inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies into sterile saline and prepare a uniform suspension.
  - Adjust turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard.
  - Inoculate plate with swab, performing multiple streak passes to achieve uniform lawn; allow surface to dry briefly.
  - Place antibiotic discs onto agar with sterile needle; apply light pressure to ensure contact; do not relocate discs after contact.
  - Do not exceed 6 discs per 90 mm plate; incubate inverted at 35±2°C for 18–24 hours.
  - All steps from inoculum prep to disc application performed under biosafety cabinet.

- Quality Control (QC)
  - Verify media sterility and use ATCC reference organisms to confirm method accuracy.
  - Ensure QC results fall within CLSI-defined ranges; if out of range, do not report test results and follow CLSI troubleshooting guidelines.

- Interpretation and Reporting
  - After incubation, measure zones of inhibition (mm) across discs.
  - Record measurements and interpret as S, I, or R per CLSI guidelines.
  - Result verification by Laboratory Supervisor prior to reporting.
