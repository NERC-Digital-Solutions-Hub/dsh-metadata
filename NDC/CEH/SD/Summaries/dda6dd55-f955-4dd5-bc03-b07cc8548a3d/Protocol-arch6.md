# Antibiotic susceptibility tests and resistance genes in Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Summary of dataset and purpose
- Focuses on E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- Data collected on antibiotic susceptibility (disk diffusion, zone of inhibition in mm) and presence of known resistance genes via real-time PCR.
- Sources: humans (healthy adults, fecal samples), poultry (caecal samples from broilers), and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/feaces; cattle manure where available in rural households).
- Settings: rural households, small-scale rural poultry farms (Mirzapur, Tangail district), urban food markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh.

## Experimental design
- Identify resistant E. coli isolates through microbiological analysis; test susceptibility to various antibiotics according to CLSI guidelines.
- Test for known resistance genes using real-time PCR.
- Data collection spans three contexts and two sampling rounds, with additional water samples in 2018.

## Collection methods and timeline
- First data collection: winter 2017 (Feb–Apr).
- Second data collection: summer 2017 (Aug–Oct).
- Water samples (farms and urban markets) collected in Oct 2018.
- Participant consent obtained; right to withdraw preserved.
- Ethical approvals: icddr,b PR16071; Loughborough University R17-P037.
- Data collection performed by trained icddr,b researchers.

## Analytical methods
- Antibiotic susceptibility testing via disk diffusion; zone diameters recorded and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant per CLSI guidelines (M100S, 2016).
- DNA extraction and real-time PCR conducted to detect resistance genes.
- Standard operating procedures referenced in the project documentation (Susceptibility.rtf, Dnaextraction.rtf, Realtimepcr.rtf).
- Laboratory analyses conducted by experienced researchers at icddr,b.

## Data management and quality control
- Data captured either on paper sheets or automated lab outputs; manual entries into Excel by a data manager.
- Random checks against original data sheets; frequency checks to identify out-of-range values.
- Notations such as “Not done” used when a gene was not tested due to lack of resistance to the relevant antibiotic.
- Emphasis on data provenance and traceability through supporting documentation.

## Data structure and file
- Primary dataset file: Ecoliastgenes.csv.
- Data fields include: susceptibility phenotype, zone of inhibition (mm), CLSI category, presence/absence of resistance genes; coding indicates when a gene was not tested due to non-resistance to corresponding antibiotic.

## Documentation and standards
- Supporting documents available: Samplingstrategy.rtf, Microbiology.rtf, Dnaextraction.rtf, Realtimepcr.rtf, Susceptibility.rtf, VariablelistASTgenes.csv.
- Standards referenced: CLSI guidelines (M100S); WHO global network SOP for disk diffusion susceptibility testing.

## Ethical and compliance notes
- Informed consent obtained; participants may withdraw at any time.
- Ethical clearances from icddr,b and Loughborough University documented.
