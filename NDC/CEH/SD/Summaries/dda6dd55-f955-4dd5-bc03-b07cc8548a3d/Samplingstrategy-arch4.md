# Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh

- Purpose
  - Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) for the AMR transmission study.

- Study design and sampling rounds
  - Two rounds of data collection: Round 1 in winter; Round 2 in summer.
  - Sites include: urban live poultry markets, commercial poultry farms, and rural households with domestic poultry.
  - For each site type, a consistent sampling framework is applied across rounds to enable comparisons over time and exposure levels.

- Sampling sites and exposure groups
  - Urban poultry markets: random selection of markets; data collected from live poultry stalls and adjacent waste streams.
  - Commercial poultry farms: selection of broiler farms; include farm workers (high exposure) and village adults not working with poultry (low exposure).
  - Rural villages/households: random selection of villages with two households per village (high exposure = poultry-owning households; low exposure = non-poultry households); focus on adult women where appropriate due to domestic poultry responsibilities.
  - Across sites, a dual exposure framework (high vs. low) is used to examine AMR transmission dynamics.

- Sample types collected
  - Human samples: faecal samples from participants.
  - Poultry samples: cloacal swabs, poultry pen litter, poultry caecal samples.
  - Environmental samples: drinking water (household tubewell and market/supply water), waste water (drains, runoff), pond/river water, sewer/ downstream water, soil from household compounds, household solid waste, animal manure, pond water, and downstream river water.
  - Laboratory-related details indicate pooling and enrichment steps where applicable and the use of LifeGuard solutions for certain samples.

- Data collection procedures and standards
  - Sampling conducted with sterile techniques, gloves for each sample, and sterile collection materials.
  - Pooling of multiple sub-samples when specified (e.g., waste water from multiple locations; soil and litter pooling).
  - Precise volumes or weights specified for many sample types (e.g., ~150 ml per wastewater point; ~500 ml for certain water samples; ~20 g for soil and litter samples).
  - Immediate placement into cool boxes and transport to the laboratory, with processing within 12–24 hours of collection.
  - Clear instructions for field handling, including decontamination steps for taps and sterile transfer of samples.

- Lab processing and timing
  - All samples are transported on ice and processed promptly to preserve integrity.
  - Samples are prepared and stored under conditions designed to maintain viability and traceability for downstream analyses.

- Metadata, geospatial, and contextual data
  - Geographic coordinates recorded for downstream river water sample locations.
  - On-site measurements include pH, temperature, and conductivity for river samples.
  - Comprehensive documentation exists for each sample type, including whether the sample is from a high- or low-exposure site and the site category (rural household, farm, or market).

- Data governance, standards, and integration
  - Detailed sampling plan and SOPs (for interaction with human, animal, and environmental samples) support data standardization across multiple sites.
  - Consistent naming, labeling, and batching of samples to enable traceability across rounds.
  - The study references an overarching project identifier (NERC NE/N019555/1) to support data management, sharing, and integration.

- Challenges and considerations for data leaders
  - Coordinating data collection across diverse settings (urban markets, farms, rural households) and two seasonal rounds.
  - Ensuring uniform adherence to SOPs and metadata completeness across field teams.
  - Managing sample-specific handling requirements (glove changes, pooling, transport conditions) to minimize variability.
  - Balancing extensive field logistics with timely lab processing to preserve data quality.
  - Integrating heterogeneous data streams (human, animal, and multiple environmental matrices) for downstream AMR analyses.

- Summary of data assets and scope
  - Comprehensive, multi-site, multi-sample dataset spanning human, poultry, and environmental matrices.
  - Two-season longitudinal design with repeated sampling.
  - Rich metadata including site type, exposure level, GPS coordinates for select samples, and basic physico-chemical measurements.
  - Data are organized to support linkage between exposure context, sample type, and downstream AMR analyses, enabling holistic assessment of transmission dynamics in urban and rural Bangladesh.
