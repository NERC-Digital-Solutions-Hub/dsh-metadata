# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe the procedure for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from this study.

## Equipment
- Incubator (35±2°C)
- Weighing balance
- Water bath (45-50°C)
- Biosafety cabinet
- Vortex machine

## Medium/reagents
- Sterile saline solution (0.85%), 3-4 mL per tube
- Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates, ~4 mm agar depth
- 70% alcohol

## Other Supplies
- Antibiotic discs
- Inoculating loop
- Sterile cotton swab
- Gas burner
- Sterile petri dishes
- Label pen
- Sterile needle
- Ruler
- Mac Farland 0.5 standard

## Quality control strains
- Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems)
- Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations)

## Procedures
- Record sample details on the media plate (Lab ID, Sample type, organism name).
- Inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies into sterile saline; emulsify to avoid clumping.
- Adjust inoculum turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard.
- Within 15 minutes, dip a sterile cotton swab into the inoculum; remove excess.
- Streak the swab over the entire MHA plate in three passes with 60° rotations; finish around the rim.
- Allow surface moisture to be absorbed before applying discs; permit brief drying with plate ajar if needed.
- Place antibiotic discs onto the agar with a sterile needle; apply gentle pressure to ensure contact.
- Do not relocate discs after contact; diffusion begins instantly. Perform all steps under biosafety cabinet.
- Do not place more than 6 discs on a single 90 mm plate; space evenly.
- Invert plates and incubate at 35±2°C for 18–24 hours.

## Quality Control (QC)
- Verify media sterility per sterility control manual.
- Use ATCC reference organisms to check assay accuracy.
- Ensure QC results are within CLSI-specified ranges.
- If QC fails, do not report test results; troubleshoot per CLSI guidelines.

## Interpretation and reporting results
- After 18–24 hours, measure zones of inhibition in millimeters.
- Record diameters on worksheets.
- Interpret results as Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
- Laboratory Supervisor must verify before reporting.
