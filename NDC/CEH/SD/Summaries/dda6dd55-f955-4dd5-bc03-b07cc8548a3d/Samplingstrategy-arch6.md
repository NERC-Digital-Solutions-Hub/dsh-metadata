Purpose
To describe the sampling strategy and procedures for sample collection of human faecal, poultry caecal and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the study Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh.

## Overview
- Describes a multi-site AMR transmission study across urban markets, commercial poultry farms, and rural households in Bangladesh.
- Two sampling rounds conducted in different seasons to capture temporal variation: Round 1 in winter, Round 2 in summer.
- Aims to collect human, animal (poultry), and diverse environmental samples to characterize AMR dynamics.

## Study design: rounds and settings
- Sampling rounds:
  - Round 1: winter
  - Round 2: summer
- Settings:
  - Urban live poultry markets
  - Commercial poultry farms
  - Rural villages/households with domestic poultry
- Each setting recruited with a two-tier structure (two samples per site type per market/farm/village per round), culminating in substantial paired data across settings and seasons.

## Settings and sampling units
- Urban poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 markets selected randomly; Round 2: 20 additional markets (total 40 markets)
  - Within each market: one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder sampled
  - Shared facilities note: water supply, wastewater, and solid waste facilities were shared in markets; hence only one sample per market for these facilities (plus general market sampling)
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 farms; Round 2: 20 additional farms (total 40)
  - Within each farm: at least one farm worker sampled; a healthy adult non-poultry worker from the same village included as low-exposure comparison
- Rural villages/households
  - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages; Round 2: 20 additional households (total 40)
  - Sampling targets:
    - High exposure: households owning domestic poultry
    - Low exposure: households not owning poultry
  - Focused sampling of adult women in rural settings (often responsible for poultry)

## Sample types and counts (summary)
- Human faecal samples
  - Rural households: 40 (high exposure)
  - Farms: 40 (high exposure)
  - Urban markets: 40 (high exposure)
  - Low-exposure human faecal samples also collected where applicable
- Poultry cloacal samples
  - Rural households: 40 (high exposure with poultry)
  - Farms: 40 (high exposure)
  - Urban markets: 40 (high exposure)
- Poultry pen litter
  - Rural households: 40 (high exposure with poultry)
  - Farms: 40 (high exposure)
  - Urban markets: 40 (high exposure)
- Water samples
  - Water supply (drinking water): Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting; note about shared facilities in markets)
  - Wastewater: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
  - Pond water: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
  - Downstream river water: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
  - Tubewell water and tap water samples collected as applicable
- Environmental and other samples
  - Soil from compound: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
  - Solid waste: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
  - Animal manure: Rural households, Farms, Urban markets (40 per setting)
- Poultry caecal samples
  - Rural households: 40 (from chickens slaughtered on-site)
  - Farms: 40 (from farmed poultry)
  - Urban markets: 40 (from live poultry)
- Note: Some sample types were pooled or limited due to shared facilities; see urban market notes above for specifics.

## Sampling procedures and handling
- General hygiene and handling
  - Use new gloves for each sample; collect in sterile containers or sterile bags as specified
  - For pooled samples (soil, solid waste, poultry litter, etc.), pool from multiple sub-samples to create a composite (~20 g per pool) before transport
  - Transport all samples on ice; process in the laboratory within 12 hours (faecal, cloacal, litter) or within 24 hours for other samples
- Human stool samples
  - Participants provide stool samples; field staff collect within 2 hours of collection; store on ice
- Poultry caecal samples
  - Collected from chickens selected for slaughter/processing; whole carcasses transported in sterile zipper bags; caecal samples processed in the lab
- Poultry pen litter
  - Collected from three different floor areas of the poultry housing; pooled (~20 g); no sharp objects
- Animal manure
  - Collected with new gloves; ~20 g per sample; placed in labeled sterile bags; transported on ice
- Soil samples
  - Collected from yard areas with high human/animal activity (e.g., near kitchen/doorway)
  - Approximately 20 g per sample; autoclaved-spoon method; soil depth ~0.5 inches
  - Part of each sample also prepared in LifeGuard solution for preservation
- Solid waste samples
  - Collected from three locations around market dustbins (around 20 g total); pooled and mixed thoroughly
  - Avoid sharp objects; maintain sterility
- Water samples
  - Water supply (drinking) and wastewater: collect from multiple points and pool into a single labelled bottle (generally 500 mL)
  - Pond/surface water: collect by plunging a sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface (500 mL)
  - Downstream river water: collect from downstream location with a sterile 500 mL bottle (same pooling approach as above)
  - Tubewell water: pump for 5 minutes, heat pump inlet, collect from pumped water; collect 500 mL aseptically
  - Tap water: run tap for 1 minute, flame outside nozzle, collect 500 mL aseptically
- Environmental sampling specifics
  - For downstream river samples, GPS coordinates recorded, along with pH, temperature, and conductivity
  - All samples labeled and stored for laboratory analysis

## Logistics and data quality notes
- Round 2 data collection replicated Round 1 sites with an additional set of 20 sites per setting to complete the total of 40 per setting
- In urban markets, sampling of water and solid waste facilities was shared; only one sample per market was collected for these facility-based samples
- Emphasis on rapid transport and standardized handling to preserve sample integrity
- Two-tier exposure design (high vs low exposure) across rural and market settings to assess differential AMR dynamics
