# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes enumeration, isolation, preservation, and identification of E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems.
  - Applies to fecal (human and poultry), solid waste/soil, supply water, and wastewater samples.
  - Isolates are stored for later use (e.g., API 20E confirmation and genetic analysis).

- Key materials and media
  - PBS (1× and 10× preparations)
  - Cefotaxime and meropenem powders
  - CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC media
  - TBX medium
  - MacConkey agar (with cefotaxime 1 mg/L or meropenem 0.5 mg/L)
  - Tryptone Soya Broth with 30% glycerol for storage
  - LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
  - Oxidase reagent
  - 0.22 μm cellulose membrane filters and mTEC agar
  - API 20E identification kit
  - Reagents for API 20E (TDA, JAMES, VP1, VP2, ADH, LDC, ODC, H2S, URE, etc.)
  - Nitrate reduction reagents and Zn for confirmation if needed

- Equipment
  - Refrigerator (2–8 °C), freezer (-20 °C, -80 °C)
  - Autoclave, water bath (40–100 °C), incubator (36 ± 2 °C)
  - Shaker, sterile consumables, Petri dishes, cryovials, sterile tubes
  - Pipettes and sterile handles

- Preparation of media
  - 10× PBS: dissolve NaCl, KCl, Na2HPO4, KH2PO4 in 800 mL water; adjust pH to 7.4; bring to 1 L; autoclave.
  - 1× PBS: add 100 mL of 10× PBS to 900 mL water.
  - CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC: reconstitute, autoclave, cool to 45–50 °C, add appropriate supplements per instructions, pour into plates; store protected from light.
  - TBX: dissolve, autoclave, cool to 45–50 °C, dispense 20 mL per plate; store in dark at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks.
  - MacConkey (with antibiotics): dissolve 50 g in 1 L water; autoclave; cool to 45–50 °C; add cefotaxime stock for ESBL plates (1 mg/L) or meropenem stock for KPC plates (0.5 mg/L); pour into plates; store as above.

- Sample processing workflow
  - For fecal, solid waste, and soil
    - Weigh 1–5 g, suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex 1 min, allow to settle 15 min.
    - Collect 1 mL of suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS.
    - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto one CHROMagar ESBL, one CHROMagar KPC, and one TBX plate; spread and incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
    - Count E. coli-like colonies (dark pink to reddish on ESBL and KPC plates).
    - Pick at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL and subculture onto MacConkey with cefotaxime; pick at least 3 from KPC and subculture onto MacConkey with meropenem.
    - Prepare a culture sweep from MacConkey plates and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at −80 °C.
  - For supply water (tap/tubewell)
    - Filter 2 × 100 mL through 0.22 μm membranes; place filters on mTEC plates (one with cefotaxime 1 mg/L, one with meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
    - Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
    - If >200 CFU, perform appropriate dilutions next day and repeat inoculation.
    - Count reddish-purple/magenta E. coli colonies; pick at least 3 isolates and subculture onto MacConkey with corresponding antibiotics; store as above.
  - For wastewater
    - Use 20 mL sample with 9-fold dilution in NS; filter as above and incubate on mTEC plates with antibiotics as above; proceed with isolation and storage as for water.
- Confirmation and identification
  - API 20E for confirmation
    - One E. coli isolate per sample undergoes API 20E testing; if an isolate is negative, test a second isolate from the same sample.
    - Procedure includes Oxidase test, preparation of bacterial suspension, inoculation of API strip, and incubation at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h.
    - Read results using the API Reading Table; if fewer than 3 positive tests after initial run, incubate an additional 24 h.
    - Use API-20E identification tools (online at APIweb) for organism identification.
    - If unidentifiable, perform additional tests (Nitrate Reduction, MacConkey growth) per the guide.
  - Data interpretation and follow-up
    - Record results and proceed with further genetic analyses as indicated.
    - Maintain and store culture stocks for future use.

- Data handling and storage
  - Store preserved isolates at −80 °C in TSB with 30% glycerol.
  - Maintain clear sample IDs and plate/culture provenance.
  - Prepared media plates have defined usage/storage windows (e.g., ESBL/KPC up to 1 day at room temp; up to 1–2 months refrigerated, protected from light/dehydration).

- Notes and references
  - Protocol references: Chromogenic media manuals (CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC) and API 20E kit documentation.
  - Emphasis on standardized, traceable procedures to support downstream data comparability and policy-relevant environmental surveillance.
