# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Overview
- Standardized protocol to enumerate, isolate, preserve, and identify E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins or carbapenems from fecal, soil, water, and wastewater samples.
- Emphasizes traceability, reproducibility, and data quality through consistent labeling, record-keeping, and storage of isolates for downstream analyses (e.g., API 20E confirmation and genetic analyses).

## Materials
- PBS solution, cefotaxime, meropenem
- CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC media, TBX medium, MacConkey media
- Tryptone Soya broth with 30% glycerol, LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution
- Oxidase reagent, filter paper, sterile petri dishes, weighing dishes, test tubes, cryovials, media bottles, inoculation loop
- Lab equipment: refrigerator (2–8 °C), freezer (-20 °C, -80 °C), autoclave, water bath (40–100 °C), incubator (36 ± 2 °C), shaker

## Media preparation (summary)
- Prepare 1 L 10× PBS, then dilute to 1 L 1× PBS; autoclave.
- Prepare 1 L CHROMagar ESBL and 1 L CHROMagar KPC media; incorporate supplements immediately before use; pour into plates; store protected from light.
- Prepare 1 L TBX medium; autoclave; cool to 45–50 °C; add plates.
- Prepare MacConkey media with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and with meropenem (0.5 mg/L); include stock antibiotic solutions; pour plates; store protected from light.
- Plates prepared for each medium are labeled with agar type, date, and sample ID; can be stored short-term at room temperature or refrigerated per instructions.

## Sample types and processing
- Fecal (human and poultry), solid waste, and soil:
  - Weigh 1–5 g; suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex, settle; collect 1 mL for serial dilutions in PBS.
  - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto one CHROMagar ESBL, one CHROMagar KPC, and one TBX plate; incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
  - Count typical E. coli colonies (dark pink to reddish).
  - Sub-culture at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL plate onto MacConkey with cefotaxime; similarly from KPC plate onto MacConkey with meropenem.
  - Create a culture sweep from MacConkey plate and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80 °C.
- Supply water (tap or tubewell):
  - Filter 2 × 100 mL through 0.22 μm membranes; place filters on CHROMagar media (one with cefotaxime, one with meropenem).
  - Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h then 44 °C for 18 h.
  - Count reddish/magenta colonies; store leftovers at 4 °C; pick at least three colonies per sample and subculture to MacConkey with the same antibiotics; store as glycerol stocks at -80 °C.
- Wastewater:
  - Take 20 mL wastewater; make 9-fold dilutions with NS.
  - Filter through 0.22 μm membranes onto CHROMagar ESBL and CHROMagar KPC; incubate as above.
  - Count colonies; pick at least three colonies and subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics; store as glycerol stocks at -80 °C.

## Colony selection and preservation
- From ESBL and KPC plates, pick at least 3 isolated colonies per sample for subculture.
- Prepare a culture sweep from MacConkey plates and store in TSB with 30% glycerol at -80 °C for long-term preservation.

## Confirmation and identification (API 20E)
- Use API 20E for one E. coli isolate per sample to confirm identity and enable further genetic analysis.
- If the presumptive E. coli is negative by API 20E, test a second isolate from the same sample.
- API 20E procedure includes oxidase test, inoculation of API strip wells, incubation at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h, and interpretation using the Reading Table.
- If initial results are inconclusive, perform additional tests:
  - Nitrate reduction test (NIT reagents, glucose tube, zinc if needed)
  - Growth on MacConkey agar for further clarification

## API-20E interpretation and follow-up
- Read and interpret results using the API Reading Table; record observations (e.g., gas production, appearance).
- If fewer than 3 positive tests after initial incubation, incubate an additional 24 ± 2 h before proceeding.
- If unidentifiable, follow-up testing per the established algorithm (nitrate reduction and MacConkey growth).

## Data, traceability and quality
- Ensure consistent labeling: each plate labeled with agar type, date, and sample ID.
- Maintain a clear link between sample IDs, colony isolates, and preservation stocks (glycerol stocks at -80 °C).
- Document the number of colonies picked from each selective plate and associated subcultures.
- Use standardized steps for API 20E and follow interpretation guidance to ensure reproducible identification outcomes.
- References provided for CHROMagar ESBL/KPC and API 20E to support method fidelity.

## Storage and preservation
- Preserve isolates as culture sweeps in TSB with 30% glycerol at -80 °C for long-term storage and downstream analyses.
