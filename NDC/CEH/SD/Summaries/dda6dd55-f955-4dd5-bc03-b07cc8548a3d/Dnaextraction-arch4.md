# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose: Describe the procedure for DNA extraction of environmental samples (soil, water, stool) or bacterial isolates obtained from the study.

## General precautions
- Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves and use universal precautions.
- Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for emergency procedures.
- Keep flammable reagents (e.g., ethanol) away from flames and sparks.

## Kit and DNA storage
- Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) when not in use.
- Store kit reagents/components at room temperature (15-30°C).

## DNA extraction from soil samples (DNeasy PowerSoil Kit, Qiagen, Cat. No. 12888-50)
- Equipment needed: pipettors, microcentrifuge, vortex, vortex adapter.
- Key workflow:
  - Weigh 0.25 g soil into PowerBead Tube; mix.
  - Ensure Solution C1 is dissolved; add C1, vortex.
  - Vortex tubes horizontally at max speed for 10 minutes.
  - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s; transfer supernatant to a clean tube.
  - Add C2, vortex; incubate 4°C 5 min; centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min.
  - Transfer up to 600 µl supernatant; add C3, vortex; incubate 4°C 5 min; centrifuge 1 min at 10,000 x g.
  - Transfer up to 750 µl supernatant; add C4, vortex; load onto spin filter (675 µl aliquots) and centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 1 min (repeat steps as needed).
  - Add C5, centrifuge 10,000 x g for 30 s; discard flow-through; centrifuge 1 min.
  - Place spin filter in new tube; add C6 (or DNA-free water) to elute; centrifuge 30 s at 10,000 x g.
  - Store eluted DNA at -20 to -80°C.

## DNA extraction from water samples (DNeasy PowerWater Kit, Qiagen, Cat. No. 14900-5-NF)
- Equipment needed: filter funnels, microcentrifuge (13,000 x g), centrifuge for 15 ml tubes (≤4000 x g), vortex, vortex adapter, vacuum filtration system.
- Special precautions: warm Solution PW1 to 55°C; PW3 may precipitate—warm to dissolve.
- Key workflow:
  - Filter water; transfer filter into PowerWater Bead Tube with 1 ml PW1.
  - Vortex at max speed for 5 min; centrifuge ≤4000 x g for 1 min; collect supernatant.
  - Transfer supernatant to tube; add IRS; incubate at 4°C 5 min; centrifuge 13,000 x g 1 min.
  - Transfer supernatant; add PW3, vortex; load onto MB Spin Column; centrifuge 13,000 x g 1 min; repeat until all supernatant is processed.
  - Place MB Spin Column in new tube; add PW4, centrifuge 13,000 x g 1 min; add PW5, centrifuge 1 min; discard flow-through and centrifuge 2 min to dry.
  - Add PW6 to filter center; centrifuge 1 min; remove spin filter basket.
  - DNA ready for downstream applications; store at -20° to -80°C.

## DNA extraction from stool samples (QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit, Qiagen, Cat. No. 51504)
- Key workflow:
  - Weigh 180–220 mg stool; add 1.4 ml Buffer ASL; vortex thoroughly; heat at 70°C for 5 min; vortex again; centrifuge 1 min to pellet particles.
  - Transfer 1.2 ml supernatant; add InhibitEX Tablet; vortex 1 min; incubate 1 min at room temp to bind inhibitors.
  - Centrifuge 3 min to pellet inhibitors; transfer supernatant to new tube; centrifuge 3 min.
  - Add 15 µl proteinase K to new tube; add 200 µl supernatant to PK; add 200 µl Buffer AL; mix thoroughly; incubate 70°C for 10 min.
  - Add 200 µl ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; centrifuge 1 min; discard filtrate.
  - Add 500 µl Buffer AW1; centrifuge 1 min; discard filtrate.
  - Add 500 µl Buffer AW2; centrifuge 3 min; (optionally transfer to new tube and centrifuge 1 min).
  - Transfer to new tube; add 200 µl Buffer AE; incubate 1 min; centrifuge 1 min to elute DNA.
  - Store DNA at -20° to -80°C.

## Preparation of Template DNA
- From a culture on TSA: suspend 1 loopful in 500 µl autoclaved dH2O; boil 10 min, then chill on ice for 5–10 min.
- Centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 5 min; collect ~200 µl supernatant for use.
- Store template DNA at -20°C.
