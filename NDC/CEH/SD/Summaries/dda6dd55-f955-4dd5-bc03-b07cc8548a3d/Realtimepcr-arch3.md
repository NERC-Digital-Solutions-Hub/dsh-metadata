# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describes how to perform PCR to amplify a targeted DNA sequence, with steps to prevent contamination and template denaturation, ensuring high-quality amplified products.

## Safety
- Use universal PCR precautions.
- Maintain the PCR hood regularly and record results in a dedicated file.

## A. Chemicals
- 10X concentrated PCR reaction buffer
- dNTPs
- Primers (Forward and Reverse)
- Taq polymerase
- 70% Ethanol
- 10% Sodium Hypochlorite
- Autoclaved filtered deionized water

## B. Equipment
- PCR hood with UV light
- Thermal cycler
- Vortex
- Rotor
- Refrigerator (2–8°C)
- Refrigerator (-20°C)

## C. Other Supplies
- Parafilm
- Micropipettes and tips (multiple ranges)
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, 200 µl)
- Gloves
- Ice
- PCR racks
- Glass marker

## A. PCR Protocol
- Set up all reaction mixtures in a area separate from DNA preparation or PCR product analysis.
- Prepare a 10 mM dNTP mix and store in aliquots at -20°C.
- Thaw 10x PCR Buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
- Prepare a master mix (excluding template DNA) and include at least one negative control to detect contamination.
- Mix the master mix thoroughly and dispense into PCR tubes; mix gently.
- Add template DNA (2.0 µl) to tubes containing the master mix.
- Program the thermal cycler with a heated lid according to manufacturer instructions.
- Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each template/primer pair.
  - Typical cycling program:
    - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
    - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 min
    - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 min
    - Extension: 72°C for 1 min
    - Number of cycles: 25–35
    - Final extension: 72°C for 10 min
    - Hold at 4°C
- After cycling, store tubes at 4°C for short-term or -20°C for long-term storage.

### Table 1. Master mix composition (per reaction, using Taq polymerase)
- 19.0 µl: Filtered deionized water (FDW)
- 2.5 µl: PCR Buffer (10x) with MgCl2 (50 mM)
- 0.5 µl: dNTP mix (10 mM each)
- 0.4 µl: Primer-A (10 pmol/µl)
- 0.4 µl: Primer-B (10 pmol/µl)
- 0.2 µl: Taq Polymerase (5 U/µl)
- 2.0 µl: Sample

## B. Quality control of the method
- Positive control: Run for each PCR set to verify amplification; the control DNA should yield a clear band.
- Negative control: Run for each PCR set; reagents without DNA should show no band.
- QA/QC criteria:
  - The outcome is interpreted through a predefined mapping of control results (Positive/Negative controls) to Pass/Fail.
  - Examples: If controls behave as expected, the run passes; any contamination (unexpected bands in negative control) or absence/weak positive signal leads to a fail and re-running with corrected master mix. The protocol lists a specific 4-control outcome mapping (Positive Control 1–4 and Negative Control 1–4) to determine Pass or Fail.
