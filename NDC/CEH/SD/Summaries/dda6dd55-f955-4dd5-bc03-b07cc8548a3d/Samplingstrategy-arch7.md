# Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the sampling strategy and procedures for human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) in the AMR Transmission study across urban and rural Bangladesh.

## Study design and rounds
- Two sampling rounds:
  - Round 1 conducted in winter; Round 2 conducted in summer.
- Geographic scope and units:
  - Urban live poultry markets: 20 markets in Round 1, plus 20 new markets in Round 2 (total 40 markets in urban Dhaka).
  - Commercial poultry farms: 20 farms in Round 1, plus 20 new farms in Round 2 (total 40 farms).
  - Rural households: 20 households from 10 villages in Round 1, plus 20 more households from 10 villages in Round 2 (total 40 households).
- Individuals and exposures:
  - Urban markets: humans and live poultry; environmental samples around markets.
  - Farms: human participants (farm workers or nearby residents) and poultry; environmental samples downstream.
  - Rural villages: households with and without domestic poultry exposure; adult women primarily sampled; environmental and poultry-associated samples as applicable.

## Settings and sampling details
- Urban live poultry markets
  - Round 1: 20 markets; one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market; samples from human participants, municipal drinking water, solid waste sites, wastewater downstream of markets, live poultry cloacal samples, and poultry pen floors/surfaces.
  - Round 2: 20 additional markets following the same procedure.
  - Total: 40 markets sampled.
- Commercial poultry farms
  - Round 1: 20 farms; at least one farm worker per farm and a non-poultry-exposed adult from the same village as low-exposure group; samples from humans, drinking water, poultry caecal samples, mixed pen feces, and downstream wastewater/pond/canal/river water.
  - Round 2: 20 additional farms; total 40 farms.
- Rural villages
  - Round 1: 20 households from 10 villages; one high-exposure (owning poultry) and one low-exposure household per village; faecal samples from adult women; environmental samples from tubewell water, soil around the compound; poultry caecal samples and animal manure from poultry-owning households; downstream water bodies (freshwater ponds, wastewater, rivers).
  - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 more villages; total 40 households.
- General note
  - Some samples reflect shared facilities in markets (water, wastewater, and solid waste sites), resulting in one sample per market for those categories.

Note: For several water-related and waste-related categories, market settings followed a single-sample-per-market rule due to shared facilities.

## Sample collection procedures (high-level)
- General handling
  - All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12 to 24 hours.
- Soil
  - Select yard area with frequent movement; wear new gloves.
  - Collect ~20 g soil at ~0.5 inch depth; store in sterile bag on ice.
  - A portion to LifeGuard solution in an Eppendorf; keep on ice.
- Solid waste
  - Collect from three locations around market dustbins; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; use new gloves.
  - Keep sample in sterile bag; place on ice for transport.
- Waste water
  - Collect from three drain locations (approx. 150 ml each); pool into 500 ml sterile bottle.
  - Keep on ice for transport.
- River/pond/surface water
  - Sterile 500 ml bottle; plunge ~30 cm below surface; fill; seal tightly.
  - Keep on ice for transport.
- Tubewell water
  - Pump water for ~5 minutes; purge and collect 500 ml aseptically.
  - Bottle sealed and kept on ice.
- Tap water
  - Clean nozzle with 70% alcohol; run water to waste for 1 minute; flame sterilize outside; collect 500 ml, seal, keep on ice.
- Human stool
  - Provide container; collect within 2 hours of defecation; store on ice.
- Poultry pen litter
  - Collect from three areas; pool ~20 g; mix; remove sharp objects; store on ice.
- Animal manure
  - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon; store on ice.
- Poultry caecal samples
  - Randomly select chickens from slaughtered poultry; process caecal sample in the lab.

## Geospatial and environmental data
- GPS coordinates collected for downstream river sample locations.
- In-field measurements recorded: pH, temperature, and conductivity for river/pond samples.

## Data quality and practical notes
- The study involved iterative data collection across rounds to capture temporal and spatial variation.
- When facilities were shared (markets), sampling was adjusted to a single sample per site for certain water and waste categories.
