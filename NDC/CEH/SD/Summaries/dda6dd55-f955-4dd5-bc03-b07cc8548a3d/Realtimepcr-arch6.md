# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describes how PCR amplifies a targeted DNA sequence to generate many copies, enabling high-quality amplified products through careful sample prep and avoidance of contamination/denaturation.

- Safety
  - Apply universal precautions when performing PCR.
  - Maintain PCR hood regularly and record results in a dedicated file.

- A. Chemicals
  - 10X concentrated PCR reaction buffer
  - dNTPs
  - Primers (Forward and Reverse)
  - Taq polymerase
  - 70% Ethanol
  - 10% Sodium hypochlorite
  - Autoclaved filtered deionized water

- B. Equipment
  - PCR hood with UV light
  - Thermal cycler
  - Vortex
  - Rotor
  - Refrigerator (2–8°C)
  - Refrigerator (-20°C)

- C. Other Supplies
  - Parafilm
  - Micropipettes (100–1000 µl, 10–100 µl, 2–20 µl, 0.5–10 µl)
  - Pipette tips
  - Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, 200 µl)
  - Gloves
  - Ice
  - PCR racks
  - Glass markers

- A. PCR Protocol
  - 1) Set up all reaction mixtures in an area separate from DNA preparation or PCR product analysis.
  - 2) Prepare a 10 mM dNTP mix and store aliquots at -20°C.
  - 3) Thaw 10x PCR Buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
  - 4) Prepare a master mix (contains all components except template DNA) and include at least one negative control lacking template DNA to detect contamination.
  - 5) Mix master mix thoroughly and dispense into PCR tubes; mix gently by pipetting up/down.
  - 6) Add template DNA (2.0 µl) to each tube containing the master mix.
  - 7) Program the thermal cycler with the heated lid per manufacturer instructions.
  - 8) Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each template/primer pair. Typical program:
    - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
    - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 minute
    - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 minute
    - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
    - Cycles: 25–35
    - Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
    - Hold: 4°C
  - 9) Run tubes in the thermal cycler.
  - 10) After cycling, store tubes at 4°C for short-term or -20°C for long-term storage.

- Table 1 (Reaction composition using Taq polymerase)
  - 19.0 µl - Water (FDW)
  - 2.5 µl - PCR Buffer (10x) with MgCl2 (50 mM)
  - 0.5 µl - dNTPs (10 mM each)
  - 0.4 µl - Primer-A (10 pmol/µl)
  - 0.4 µl - Primer-B (10 pmol/µl)
  - 0.2 µl - Taq Polymerase (5 U/µl)
  - 2.0 µl - Template DNA

- B. Quality control of the method
  - Positive control
    - Included for each PCR sample set.
    - Use a control DNA that yields a visible band; dilute if needed to produce a clear, bright band.
  - Negative control
    - Included for each PCR sample set; contains all reagents except template DNA.
    - Should produce no band; presence of a band indicates contamination or QC failure.
  - QA/QC outcomes
    - Positive control results determine pass/fail: score pattern indicates Pass or Fail (examples include combinations where some positives out of multiple controls pass while others fail, signaling overall QC status).
    - Negative control results determine pass/fail: blanks should be negative; any band can indicate failure and necessitate re-running affected samples with a new master mix.
