# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose: Describes procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, stool, etc.) or bacterial isolates obtained in the study.
- Scope of methods: Uses Qiagen kit-based workflows for different sample types:
  - Soil: DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
  - Water: DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit
  - Stool: QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit
  - Template DNA preparation from cultured isolates
- General workflow concepts:
  - Lysis of cells and release of DNA
  - Binding of DNA to silica-based membranes or spin columns
  - Washing to remove inhibitors and impurities
  - Elution of purified DNA for downstream applications
  - Storage of extracted DNA at cold temperatures

## General Precautions
- Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves and observe universal precautions.
- Follow SDS/Emergency procedures for ingestion or exposure.
- Keep flammable reagents away from open flames or sparks.

## Kit and Extracted DNA storage
- Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) for long-term use.
- Store kit reagents/components at room temperature (15–30°C).

## DNA extraction from soil samples by DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit
- Equipment typically required: pipettors, microcentrifuge, vortex mixer, vortex adapter, and centrifuge capable of 10,000 x g.
- Key procedure highlights:
  - Add 0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tube; mix vigorously.
  - Prepare Solution C1 if precipitated; mix and proceed.
  - Perform bead-beating (vortex) and centrifugation steps to separate supernatant.
  - Sequentially add Solutions C2, C3, C4 with incubations and centrifugations to purify DNA.
  - Bind DNA to a spin filter, wash with Solutions C5 and proceed.
  - Elute with Solution C6 (or DNA-Free water) and collect DNA.
  - Final DNA is ready for downstream applications and should be stored cold.
- Post-extraction storage: Freeze DNA (-20°C to -80°C) recommended.

## DNA extraction from water samples by DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit
- Equipment and consumables: filter funnels, centrifuge for 15 ml tubes, filter membranes, pipettes, microcentrifuge, vortex, vortex adapter, vacuum system.
- Special precautions:
  - Warm Solution PW1 (55°C) to dissolve precipitates.
  - Warm PW3 if precipitated; mix PW4 before use.
- Key procedure highlights:
  - Filter water; assemble/prepare MB Bead Tube with beads.
  - Add PW1, bead-beat, and centrifuge to recover lysate.
  - Transfer supernatant and treat with IRS, PW3, and MB Spin Column with sequential loading.
  - Wash with PW4 and PW5; spin down to remove residual solutions.
  - Elute DNA with PW6; collect in fresh tube.
- Post-extraction storage: DNA stored frozen (-20°C to -80°C) recommended.

## DNA extraction from stool samples by QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit
- Procedure overview:
  - Weigh ~180–220 mg stool; homogenize in Buffer ASL; heat to 70°C; vortex and pellet solids.
  - Transfer supernatant; add InhibitEX to remove inhibitors; centrifuge to pellet inhibitors.
  - Bind lysate to QIAamp spin column; wash sequentially with AW1 and AW2.
  - Elute DNA with Buffer AE; collect in a new tube.
- Post-extraction storage: DNA stored frozen (-20°C to -80°C) recommended.

## Preparation of Template DNA
- From a cultured colony: suspend in autoclaved water; boil for 10 minutes; cool rapidly on ice.
- Centrifuge to pellet debris; collect supernatant (~200 µl) for template DNA.
- Store template DNA at cold storage (as per standard practice; typical guidance is -20°C).
