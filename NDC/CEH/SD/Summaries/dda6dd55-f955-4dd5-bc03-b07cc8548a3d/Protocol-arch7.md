# Antibiotic susceptibility tests and resistance genes in Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Overview
- Protocol for studying antibiotic resistance in Escherichia coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems.
- Susceptibility testing and resistance gene detection conducted in human, poultry, and environmental samples.
- Data collected across rural households, small-scale poultry farms, and urban markets in Bangladesh; ethical approval obtained.

## Study Design and Settings
- Settings:
  - Rural households
  - Small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city
- Timeframe:
  - Data collection rounds in winter (February–April 2017) and summer (August–October 2017)
  - Water supply samples from farms/markets collected in October 2018
- Participants and samples:
  - Bacterial isolates identified as resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems
  - Sources: healthy adults (fecal samples), poultry (caecal samples), and environmental samples (water, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces)
- Consent and ethics:
  - Written informed consent obtained; right to withdraw
  - Ethical approvals: icddr,b PR16071; Loughborough University R17-P037

## Sample Collection
- Conducted by trained researchers from icddr,b
- Sample types and origins mapped to the three study settings above

## Laboratory Analyses
- Antibiotic susceptibility testing:
  - Disk diffusion method; zone of inhibition measured in millimeters
  - Interpretations: susceptible, intermediate, or resistant per CLSI guidelines (M100S, 2016)
- Resistance gene detection:
  - Real-time PCR to test for known antibiotic resistance genes
- Additional procedures and SOPs:
  - Standard operating procedures for susceptibility testing, DNA extraction, and PCR provided in supporting documentation

## Data and Quality Control
- Data capture:
  - Primary data recorded on paper or automatically output from equipment; later entered into Excel
- Quality checks:
  - Random checks against original data sheets
  - Frequency/consistency checks to identify out-of-range values and corrections
- Researchers:
  - Analyses conducted by trained, experienced staff at icddr,b

## Data Structure
- Dataset file: Ecoliastgenes.csv
- Notation:
  - "Not done" indicates a resistance-positive isolate was not tested for a particular gene
- Supporting documentation (included in the project):
  - Samplingstrategy.rtf
  - Microbiology.rtf
  - Dnaextraction.rtf
  - Realtimepcr.rtf
  - Susceptibility.rtf
  - VariablelistASTgenes.csv

## Ethics and Data Availability
- Ethical clearances obtained from participating institutions
- Consent procedures described; withdrawal rights preserved

## Potential GIS Applications and Considerations
- Spatial mapping of antibiotic resistance patterns across humans, poultry, and environmental sources
- Integration with environmental layers (water sources, soils, markets) and infrastructure data (households, farms)
- Temporal analysis across rounds (2017) and seasonal trends
- Data standardization challenges:
  - Multiple sample types and resolutions
  - Mapping “Not done” cases appropriately
- Data quality and metadata need to be maintained for reliable spatial analyses
- Use cases:
  - Track transmission and hotspots of resistance
  - Inform policy and intervention strategies at household, farm, and market levels
