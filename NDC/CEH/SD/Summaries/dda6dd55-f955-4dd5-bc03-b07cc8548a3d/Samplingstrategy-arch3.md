# Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh

- Purpose
  - Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human faecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) to study AMR transmission from environment to humans.
  - Settings: urban live poultry markets, commercial poultry farms, rural households with domestic poultry.
  - Study conducted in two rounds to capture seasonal variation (Round 1 in winter; Round 2 in summer).

- Study design overview
  - Multisite, cross-environment sampling conducted in three settings to assess AMR dynamics across human, animal, and environmental reservoirs.
  - Each round repeated across the three settings to build a comparative dataset over time.

- Sampling settings and rounds
  - Urban poultry markets
    - Round 1: 20 markets randomly selected; one live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market; samples from human participants, market water supply, wastewater from drains downstream of markets, poultry cloacal swabs, and floors/pen surfaces.
    - Round 2: 20 additional markets; identical procedures, total 40 markets across rounds.
  - Commercial poultry farms
    - Round 1: 20 small-to-medium broiler farms; at least one farm worker per farm; one rural high- and one low-exposure human participant per farm; samples from humans, drinking water, poultry caecal samples, mixed pen feces, downstream wastewater, pond/canal water, and downstream river water.
    - Round 2: 20 additional farms; total 40 farms across rounds.
  - Rural villages
    - Round 1: 20 households (10 villages; two per village: high exposure with poultry and low exposure without poultry); samples from adult women, tubewell water, household soil, poultry caecal (for poultry-owning households), animal manure; downstream pond, wastewater, and river water samples.
    - Round 2: 20 additional households from 10 new villages; total 40 households across rounds.

- Sample types and exposure groups (summary)
  - Human samples: faecal samples collected from adults in all settings; in markets and farms, participants included workers and nearby residents.
  - Poultry samples: cloacal swabs and poultry pen litter from birds; poultry caecal samples from slaughtered chickens (farm and market contexts).
  - Environmental samples: drinking water (market tubewell/household), general water supplies, downstream wastewater, pond/river water, soil from household compounds, animal manure, solid waste from market dumps, and poultry pen environments.
  - Exposure design: high exposure (with poultry exposure) vs. low exposure (without poultry) across rural households; explicit high/low exposure delineations in farms and markets via participant roles and facility types.

- Sampling plan and procedures (general approach)
  - Two rounds with the same data collection process, Round 2 replicating Round 1 workflow to enable temporal comparison.
  - All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12–24 hours of collection.
  - Geographic and environmental metadata collected where relevant:
    - GPS coordinates for downstream river sampling locations.
    - Measurements of pH, temperature, and conductivity for river-related samples.

- Field collection procedures by sample type (highlights)
  - Human stool samples: collected from participants within 2 hours of collection; stored on ice.
  - Poultry cloacal samples: collected from live birds; sourced in market and farm settings.
  - Poultry pen litter: collected from three different floor areas; pooled and mixed; stored on ice.
  - Animal manure: ~20 g collected with sterile tools; stored on ice.
  - Soil from compound: ~20 g collected from high-traffic area near dwelling; sterile handling; preservation for a portion.
  - Solid waste: pooled ~20 g from three locations around market dustbins; sterile handling and cool transport.
  - Wastewater: ~150 ml from three drain locations; pooled into a 500 ml sterile bottle; cool transport.
  - Water samples (pond/surface water and supply/tubewell): sterile collection procedures; 500 ml bottles; cool transport; specific steps for tubewell and tap water to ensure sample integrity.
  - Supply water/tubewell water: pump-out procedure described (5 minutes pumping, decontamination steps, collect 500 ml aseptically).
  - Tap water: flush procedure before sampling; sterile collection and transport.
  - Poultry caecal samples: collected from slaughtered birds; caecal tissue processed in the lab.
  - Note: Some samples are marked with exposure-specific applicability (e.g., certain matrices shared across markets; some sample types not applicable in certain contexts).

- Laboratory processing and quality considerations
  - All samples kept on ice during transport and delivered to the lab for processing within defined timeframes (12–24 hours, depending on sample type).
  - Data and metadata logged (e.g., GPS, environmental measurements) to support downstream analysis and data governance.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a comprehensive, multi-environment sampling framework designed to monitor AMR transmission pathways between the environment and humans.
  - Integrates temporal (two rounds) and spatial (urban markets, farms, rural households) dimensions to inform policy decisions and future monitoring needs.
  - Highlights practical data quality considerations: timely transport, standardized collection procedures, preservation methods, and collection of contextual metadata (GPS, pH, temperature, conductivity).
  - Addresses data accessibility and traceability through explicit documentation of collection sites, sampling plans, and laboratory processing timelines, aligning with data governance and transparency principles.
