# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- Describe procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates obtained in the study.
- Identify the kits and methods used to obtain DNA suitable for downstream analyses.

## Protocols and scope
- DNA extraction from soil samples using DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Catalog No. 12888-50).
- DNA extraction from water samples using DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Catalog No. 14900-5-NF).
- DNA extraction from stool samples using QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen; Catalog No. 51504).
- Preparation of template DNA from cultured organisms (boiling method).

## Equipment and reagents (highlights)
- General lab equipment: pipettors, microcentrifuge, vortex mixer (including Vortex GenIE with adapter), spin filters, collection tubes.
- Kits and solutions: PowerSoil C1–C6 reagents, PowerWater reagents PW1–PW6, QIAamp DNA Stool Kit components, buffers AW1/AW2/AE, etc.
- Safety: use gloves, avoid skin contact with reagents, follow MSDS for emergencies; keep flammable reagents away from flames.
- Storage: extracted DNA is recommended to be stored frozen (-20°C to -80°C); kit reagents typically stored at room temperature or as specified.

## Safety precautions
- Wear gloves and follow universal precautions during the procedures.
- Avoid skin contact with reagents; in case of contact, wash with water.
- Refer to Material Safety Data Sheets for emergency procedures.
- Keep flammable reagents away from open flames and sparks.

## DNA extraction from soil (PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit)
- Sample: add 0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tube.
- Pre-treatment: check Solution C1; heat to dissolve precipitate if needed; add C1.
- Mechanical disruption: vortex at max speed for 10 minutes with PowerBead Tubes secured.
- Centrifugation: 10,000 x g for 30 seconds; collect supernatant.
- Sequential chemical steps: add C2, incubate at 4°C, centrifuge; transfer supernatant (≤ 600 µl); add C3 and repeat; add C4, vortex; proceed through spins and filtrations with C5, then centrifugation steps.
- Final bindings and elution: bind DNA on Spin Filter with C4/C5 steps as indicated; elute with C6 or water.
- Final step: store extracted DNA frozen (-20° to -80°C).
- Notes: avoid pellet carryover; ensure spin filter assembly is properly seated.

## DNA extraction from water (PowerWater Kit)
- Filtration: filter water through appropriate funnel/filter setup.
- Bead tube preparation: transfer filter into PowerWater Bead Tube with 1 ml Solution PW1; vortex and centrifuge as specified (≤ 4000 x g).
- Supernatant processing: transfer supernatant, add PW1/PW3 as directed, centrifuge and recover supernatant.
- Binding and washing: apply lysate to MB Spin Column; wash with PW4 and PW5; perform additional centrifugation steps to remove residual liquid.
- Elution: add PW6 or sterile water to elute DNA.
- Final step: store DNA frozen (-20° to -80°C).
- Notes: warm PW1 and PW3 if precipitates form; mix PW4 before use.

## DNA extraction from stool (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
- Sample prep: weigh 180–220 mg stool; add Buffer ASL; homogenize vigorously; heat 70°C for 5 min; centrifuge to pellet solids.
- Inhibitor removal: transfer supernatant; add InhibitEX tablet; vortex and incubate to bind inhibitors; centrifuge to pellet.
- Lysis: transfer supernatant; add proteinase K; add Buffer AL; mix thoroughly; incubate at 70°C.
- Precipitate inhibitors and lysate handling: add ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; centrifuge to pass through.
- Column washing: wash with AW1 and AW2 as specified; optionally transfer to new collection tube.
- Elution: elute DNA with Buffer AE (or equivalent) directly onto membrane; centrifuge to elute.
- Final step: store DNA frozen (-20° to -80°C).

## Preparation of Template DNA
- From culture: transfer one loopful to 500 µl autoclaved dH2O; boil for 10 minutes; cool on ice for 5–10 minutes.
- Clarification: centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 5 minutes; collect ~200 µl supernatant.
- Storage: store template DNA at -200°C for later use.

## Outputs and downstream use
- DNA suitable for downstream molecular analyses.
- All DNA should be stored frozen to preserve integrity.

## Notes and references
- Special notes include handling precipitates in PW1/PW3, and careful handling to avoid contamination.
