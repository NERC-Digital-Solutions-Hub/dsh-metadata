# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describes a PCR protocol to amplify a targeted DNA sequence, emphasizing contamination avoidance, prevention of template denaturation, and generation of high-quality amplified products.

- Safety and housekeeping
  - Universal precautions for PCR.
  - Regular maintenance of the PCR hood; results recorded in a dedicated file.

- Reagents (chemicals)
  - 10× PCR reaction buffer
  - dNTPs
  - Forward and reverse primers
  - Taq polymerase
  - 70% ethanol
  - 10% sodium hypochlorite
  - Autoclaved filtered deionized water

- Equipment
  - PCR hood with UV light
  - Thermal cycler
  - Vortex
  - Rotor
  - Refrigerators (2–8°C and -20°C)

- Other supplies
  - Parafilm, micropipettes and tips, microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, 200 µl), gloves, ice, PCR racks, glass marker

- PCR protocol (key steps)
  - Prepare reaction mixtures in a area separate from DNA prep and PCR product analysis.
  - Make a 10 mM dNTP mix and store aliquots at -20°C; thaw 10× PCR buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
  - Prepare a master mix containing all components except template DNA; include at least one negative control in every setup.
  - Dispense master mix into tubes; add template DNA (2.0 µl) to each tube.
  - Program the thermal cycler with appropriate heated-lid settings per manufacturer instructions.
  - Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each new template/primer pair.
  - Typical cycling program:
    - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
    - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 minute
    - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 minute
    - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
    - Number of cycles: 25–35
    - Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
    - Hold: 4°C
  - After cycling, store tubes at 4°C for short-term or -20°C for long-term storage.

- Master mix composition (illustrative)
  - Water, 10× PCR buffer with MgCl2, 10 mM dNTPs, Forward primer, Reverse primer, Taq polymerase, and the Template DNA added separately per reaction.

- Quality control (QA/QC)
  - Include a Negative Control (no DNA) for each PCR set; it should yield no band.
  - Include a Positive Control (known DNA) for each set; it should yield a clear band.
  - If controls fail (e.g., unexpected bands or no bands), the gel fails QA/QC and affected samples must be redone.
  - Positive controls should provide a clear, detectable band; if necessary, dilute control DNA to achieve an appropriate intensity.
  - The overall QA/QC decision is based on the expected outcomes of both controls: passing controls indicate a pass; failures indicate a fail and require remediation.

- Storage and data handling
  - Completed samples can be stored in the 4°C fridge or -20°C freezer for longer-term storage.
  - Procedures imply careful recording of results and conditions to support reproducibility and data integrity.
