# Antibiotic susceptibility tests and resistance genes in Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Objective and scope
- Investigates E. coli isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems across human, poultry, and environmental sources.
- Aims to determine antibiotic susceptibility profiles and the presence of known resistance genes using real-time PCR.
- Samples collected from healthy humans (faecal), poultry (caecal), and environmental sources (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, solid waste, poultry litter/faeces; cattle manure when available).
- Settings include rural households, small-scale commercial poultry farms in Mirzapur, Tangail district, and urban markets in Dhaka, Bangladesh.
- Ethical considerations: informed consent obtained; participants can withdraw; ethical approvals from icddr,b and Loughborough University.

## Experimental design and timeline
- Data collection rounds:
  - Winter 2017: February–April
  - Summer 2017: August–October
  - Water samples from farms/urban markets: October 2018
- Data collection conducted by trained researchers from icddr,b.
- No formal sample size calculation; no expected size effects.

## Methods and laboratory analyses
- Isolation: Bacteria identified as resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems through microbiological analysis.
- Phenotypic testing: Antibiotic susceptibility via disk diffusion; zone diameters (mm) measured and categorized as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant according to CLSI guidelines (M100S, 2016).
- Genotypic testing: DNA extracted from resistant isolates; real-time PCR performed to detect known resistance genes.
- Standard operating procedures (SOPs) for susceptibility testing, DNA extraction, and PCR are provided in the supporting documentation.
- Laboratory work conducted by trained staff at the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b.

## Data collection, processing, and quality control
- Data capture: either paper data sheets or automated outputs from lab equipment; paper records entered into Excel by an experienced data manager.
- Quality checks:
  - Random checks comparing paper sheets to entered data by an independent researcher.
  - Frequency checks to identify and correct out-of-range or erroneous values.
- Data handling environment: single dataset file named Ecoliastgenes.csv.
- Notation: "Not done" indicates a gene was not tested because the isolate did not show resistance to the relevant antibiotic.

## Data structure and documentation
- Primary dataset: Ecoliastgenes.csv.

- References and standards:
  - CLSI, Performance Standards for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing, M100S (2016).
  - WHO global foodborne infections network SOP for susceptibility testing of Enterobacteriaceae using disk diffusion.

## Ethical and logistical considerations
- Written informed consent obtained from participants; right to withdraw at any time.
- Ethical clearances secured from icddr,b (PR16071) and Loughborough University (R17-P037).
- Data collection executed by trained personnel to ensure consistency across human, poultry, and environmental samples.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and data use
- Uses standardized methods (disk diffusion, CLSI guidelines) to generate comparable susceptibility data across multiple reservoirs (humans, animals, environment).
- Integrates phenotypic susceptibility with genotypic resistance profiles to support monitoring of antimicrobial resistance trends.
- Produces a structured, QA-backed dataset suitable for storage, tracking, and potential integration into monitoring portals or dashboards.
