# Antibiotic susceptibility tests and resistance genes in Escherichia coli bacteria from humans, poultry and environmental samples: protocol

## Aim
- Identify E. coli isolates resistant to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems from humans, poultry, and environmental samples.
- Test susceptibility of these resistant isolates to various antibiotic classes.
- Detect known antibiotic resistance genes using real-time PCR.

## Study setting and data collection rounds
- Data collected in three settings:
  - Rural households
  - Small-scale commercial poultry farms (broiler chickens) in Mirzapur, Tangail district
  - Urban food markets in Dhaka city, Bangladesh
- Collection rounds:
  - Round 1: February–April 2017
  - Round 2: August–October 2017
  - Additional water-supply samples: October 2018
- Data collection performed by trained researchers from icddr,b.

## Sample collection
- Bacterial samples from resistant E. coli identified by microbiological analysis.
- Sources:
  - Humans: healthy adults (via fecal samples)
  - Poultry: caecal samples from poultry GI tract
  - Environment: water supply, wastewater, surface water (ponds, rivers), soil, solid waste, poultry litter/feces
  - Rural households also included cattle feces/manure where available

## Laboratory analyses
- Initial selection: isolates with resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and carbapenems confirmed by microbiological culture.
- Antibiotic susceptibility testing:
  - Disk diffusion method; measure zone of inhibition (mm).
  - Classify as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant per CLSI guidelines (2016 supplement M100S).
- Molecular analyses:
  - DNA extraction from resistant isolates.
  - Real-time PCR to test for presence of known antibiotic resistance genes.
- Procedures:
  - Standard operating procedures provided in supporting documentation.
  - Analyses conducted by trained staff at the Food and Enteric Microbiology Laboratory, icddr,b.

## Quality control and data management
- Data collection:
  - Recorded on paper forms or automatically by lab equipment, then entered into Excel.
  - Paper records independently digitized by an experienced data manager.
- Quality checks:
  - Random checks against original data sheets by an independent researcher.
  - Frequency checks to identify out-of-range or erroneous values, followed by corrections.

## Data structure and documentation
- Main dataset: Ecoliastgenes.csv
  - Note: 'Not done' indicates a test was not performed because the isolate did not show resistance to the relevant antibiotic.
