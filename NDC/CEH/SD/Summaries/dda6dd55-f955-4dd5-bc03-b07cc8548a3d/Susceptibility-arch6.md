# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing
NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describes the procedure for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from the study.
  - Information captured supports data generation for quality-controlled analysis and downstream data products.

- Equipment
  - Incubator (35±2°C)
  - Weighing balance
  - Water bath (45-50°C)
  - Biosafety cabinet
  - Vortex mixer

- Medium/reagents
  - Sterile saline (0.85%), 3-4 mL per tube
  - Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates, ~4 mm agar depth
  - 70% alcohol

- Other supplies
  - Antibiotic discs
  - Inoculating loop, sterile cotton swab
  - Gas burner, sterile Petri dishes
  - Label pen, sterile needle, ruler
  - MacFarland 0.5 standard

- Quality control strains
  - Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems)
  - Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations)

- Procedures (summary)
  - Record sample details on the media plate (Lab ID, sample type, organism name).
  - Inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies into sterile saline; emulsify to avoid clumping.
  - Adjust inoculum turbidity to 0.5 McFarland using nephelometer or standard reference.
  - Within 15 minutes, inoculate a sterile swab from the prepared suspension.
  - Streak the MHA plate in three passes with rotation (60° each) and along the rim to ensure even coverage.
  - Allow excess surface moisture to be absorbed before applying discs (lid may be ajar 3–5 minutes; max 15 minutes).
  - Place antibiotic discs onto the agar with a sterile needle; apply gentle pressure to ensure contact.
  - Do not relocate discs after contact; perform all steps under a biosafety cabinet.
  - Do not place more than 6 discs on a 90 mm plate; space discs evenly.
  - Invert plates and incubate at 35±2°C for 18–24 hours.

- Quality control (QC)
  - Verify culture media quality per sterility/quality manuals.
  - Use ATCC reference strains to check susceptibility method.
  - Ensure QC results fall within CLSI-specified ranges.
  - If QC fails, do not report test results; follow CLSI troubleshooting guidelines.

- Interpretation and reporting results
  - After 18–24 hours, measure zones of inhibition in millimeters across the plate.
  - Record zone diameters on worksheets.
  - Classify results as Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
  - Result verification by Laboratory Supervisor prior to reporting.

- Data-focused notes for the Data Support perspective
  - Key data outputs include: Lab ID, sample type, organism name, inoculum standard (0.5 McFarland), zone diameters (mm) for each antibiotic disc, S/I/R interpretation, QC results, and supervisor verification status.
  - Data quality hinges on standardized inoculum, consistent disc placement, controlled incubation conditions, precise measurement, and strict adherence to CLSI guidelines.
  - The structured data enable downstream analytics, dashboards, and surveillance reporting, while QC tracking supports data integrity and reproducibility.
