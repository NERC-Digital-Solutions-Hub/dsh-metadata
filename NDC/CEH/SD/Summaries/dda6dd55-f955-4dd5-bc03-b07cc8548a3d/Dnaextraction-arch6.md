DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Objective
- Describe procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water) and bacterial isolates, including stool samples, and preparing template DNA for downstream applications.

## General precautions and storage
- Wear gloves, avoid skin contact with reagents; consult MSDS for emergencies; keep flammable reagents away from flames.
- Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) when not in use.
- Store kit reagents at room temperature (15–30°C) unless specified otherwise.
- Special notes:
  - PowerSoil: Check Solution C1; if precipitated, heat to 60°C to dissolve.
  - PowerWater: Warm PW1 and PW3 to dissolve precipitates as needed; PW3 may precipitate and can be warmed to dissolve.
- Equipment broadly required: pipettors, microcentrifuges, vortexers with adapters, spin filters, and specific kit components (PowerBead tubes, spin columns, and solutions C1–C6 for PowerSoil; PW1–PW6 for PowerWater).

## DNA extraction from soil samples (PowerSoil Kit)
- Kit: DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 12888-50)
- Procedure highlights:
  - Add 0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tube; vortex.
  - Ensure Solution C1; if precipitated, heat to 60°C.
  - Add C1, vortex; secure tubes and vortex at max speed for 10 minutes.
  - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s; transfer supernatant to clean tube.
  - Add C2, vortex; incubate at 4°C; centrifuge; transfer up to 600 μl.
  - Add C3, vortex; incubate at 4°C; centrifuge; transfer up to 750 μl.
  - Add C4, mix; bind with Spin Filter using successive loads (675 μl portions) at 10,000 x g.
  - Wash with C5; dry spin.
  - Elute with C6 (or sterile water) onto filter; centrifuge to elute.
  - Final: store DNA frozen (-20° to -80°C).
- Output: DNA ready for downstream applications.

## DNA extraction from water samples (PowerWater Kit)
- Kit: DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 14900-5-NF)
- Equipment: filter funnels, centrifuge for ≤4000 x g, MB Spin Column components, vortex, and PowerWater Bead Tube.
- Special precautions: PW1 warm at 55°C to dissolve; PW3 may precipitate and warm similarly; PW4 should be shaken before use.
- Procedure highlights:
  - Filter water samples; prepare filter for bead disruption; place in PowerWater Bead Tube with PW1; vortex; centrifuge ≤4000 x g; collect supernatant.
  - Centrifuge supernatant to pellet beads; transfer supernatant; add IRS, PW3, load onto MB Spin Column; centrifuge; repeat until all supernatant processed.
  - Bind, wash with PW4 and PW5; dry spin to remove residual liquid.
  - Elute with PW6; collect DNA.
  - Output: DNA ready for downstream applications; store DNA frozen.

## DNA extraction from stool samples (QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit)
- Kit: QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen; Cat. No. 51504)
- Procedure highlights:
  - Weigh 180–220 mg stool; add Buffer ASL; vortex thoroughly; heat at 70°C for 5 min; vortex and pellet debris.
  - Transfer supernatant; add InhibitEX Tablet; vortex; incubate to bind inhibitors; centrifuge to pellet inhibitors.
  - Transfer supernatant; add Proteinase K; add Buffer AL; mix; incubate at 70°C for 10 min; add ethanol; mix.
  - Apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; centrifuge to bind; discard flow-through; repeat binding.
  - Add AW1, centrifuge; add AW2, centrifuge; optional final spin for dryness.
  - Elute with Buffer AE to collect DNA.
  - Output: DNA ready for downstream applications; store frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

## Preparation of Template DNA
- From a cultured organism on TSA:
  - Transfer 1 loopful to 500 μl autoclaved water; vortex; boil 10 minutes; cool on ice 5–10 minutes.
  - Centrifuge at 6,000 x g for 5 minutes; collect ~200 μl supernatant.
  - Store template DNA at -200°C freezer (as stated in the document).
