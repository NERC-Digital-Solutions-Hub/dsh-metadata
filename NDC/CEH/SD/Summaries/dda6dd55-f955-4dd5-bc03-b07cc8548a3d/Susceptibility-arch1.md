# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

## Purpose
- Describe the procedure for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from this study.

## Equipment
- Incubator (35 ± 2°C)
- Weighing balance
- Water bath (45–50°C)
- Biosafety cabinet
- Vortex machine

## Medium/reagents
- Sterile saline solution (0.85%), 3–4 mL per tube
- Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates with ~4 mm uniform depth
- 70% alcohol

## Other Supplies
- Antibiotic discs
- Inoculating loop
- Sterile cotton swab
- Gas burner
- Sterile petri dishes
- Label pen
- Sterile needle
- Ruler
- MacFarland 0.5 standard

## Quality control strain
- Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems)
- Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations)

## Procedures
1. Record sample details on the media plate: Lab ID, sample type, and organism name.
2. Inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies from the agar plates into a tube of normal saline using a sterile loop; emulsify to avoid clumping.
3. Compare turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard using a nephelometer or a marked paper, and adjust inoculum to the standard.
4. Within 15 minutes of preparing the adjusted inoculum, dip a sterile cotton swab into the inoculum; rotate and press firmly on the inside wall to remove excess liquid.
5. Streak the swab over the entire surface of the MHA plate; rotate the plate ~60°, repeat streaking, rotate 60° again, and streak for a third time; inoculate around the rim.
6. Allow excess moisture to be absorbed before applying discs; the lid may be left ajar for 3–5 minutes (no more than 15 minutes).
7. Place antibiotic discs onto the agar with a sterile needle.
8. Apply gentle pressure to ensure disc–agar contact.
9. Do not relocate a disc once in contact; diffusion begins instantly. Carry out all steps (inoculum prep to disc application) under a biosafety cabinet.
10. Do not place more than 6 discs on a single 90 mm plate; space evenly.
11. Invert plates and incubate at 35 ± 2°C for 18–24 hours.

## Quality Control (QC)
- Ensure media sterility and quality per the CLSI-recommended sterility controls.
- Use ATCC reference organisms to verify susceptibility testing procedure.
- Confirm QC results fall within CLSI-specified ranges.
- If QC results are out of range, do not report test results and follow CLSI troubleshooting guidelines.

## Interpretation and reporting results
- After 18–24 hours, measure zones of inhibition with a ruler; record diameters in millimeters.
- Transcribe results to categories: Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
- Laboratory Supervisor reviews and verifies results before reporting.
