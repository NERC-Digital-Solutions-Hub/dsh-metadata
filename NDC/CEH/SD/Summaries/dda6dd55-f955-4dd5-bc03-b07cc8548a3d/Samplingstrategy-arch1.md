# Sampling plan and procedure for sample collection NERC study NE/N019555/1

## Aim
- Describe the sampling strategy and procedures for collecting human fecal, poultry caecal, and environmental samples (water supply, wastewater, surface water, soil, animal manure, poultry pen litter) to study the Spatial and Temporal Dynamics of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) Transmission from the Outdoor Environment to Humans in Urban and Rural Bangladesh.

## Study settings and rounds
- Two rounds of data collection: Round 1 in winter, Round 2 in summer.
- Sampling settings:
  - Urban live poultry markets (Dhaka metropolitan area)
  - Commercial poultry farms
  - Rural households with domestic poultry

## Sampling frames and participants
- Urban markets: 20 markets in Round 1; 20 additional markets in Round 2; total 40 markets. One live poultry stall holder and one fruit/vegetable stall holder per market. Samples collected from human participants, municipal water supply, solid waste disposal sites, and downstream wastewater; poultry cloacal samples and poultry pen surfaces.
- Commercial poultry farms: 20 farms in Round 1; 20 additional farms in Round 2; total 40 farms. One farm worker per farm and a low-exposure rural resident from the same village. Samples include human feces, drinking water, poultry caeca, mixed pen feces, and downstream wastewater, pond/canal water, and downstream river water.
- Rural villages: 20 households per round (10 villages; 2 households per village). High exposure: poultry-owning households; Low exposure: non-poultry households. Adult women sampled for stool; environmental samples from tubewell water, household soil, poultry caecal samples (where applicable), and animal manure; downstream water bodies sampled. Round 2 adds 20 more households from new villages (total 40 households).

## Sample types and exposure categories
- Human fecal samples: urban markets, farms, rural high/low exposure groups.
- Poultry samples: cloacal swabs, poultry pen litter (farm/market environments).
- Environmental and water samples: 
  - Water supply (drinking water, tubewell water, tap water)
  - Wastewater
  - Pond water, river water, downstream river water
  - Soil from household compounds
  - Animal manure
- Exposure categories: high exposure (with poultry or direct poultry-related environments) vs low exposure (without poultry or non-farm workers).

## Sampling procedures by type
- General handling
  - All samples transported on ice and processed in the laboratory within 12–24 hours.
  - Field data recorded where applicable (GPS coordinates for downstream river samples; pH, temperature, conductivity).
- Soil samples
  - Choose a high-traffic yard area (e.g., near kitchen/front door).
  - Use new gloves; autoclaved spoon; collect ~0.5 inch depth, ~20 g soil.
  - Store on ice; sub-sample into LifeGuard solution and keep on ice.
- Solid waste samples
  - Collect from three locations around market waste bins; ~20 g pooled.
  - Use new gloves; pool thoroughly; avoid sharp objects; cool transport.
- Wastewater samples
  - Collect ~150 ml from three drain locations per point; pool into 500 ml sterile bottle; keep cool and transport.
- River/pond/surface water samples
  - Collect 500 ml by plunging sterile bottle ~30 cm below surface; seal tightly; cool and transport.
- Water supply samples
  - Tubewell water: pump for 5 minutes, heat pump mouth, pump several gallons to waste.
  - Collect 500 ml aseptically directly into sterile bottle; seal and cool.
  - Tap water: run tap for 1 minute to waste; sterilize outside nozzle with flame; collect 500 ml; seal and cool.
- Human stool samples
  - Provide container; collect from participant within 2 hours; store on ice.
- Poultry pen litter
  - Collect from three different areas of the floor; pool ~20 g; mix thoroughly; store on ice.
- Animal manure
  - Collect ~20 g fresh manure with sterile spoon; store on ice.
- Poultry caecal samples
  - Randomly select slaughtered chickens; collect caecal sample from whole freshly slaughtered carcasses; transport in sterile conditions to laboratory.

## Data management and notes
- Documentation references: NERC study NE/N019555/1.
- Some facilities (water supply, wastewater, solid waste) are shared within markets; only one sample per market collected for those facilities.
- All samples accompanied by appropriate labeling and transport protocols to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
