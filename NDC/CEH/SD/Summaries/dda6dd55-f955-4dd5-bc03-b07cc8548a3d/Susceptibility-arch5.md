# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose and scope
- Describes the procedure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from the study.
- Defines the equipment, reagents, and procedures required to generate standardized AST data.
- Specifies quality control (QC) measures and interpretation of results per established guidelines.

## Data and metadata requirements
- Data collected/per recorded items:
  - Lab ID, sample type, and organism name (on the media plate).
  - Inoculum details: number of colonies used, preparation in sterile saline, and turbidity matching to 0.5 McFarland standard.
  - Plate and assay details: Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plate parameters (depth ~4 mm), disc placement, number of discs per plate (max 6 on a 90 mm plate), disc identities, and contact verification.
  - Incubation conditions: 35±2°C for 18–24 hours.
  - Zone of inhibition diameters in millimeters (measured with a ruler from edge to edge through the disk center).
  - Final interpretation: Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
  - Quality control data: QC strain identities, results, and verification against CLSI ranges.
  - Supervisor verification of final results.
- Metadata standards referenced: CLSI M100S guidelines; WHO SOP for susceptibility testing of Enterobacteriaceae using disk diffusion.

## Procedure and data capture workflow
- Record sample details on the plate before testing.
- Prepare inoculum: select 4–5 well-isolated colonies, emulsify in sterile saline to create a uniform suspension.
- Standardize inoculum turbidity to 0.5 McFarland.
- Use a sterile cotton swab to inoculate the MHA plate in multiple passes to achieve even coverage; allow surface moisture to be absorbed.
- Apply antimicrobial discs after surface drying (up to 15 minutes to absorb moisture; 3–5 minutes recommended).
- Place discs strategically (no more than six per plate) and apply gentle pressure to ensure contact.
- Do not move any disc after contact; all steps from inoculum to disc application occur under biosafety cabinet.
- Incubate inverted plates at 35±2°C for 18–24 hours.
- Measure zones and record diameters; interpret results according to CLSI guidelines.
- Document and verify by Laboratory Supervisor before reporting.

## Quality control and assurance
- Perform QC using standard reference organisms (ATCC strains) per CLSI-recommended ranges.
- If QC results are out of range, do not report sample results; troubleshoot per CLSI guidelines before proceeding.
- Ensure media sterility and consistency using laboratory SOPs and CLSI guidance.

## Interpretation and reporting
- After incubation, measure zones and record millimeter diameters.
- Convert measurements to categorical results (S/I/R) per CLSI criteria.
- Final results are verified by the Laboratory Supervisor prior to reporting.

## Data governance, storage, and accessibility
- Data generated should be uploaded to relevant data portals and catalogued in dataset holdings.
- Maintain documentation of the testing procedure, including any deviations or troubleshooting steps.
- Ensure traceability to the specific reference strains used for QC and to the CLSI guidelines applied.
- Support potential data updates or embargoes by maintaining a versioned record of results and methods.

## Key data artifacts and fields (summary)
- Sample and plate identifiers (Lab ID, sample type, organism).
- Inoculum parameters (colony count, saline suspension, 0.5 McFarland standard).
- Plate conditions (MHA depth, disc count per plate).
- Disc information (disc identity, placement, contact verification).
- Zone diameters (mm) and interpretation (S/I/R).
- QC strains and results (ATCC strains and acceptable ranges).
- Guideline reference (CLSI M100S, WHO SOP).
- Supervisor verification status.

## Challenges and considerations for Data Stewards
- Incomplete or inconsistent recording of user needs and metadata depth.
- Timely acquisition of data from various sources and systems.
- Ensuring metadata standards are consistently applied across different labs or formats.
- Managing data from large numbers of plates/discs and potential transfer bottlenecks.
- Keeping up-to-date with evolving CLSI guidelines and ensuring proper versioning in datasets.
