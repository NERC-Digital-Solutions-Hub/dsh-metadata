# Procedure for enumeration, isolation, preservation and identification of E. coli isolates NERC project NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describe the enumeration, isolation, preservation, and identification of E. coli isolates resistant to third generation cephalosporin or carbapenem from study samples.

- Materials and equipment (highlights)
  - Buffers and media: PBS (10× and 1×), Cefotaxime, Meropenem, TBX, CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, MacConkey, Tryptone soy broth with 30% glycerol, LifeGuard Soil Preservation solution, Oxidase reagent
  - Lab vessels and tools: sterile Petri dishes, test tubes, cryovials, inoculation loop, filter papers
  - Equipment: refrigerator (2–8 °C), freezer (-20 °C / -80 °C), autoclave, water bath (40–100 °C), incubator (36 ± 2 °C), shaker

- Media preparation (key steps)
  - 1 L 10× PBS: dissolve salts in 800 mL water, adjust pH to 7.4, bring to 1 L; autoclave 121 °C 15 min; to 1× PBS, add 100 mL of 10× PBS to 900 mL water
  - 1 L CHROMagar ESBL and 1 L CHROMagar KPC: prepare 33 g of respective medium, autoclave, cool to 45–50 °C, add supplemental powder (prepared fresh; 570 mg for ESBL; 400 mg for KPC), mix, pour plates, store protected from light
  - TBX: 36.6 g TBX medium per L, autoclave, cool to 45–50 °C, dispense 20 mL per plate
  - MacConkey media with antibiotics: prepare 50 g MacConkey per L; autoclave; prepare cefotaxime stock (2 mg/mL) and meropenem stock (10 mg/mL); add 500 µL cefotaxime stock for 1 L MacConkey (1 mg/L) or 50 µL meropenem stock for 1 L MacConkey (0.5 mg/L)
  - Plates: label with agar type, date, and sample ID; store in dark, use promptly

- Sample processing and isolation workflow
  - Fecal (human/poultry), solid waste, soil
    - Suspend 1–5 g sample in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex 1 min, settle 15 min
    - Collect 1 mL suspension; perform serial PBS dilutions
    - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto CHROMagar ESBL, CHROMagar KPC, and TBX plates; incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h
    - Identify colonies typical for E. coli (dark pink to reddish on ESBL/KPC/TBX)
    - Subculture at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL plate onto MacConkey with cefotaxime; similarly 3 colonies from KPC plate onto MacConkey with meropenem
    - Preserve a culture sweep from MacConkey onto TSB with 30% glycerol and store at -80 °C
  - Water supplies (tap/tubewell)
    - Pass 2×100 mL through 0.22 µm filters; place filters on mTEC plates with cefotaxime (1 mg/L) and meropenem (0.5 mg/L)
    - Incubate at 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h
    - If colonies >200 CFU, perform appropriate dilutions and repeat
    - Count reddish/purple colonies; pick at least 3 isolates from each sample onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics; prepare glycerol stock at -80 °C
  - Waste water
    - Use 20 mL wastewater, perform 9-fold dilution with NS
    - Filter onto mTEC plates with antibiotics as above; incubate as for water
    - Follow same isolation and preservation steps

- Confirmation of E. coli using API 20E
  - Test one E. coli isolate per sample (additional isolate if initial is negative)
  - Oxidase test: small colony emulsified in sterile water; add oxidase reagent; purple/black indicates positive
  - Prepare API-20E strip inoculum from colony; incubate at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h
  - Read results via API-20E Reading Table; use API web for organism identification
  - If fewer than 3 positive tests after initial incubation, incubate an additional 24 h
  - Reagent handling and reconstitution steps are provided for first use (detailed steps in original protocol)

- Interpreting API-20E results and follow-up
  - If API-20E cannot identify, perform additional tests:
    - Nitrate reduction test with NIT reagents (NO2 positive indicated by red)
    - If negative, apply Zn test to GLU tube (to differentiate N2)
    - Growth on MacConkey agar may also inform identification
  - Confirmed identification is recorded; unidentifiable results prompted supplementary testing

- Data outputs and traceability
  - Record sample IDs, plate IDs, colony counts, and antibiotic conditions (ESBL/KPC/TBX/MacConkey with cefotaxime/meropenem)
  - Maintain glycerol stock identifiers and API-20E results for each sample
  - Preserve isolates at -80 °C for downstream genetic analysis
  - Ensure proper labeling, data capture, and linkage between sample, colony, and test results
