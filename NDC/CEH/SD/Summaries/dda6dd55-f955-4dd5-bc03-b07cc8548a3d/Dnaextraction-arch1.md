# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Purpose
  - Describe DNA extraction procedures for environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates.
  - Covers specific kits and steps to obtain DNA suitable for downstream applications.

- General precautions
  - Avoid skin contact with reagents; wear gloves; use universal precautions.
  - Refer to MSDS for emergency procedures in case of ingestion or contact.
  - Keep flammable reagents (e.g., ethanol) away from open flames.

- DNA storage (overall)
  - Store extracted DNA frozen at -20°C to -80°C when not in use.
  - Kit reagents/components are generally stored at room temperature (15–30°C) unless stated otherwise.

- DNA extraction from soil samples (DNeasy PowerSoil DNA isolation Kit, Qiagen; Catalog No. 12888-50)
  - Equipment required
    - Pipettors (50 μl–500 μl), microcentrifuge (10,000 x g), Vortex Genie, Vortex Adapter
  - Key procedure overview
    - Add 0.25 g soil to PowerBead Tube; mix; check Solution C1 and dissolve precipitate if necessary.
    - Add 60 μl Solution C1; vortex vigorously for 10 minutes.
    - Centrifuge at 10,000 x g for 30 s; transfer supernatant to clean tube.
    - Add 250 μl Solution C2; incubate on ice; centrifuge; transfer up to 600 μl of supernatant.
    - Add 200 μl Solution C3; incubate on ice; centrifuge; transfer up to 750 μl of supernatant.
    - Add 1200 μl Solution C4; mix; load ~675 μl onto Spin Filter; centrifuge; repeat until all supernatant processed.
    - Add 500 μl Solution C5; centrifuge; discard flow through; spin down 1 min.
    - Place Spin Filter in new tube; add 100 μl Solution C6 to membrane (or use sterile DNA-Free water for elution); centrifuge 30 s to elute.
    - DNA is ready for downstream applications; store frozen if not used.

- DNA extraction from water samples (DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit, Qiagen; Catalog No. 14900-5-NF)
  - Equipment and setup
    - Vacuum filtration system, filters, centrifuge (≤13,000 x g), pipettes, vortex, Vortex Adapter
  - Special precautions
    - Warm Solution PW1 (55°C) to dissolve precipitates; warm PW3 if precipitated; shake PW4 before use; PW3 can be used warm.
  - Key procedure overview
    - Filter water; insert filter into PowerWater Bead Tube.
    - Add 1 ml PW1; secure and vortex; centrifuge as needed to collect supernatant.
    - Transfer supernatant to new tube; add Solution IRS; incubate on ice; centrifuge.
    - Add PW3; vortex; load onto MB Spin Column; centrifuge and discard flow-through; repeat until all supernatant is processed.
    - Place MB Spin Column into new tube; add PW4; centrifuge; then add PW5; centrifuge; dry-spin to remove residual liquid.
    - Place MB Spin Column into new tube; add PW6 to elute DNA; centrifuge.
    - Store eluted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

- DNA extraction from stool samples (QIAmp DNA Stool Mini Kit, Qiagen; Catalog No. 51504)
  - Procedure overview
    - Weigh 180–220 mg stool; add 1.4 ml Buffer ASL; vortex thoroughly; heat at 70°C for 5 min; vortex again; centrifuge to pellet debris.
    - Transfer supernatant to new tube; add InhibitEX Tablet; vortex; incubate to bind inhibitors; centrifuge to pellet inhibitors.
    - Transfer clear supernatant; add 15 μl proteinase K to a new tube; add 200 μl supernatant to PK; add 200 μl Buffer AL; mix thoroughly; incubate at 70°C for 10 min.
    - Add 200 μl ethanol; apply lysate to QIAamp spin column; centrifuge to bind.
    - Add 500 μl Buffer AW1; centrifuge; discard flow-through; place in new tube.
    - Add 500 μl Buffer AW2; centrifuge; optional dry-spin.
    - Elute with 200 μl Buffer AE onto the column; centrifuge to elute DNA.
    - Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C).

- Preparation of Template DNA
  - Source: genomic or bacterial culture
  - Procedure overview
    - Transfer 1 loopful from TSA plate into 500 μl autoclaved dH2O; vortex to mix.
    - Boil for 10 minutes; place on ice for 5–10 minutes.
    - Centrifuge at 6,000 rpm for 5 minutes; collect ~200 μl supernatant.
    - Store template DNA at -20°C (note: text indicates -200 C, likely a typographical error).
