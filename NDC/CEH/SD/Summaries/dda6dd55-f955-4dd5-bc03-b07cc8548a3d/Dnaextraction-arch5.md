# DNA extraction procedure from environmental samples and bacterial isolates NERC study NE/N019555/1

- Overview
  - Describes procedures for extracting DNA from environmental samples (soil, water, stool) and bacterial isolates, using Qiagen kits (PowerSoil, PowerWater) and the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit.
  - Includes general safety, storage recommendations, and a template DNA preparation workflow.

- Sample types and corresponding methods
  - Soil samples
    - Kit: DNeasy PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (Qiagen; Catalog No. 12888-50)
    - Key steps: weigh ~0.25 g soil into PowerBead Tube, perform lysis with C1–C4 solutions, bind DNA on spin column, perform multiple washes, elute DNA with C6 or water, store frozen.
  - Water samples
    - Kit: DNeasy PowerWater DNA Isolation Kit
    - Key steps: filter water, prepare MB Spin Column, process with PW1–PW6 solutions, bind and wash DNA on the spin column, elute and store.
  - Bacterial isolates (general)
    - Included within the PowerSoil/PowerWater workflows via the respective protocols; emphasis on proper lysis, binding, washing, and elution steps.
  - Stool samples
    - Kit: QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen; Catalog No. 51504)
    - Key steps: weigh stool, lyse with Buffer ASL, heat, remove particulates, add InhibitEX Tablet to remove inhibitors, digest with proteinase K + Buffer AL, add ethanol, load onto QIAamp column with AW1/AW2 wash steps, elute with Buffer AE, store DNA.

- Preparation of template DNA
  - From cultured organisms: suspend colony in autoclaved water, heat-denature (boil) for 10 minutes, place on ice, centrifuge to clarify, collect ~200 μl supernatant for use, store at -20 to -80°C.

- Equipment and materials
  - Pipettors, microcentrifuges at specified speeds (e.g., 10,000 x g; 13,000 x g), vortex mixer, spin columns, beakers, filter systems for water processing, consistent with each kit’s instructions.
  - Temperature and timing details are kit-specific (e.g., incubation at 4°C for certain steps; precise centrifugation times/speeds).

- Safety and handling
  - General precautions: avoid skin contact with reagents, wear gloves, consult SDS for emergencies.
  - Specific handling: maintain reagents at recommended temperatures, avoid open flames for flammable components, follow kit-specific safety notes.

- Storage and data management implications (Data Steward perspective)
  - Store extracted DNA frozen (-20°C to -80°C) for downstream applications.
  - Capture and manage metadata for reproducibility and discoverability:
    - Sample type, source, and identifiers; kit brand and catalog numbers; lot numbers; exact volumes used at each step; incubation times and temperatures; centrifugation speeds and durations; elution volumes; storage location and date.
  - Document protocol version and any deviations from standard procedures.
  - Ensure traceability from raw samples to extracted DNA, enabling auditing and re-analysis if needed.
  - Note any inhibitors or considerations (e.g., InhibitEX for stool) that could affect downstream data interpretation.
  - Include references to primary kit manuals and study identifiers (e.g., NERC NE/N019555/1) for provenance.

- End-of-protocol notes
  - DNA ready for downstream applications after elution; recommended to store at -20°C to -80°C.
