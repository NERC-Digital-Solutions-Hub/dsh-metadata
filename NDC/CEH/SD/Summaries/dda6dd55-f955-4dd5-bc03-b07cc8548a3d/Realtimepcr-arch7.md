# Procedure for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) NERC project NE/N019555/1

## Purpose
- PCR amplifies a targeted DNA sequence to generate many copies quickly.
- The procedure describes how samples are prepared and run to avoid contamination and template denaturation, ensuring high-quality amplified products.

## Safety
- Apply universal precautions when performing PCR.
- Maintain the PCR hood regularly and record results in a dedicated file.

- Autoclaved filtered deionized water

## B. Equipment
- PCR hood with UV light

- Refrigerator (2–8°C)
- Refrigerator (-20°C)

## C. Other Supplies
- Parafilm
- Micropipettes (100-1000 µl, 10-100 µl, 2-20 µl, 0.5-10 µl)
- Pipette tips
- Microcentrifuge tubes (1.5 ml, 200 µl)
- Gloves
- Ice
- PCR racks
- Glass marker

## A. PCR Protocol
- 1. Set up all reaction mixtures in an area separate from DNA preparation or PCR product analysis.
- 2. Prepare a dNTP mix containing 10 mM of each dNTP; store aliquots at -20°C.
- 3. Thaw 10x PCR Buffer, dNTP mix, and primer solutions.
- 4. Prepare a master mix containing all components needed for PCR except the template DNA; include at least one negative control to detect contamination.
- 5. Mix the master mix thoroughly and dispense appropriate volumes into PCR tubes; mix gently by pipetting up and down.
- 6. Add template DNA (2.0 µl) to the tubes containing the master mix.
- 7. Program the thermal cycler with the heated lid according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
- 8. Optimize temperatures and cycling times for each new template target or primer pair to maximize yield and specificity. Typical cycling program:
  - Initial activation: 95°C for 10–15 minutes
  - Denaturation: 94°C for 0.5–1 minute
  - Annealing: 50–68°C for 0.5–1 minute
  - Extension: 72°C for 1 minute
  - Number of cycles: 25–35
  - Final extension: 72°C for 10 minutes
  - Hold: 4°C
- 9. Place tubes in the thermal cycler and start the program.
- 10. After cycling, store tubes at 4°C for short-term or -20°C for long-term storage.

- Table 1 (Reaction composition using Taq polymerase) is referenced for exact volumes (example components include water, 10x buffer with MgCl2, dNTPs, primers, Taq polymerase, and template DNA).

## B. Quality control of the method
- 1. Set up positive and negative controls for each PCR sample set.
  - Negative Control: Reagents without any DNA; should produce no band. If a band appears, the gel fails QA/QC and all samples using that master mix must be redone.
  - Positive Control: DNA that yields a clear, observable band; if needed, dilute to obtain a bright, clear band.
- 2. Control outcomes determine pass/fail:
  - Positive controls should indicate expected results; negative controls should be blank.
  - The documented mapping assigns pass/fail based on control outcomes (e.g., certain combinations labeled Passes or Fails). In practice, the assay passes QA/QC when positive controls show correct bands and negative controls show no bands; any deviation results in failure and requires re-testing.

## Data/Record-keeping and GIS-relevant considerations
- Document all reagents, lot numbers, and concentrations to ensure traceability.
- Record cycling conditions, instrument settings, and results (including gel images or equivalent readouts).
- Store results and QA/QC outcomes with clear sample identifiers to support data provenance and integration into spatial or GIS-enabled datasets.
- Contamination control and transparent reporting of controls are crucial for data quality when results feed geospatial analyses or policy-facing data products.
