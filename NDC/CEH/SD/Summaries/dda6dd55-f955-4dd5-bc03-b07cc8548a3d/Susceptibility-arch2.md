# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

## Purpose
- Describe the procedure for Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from the study.

## Equipment
- Incubator (35 ± 2°C)
- Weighing balance
- Water bath (45–50°C)
- Biosafety cabinet
- Vortex machine

## Medium/Reagents
- Sterile saline solution (0.85%), 3–4 mL per tube
- Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates, agar depth ~4 mm
- 70% alcohol

## Other Supplies
- Antibiotic discs
- Inoculating loop
- Sterile cotton swab
- Gas burner
- Sterile petri dishes
- Label pen
- Sterile needle
- Ruler
- MacFarland 0.5 standard

## Quality Control Strain
- Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
- Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems)
- Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combos)

## Procedures
- Record sample details on the media plate: Lab ID, sample type, organism name.
- Inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies into normal saline; emulsify to avoid clumping.
- Adjust inoculum turbidity to 0.5 McFarland (nephelometer or marked paper).
- Within 15 minutes, dip a sterile cotton swab into inoculum; remove excess.
- Streak swab over the entire MHA surface, performing 3 passes with 60° rotations and a final rim sweep.
- Allow surface to dry; blot moisture as needed (lid can be ajar for 3–5 minutes, max 15).
- Place antibiotic discs onto the agar with a sterile needle; apply gentle pressure for contact.
- Do not move a disc once in contact; conduct steps under biosafety cabinet.
- Do not place more than 6 discs on a single 90 mm plate; space evenly.
- Invert plates and incubate at 35 ± 2°C for 18–24 hours.

## Quality Control (QC)
- Conduct sterility control of media per the technical manual.
- Use ATCC reference organisms to check susceptibility.
- Ensure QC results are within CLSI ranges.
- If QC is out of range, do not report test results and follow CLSI troubleshooting guidelines.

## Interpretation and Reporting
- After 18–24 hours, measure zones of inhibition with a ruler (mm).
- Record diameters on worksheets.
- Transcribe results to Susceptible (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI guidelines.
- Laboratory Supervisor must verify results before reporting.

## Data Outputs and Data Management Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Output data include zone diameters (mm) and S/I/R classifications for each isolate-disc combination.
- Results are recorded on worksheets and subsequently stored in datasets and portals for accessibility.
- QC results are used to assure data quality; troubleshooting is conducted if QC is out of range.
- Standardised methods and reporting facilitate integration with other environmental datasets and enable broader data sharing and policy-relevant analyses.
