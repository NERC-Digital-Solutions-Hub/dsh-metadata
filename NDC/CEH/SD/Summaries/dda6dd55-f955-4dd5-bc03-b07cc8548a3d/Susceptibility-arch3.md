# Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing

- Purpose
  - Describes the procedure for antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) of Escherichia coli isolates from the study.

- Equipment
  - Incubator (35 ± 2°C)
  - Weighing balance
  - Water bath (45–50°C)
  - Biosafety cabinet
  - Vortex mixer

- Medium/Reagents
  - Sterile 0.85% saline (3–4 mL per tube)
  - Mueller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates with ~4 mm agar depth
  - 70% alcohol

- Other Supplies
  - Antibiotic discs
  - Inoculating loop
  - Sterile cotton swab
  - Gas burner
  - Sterile petri dishes
  - Label pen
  - Sterile needle
  - Ruler
  - MacFarland 0.5 standard

- Quality Control Strain
  - Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (for carbapenems)
  - Escherichia coli ATCC 35218 (for β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations)

- Procedures (summary)
  - Record sample details on the media plate (Lab ID, sample type, organism name).
  - Inoculate 4–5 well-isolated colonies into sterile saline; emulsify to avoid clumping.
  - Adjust inoculum turbidity to 0.5 McFarland standard.
  - Use a sterile swab to inoculate the MHA plate evenly (three streak passes with 60° turns; also inoculate the rim).
  - Allow surface moisture to absorb (lid can be ajar for 3–5 minutes, max 15).
  - Apply antibiotic discs onto the agar with a sterile needle; press to ensure contact.
  - Do not relocate discs after contact; apply no more than 6 discs per 90 mm plate; space evenly.
  - Invert plates and incubate at 35 ± 2°C for 18–24 hours under biosafety cabinet conditions.

- Quality Control (QC)
  - Verify media sterility and follow the manual for sterility controls.
  - Use ATCC QC strains to confirm susceptibility method; results must fall within CLSI-recommended ranges.
  - If QC results are out of range, do not report test results and troubleshoot per CLSI guidelines.

- Interpretation and Reporting Results
  - After 18–24 hours, measure inhibition zone diameters in millimeters.
  - Record measurements; interpret as Sensitive (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) per CLSI.
  - Results require verification by the Laboratory Supervisor before reporting.

- Data management and governance considerations
  - Ensure sample details, inoculum preparation, disc placement, incubation, and zone measurements are recorded for traceability.
  - Maintain adherence to CLSI guidelines and QC procedures to ensure data quality.
  - Results should be verified by a supervisor and transparently reported, with data handling aligned to governance and sharing standards.
