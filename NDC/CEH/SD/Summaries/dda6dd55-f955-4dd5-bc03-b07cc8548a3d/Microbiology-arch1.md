  - Add 33 g CHROMagar ESBL to 1 L dH2O; heat to dissolve; autoclave 121 °C for 15 min.
  - Cool to 45–50 °C; add 570 mg supplement powder (dissolve in 10 mL purified water); vortex to homogenize; mix with melted CHROMagar ESBL.
  - Pour into sterile Petri dishes; allow to solidify and dry; store in dark.
  - Prepared plates usable 1 day at room temperature; can be refrigerated (2–8 °C) for up to 1 month.

- 1 L CHROMagar KPC media
  - Add 33 g CHROMagar KPC to 1 L dH2O; dissolve and autoclave as above.
  - Cool to 45–50 °C; weigh 400 mg supplement powder; add 10 mL purified water to make supplement solution; vortex to homogenize.
  - Add supplement to melted CHROMagar KPC cooled to 45–50 °C; pour into plates; store as above.
  - Prepared plates usable 1 day at room temperature; can be refrigerated (2–8 °C) for up to 2 months.

- 1 L TBX media
  - Add 36.6 g TBX medium to 1 L dH2O; boil to dissolve; autoclave 121 °C for 15 min.
  - Cool to 45–50 °C; label plates; dispense 20 mL per Petri dish; allow to solidify; store in dark at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks.

- MacConkey agar media with antibiotics
  - MacConkey base: Dissolve 50 g MacConkey in 1 L dH2O; boil to dissolve; autoclave 121 °C for 15 min.
  - Stock solutions: Cefotaxime 2 mg/mL; Meropenem 10 mg/mL.
  - For cefotaxime plates: add 500 μL of cefotaxime stock to 1 L MacConkey; mix well (1 mg/L final).
  - For meropenem plates: add 50 μL of meropenem stock to 1 L MacConkey; mix well (0.5 mg/L final).
  - Label plates with type (Mac+cefo or Mac+mero), date, sample ID; dispense 20 mL per plate; solidify; store dark at 4 °C for up to 4 weeks.

## Sample Processing

- For fecal (human and poultry), solid waste and soil samples:
  - Weigh 1–5 g sample; suspend in 9–45 mL sterile PBS; vortex 1 min; allow to settle 15 min.
  - Collect 1 mL suspension; prepare serial dilutions in PBS.
  - Inoculate 0.1 mL of each dilution onto ESBL, KPC, and TBX plates (spread plating).
  - Incubate at 37 °C for 18–24 h.
  - Identify E. coli by typical dark pink/reddish colonies.
  - Pick at least 3 isolated colonies from ESBL plate and subculture onto MacConkey with cefotaxime; similarly pick 3 colonies from KPC plate and subculture onto MacConkey with meropenem.
  - Take a culture sweep from MacConkey plates and suspend in TSB with 30% glycerol; store at -80 °C.

- For supply water (tap or tubewell water):
  - Filter 2 × 100 mL through 0.22 μm membranes; place filters onto two mTEC plates (one with cefotaxime 1 mg/L, one with meropenem 0.5 mg/L).
  - Incubate 37 °C for 2 h, then 44 °C for 18 h.
  - Keep leftovers at 4 °C; if >200 CFU, dilute next day and inoculate again as above.
  - Count reddish/purple colonies; pick at least 3 isolated colonies and subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics.
  - Store culture sweep in TSB with 30% glycerol at -80 °C.

- For wastewater:
  - Take 20 mL wastewater; prepare to 9-fold dilutions with NS.
  - Filter through two 0.22 μm membranes onto ESBL/KPC plates; incubate as above (37 °C 2 h, then 44 °C 18 h).
  - If >200 CFU, dilute and re-inoculate next day as above.
  - Count colonies; pick at least 3 isolates and subculture onto MacConkey with the same antibiotics.
  - Store culture sweep in TSB with 30% glycerol at -80 °C.

## Confirmation of E. coli using API 20E

- One E. coli isolate from each sample is tested with API 20E for confirmation and potential further genetic analysis. If a sample’s presumptive E. coli is negative, a second isolate is tested.

- API-20E identification procedure
  - Oxidase test: prepare oxidase strip; place a colony on filter paper; apply oxidase reagent; purple/black indicates positive.
  - Prepare humid incubation box; label tray with date, sample ID, and colony ID.
  - Emulsify a colony in 5 mL dH2O; use this suspension to inoculate API-20E strip wells (CIT, VP, GEL included as indicated).
  - Add mineral oil to ADH, LDC, ODC, H2S, and URE tests to create anaerobic conditions.
  - Incubate at 36 ± 2 °C for 18–24 h.

- Interpreting API-20E
  - Read according to the Reading Table; record observations (gas, etc.).
  - If fewer than 3 positive tests after incubation, incubate an additional 24 ± 2 h before proceeding.
  - For first-time reagent use, follow specific procedures to open ampoules and reconstitute reagents; proceed with test additions and incubations as directed.
  - Identify organism using APIweb.
  - If unidentifiable, perform additional tests: Nitrate Reduction (NIT tests) and growth on MacConkey.

- Nitrate Reduction / Additional tests (if needed)
  - NIT tests: add NIT reagents to GLU; observe color change (NO2 red indicates positive); if negative, add Zn and reobserve to distinguish N2.
