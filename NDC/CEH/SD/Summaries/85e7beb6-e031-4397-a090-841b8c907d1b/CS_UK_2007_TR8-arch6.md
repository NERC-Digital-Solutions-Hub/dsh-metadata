# Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007

- Presents longitudinal data on macroinvertebrate taxa in Scotland and Wales for headwater streams, focusing on taxa that occur in at least 10% of samples.
- Scotland: shows changes in proportional occurrence from 1990 to 1998 (blue) and 1998 to 2007 (red), plus overall 1990–2007 changes for taxa with ≥10% occurrence.
- Wales: provides proportions of sampled sites where taxa were observed in 1990, 1998, and 2007 for taxa meeting the ≥10% occurrence criterion.
- Outputs include selected taxa relationships, histograms of year-to-year changes, and cross-year tables, illustrating how common macroinvertebrate groups shift over time in these regions.
- Aimed to inform understanding of headwater stream ecological status, facilitate cross-country comparisons, and support policy-relevant assessments.
