# Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007

- Overview
  - Long-term, nationwide monitoring of headwater streams in GB focusing on ecological status via macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and river habitats, with supporting water chemistry.
  - Repeated surveys conducted in 1990, 1998, and 2007 to describe temporal changes and linkages with land use and catchment characteristics.
  - Primary data products include site-level indicators (e.g., TAXA, ASPT, O/E TAXA, O/E ASPT, BC dissimilarity, MTR, species richness, RHS measures HMS/HQA) with country and Environmental Zone stratifications, enabling map-based visualization and spatial decision-making.

- Data, scope, and GIS-ready outputs
  - Spatial design: surveys within 591 1 km x 1 km squares across GB; headwater streams defined as Strahler Order ≤ 3.
  - Indices and outputs:
    - Macroinvertebrates: TAXA, ASPT, O/E TAXA, O/E ASPT, BC dissimilarity to RIVPACS reference.
    - Macrophytes: Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and species richness.
    - River Habitats: RHS scores including Habitat Modification Score (HMS) and Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA).
    - Data handling: standardized protocols, QA, taxonomy harmonization; higher values (except HMS) indicate better status.
  - GIS relevance: enables spatial mapping of ecological status across Environmental Zones (EZs) and country contexts; supports integration with land-use data for policy and catchment management.

- Scotland (as reported in the document)
  - Taxa occurrence changes (1990–1998; 1998–2007) show shifts in taxa proportions; focus on taxa occurring in ≥10% of samples.
  - Selected macroinvertebrate taxa illustrate relationships between occurrence and time; patterns include both increases and declines across periods.
  - Overall interpretation: regional variability with some improvements and some declines; data quality notes include potential effects from site relocation.

- Wales (as reported in the document)
  - Table 10-3 presents proportions of sampled sites with taxa observed in 1990, 1998, and 2007 for taxa occurring in ≥10% of samples.
  - Temporal changes indicate notable taxa with varying trends across the three survey years, illustrating shifting community composition.
  - Results contribute to understanding long-term changes in headwater streams within Wales and complement Scotland’s regional patterns.

- Data quality, limitations, and interpretation
  - Hydrological year effects (e.g., drought in 1990, wet years in 1998 and 2007) influence observed changes.
  - Surveyor effects and protocol changes (e.g., relocation, resectioning) can affect RHS HMS scores; GPS improvements in 2007 reduced relocation issues.
  - RIVPACS-based status may miss shifts in community composition that do not alter taxa richness; BC dissimilarity offers a more sensitive alternative.
  - Ditch/drain data are smaller in scale and should be interpreted with caution but provide complementary insights to streams.

- Applications and implications for GIS and policy
  - The dataset supports map-based visualization of ecological status, facilitating policy planning, catchment management, and integration with land-use layers.
  - Ongoing and planned integrated analyses will link square-level land-use characteristics to stream ecological status, enhancing spatial decision-making and policy relevance.
