# Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007

## Overview
- Long-term monitoring of headwater streams across Great Britain to describe ecological status changes and provide baselines for policy evaluation.
- Focus on streams of Strahler order 3 or less; data collected for 1990, 1998, and 2007 across England, Scotland, and Wales.
- Policy relevance: supports assessment under the Water Framework Directive and related biodiversity initiatives; informs diffuse pollution and land-use management considerations.

## Aims and scope
- Describe changes in ecological status and biodiversity of headwater streams; assess status relative to minimally impacted reference conditions.
- Deliver baseline data for policy impact evaluation and to inform diffuse pollution and riparian management strategies.
- Use a multi-element approach (biological, physical habitat, and chemistry) to enable robust trend analysis.

## Methods

### Survey design and site use
- Repeated sampling at headwater stream sites across the three survey years, with some sites revisited and others moved when upstream conditions exceeded Strahler order 3.
- Separate analyses for stream sites and ditch/drain sites; country-level and Environmental Zone (EZ) stratification.

### Data elements per site
- Macroinvertebrates: Taxa richness (TAXA), ASPT, BMWP-derived indices, AWIC; observed/expected (O/E) comparisons via RIVPACS/RICT; dissimilarity to reference (BC index).
- Macrophytes: Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and macrophyte species richness.
- River habitats: River Habitat Survey (RHS) indices—Habitat Modification Score (HMS) and Habitat Quality Assessment Score (HQA), plus sub-scores for channel and bank features.
- Water chemistry: Key metrics including alkalinity, soluble reactive phosphorus, total oxidised nitrogen; field conductivity and pH.
- Data quality and QA: Tablet-based data capture (2007); taxonomy audits; QA checks and cross-lab verification; taxonomic harmonisation across years.

### Modelling and analysis
- Linear mixed-effects models with random effects for sites following longitudinal data structure.
- Primary predictor: survey year (1990, 1998, 2007); country-level and EZ-level analyses; separate analyses for stream vs ditch/drain data; BC status classification (high/good/moderate/poor/bad) based on O/E TAXA and ASPT; dissimilarity (BC) used to compare observed and reference communities.
- Examination of status changes between years and cross-country comparisons; analysis of taxa prevalence changes over time.
- Data scope: hundreds of stream sites across GB for macroinvertebrates; separate, fewer samples for macrophytes and RHS with year variations.

## Key findings

### Macroinvertebrates
- Overall improvements 1990–1998 across GB; 1998–2007 shows continued improvement in England, mixed results in Scotland, and inconclusive in Wales due to smaller samples.
- Indices:
  - ASPT increases 1990–1998 (England and Scotland); continuing improvement in England 1998–2007; Scotland limited change; Wales uncertain due to sample size.
  - TAXA richness and overall taxa increases 1990–1998 across all countries; 1998–2007 variable, with England continuing gains and Scotland often showing declines for some measures; Wales less clear due to smaller samples.
  - AWIC declines 1990–1998 in England and Wales; patterns thereafter less clear.
- Reference-comparison (O/E vs reference):
  - Mean dissimilarity to RIVPACS reference (BC index) improved from 1990 to 2007; most improvement occurred 1990–1998, with England continuing 1998–2007.
- Status classifications (RIVPACS/RICT):
  - Proportions in high/good classes generally rose from 1990 to 2007; regional and EZ patterns observed (EZ1 often lower status; other zones improved).
  - 1998–2007: more sites improved than deteriorated in England/Wales; Scotland shows zone-specific deterioration signals (notably EZ6 Highlands).
- Site-level changes: Mixed pattern 1998–2007 with many changes within expected sampling variability.
- Ditch/drain macroinvertebrates: Fewer sites; patterns broadly similar to streams in Scotland (1990–1998 increases); 1998–2007 declines less clear due to limited data.

### Macrophytes
- Stream macrophytes: Increases in mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and species richness from 1998 to 2007 across England, Scotland, and Wales; Scotland shows notable nutrient-status improvements via macrophyte indicators.
- Ditch/drain macrophytes: Scotland shows significant gains in both MTR and species richness; England/Wales less pronounced due to smaller samples.

### River habitats
- RHS-derived indicators:
  - HQA (habitat quality) improved from 1998 to 2007 across GB.
  - HMS (habitat modification) increased significantly in Scotland; England and Wales showed smaller, less consistent changes.
- Sub-scores:
  - Largest gains in bank features and special features; bank vegetation may have declined in some instances; channel features improved modestly.
  - Some observed year-to-year and assessor-related differences in evaluating resectioning and channel modification between 1998 and 2007.

## Land-use relationships and riparian vegetation
- Preliminary models suggest most O/E ASPT variation is spatial; higher arable land, improved grassland, and urban cover within a square associate with lower ASPT, while woody riparian cover positively relates to ASPT.
- Time-variant woody cover generally aligns with positive associations; time-variant arable land shows occasional positive associations, indicating complex land-management-hydrology interactions.
- 1998–2007 resectioning and land-management variables show negative associations with ASPT in some models; HQA tends to relate positively to ASPT, though temporal links are weaker.

## Ecosystem services and context
- Headwater streams provide provisioning, supporting, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services; ecological status improvements linked to diffuse land-use changes and riparian habitat improvements.

## Policy relevance and monitoring implications
- Demonstrates value of long-term, multi-element monitoring for policy evaluation (WFD status classification, biodiversity targets).
- Reference-condition approach (RIVPACS/RICT and BC dissimilarity) offers complementary perspectives beyond simple richness.
- Environmental Zone framework enables cross-region comparisons and helps identify where interventions are needed.
- Highlights need for data integration across scales (land cover, riparian vegetation, hydromorphology, in-stream biology) to understand drivers.
- Data governance emphasis: data quality, metadata, QA, and public sharing are crucial but sometimes challenging aspects of monitoring programs.

## Data quality, QA, and governance
- QA and taxonomy audits show good agreement; site relocation and reach changes can affect interpretation.
- GPS and tablet-based capture improved location accuracy and data integrity (2007).
- Metadata and data-sharing barriers acknowledged; ongoing analyses aim to broaden explanatory variables across scales.

## Limitations and caveats
- Climate variability influences: 1990 drought in England and 1998 wet year; 2007 wet year with floods affected results.
- Sample size limitations in Wales and ditch/drain datasets reduce statistical power.
- Taxa prevalence changes can be affected by sampling/detection biases; richness vs. composition metrics may diverge in sensitivity.
- RHS HMS interpretation may reflect observer differences rather than true habitat modification changes.

## Conclusions
- Headwater stream ecological status in GB shows broadly positive trends from 1990 to 2007, especially 1990–1998.
- England: continued macroinvertebrate improvement and increased macrophyte diversity from 1998–2007.
- Scotland: more mixed results; some nutrient-status improvements, but macroinvertebrate gains are uneven.
- Wales: improvements present but with limited statistical power due to sample size.
- Overall: Macroinvertebrate and macrophyte indicators generally improved; habitat quality improved but some HMS signals may reflect observer effects.
- Provisional analyses suggest negative links between intensive land uses (arable, improved grassland, urban) and ecological status, with positive links to riparian woody cover; integrated analyses ongoing to refine drivers across scales.
