# Headwaters

- Comprehensive description of the Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) field methods for headwaters, pond condition, and associated biodiversity and habitat assessments in Britain.
- Documents the design, data collection protocols, on-site data capture, sample handling, and data management workflows used to build a national, standardized dataset.

## Scope and design

- CS2007 re-surveys:
  - All 425 CS2000 freshwater squares for headwater streams (macroinvertebrate community, aquatic plant community, River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology, physical characteristics, and a water chemistry sample).
  - Randomly selected ponds within 629 CS2007 squares containing ponds (in these squares, 1 randomly selected pond per square for macrophyte survey, physical characteristics, and water chemistry).
- Aims to produce a national freshwater dataset across headwater streams and ponds using consistent methods and digital data capture.

## Data collection and field methods

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS-based):
  - Sample area: single continuous stream reach, typically 5–15 m, with proportional sampling of habitats.
  - Method: 3-minute pond-net kick sampling plus 1 minute of manual searching; pond-net with 900 μm mesh; no fish or obviously large, easily identified taxa retained; rare taxa carefully handled.
  - Sample handling: transfer to labeled containers, fix with 40% formalin to achieve ~4% formaldehyde strength, store in 1.3 L pots; meticulous labeling and cross-site traceability.
  - Environmental data: record width, depth at multiple points, velocity category, substrate composition, bedrock/peat, presence of other habitats (rock pavement, moss, algae, higher plants); draw a 50 m river-reach sketch for relocation; photograph macroinvertebrate area with marker boards (M) and site numbers.
  - Data capture: on-site forms (RIVPACS Sample Area Form) and data entry into RIVPACS RAPID system; validation required before leaving site.
- Water chemistry sampling (headwaters):
  - Field measurements: conductivity and pH using Hanna Combi meter; post-calibration checks recommended.
  - Laboratory analyses: filtered samples for SRP, TON, and alkalinity; on-site filtration using 0.45 μm filters; detailed sample labeling and submission protocol to CEH Lancaster.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS):
  - Coverage: 500 m RHS reach centered on macroinvertebrate sampling site where possible.
  - Data capture: use RAPID on Tablet PC; 17 sections across 4 pages; drop-down data fields to minimize entry errors; on-site validation with “Check Data” before leaving.
  - 10 spot-checks plus channel vegetation/substrate summaries; after data entry, data validation ensures completeness and consistency.
  - Output: RHS indices and habitat characterizations aligned with the 2003 RHS protocol (Environment Agency), enabling comparability with prior and future surveys.
- Aquatic macrophyte (MTR) survey:
  - Coverage: 100 m reach centered on macroinvertebrate site; walk/wade to record submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; estimate percent cover by species and overall percent cover by category.
  - Data capture: IRIS system (field digital data entry) with 2-page form for plant presence and physical site data; specimens for lab confirmation collected when needed.
  - Identification guidance: prioritizes species-level ID where possible; guidance for when to submit specimens to experts; rare species flagged for special handling.
- Pond condition survey (CS2007):
  - Pre-work: ponds identified and basic attributes recorded by mappers; survey pond selected per square; entire pond surveyed if on boundary or within square.
  - Data collection: boundary sketch, area estimation, drawdown height, proportion of water present, sediment/water depths, sediment base composition, pollution indicators, inflows/outflows, pond management, surrounding land use, amenity values.
  - Sample handling: water turbidity estimation, water chemistry, and sample labeling similar to headwaters; transport to Pond Conservation with standardized packing; TREM card attached to transport box.
  - Macrophyte survey: complete species list within the pond boundary; abundance estimates (dominant, abundant, frequent, occasional, rare) and total submerged/floating/emergent cover; specimen handling and lab confirmation for uncertain IDs; strict note-taking on inaccessible pond areas.
  - Deliverables: pond mapping recording sheets, field data sheets, plant specimens, and water samples to Pond Conservation; monthly dispatch with proper labeling and packaging.

## Data management, quality, and governance

- Digital data capture and validation:
  - On-site data entry into RAPID (RHS) and IRIS (plant survey) to reduce transcription errors; on-screen validation checks identify missing or inconsistent data before leaving the site.
  - RAPID and IRIS frameworks mirror the structure of their respective paper forms to ensure traceability and standardization.
- Training and quality controls:
  - Field teams hold Environment Agency RHS/RIVPACS accreditation; ongoing training for RIVPACS macroinvertebrate sampling, MTR aquatic plant surveying, and chemical sampling.
  - Regular team rotations and audits (approximately 7% of headwater sites) to maintain consistency across teams and time.
  - Field survey check-lists are used to ensure all tasks are completed before leaving each site.
- Data flow and storage:
  - Macroinvertebrate and plant samples transported to CEH Dorset for processing; samples shipped in small batches with Transport Emergency (TREM) cards.
  - Specimens and data sheets stored at CEH bases until processing; specimen labeling and documentation are critical for traceability.
  - Output data stored in centralized databases (RIVPACS, RHS RAPID, IRIS plant data) enabling cross-site comparisons and national analyses.
- Documentation and references:
  - Methods align with established guidance (Environment Agency RHS manual, MTR macrophyte protocols, Murray-Bligh sampling procedures, etc.) to ensure comparability with earlier CS surveys.

## Practical considerations for Data Leaders

- Ensure end-to-end data lineage, from field collection to centralized databases, with standardized metadata and participant accreditation.
- Leverage on-site digital data capture to improve data quality, timeliness, and validation opportunities; maintain interoperability between RAPID, IRIS, and RIVPACS data streams.
- Promote consistency across teams via training, field checklists, and periodic audits; implement robust sample tracking and labeling practices.
- Manage data governance and sharing across partners by documenting protocols, sample handling rules, and transport/ethics (including rare species and specimen handling).
- Align with broader data-system aims: holistic view of data systems, co-ownership of data products, clear data availability and gaps, and active collaboration within the data community to support an effective national freshwater monitoring system.

## End-to-end workflow highlights

- Pre-field: establish square selection, pond mapping, and survey pond identification; prepare sampling equipment and safety plans.
- In-field: execute macroinvertebrate sampling, water chemistry, RHS, and macrophyte surveys; capture data digitally; take photographs; collect and label samples; ensure safety protocols.
- Post-field: validate data on-site; transport macroinvertebrate and plant samples to CEH; dispatch field data sheets and specimens to Pond Conservation or CEH Dorset; complete field survey check-lists.
- Analysis and integration: compile macroinvertebrate, chemical, plant, and habitat data into standardized databases for national analysis and trend assessment.
