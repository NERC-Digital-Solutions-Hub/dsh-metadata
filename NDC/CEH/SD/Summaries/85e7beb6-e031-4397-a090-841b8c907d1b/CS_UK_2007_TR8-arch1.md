# Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007

- Overview
  - Longitudinal national monitoring of headwater streams (Strahler Order 3 or less) across England, Scotland, and Wales, with data from 1990, 1998, and 2007.
  - Aims to describe changes in ecological status, relate them to land-use/land-cover variables and riparian/channel characteristics, and provide baselines for policy assessment (e.g., WFD, UK BAP).

- Data Collected and QA
  - Sampling in 591 1km x 1km squares; headwater site within each square (or ditch/drain when necessary); repeated where possible.
  - Three quality elements:
    - Macroinvertebrates (RIVPACS/RICT): indices such as TAXA, ASPT, AWIC, O/E, and BC dissimilarity.
    - Macrophytes: Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and species richness.
    - River Habitat Survey (RHS): Habitat Modification Score (HMS) and Habitat Quality Assessment Score (HQA).
  - Water chemistry: single supporting measurement (alkalinity, soluble reactive phosphorus, total oxidised nitrogen); field conductivity and pH also recorded.
  - QA processes include harmonised taxonomy, cross-checks, and auditing; some uncertainty due to reach changes and site relocation; ditch samples have smaller sample sizes.

- Analytical Approach
  - Three-time-point longitudinal design analyzed by country and Environmental Zone (EZ) where possible.
  - Modelling using linear mixed-effects models to handle within-site and between-site variation; year as main factor; interactions with EZs for regional differences.
  - Use of BC dissimilarity and O/E indices to assess deviation from reference conditions; partial multivariate analyses to relate status to land management and RHS.
  - Data become more usable over time through data provenance (metadata) and cross-dataset integration.

- Key Findings: Macroinvertebrates
  - England: improvements 1990–1998; 1998–2007 trends generally stable or improving for several indices; AWIC declined 1990–1998.
  - Scotland: strong gains 1990–1998 but mixed 1998–2007; some regions show declines or variability (e.g., Highlands) and surveyor-related uncertainties in Lowlands.
  - Wales: overall improvements, but smaller sample sizes limit statistical power; AWIC declines observed 1990–1998 with diverse patterns later.
  - Across GB: ASPT and TAXA typically rose 1990–1998; continued improvement or stabilization 1998–2007 varies by country; BC dissimilarity toward reference decreased over time, indicating convergence toward reference conditions.

- Key Findings: Macrophytes
  - 1998–2007: increases in mean trophic rank (MTR) and species richness across GB; notable Scotland gains in MTR; Wales also shows richness gains with smaller samples.
  - Ditch/drain sites show fewer data but trends in the same direction, with England showing more variable MTR patterns in ditches.

- Key Findings: River Habitat (RHS)
  - 1998–2007: overall improvements in RHS across GB; Scotland shows significant HMS increases driven by Lowland (EZ4) habitat features; some sub-scores indicate surveyor/site differences.
  - Notable gains in bank features, channel features, and presence of special features; some declines in bank vegetation scores.

- Environmental Drivers and Land Management Relationships
  - Preliminary analyses suggest negative associations between intensive land uses (arable land, improved grassland, urban cover) and ecological status (O/E ASPT).
  - Positive associations with riparian woody cover; time-variant effects of woody cover and arable land indicate complex spatial-temporal relationships.
  - Bed/bank resectioning (engineering) tends to relate to lower O/E ASPT in time-variant analyses; potential surveyor effects noted.
  - Riparian canopy height and woody cover influence macroinvertebrate community structure; nutrient signals may appear in certain contexts.

- Data Quality, Limitations, and Context
  - Taxonomic harmonisation required due to year-to-year changes; site relocation/reach changes introduce uncertainty.
  - Ditch samples are smaller in number, with patterns broadly similar to streams but lower statistical power.
  - 1990 drought and 1998 wet year provide hydrometeorological context; interpreting trends requires considering climate variability.

- Policy and Ecosystem Context
  - Results align with policy aims (WFD: at least good ecological status; UK BAP; ecosystem services framework) and support integrated assessments under national planning.
  - Findings offer baselines for evaluating policy changes and diffuse pollution pressures; enable cross-country and EZ-level comparisons.

- Conclusions and Implications
  - Headwater stream ecological status shows overall positive trends from 1990 to 2007, with clearer improvements in England; Scotland more variable; Wales intermediate with smaller samples.
  - 1990–1998 improvements likely reflect climatic conditions; 1998–2007 improvements more linked to land-management and riparian habitat enhancements, especially in England.
  - Macrophyte diversity and habitat quality have improved; Scotland shows some nutrient-related signals in MTR.
  - Negative impacts associated with intensive agriculture and urbanization; positive role for riparian woody vegetation.
  - Demonstrates the value of integrated Countryside Survey data for understanding drivers of headwater stream ecology and informing policy decisions.
