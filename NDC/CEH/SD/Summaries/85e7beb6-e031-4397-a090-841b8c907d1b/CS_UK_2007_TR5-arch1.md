# Countryside Survey 2007 Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey

- The document outlines standardized methods for the Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) covering headwaters and ponds across Great Britain, integrating macroinvertebrate, plant, hydromorphology, and water chemistry assessments with robust data-handling protocols.
- Aims include identifying correlations, reporting findings, and supporting predictive inferences about actions’ likely impacts, using topic expertise coupled with rigorous data analysis.

## Study Design and Scope

- Headwaters module:
  - Re-survey of all 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams.
  - Elements surveyed in each square: macroinvertebrate community (RIVPACS), hydromorphology (River Habitat Survey, RHS), physical characteristics of the watercourse, aquatic plant community, and water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP, TON, alkalinity).
- Pond module:
  - Integration of pond biological condition into CS2007 across all CS2007 squares containing ponds.
  - For each square with ponds: a randomly selected pond is surveyed for aquatic plants, physical characteristics, and water chemistry; mapping and outer boundary delineation are recorded.
- The CS2007 program positions ponds and headwater sites within a national framework to enable cross-year and cross-site comparisons.

## Data Collection Methods

- Macroinvertebrate sampling (RIVPACS protocol):
  - Primary objective: maximize the taxonomic diversity collected within a single sampling area (5–15 m of stream width) using a standard 25 cm2 pond-net (900 µm mesh) with three minutes of active sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
  - Sampling involves kick-net methods across multiple habitats (gravel/cobbles, soft sediments, boulders, vegetation, still water, and deep waters) with proportional effort across habitats.
  - Post-sampling handling: samples fixed in 40% formalin, labeled, and stored in polythene pots; strict cross-contamination controls; samples transported to CEH Dorset; detailed labeling and batch documentation.
  - Environmental data (RIVPACS Sample Area Form) captured for the entire sampling area, including width, depth, velocity, substratum, habitat types, and channel shading.
  - Photographs and sketch maps used to aid relocation of sampling sites in the future.
- River Habitat Survey (RHS) and data capture:
  - A 500 m RHS reach (centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling site) is surveyed for hydromorphology and habitat diversity, regardless of flow conditions.
  - On-site data entry via RAPID (a field data-entry system) on a Tablet PC; data validation occurs in situ before leaving the site.
  - Page-based data entry includes spot-checks (10 per reach) and an Overall/extra-substrates tab to capture additional habitat features beyond spot-checks.
  - A standardized 500 m reach ensures consistent spatial coverage and comparability across sites; data are stored in RAPID and later integrated with other CS2007 data.
- Aquatic macrophyte survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR method):
  - 100 m reach (centered on macroinvertebrate sampling point) walked/waded to record presence and percent cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent macrophytes (to species level when possible).
  - In larger or deeper sections, grapnels and targeted sampling retrieve submerged plants; specimens collected for laboratory confirmation when necessary.
  - Species identification guided by an approved list; rare or potentially ambiguous taxa may require laboratory confirmation or expert input.
  - Data processed via IRIS (interactive plant data-entry system) with on-site validation; a 2-page form captures plant data and site physical characteristics.
- Pond condition survey:
  - Ponds mapped and boundaries drawn; survey includes turbidity estimation, water chemistry sampling, drawdown height, pond area estimation, sediment and pond-base composition, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and surrounding land-use.
  - The pond condition form records management interventions, grazing, waterbird and fish presence, amphibians, and amenity use.
  - Photographs of ponds with square numbers; boundary delineation uses winter/water level context; 50 ml filtered samples collected for SRP/TOT/alkalinity analysis.
  - Sampling follows safety guidelines appropriate for pond environments; two surveyors collaborate due to elevated health and safety risks in ponds.
- Data handling and metadata:
  - RIVPACS data and environmental field data are captured on standardized forms (SAMPLE AREA forms for macroinvertebrates; RHS data via RAPID; plant data via IRIS).
  - All data are georeferenced with GPS-derived NGR coordinates (to at least 8-digit precision where feasible).
  - Quality control: trained surveyors (e.g., Environment Agency certificates for RHS/RIVPACS), data validation during fieldwork, periodic audits (~7% of headwater sites), and team rotation to ensure consistency.

## Data Collection Tools and Digital Systems

- RIVPACS Sample Area Form:
  - On-site data sheet for macroinvertebrate sampling area, water width, depth, velocity, substrate, habitat composition, and sampling method details.
- RAPID (River Habitat Survey field data entry system):
  - Tablet-based data entry for RHS data; 17 sections across 4 pages; built-in validation to ensure completeness and internal consistency.
  - Facilitates GPS integration, site relocation features, and on-site RHS guidance materials.
- IRIS (Aquatic Plant Survey data entry system):
  - Tablet-based plant survey data capture; two-page form for plant species lists and site physical attributes; validation on completion.
  - Supports specimen handling instructions and labeling for laboratory confirmation when needed.
- Field Survey Check-list:
  - A consolidated checklist to ensure all components of the headwater field survey (RHS, macroinvertebrates, plant survey, chemical sampling, and site photographs) are completed and properly dispatched.

## Data Quality, Validation and Governance

- Quality control measures include:
  - Certification of all RHS/RIVPACS surveyors.
  - Regular training in RIVPACS, MTR, RHS, and chemical sampling protocols.
  - Regular team rotations to align sampling techniques.
  - Independent audits of approximately 7% of headwater sites by CEH staff.
  - On-site data validation in RAPID and IRIS with step-by-step error correction.
- Data management aims to ensure data are discoverable and usable, with linked datasets (macroinvertebrates, chemistry, RHS, macrophytes) across CS2007 squares for robust analysis.

## Practical Considerations

- Scale and accessibility challenges include data gaps at local scales and the need to unify data from multiple sources and formats.
- The protocols emphasize safety, consistent sampling across diverse habitats, and the need for domain expertise during interpretation and analysis.
- The project emphasizes reporting and sharing findings with metadata-rich datasets through appropriate portals and repositories to support transparency and reuse.

## Transport, Storage and Dissemination of Samples

- Macroinvertebrate samples and plant specimens are stored and couriered to CEH Dorset as batches (6–8 pots per box initially; transport requires TREM documentation for formaldehyde-containing samples).
- Specimens and data are catalogued and dispatched to Pond Conservation for processing and archiving, with clear labeling and chain-of-custody procedures.

## Appendices and References
