# Countryside Survey: Headwater Streams Report from 2007

- Long-term, multi-component field survey of headwater streams (Strahler Order 3 or less) across Great Britain; provides baseline and trend data to inform policy and management (notably Water Framework Directive).
- Combines ecological indicators from macroinvertebrates, macrophytes, and in-channel/ riparian habitats, with supporting water-chemistry data; includes integrated analyses linking aquatic status with terrestrial land-use data.

## Data scope and methods

- Data collection framework:
  - 591 1km x 1km squares; headwater site(s) within each square; most sites revisited across years; some relocations when headwaters exceeded Strahler order 3.
  - Separate analyses for ditch/drain sites due to data limitations for standard O/E calculations in non-typical streams.
- Indicators and indices:
  - Macroinvertebrates: ASPT, TAXA (BMWP), AWIC, species richness; O/E TAXA and O/E ASPT from RIVPACS/RICT; ecological status classes aligned with WFD.
  - Dissimilarity metric: Bray-Curtis (BC) index to detect compositional shifts beyond richness.
  - Macrophytes: Mean Trophic Rank (MTR) and species richness.
  - Habitat: RHS indices—Habitat Quality Assessment (HQA) and Habitat Modification Score (HMS).
- Analyses and governance:
  - Linear mixed-effects models to separate spatial and temporal variation; bootstrapped or simultaneous confidence intervals; environmental zones (EZ) for spatial context.
  - Robust QA, taxonomy harmonization across years; tablet-based data capture in 2007 with standardized QA and consolidation; cross-checks between main, QA, and audit identifications.
- Data access and collaboration:
  - Data released publicly via the Countryside Survey data portal; collaborative authorship across CEH, QMUL, Bournemouth University; funded by NERC and Defra.

## Key findings and implications

- Temporal trends:
  - Overall headwater status improved from 1990 to 1998; 1998–2007 results more variable across GB.
  - England: continuing macroinvertebrate improvements; increases in macrophyte species; habitat indicators improving; southeastern England remains relatively degraded.
  - Scotland: macroinvertebrate indices largely improved 1990–1998; 1998–2007 mixed; nutrient-related macrophyte metrics show some improvements; Highlands macroinvertebrate richness declines observed.
  - Wales: patterns broadly align with England/Scotland but with smaller samples and reduced statistical power; some macrophyte gains, macroinvertebrate changes less pronounced.
  - Ditch/drain sites show fewer significant changes; generally mirror stream-site patterns but with weaker signals.
- Habitat and land-use associations:
  - Provisional links between intensive land uses (arable, improved grassland, urban) and poorer ecological status.
  - Riparian woody cover positively associated with ecological status; channel modification generally negative.
- Climate context:
  - Drought in 1990 potentially influenced early gains; subsequent wetter years add complexity to attribution; hydrology remains a key context factor.
- Methodological insights:
  - BC dissimilarity offers sensitivity to compositional changes beyond simple richness trends; O/E TAXA provides a direct link to traditional biological quality assessments.
  - Integration of aquatic indicators with terrestrial land-use data enhances understanding of drivers and identification of leverage points for management.

## Data quality, governance and reliability

- High-quality, harmonized taxonomy across years; robust QA processes and cross-validation between data streams.
- GPS-based site localization and standardized survey methods support reproducibility over decades.
- Acknowledges limitations: site relocations, reach variability within squares, and smaller sample sizes in Wales affecting statistical power.
- Public data release enables reuse for broader analyses and policy assessments.

## Data leadership implications for the archetype

- Demonstrates value of sustained, standardized, multi-component data collection for long-term decision-making.
- Highlights trade-offs between different indicators (O/E TAXA vs BC dissimilarity) and how they reveal different aspects of ecological change.
- Shows the benefits of integrating aquatic data with terrestrial land-use information to explain spatial and temporal variation, guiding cross-sector collaboration and policy-relevant analyses.
- Emphasizes rigorous data governance (QA, taxonomy harmonization, documentation) as essential for reliable cross-year comparisons and future Integrated Assessments.
- Underlines the importance of transparent data access (public data portal) to enable stakeholder engagement, benchmarking, and accountability.

## Policy and practical implications

- Provides baselines and trend signals relevant to achieving Water Framework Directive targets for headwater streams.
- Supports integrated catchment health assessments by relating aquatic status to riparian condition and land management practices (e.g., riparian restoration, runoff reduction from arable and urban areas).
- Encourages data-driven prioritization of restoration and monitoring efforts across regions (England, Scotland, Wales) based on region-specific trends and drivers.

## Conclusions

- Headwater stream ecological status shows overall positive trajectories 1990–2007, with clearer improvements 1990–1998 and more variable patterns thereafter.
- Regional differences exist, with England showing continued macroinvertebrate and macrophyte improvements, Scotland exhibiting mixed results with some nutrient-status gains but macroinvertebrate declines in certain zones, and Wales displaying similar but power-limited patterns.
- Early indications of negative effects from intensive land use and positive effects from riparian woody cover emerge from provisional analyses.
- The integrated, multi-component dataset demonstrates strong potential for linking land management, habitat structure, and stream health to inform future Countryside Survey work and broad-scale ecosystem assessments.
