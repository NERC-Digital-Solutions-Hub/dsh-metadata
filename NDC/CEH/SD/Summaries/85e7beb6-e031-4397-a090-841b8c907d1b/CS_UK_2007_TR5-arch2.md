# Countryside Survey in 2007: Headwaters and Pond Condition Survey Methods

- Purpose and scope
  - Use standardized, data-driven methods to assess environmental health and policy performance over time across Great Britain.
  - Focus on headwater streams and ponds as part of the Countryside Survey (CS2007), with integrated data on macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, hydromorphology, water chemistry, and site context.
  - Enable data to be stored, quality assured, and made accessible for scrutiny and downstream use.

- Core datasets and outputs
  - Macroinvertebrate data (RIVPACS) and associated environmental variables.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS) hydromorphology and habitat data collected in the field and entered via a digital system (RAPID).
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (Mean Trophic Rank, MTR methodology) with plant identification (to species where possible) and percent cover estimates via IRIS.
  - Water chemistry readings (pH, conductivity) plus filtered SRP, TON and alkalinity samples.
  - Pond condition data including boundary delineation, turbidity estimates, sediment/pond base composition, inflows/outflows, pollution indicators, and pond management/use.
  - Field relocation photographs, sketch maps, and accompanying site environmental data.

- Field design and sampling targets
  - Headwaters (CS2007): re-survey of 425 CS2000 squares for headwater streams, with a 500 m standard headwater sampling reach per square and a 100 m aquatic-plant survey segment centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point.
  - Pond components (CS2007): random pond selection within CS2007 squares containing ponds; integrated macrophyte, environmental, and water-chemistry assessments for the identified survey pond per square.
  - Re-survey logic aims to ensure comparability with CS2000 while focusing on headwater streams and ponds across GB.

- Data collection and field methods (highlights)
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling
    - Use standard 25 cm2 pond-net with 900 µm mesh; three-minute active sampling plus one minute of manual searching.
    - Sample proportionally across habitats; avoid excessively wide sampling extents; preserve specimens for lab ID; do not routinely retain fish or readily identified large rare species in the field.
    - On completion, split samples into appropriately labeled containers with fixative (approx. 4% formaldehyde) and ensure robust labeling for transport.
  - Environmental data collection (macroinvertebrate sample area)
    - Record site width, depth, hydraulic characteristics, substrate, and surrounding land use; capture site photographs; complete RIVPACS Environmental Data forms.
  - Water chemistry
    - Field measurements of conductivity and pH; on-site filtration for SRP, TON, and alkalinity using 0.45 µm filters; proper labeling of sample bottles and submission in envelopes for CEH analyses.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 500 m RHS reach centered on the macroinvertebrate sampling point; 2003 RHS protocol used; data captured via RAPID on Tablet PC with on-site validation.
    - Complete 17-section RHS data entry, including spot-checks, physical attributes, bank features, channel vegetation, and overall channel characteristics.
  - Aquatic macrophyte survey (MTR)
    - 100 m reach around the macroinvertebrate site; record presence/cover of submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species on a 9-point cover scale.
    - Wading and grappling used where appropriate; specimens sampled for lab confirmation when needed; rare species flagged for special handling.
  - Data capture systems
    - RIVPACS Sample Area Form for macroinvertebrates and site data.
    - RHS data captured in RAPID (River Habitat Survey field system) for real-time validation and relocation.
    - Macrophyte data captured in IRIS (in-field aquatic plant data entry); plant specimens may be sent to experts for confirmation; plant identification guided by standard references.
  - Pond condition procedures
    - Pond boundary delineation, boundary sketch, area estimation, drawdown height, and water area calculations.
    - Water turbidity estimation prior to disturbance; turbidity categories: clear, moderately clear, moderately turbid, turbid.
    - Environmental survey including amenity use and land-use around ponds; macrophyte surveys across the entire pond area when possible; specimen handling for plant ID confirmation.
    - Transport and storage: CEH-specific transit instructions, TREM cards for transport of formalin-fixed samples, and monthly dispatch to CEH Dorset.

- Quality control and assurance
  - All field staff hold recognized RHS and macroinvertebrate sampling certifications; training in MTR aquatic plant surveying and chemical sampling.
  - Regular team rotation to maintain technique consistency; approximately 7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff.
  - Field survey checklists used to ensure completion of tasks; on-site data validation through RAPID and IRIS.
  - Clear data validation steps to catch missing fields or inconsistencies before leaving the site.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Standardized formats and data flows ensure cross-site comparability and traceability of samples from field to lab.
  - On-site data entry reduces post-field data handling errors; validation steps (RAPID/IRIS) ensure data quality prior to submission.
  - Integration of multiple data streams (biological, physical habitat, chemistry, and land-use context) supports robust environmental health assessments and policy performance analysis over time.
  - Data accessibility and re-use: datasets are prepared for transfer to CEH laboratories and, ultimately, to national data portals for broader scrutiny and use.

- Foundational challenges and opportunities
  - Challenge: increasing the value of datasets by combining monitoring data with other relevant data sources and making underlying data accessible for broader use.
  - Opportunity: standardized, machine-readable data collection and on-site validation pave the way for enhanced data integration, interoperability, and downstream policy evaluation.

- Pond-specific notes (overview)
  - Ponds are mapped and classified by size and winter water level; cysts of a single survey pond per square, with macrophyte, environmental, and water chemistry assessments.
  - Sampling guided by safety considerations in pond environments; field protocols emphasize safety planning and appropriate PPE.

- Outputs and documentation
  - Comprehensive field sheets and digital forms (RIVPACS, RHS via RAPID, IRIS for macrophytes) support traceable data lineage from field to analysis.
  - Detailed pond condition recording sheets and macrophyte survey forms provide a structured record for future re-surveys and comparisons.

- Endnotes and governance
  - The CS2007 program is part of a broader UK Countryside Survey initiative with CEH-led coordination, field training, and data handling practices designed to ensure data quality and comparability across years and sites.
