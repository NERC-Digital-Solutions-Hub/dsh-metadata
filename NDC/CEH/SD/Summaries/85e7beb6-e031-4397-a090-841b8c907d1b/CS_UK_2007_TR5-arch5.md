# HEADWATERS

- Purpose and scope
  - Countryside Survey 2007 headwater component to re-survey 425 headwater squares and survey one pond per square (where present), capturing macroinvertebrates, aquatic plants, hydromorphology, and water chemistry to assess biological condition across GB headwaters.
  - Integrates multiple data streams (RIVPACS macroinvertebrates, RHS hydromorphology, MTR macrophytes, and water chemistry) using standardized protocols for long-term comparability.

- Data collection standards and protocols
  - Macroinvertebrate sampling
    - Sample area: single continuous stretch 5–15 m; three-minute active kick sampling plus one minute manual search.
    - Equipment: pond-net (900 μm mesh), sample handling into labeled pots/bags; fixed with 40% formalin to ~4% formaldehyde; multiple containers for large samples.
    - Documentation: RIVPACS Sample Area Form with site, date, NGR, method, time, width, depth, substrate, habitat types, and photographs; sample area map sketch for relocation.
  - Water chemistry and field measurements
    - On-site measurements: pH and conductivity (Hanna Combi meter); SRP, TON, and alkalinity via on-site filtration (0.45 μm filters) into a 50 ml bottle; meticulous labeling and chain-of-custody.
  - Environmental data and site data capture
    - RIVPACS Sample Area Form collects width, depth (at ¼, ½, ¾), velocity category, substrate, bed stability, channel vegetation, and surrounding habitats across the full sampling width.
    - RHS data captured via RAPID (field digital system) to record hydromorphology, spot-checks, and 500 m sampling reach; built-in validation checks.
  - River Habitat Survey (RHS)
    - 500 m reach centered on the macroinvertebrate site; 2003 RHS protocol used; integrated via RAPID for real-time validation and consistency.
  - Aquatic plant and macrophyte data
    - Macrophyte (MTR) survey in 100 m reach; record presence and percent cover for submerged, floating-leaved, and emergent species; standardized cover categories; specimen collection for difficult identifications.
    - IRIS system used for aquatic plant data entry; includes species lists, cover values, and physical site data with validation.
  - Data quality assurance
    - Field staff hold Environment Agency RHS certification; training in RIVPACS macroinvertebrates, MTR plant surveying, and chemical sampling; regular team rotation to maintain consistency.
    - ~7% of headwater sites audited by CEH staff; on-site data validation before leaving site; field survey checklists completed collaboratively.
  - Data handling and transport
    - Samples labeled and stored in transport boxes with TREM (transport emergency) cards; routine dispatch to CEH Dorset for processing (6–8 macroinvertebrate pots per box); plant specimens also sent for ID confirmation.
    - Documentation and field notes maintained; data entered into on-site digital systems (RAPID for RHS, IRIS for plants) to minimize transcription errors.

- Data governance, metadata, and data lifecycle
  - Metadata and traceability
    - Each data point tied to CS square, pond/stream name, date, exact NGR, and surveyors; photographs linked to sampling points; relocation boards (M, RHS, MTR) included in field photos for future site relocation.
  - Data interoperability and standards
    - Uses consistent, published field methods (RIVPACS, RHS 2003, MTR) to ensure comparability across years and sites; data structures aligned with CS2007 field forms and RAPID/IRIS data-entry schemas.
  - Data validation and quality control
    - On-site checks via RAPID/IRIS; missing data prompts; data validation completed before submission; data audits of headwater sites; cross-checks between macros, plants, and environmental data to ensure consistency.

- Practical considerations and challenges
  - Logistical and safety considerations
    - Sampling sites may be high-risk; sampling may be halted if multiple risk factors are present; field teams assess access, flow conditions, substrate stability, and livestock presence.
  - Coverage and sampling decisions
    - Sampling design aims to capture representative habitat breadth; 5–15 m macroinvertebrate sampling areas; 500 m RHS reach; 100 m MTR macrophyte survey length centered on invert sampling site.
  - Rare species and taxonomic challenges
    - Rare taxa identified with caution; representative samples sent to specialists; formal ID confirmation protocols in place; emphasis on meticulous specimen handling and labeling.

- Pond condition survey component (overview)
  - When ponds exist within a square, mapping of ponds occurs first; one pond per square selected as the survey pond.
  - Key measurements and activities
    - Preliminary pond mapping, boundary delineation, and photographic records; sketch outline and area estimation; drawdown height and proportion of water area present.
    - Turbidity estimation and water chemistry (pH, conductivity, SRP/TON/Alkalinity) with on-site filtration; use of 50 ml bottles and standardized labeling.
    - Macrophyte survey within the outer pond boundary (100 m survey length for plants) with species lists, abundance estimates, and documentation for difficult IDs (with specimens sent for confirmation as needed).
    - Habitat and pollution assessments, inflows/outflows, pond management history, and surrounding land use; amenity value and public access considerations.
  - Data capture and submission
    - Macrophyte and pond environmental data recorded on CS2007 pond fieldsheets; specimens packaged and sent to Pond Conservation; photographs cataloged; field survey checklists completed; data and forms archived and shared per CS2007 procedures.

- Archiving and dissemination
  - Field data, samples, and plant specimens stewarded by CEH, Pond Conservation, and associated partners; monthly courier and reporting to CEH Dorset; broader dissemination via the Countryside Survey program.

- Core references and methodological basis
  - River Habitat Survey (Environment Agency 2003), RIVPACS methodology (Holmes et al. 1999), Mean Trophic Rank (Holmes et al. 1999), and supporting manuals for macroinvertebrate sample collection and habitat assessment.
