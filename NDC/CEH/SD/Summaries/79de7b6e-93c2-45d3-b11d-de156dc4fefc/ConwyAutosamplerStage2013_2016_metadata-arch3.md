# Experimental design/Sampling regime

- Purpose and scope: 15-minute river stage height measurements at 6 river monitoring stations in the Conwy catchment, North Wales, with water temperature also sampled at Cwm Llanerch. Data span: 2013–2016, collected for the NERC project NE/J011991/1. Gaps exist due to equipment/battery or system failures.
- Sites and parameters (with coordinates):
  - Cwm Llanerch: lat 53.106627, lon -3.7916149; parameters: water level (mm), water temperature (°C)
  - Glasgwm: lat 53.027723, lon -3.8462502; parameters: water level (mm)
  - Nant y Brwyn: lat 52.990162, lon -3.8018288; parameters: water level (mm)
  - Nant y Coed: lat 53.049063, lon -3.7183329; parameters: water level (mm)
  - Hiraethlyn: lat 53.204355, lon -3.7827381; parameters: water level (mm)
  - Dyffryn Mymbyr: lat 53.089587, lon -3.9718091; parameters: water level (mm)
- Collection cadence:
  - Water level: measured every 10 seconds by pressure transducers; hourly/15-minute means logged every 15 minutes.
  - Temperature (only at Cwm Llanerch): measured and logged similarly.
  - Data are downloaded to field laptops and uploaded to an Access database.
- Field instrumentation and rationale:
  - Most sites used Druck PDCR 1830 pressure transducers with Campbell CR10 data loggers.
  - Cwm Llanerch used Campbell CS451 pressure transducer with Campbell CR1000 data logger (due to discontinuation of CR10x/PDCR kit and availability at the time).
  - Pressure transducers located in still wells at the channel edge; kit substitutions occurred because original equipment was no longer available.
- Calibration:
  - PDCR 1830 sensors calibrated with Druck DPI 510 at CEH Wallingford (2013).
  - CS451 sensor at Cwm Llanerch factory-calibrated prior to deployment.
- Data quality and validation:
  - Regular site visits and data downloads; data visually checked for obvious issues.
  - Common issue: periods with no data due to power failures, resolved by battery changes during site visits.
- Data recorded and units:
  - Stage_ht_mm: water height above transducer (mm)
  - Battery_volt: logger/transducer power supply voltage (V)
  - Temp_degC (only at Cwm Llanerch): water temperature (°C)
- Data structure and file organization:
  - Data stored as site-specific CSV files; file names indicate site and time span (e.g., 2013–2016).
  - Non-Cwm Llanerch sites: 5 columns per file (ID, Date, Time, Stage_ht_mm, Battery_volt).
  - Cwm Llanerch: includes an extra Temp_degC column.
- Supporting data and metadata:
  - Start and end data ranges provided for each site (e.g., Cwm Llanerch 12/03/201? to 03/02/2016; several sites 2013–2016).
  - Supporting coordinates documented for all sites to enable geospatial provenance.
- Data governance and accessibility (implications for monitoring frameworks):
  - Data are organized for traceability and reuse (site-specific CSVs, clear column definitions, calibration notes).
  - Potential barriers for broader sharing include data gaps, equipment changes over time, and metadata completeness, which are addressed through documented calibration, QA processes, and structured data formats.
