# Description

## What was recorded and what form does the data take?
- Records of offspring production for 192 female cockroaches (Blaptica dubia).
- Counted the number of nymphs produced by each female in up to two clutches; data entered into a spreadsheet.

## Where data collected
- University of Aberdeen Zoology building ground floor insectary.

## When data collected
- 29/12/23 to 23/01/24.

## How data collected
- Each female stored in an individual box with food, hydration, and shelter.
- Checked twice a week; counted offspring and removed them after counting.

## Why data collected
- Part of the project "The evolution and plasticity of social networks traits" to determine fitness consequences of social network position at different humidities.

## Who collected and interpreted data
- Collection: Callum McLean (research associate), Georgia Cash (PhD student), and David Fisher (PI).
- Interpretation: McLean and Fisher.

## Completeness
- All females have brood records.
- 40/192 produced a non-zero brood one; 1/192 produced a non-zero brood two.
- If zero for a brood, no date recorded and the cell is NA.

## Methods
- 192 females mated with two males over two weeks at 28C and ~50% humidity.
- Two paper tags affixed to backs for identification.
- Transferred to Binder incubator at 28C with either 50% (n=96) or 30% (n=96) humidity for two weeks (the experimental period), during which social associations were recorded in groups of 24.
- Returned to 28C/50% humidity in individual containers; number of nymphs checked twice weekly.
- Monitoring continued for 10 weeks; no female produced offspring in 10 days.

  - date1: date of the first brood (NA if none)
  - nymphs2: number of nymphs produced in the second brood (0 if none)
  - date2: date of the second brood (NA if none)
  - total_off: sum of nymphs and nymphs2
