# Description

- What was recorded and in what form
  - Records of offspring production for 192 female cockroaches (Blaptica dubia)
  - Counted the number of nymphs produced in up to two clutches; entered into a spreadsheet

- Where were the data collected
  - University of Aberdeen Zoology building, ground floor insectary

- When were the data collected
  - 29/12/23 to 23/01/24

- How were the data collected
  - Each female housed in an individual box with food, hydration, and shelter
  - Checked twice a week; counted offspring and removed them
  - Zero offspring recorded as 0; no date recorded for zero brood (NA)

- Why were the data collected
  - Part of the project “The evolution and plasticity of social networks traits”
  - Aimed to determine fitness consequences of social network position at different humidities

- Who was responsible for collection and interpretation
  - Data collection: Callum McLean, PhD student Georgia Cash, and Principal Investigator David Fisher
  - Data interpretation: McLean and Fisher

- Completeness
  - All females have brood records
  - 40/192 produced non-zero brood 1; 1/192 produced non-zero brood 2
  - NA used where no date exists for a brood

- Methods (experimental design and procedure)
  - 192 females mated with two males over two weeks at 28C and ~50% humidity
  - Two paper tags affixed to backs for identification
  - Two-week experimental period at either 50% or 30% humidity (randomly assigned; groups of 24)
  - Post-exposure, females returned to 28C 50% humidity in individual containers
  - Offspring counts taken twice weekly for 10 weeks; by week 10, no female had offspring in the preceding 10 days

- Metadata (dataset schema)
  - Column headings and descriptions:
    - unique_ID: unique identifier for each female
    - humidity: humidity level during the experimental period (50% or 30%)
    - label: tag used for visual identification
    - group: social group identifier
    - nymphs: number of nymphs produced in the first brood (0 if none)
    - date1: date of the first brood (NA if none)
    - nymphs2: number of nymphs produced in the second brood (0 if none)
    - date2: date of the second brood (NA if none)
    - total_off: total offspring produced (sum of nymphs and nymphs2)
