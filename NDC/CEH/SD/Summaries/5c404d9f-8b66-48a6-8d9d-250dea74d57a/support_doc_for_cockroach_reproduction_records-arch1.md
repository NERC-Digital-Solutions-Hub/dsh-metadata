# Records of offspring production for 192 female cockroaches (Blaptica dubia)

## Overview
- Records the number of nymphs produced by 192 female cockroaches, counted for up to two broods per female and recorded in a spreadsheet.
- Data describe offspring output under different humidity treatments within a controlled experimental setup.

## Data collection details
- Location: University of Aberdeen Zoology building ground floor insectary.
- Timeframe: 29 December 2023 to 23 January 2024.
- Procedure: Each female housed individually with food, water, and shelter; checked twice weekly to count offspring, which were then removed.

## Purpose and context
- Part of the project “The evolution and plasticity of social networks traits.”
- Aim: determine fitness consequences of social network position at different humidity levels.

## Experimental design
- Subjects: 192 females mated with two males over two weeks at 28°C and ~50% humidity.
- Tagging: Two paper tags affixed to each female for identification.
- Humidity treatments: After mating, females placed in incubator at 28°C with either 50% humidity (n=96) or 30% humidity (n=96) for two weeks.
- Post-treatment: All females returned to 28°C at 50% humidity in individual containers.
- Follow-up: Offspring (nypms) counted twice weekly for 10 weeks; after this period, no offspring were produced in the final 10 days.

## Data fields and completeness
- Completeness: All females have brood data; 40/192 produced a non-zero brood1, and 1/192 produced a non-zero brood2.
- Handling zeros: If a brood produced zero offspring, there is no date recorded (NA used for the corresponding date).
- Key columns: unique_ID, humidity, label, group, nymphs, date1, nymphs2, date2, total_off.

## Metadata and data structure
- nymphs: number of offspring in the first brood.
- date1: date of the first brood (NA if none).
- nymphs2: number of offspring in the second brood.
- date2: date of the second brood (NA if none).
- total_off: total offspring (sum of nymphs and nymphs2).

## Data quality and provenance
- Data collected by: Callum McLean (research associate), Georgia Cash (PhD student), and David Fisher (PI).
- Interpretation primarily by McLean and Fisher.
- Data intended for reuse and comparability, with explicit metadata describing experimental conditions and outcomes.
