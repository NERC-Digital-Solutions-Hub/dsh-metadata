# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

- Dataset overview: Global positioning system (GPS) locations for instruments and features tied to wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table (SET) installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats; includes surface elevation relative to a rod SET instrument on local benchmarks and depths of sediment above marker horizons adjacent to the SET benchmark.
- Staff responsible: Tom Spencer, Ben Evans.
- Study locations and habitat descriptions:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM) representing contrasting habitats and sediment types.
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), representing contrasting sediment types.
  - Saltmarsh: two contrasting soil types in Essex (clay) and Morecambe Bay (sandy).
  - Mudflat: Essex (cohesive clays, mud, silt) vs. Morecambe Bay (coarse, mobile sediments).
- Monitoring cadence: Twice within a 1-year monitoring period.
- Observed variables:
  - Heights at pins 1–9.
  - Horizon depths at cores 1–3.
  - SET-related readings and associated metadata (e.g., SET number, horizon depths, notes).
- Measurement procedures and standards:
  - Monitoring stations installed autumn 2012.
  - Rod Surface Elevation Table (rSET) used to enable inter-comparability with a globally standardized method (see Cahoon et al. 2002; USGS SET reference).
  - Benchmarks driven to refusal; receivers bolted and top of rod cemented into protective pipes around the benchmark.
  - Measurements taken every 3–6 months around the benchmark within four quadrants and nine pins per quadrant.
  - 50 cm x 50 cm feldspar marker horizons installed just beyond instrument reach; depth of sediment above horizon measured via coring; horizontal horizon corrections via averaging measurements if not perfectly horizontal.
  - If horizon depth < 1 mm, recorded as 0 mm; if horizon not detectable, recorded as NA.
  - Notes on readings captured in spreadsheets to reflect potentially significant factors.
- GPS and coordinate details:
  - Coordinates for SET benchmarks per site provided; accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions; OSGB1936 coordinate system used.
  - GPS locations of benchmarks and marker horizons are contained in the associated dataset CBESS_gps_wave_transects.
- Calibration and data handling:
  - Real-time Leica RTK corrections used where applicable.
  - Data were entered into Excel spreadsheets; dataset field descriptions and header/row metadata documented.
  - Calibration references: Cahoon et al. (2002) on high-precision wetland elevation measurements.
- Data schema and metadata:
  - Comprehensive dataset field descriptions covering season, location, site, habitat, quadrats, scales, records, dates, times, SET numbers, pin readings (1–9), horizon depths (core 1–3), notes, and provenance.
  - Multiple levels of categorization (Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat, Scale) to support filtering and interoperability.
- Data governance considerations for reuse:
  - Data stewardship need to maintain interoperability across sites and formats, ensure timely transfer from field to dataset, and uphold metadata completeness.
  - Clear provenance linking between CBESS_gps_wave_transects and this dataset ensures traceability.
- References and external sources:
