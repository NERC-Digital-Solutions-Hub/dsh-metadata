# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview
- Dataset documenting GPS locations for instruments and features related to wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table (SET) installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.
- Includes benchmark rods, SET installations, marker horizons, and associated metadata for inter-comparability.

## Locations and habitats
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Habitats: Saltmarsh (two soil types in Essex—clay; and sandy soils in Morecambe Bay) and Mudflat (Essex clays; Morecambe sands).
- Site-level differences in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Instrumentation and measurements
- Rod Surface Elevation Table (SET) installations with benchmark rods driven into substrate autumn 2012.
- Measurements taken at nine pins per SET, in four quadrants, at 3–6 month intervals over a 1-year monitoring period.
- Marker horizons: 50 cm × 50 cm potsher horizons of potash feldspar installed beyond reach of the instrument arm; depth of sediment above horizon measured.
- Precision: Pin measurement confidence intervals ±4.3 mm (as per Cahoon et al. 2002).

## Data collection and processing
- GPS coordinates of SET benchmarks collected with Leica GS08 GNSS; accuracy better than 50 mm; coordinates in OSGB1936.
- Observations recorded in Excel spreadsheets; notes on significant factors included with readings.
- Horizon depths: average depths used when horizons are not perfectly horizontal; horizons not detectable recorded as NA or 0 mm where appropriate.
- Calibration: real-time Leica RTK corrections where applicable; methodology aligned with Rod Surface Elevation Table standards (Cahoon et al. 2002).

## Dataset structure and fields
- Data described by fields such as Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat, Scale (A-D), Record, Date, Time, SET Number, Pin 1–9 readings, Marker horizon depth (Core 1–3), and Notes.
- Related GPS dataset: CBESS_gps_wave_transects contains GPS locations of benchmarks and horizons.

## Quality, scope and limitations
- Data collected over a 1-year period with multiple measurement rounds.
- NA values indicate measurements not performed or horizon not detectable.
- Designed for cross-site comparability using standardized SET methodologies; some field data remain contingent on site conditions.

## Access and references
- Data stored in Excel spreadsheets; dataset field descriptions available.
