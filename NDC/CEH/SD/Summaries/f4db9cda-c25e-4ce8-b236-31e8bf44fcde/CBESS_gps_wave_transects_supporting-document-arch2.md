Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) GPS locations for instruments and features associated with wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

## Overview
- Dataset documenting GPS locations for instruments and features used in wave monitoring and sedimentation-erosion table (SET) installations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.
- Focuses on surface elevation relative to rod SET (rSET) instruments and sediment depths above feldspar marker horizons adjacent to rSET benchmarks.
- Staff: Tom Spencer and Ben Evans.

## Study sites and habitat context
- Locations:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM)
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS)
- Habitat types:
  - Saltmarsh and mudflat with contrasting soil types (Essex: clay soils; Morecambe Bay: sandy soils)
- Environmental contrasts:
  - Essex vs Morecambe Bay differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation
  - Mudflat sites differ in sediment characteristics (Essex: cohesive clays/mud/silt; Morecambe: coarse, mobile sediments)

## Observational design and timing
- Monitoring approach: standardized rod Surface Elevation Table (rSET) framework to enable inter-comparability.
- Installation timing: autumn 2012.
- Monitoring cadence: measurements taken twice over a 1-year period; typical re-measurement intervals are 3–6 months.
- Benchmarking: SET benchmarks driven into substrate; receivers attached and top of rod cemented into surrounding pipes.

## Variables and measurements
- Primary measurements:
  - Heights at nine pins (Pin 1–9) around the SET
  - Horizon depths at three marker horizons (Core 1–3)
- Marker horizons: 50 cm × 50 cm potash feldspar horizons installed just beyond instrument reach; depth of sediment above horizons measured in cores.
- Data notes: recordings include context notes on readings; some cores may have missing horizon data (NA).

## Instrumentation and procedures
- Instrumentation: Rod Surface Elevation Table (rSET) with receivers around benchmark rods.
- Reference framework: aligns with Cahoon et al. (2002) standard for high-precision wetland sediment elevation measurements.
- Field procedures: markers installed; cores taken to assess sediment depth relative to horizons; measurements logged with attention to measurement conditions and potential influencing factors.
- Accuracy: GPS coordinates with accuracy better than 50 mm in all directions; OSGB1936 coordinate system.

## Data management and formats
- Data storage: observations recorded in Excel spreadsheets; NA indicates missing measurements.
- Calibration and positioning: real-time Leica RTK corrections used where applicable; coordinates provided for SET benchmarks and horizons in the associated dataset.
- Dataset identifiers:
  - Main dataset: CBESS_gps_wave_transects
  - Data format: tabular (Excel) with fields for season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale, reading records, dates, times, and readings.

## Dataset contents and field structure
- Core descriptive fields include:
  - Season, Location (Morecambe or Essex), Site (e.g., CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Mudflat or Saltmarsh)
  - Quadrat (1–22) and Scale (A–D; corresponding magnitudes)
  - Record number, Date, Time of day
  - SET Number (inland progression)
  - Pin readings (Pin 1–9) and Marker horizon depths (Core 1–3)
  - Notes/comments on readings
- Dataset field descriptions are provided to support data interpretation and analysis.

## Data accessibility and interoperability
- GPS locations and methodological details documented to support data sharing and cross-site comparisons.
- Dataset designed to be compatible with global SET monitoring standards and inter-site analyses.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy
- Supports consistent, comparable assessments of coastal sediment dynamics, sedimentation rates, and threats to coastal ecosystems.
- Enables integration with other CBESS and regional datasets to evaluate ecosystem services and biodiversity in coastal habitats.
- Addresses challenges of maximizing dataset value and enabling access to underlying data by standardizing formats and documentation.
