# Documentation for model code to simulate animal behaviour in response to light

- The dataset provides material to reproduce 3D volumetric data describing photon energy density in a simulated environment, plus heatmaps and journey lengths for ensembles of weighted walkers in those environments.
- It includes source code and configurations for two primary software components:
  - A Monte Carlo Radiative Transfer (MCRT) solver (Aetherus) to generate the 3D energy-density data.
  - A weighted random-walking (grid_walker) code to transform 2D plane data from the MCRT outputs into heatmaps and journey-length metrics.
- Outputs enable end users to explore photon-energy distributions and walker behaviours in the simulated scenes, supporting data reuse and further analysis.

- Collection/generation methods
  - Source packages:
    - MCRT solver: mcrt/aetherus-0.2.0.tar.gz with accompanying scripts
    - Weighted random walking: grid_walker-0.1.0.tar.gz
  - Input data organization (in/ directory) generated with multiple methods depending on file type; configuration files for MCRT/aetherus provided in JSON/JSON5; additional inputs and scripts supplied.
  - Light Intensity Distributions (LIDs): photometry data sourced from lamp manufacturers (IES or LDT) via goniophotometer measurements.
  - Geometry:
    - Terrain: Wavefront OBJ file terrain.obj generated by triangulating study plot bounds and elevating vertices using 1 m Defra National LIDAR data; specific DTM tile referenced.
    - Buildings: geometry generated via the same pipeline; building footprints from Ordnance Survey VectorMap Local; ground plane extruded by DSM observed differences from lidar data.
  - Spectral Reflectances: USGS Spectral Library v7; asphalt and brick materials used (e.g., GDS353, GDS367) converted to suitable input formats.
  - Emission Spectra: sourced from LICA-UCM spectral database and converted to JSON for MCRT input.
  
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Geometry: measured in metres; 1 geometry unit corresponds to 1 m.
  - Emission spectra and spectral reflectances: provided in relative units.
  - Photometric data: luminous intensities provided in candela.
  
- Quality control
  - MCRT code includes unit tests for individual components and comparisons against analytical predictions for weighted walking code where applicable.
  - Mesh integrity checks: watertight meshes and correctly oriented vertex normals.

- Data structure and contents
  - Three main components:
    - Input data for the MCRT code: configuration files, spectra (.csv), spectral reflectances (JSON), photometric data (.ldt/.ies), and geometry (.obj).
    - MCRT solver (0.2.0) with source code and binaries (Linux x86_64 and macOS Apple Silicon).
    - Grid_walker code (v0.1.0) source.
  - A directory of scripts to automate reproduction of results (scripts/).
  - Example file inventory includes various in/ subfolders (lids, objs, lights, mats, spec, refs) and grids, plus a comprehensive collection of Aetherus-related source files and utilities.
  - Note: the file listing contains some formatting artifacts in the metadata, but the structure indicates a full, self-contained reproducible package.
