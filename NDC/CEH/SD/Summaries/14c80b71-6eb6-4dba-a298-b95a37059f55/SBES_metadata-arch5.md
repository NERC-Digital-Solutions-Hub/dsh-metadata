- Discovery metadata
  - Files: SBES_2015.csv, SBES_2016.csv
  - Authors: Phil Ashworth, Andrew Nicholas, Dan Parsons, Greg Sambrook Smith, Chris Unsworth
  - Data: Water depths measured on the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in 2015 and 2016

- Dataset purpose and content
  - Aimed at characterizing spatial variations in water depth and river bed morphology
  - Data represent the boat track line along the river and indicate depth ranges affected by large-scale bars and dune bedforms

- Metadata and data structure
  - Context: three columns
    - Column 1: Measurement location UTM Easting (m)
    - Column 2: Measurement location UTM Northing (m)
    - Column 3: Water depth (m)

- Acquisition and instrumentation
  - Instruments: Navisound NS 215 system and Reson TC 2024 200 kHz high-resolution dual-frequency single beam echo sounder (SBES)
  - Sampling: 10 Hz
  - Geolocation: Leica 1230 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) dGPS
  - Platform: Small zodiac boat
  - Data samples: Represent the boat’s track line during transit

- Temporal and spatial coverage
  - Collection periods: 2015 (7–9 September) and 2016 (2–14 September)
  - Spatial frame: river segment along the South Saskatchewan River with UTM coordinates recorded

- Data quality and processing
  - Data were filtered to remove spikes and errors associated with water shallower than the instrument measurement range

- Governance and handling notes for Data Stewards
  - Documentation includes authorship and measurement methods to support provenance
  - Metadata specifies coordinate reference (UTM) and units for consistency
  - Data limitations include instrument depth range and potential temporal gaps due to field conditions
  - Considerations for sharing: ensure metadata remains aligned with dataset; plan for updates if additional years are added; maintain visibility of measurement instruments and processing steps in the metadata
  - Potential use cases: spatial analysis of depth variations and river bed morphology over the 2015–2016 period; suitable for integration with other bathymetric or hydrodynamic datasets

- Authentication and provenance
  - Clear attribution to dataset authors
  - Methodology and instrument details documented to support reproducibility and quality assessment
