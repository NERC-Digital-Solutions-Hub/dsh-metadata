# SBES_2015.csv, SBES_2016.csv

- Water depths measured along the South Saskatchewan River, Canada, for two survey periods: 2015 and 2016.
- Data collected to characterize spatial variations in water depth and river bed morphology, including large-scale bar forms and dune bedforms.

## Overview of the files
- Files: SBES_2015.csv and SBES_2016.csv
- Columns: three columns per record
  - Column 1: Measurement location UTM Easting (m)
  - Column 2: Measurement location UTM Northing (m)
  - Column 3: Water depth (m)

## Data collection and instruments
- Instruments: Navisound NS 215 system and Reson TC 2024 200 kHz high-resolution dual-frequency SBES
- Sampling rate: 10 Hz
- Geolocation: Leica 1230 RTK dGPS system
- Platform: small zodiac boat
- Data samples correspond to the boat’s track line (the path of transit along the river)

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- 2015 data collection: 7–9 September 2015
- 2016 data collection: 2–14 September 2016
- Spatial reference: UTM coordinates (Easting/Northing in meters)

## Purpose and interpretation
- Aimed to provide information about spatial variations in water depth and river bed morphology
- Depth variations reflect both submerged large-scale bar forms and smaller dune bedforms

## Data quality and processing
- Data were filtered to remove spikes and errors associated with depths shallower than the instrument’s measurement range

## Provenance and authors
