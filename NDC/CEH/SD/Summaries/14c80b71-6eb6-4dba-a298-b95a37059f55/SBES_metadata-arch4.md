# SBES_2015.csv, SBES_2016.csv

- Overview
  - Water depth measurements along the South Saskatchewan River, Canada, collected in 2015 and 2016.
  - Aimed at characterizing spatial variation in water depth and river-bed morphology.

- Data content and structure
  - Three data columns per record:
    - Column 1: Measurement location UTM Easting (meters)
    - Column 2: Measurement location UTM Northing (meters)
    - Column 3: Water depth (meters)
  - Files: SBES_2015.csv and SBES_2016.csv
  - Data samples represent the boat’s track line as it transited the river.

- Collection methods and instruments
  - Acoustic surveying: Navisound NS 215 system and Reson TC 2024 200 kHz high-resolution single beam echo sounder (SBES), sampling at 10 Hz.
  - Geolocation: Leica 1230 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) differential GPS.
  - Platform: Instruments mounted on and operated from a small zodiac boat.
  - Purpose: capture spatial variations in depth and infer river-bed features such as large-scale bars and dune bedforms.

- Data collection windows
  - 2015: 7–9 September
  - 2016: 2–14 September

- Data processing and quality
  - Spike removal and corrections for data shallower than instrument measurement range.
  - Data filtered to improve reliability before analysis.

- Authors and provenance
  - Phil Ashworth, Andrew Nicholas, Dan Parsons, Greg Sambrook Smith, Chris Unsworth

- Relevance for data governance and use
  - Provides a structured, geolocated depth dataset suitable for spatial analysis and morphology studies.
  - Clear metadata on instruments, sampling frequency, and processing steps supports reproducibility and data quality assessment.
