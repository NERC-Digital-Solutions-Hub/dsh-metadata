# SBES_2015.csv, SBES_2016.csv

- Overview
  - Water depth measurements on the South Saskatchewan River, Canada, for two field campaigns: 2015 and 2016.
  - Aimed at capturing spatial variations in water depth and river bed morphology along boat transects.

- Data content and structure
  - Three columns per file:
    - Measurement location UTM Easting (m)
    - Measurement location UTM Northing (m)
    - Water depth (m)
  - Data represent a boat 'track line' collected along the river.

- Measurement methodology
  - Instruments: Navisound NS 215 system and Reson TC 2024 200 kHz high-resolution SBES.
  - Sampling: 10 Hz.
  - Geolocation: Leica 1230 RTK differential GPS.
  - Platform: Small zodiac boat.
  - Purpose: Map depth range and infer spatial variations due to large-scale bars and dune bedforms.

- Temporal coverage
  - 2015: 7–9 September
  - 2016: 2–14 September

- Data processing and quality control
  - Spike filtering and removal of data where water depth was shallower than the instrument’s measurement range.

- Purpose and interpretation
  - Provide information on spatial depth variation and support interpretations of bedform morphology (bars and dunes) in the South Saskatchewan River.

- Data quality, provenance, and storage
  - Data were collected by named authors (see below) and prepared for standardized use.
  - Datasets are stored and intended to be uploaded to appropriate data portals as part of standard monitoring practices.
