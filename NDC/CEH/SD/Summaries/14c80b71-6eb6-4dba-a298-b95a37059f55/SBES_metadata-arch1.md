# SBES_2015.csv, SBES_2016.csv

## Overview
- Data files contain water depth measurements along the South Saskatchewan River, Canada, collected in 2015 and 2016.
- Purpose: to characterize spatial variations in water depth and river bed morphology.

## Data format
- Three columns:
  - Column 1: Measurement location UTM Easting (meters)
  - Column 2: Measurement location UTM Northing (meters)
  - Column 3: Water depth (meters)

## Methods and instruments
- Depth measurements obtained with Navisound NS 215 system and Reson TC 2024 200 kHz high-resolution dual-frequency single beam echo sounder (SBES), sampled at 10 Hz.
- Geolocation via Leica 1230 Real-Time Kinematic (RTK) differential GPS (dGPS).
- Instruments mounted on and operated from a small zodiac boat.
- Data samples represent the boat’s track line (the path followed in transit along the river).

## Temporal and geographic scope
- 2015 data collection: 7–9 September 2015
- 2016 data collection: 2–14 September 2016
- Location: South Saskatchewan River, Canada

## Data processing and quality
- Data filtered to remove spikes and errors associated with shallower-than-range measurements of the instrument.

## Content and interpretive notes
- Data indicate the range of water depths and reflect variations due to submerged large-scale bar forms and smaller dune bedforms.
- Along-track measurements provide a picture of depth variation along boat transects, not a gridded surface.

## Practical use and considerations
- Useful for analyzing spatial depth variation and inferring river bed morphology patterns.
- Requires consideration of along-track nature and temporal scope (specific dates) when applying to broader spatial or temporal questions.
