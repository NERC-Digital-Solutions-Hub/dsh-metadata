# Social surveys carried out in Chinese rural villages to the local stakeholders to understand their knowledge learning dynamics and preference

## Overview
- Purpose: Document social surveys in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province (Loess Plateau), 2019 to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local farmers and village leaders.
- Aim for data leaders: Capture user needs for data-informed farming support, enabling co-ownership of data products and informing data strategy.

## Survey Design and Participants
- Experimental design: Cross-sectional social surveys using questionnaires with closed and open-ended items.
- Location and sampling: Changwu County and surrounding villages with research stations; participants include village leaders and individual farmers.
- Sample size: 167 farmers and 11 village leaders; selection based on village population and stakeholder support.
- Respondent scope: Farmers and village leaders from surveyed towns/villages.

## Data Collection Tools and Procedures
- Instruments: Questionnaires comprising multiple questions (closed and open-ended).
- Data structure: Two CSV files in Survey_Changwu.zip:
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv (55kb)
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv (8kb)
- Data quality notes: Calibration steps and formal quality control are not provided (N/A).

## Data Files and Content
- Farmers dataset (For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv):
  - Contains responses to Q1–Q30, plus demographic and farming practice items.
  - Topics include village origin, gender, age, education, years farming, learning sources, learning approaches, usefulness of knowledge sources, soil erosion knowledge, training needs, barriers to participation, productivity drivers, and environmental concerns.
- Village leaders dataset (For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv):
  - Contains responses related to representation, perceived farmer pressures, preferred support for practice changes, advice to farmers, training/sharing methods, collaboration with scientists and higher government, policy implementation, monitoring, regulation, and farmer interest.

## Detailed Question Sets (Illustrative)
- Farmers (selected examples):
  - Q1–Q3: village origin, gender, age; Q4: education level; Q5: length of family farming; Q6–Q7: current learning sources and methods; Q8–Q11: perceived helpfulness of knowledge from family, peers, government, and shops; Q12–Q14: exposure to soil-related terms and erosion knowledge; Q16–Q29: productivity drivers, barriers, training needs, government support, environment practices, and environmental issues.
  - Q25–Q27: barriers to participation, concerns about food production rates, and biggest farming challenges.
- Village Leaders (selected examples):
  - Q1–Q4: village/town represented, greatest farmer pressures, best form of support, and types of advice provided.
  - Q5–Q7: modes of sharing advice, collaboration with scientists, and potential benefits of higher-level government involvement.
  - Q8–Q15: monitoring policy implementation, regulation of farming activities, and policy-related outcomes.

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Limitations
- Calibration and fieldwork specifics are not documented (N/A).
- No explicit quality control procedures described.
- Data are self-reported and cross-sectional; potential biases in respondent responses and coverage limited to participating villages.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Provides a rich baseline of user needs, training preferences, and information sources relevant to data strategy and extension activities.
- Enables assessment of data gaps (e.g., understanding of soil erosion, red soil knowledge, and training effectiveness) and informs prioritization of data collection efforts.
- Supports development of data products and dissemination practices aligned with farmer and leader needs, including potential co-ownership and stakeholder collaboration.
- Offers insights into how farmers interact with various information channels and the perceived usefulness of different knowledge sources, useful for designing data-informed outreach and policy support.
