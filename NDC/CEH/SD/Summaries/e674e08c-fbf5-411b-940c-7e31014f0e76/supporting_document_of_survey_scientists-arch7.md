# Supporting information for interpreting

- The document describes a questionnaire survey of British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge management (KM) methods used in environment research. The British sample is used as a comparator because the UK is more experienced in KE research than China.
- The aim is to understand how scientists transfer knowledge to users (e.g., policymakers, practitioners, public) and how knowledge exchange (KE) and co-production practices are adopted in the field.

## Collection methods

- Participants:
  - Chinese (n = 27) and British (n = 16) scientists working on a joint International Critical Zone (CZ) project.
  - An additional 41 general Chinese environmental scientists surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China, to assess representativeness of the wider Chinese environmental science community.
- Recruitment:
  - Voluntary responses collected during project meetings or via email circulation.
  - Additional responses gathered at a conference.

## Calibration, fieldwork, instrumentation

- N/A (Not applicable).

## Analytical methods

## Nature and units of recorded values

- Questionnaire data.

## Details of data structure

- The dataset folder SurveyScientists contains 3 CSV files:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (6 kb): survey results from geo-scientists who attended the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
  - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv (5 kb): survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZO programme.
  - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv (7 kb): survey results from 7 British CZO scientists collected via email.
- Data format:
  - Each file contains responses to a set of questions labeled Q1, Q2, ..., Q12, with corresponding answer definitions (e.g., 1=China, 2=UK; 1=Yes, 2=No; etc.).
  - Some questions include sub-items (e.g., Q3, Q6, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11) to capture types of knowledge transfer activities, outputs, involvement with end users, processes, and training interest.

## Dataset contents and question topics

- Q1: Geographic base (China, UK, Other).
- Q2: Prior experience with knowledge transfer to users during research career.
- Q3: Types of knowledge transfer conducted if Q2 is Yes (or note absence if No).
- Q4: Prior awareness of knowledge exchange and/or co-production concepts.
- Q5: Examples of different knowledge transfer activities (who, how, outputs).
- Q6: Types of knowledge transfer outputs produced (e.g., policy briefing, best practice guidance, webinars, training, decision-support tools, technical reports, etc.).
- Q7: Whether outputs were made with end users (co-produced) or for end users (traditional/hybrid) or not at all.
- Q8: Knowledge exchange processes used (e.g., co-designed questions, co-produced outputs, participatory workshops, secondments in end-user organizations).
- Q9: Whether KE activities’ success has been measured, and by whom.
- Q10: Perceived possibility of using a KE approach in the project; explanation requested.
- Q11: Interest in using KE/co-production if concepts were new; options include Yes, No, Maybe, or Not applicable.
- Q12: Interest in further training on KE techniques.

## Potential uses for GIS specialists

- The data describe where respondents come from (UK vs China) and their engagement with KE, which can be mapped to compare regional approaches to knowledge transfer and co-production.
- Mapping opportunities:
  - Visualize geographic distribution of respondents and their KE experience (Q1, Q2, Q9) across countries.
  - Chart prevalence of KE outputs (Q6) and collaboration with end users (Q7) by region.
  - Assess interest in KE training (Q12) across locations to inform GIS-enabled training program design.
- The combination of survey responses with organizational or project-level metadata could support map-based dashboards illustrating KE practices in environmental research across different scientific communities.
