# Supporting information for interpreting

## Overview
- Describes the experimental design, sampling regime, and data collection for questionnaire surveys of British and Chinese scientists investigating knowledge management (KM) methods in environment research.
- Aims to compare UK and China contexts to glean insights for knowledge exchange and co-production practices.

## Sampling and participants
- British scientists (n = 16) and Chinese scientists (n = 27) from a joint international critical zone (CZ) project participated.
- To assess representativeness, an additional 41 Chinese environmental scientists were surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
- Surveys were collected during project meetings or via email circulation; participation was voluntary.

## Data files and structure
- The dataset folder SurveyScientists contains 3 CSV files:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results from Geo Conference attendees)
  - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv (survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZO programme)
  - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv (survey results from 7 British CZO scientists via email)
- Each file contains responses to a single questionnaire with questions labeled Q1 to Q12 and defined response options.

## Questionnaire content and response coding (Q1–Q12)
- Q1: Base location (China, UK, Other)
- Q2: Whether the respondent has ever engaged in knowledge transfer/knowledge exchange (KTE)
- Q3: Types of knowledge transfer used (e.g., traditional, hybrid, knowledge exchange)
- Q4: Prior awareness of knowledge exchange and co-production terms
- Q5: Examples of KTE activities; collaborators and outputs
- Q6: Types of KTE outputs produced (e.g., policy briefs, best practice guidance, webinars, training, tools)
- Q7: Whether outputs were developed WITH end users or FOR end users, or not at all
- Q8: KTE processes used (e.g., co-designed research questions, co-produced outputs, participatory workshops, secondments)
- Q8a: Optional explanations for Q8
- Q9: Whether the success of KTE activities was measured, and by whom
- Q9a: Explanations if YES
- Q10: Perceived applicability of a KTE approach to the respondent’s project
- Q10a: Explanations
- Q11: Interest in using KE/co-production approaches if unfamiliar before
- Q11a: Explanations
- Q12: Interest in further training on KE techniques
- Q12a: Not applicable options and explanations where provided

## Data quality, provenance, and notes
- Quality control field: Not applicable (N/A)
- Data structure is described, withCSV files containing the question-response mappings and defined response categories
- Small-scale survey data intended for comparative analysis of KTE practices between UK and China within the CZ contexts

## Implications for data stewardship
- Documented provenance: three CSV datasets with explicit question numbers and response schemes facilitate traceability and re-use.
- Metadata considerations: ensure clear definitions of Q1–Q12, response codes, and any mapping between files to support interoperability.
- Representativeness and bias: voluntary sampling and differing sample sizes by group may affect generalizability; consider metadata on respondent groups in analyses.
- Data sharing and privacy: survey responses appear to be anonymized at the level of content; maintain appropriate privacy best practices if further disaggregating data.
