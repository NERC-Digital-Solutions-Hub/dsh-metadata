# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose
  - Describes the experimental design, sampling regime, collection methods, and data structure for surveys of British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge management (KM) methods in environment research.

- Experimental design / Sampling regime
  - Questionnaires aimed at understanding KM/knowledge transfer (KT) and knowledge exchange (KE) practices in environment research.
  - British scientists selected because the UK has more KE research experience; cross-country comparison with China expected to yield helpful insights.

- Collection methods
  - Survey participants:
    - Chinese (n = 27) and British (n = 16) scientists involved in a joint international critical zone (CZ) project.
    - Additional 41 general Chinese environmental scientists surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to assess representativeness of the Chinese responses.
  - Administration:
    - Volunteers completed surveys during project meetings or via email circulation; extended recruitment at the conference for broader representation.

- Calibration steps and values
  - Not applicable (N/A).

- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation
  - Not applicable (N/A).

- Analytical methods
  - Not applicable (N/A).

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - Questionnaire responses; coded responses (e.g., 1, 2, 3, etc.) corresponding to answer categories.

- Details of data structure
  - The dataset folder SurveyScientists contains 3 CSV files:
    - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results from geo-scientists at the 2017 Guizhou conference)
    - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv (survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZO programme)
    - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv (survey results from 7 British CZO scientists collected via email)
  - Data fields:
    - Q1 to Q12 questions with defined response options; some questions have subfields (e.g., Q3, Q6, Q7, Q8, Q9, Q10, Q11, Q12 and their a or a1 variants).

- Questionnaire structure (key points)
  - Q1: Baseline location (China, UK, Other)
  - Q2: Have you engaged in knowledge transfer to end users during your research career? (Yes/No)
  - Q3: If yes, which types of knowledge transfer have you done? (multiple)
  - Q4: Prior awareness of knowledge exchange and/or co-production
  - Q5: Examples of KT/KE activities and outputs
  - Q6: Types of KT/KE outputs produced (tick all)
  - Q6a: If “other,” explanation
  - Q7: Were outputs created WITH end users (co-produced), FOR end users (hybrid), or not at all?
  - Q7a: comments
  - Q8: KE processes used (tick all)
  - Q8a: if “other,” explanation
  - Q9: Whether KE activities’ success was measured; by whom; how
  - Q9a: explanation if measured
  - Q10: Feasibility of applying KE in the project; explanations
  - Q10a: elaboration
  - Q11: Interest in using KE approaches if new to the concept
  - Q11a: explanation
  - Q12: Interest in further training on KE techniques
  - Q12a: response

- Data quality and limitations (implied)
  - Voluntary response samples; potential representativeness concerns, especially for the broader Chinese scientist group.
  - Cross-country comparability may be influenced by cultural or institutional differences.
  - Data are self-reported and categorical; complex nuanced insights may require careful interpretation.

- Relevance for Data Leaders
  - Illustrates handling of multi-source, survey-based data across international teams.
  - Highlights the importance of clear metadata and consistent coding for complex multi-part questions.
  - Demonstrates structuring of datasets with multiple CSVs and extensive Q/Qa fields for downstream analysis.
  - Emphasizes consideration of response biases, representativeness, and cross-domain comparability when aggregating data to inform data strategy and governance.
