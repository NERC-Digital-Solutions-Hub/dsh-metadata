# Supporting information for interpreting

- Purpose: Questionnaire surveys with British and Chinese scientists to explore knowledge management (KM) methods used in environment research, comparing UK experience in KE research with China to derive helpful insights.
- Rationale for groups: British scientists chosen for their greater experience in KE research; comparison with Chinese scientists to contextualize findings.

## Experimental design and sampling regime

- Survey targets:
  - Chinese scientists (n = 27) and British scientists (n = 16) involved in a joint international critical zone (CZ) project.
- Extended sampling:
  - Additional 41 general Chinese environmental scientists surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to test representativeness of the initial Chinese responses.
- Objective: Assess whether survey responses from the joint project participants reflect broader trends within the Chinese environmental science community.

## Collection methods

- Participant recruitment:
  - Volunteers from project meetings or via email circulation for the CZ-related surveys.
  - Additional responses collected at a conference (Geochemistry Conference 2017) in China.
- Data format: Survey responses stored in three CSV files, each representing a different respondent group or collection method.

## Data structure and contents

- Datasets:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv: Responses from geoscientists attending the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
  - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv: Responses from Chinese and British scientists within the CZO programme.
  - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv: Responses from seven British CZO scientists collected via email.
- General structure:
  - Each dataset contains a sequence of questions (Q1, Q2, …, Q12) and corresponding response definitions (coded numerical options, e.g., 1, 2, 3, …).
- Notable question content:
  - Q1: Geographic base (codes: 1=China, 2=UK, 3=Other).
  - Q2: Prior experience with knowledge transfer to users (Yes/No).
  - Q3: Types of knowledge transfer used (Traditional, Hybrid, Knowledge Exchange, etc.).
  - Q4: Prior awareness of knowledge exchange and/or co-production.
  - Q5–Q6: Examples of KE activities and outputs produced (e.g., policy briefs, guidance, webinars, training, decision-support tools).
  - Q7: Whether outputs were made WITH end users (co-produced) or FOR end users (traditional/hybrid), or not at all.
  - Q8–Q8a: KE processes used (co-design, co-produced outputs, participatory workshops, secondments, other).
  - Q9–Q9a: Whether KE impact was measured and by whom.
  - Q10–Q10a, Q11–Q11a: Potential to apply KE in current project and attitudes toward KE adoption.
  - Q12: Interest in further KE training (Yes/No).

## Data quality and notes

- Calibration steps: Not applicable (N/A).
- Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation: N/A.
- Analytical methods: N/A.
- Data quality control: N/A.
- Data provenance and documentation: Clear labeling of datasets and explicit definitions for response options; structured around a common questionnaire format for comparability.

## Key considerations for analysts

- Scope and representativeness: Small, volunteer-based samples; cross-country comparison may be influenced by response bias or sectoral differences.
- Cross-dataset harmonization: Three CSV files may require alignment on question numbering and response coding for integrated analyses.
- Variables of interest: Patterns in types of knowledge transfer, prevalence of co-production vs. traditional KE, reported outputs, and whether KE activities were measured for impact.
- Potential analyses: Correlations between country and KE practices, association between prior KE experience and likelihood of co-production, relationship between KE outputs and measured impact, and attitudes toward future KE training.
