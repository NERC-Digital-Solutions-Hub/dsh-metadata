# Supporting information for interpreting

- Objective: Provide supplementary information for interpreting a study on knowledge management (KM) and knowledge transfer (KE) practices among environmental scientists; compare UK and China within a joint international CZ (critical zone) project to derive insights for environmental health research and policy performance.
- Scope: Documents the experimental design, sampling, data collection, and data structure used to assess how scientists engage in KE/CO-production activities and how these practices are measured.

## Experimental design and sampling regime

- Questionnaires were used to explore KM/KE methods in environment research.
- Rationale for comparing British and Chinese scientists: UK has more KE research experience; cross-national comparison may yield helpful insights.

## Collection methods

- Primary survey participants:
  - Chinese scientists (n = 27) and British scientists (n = 16) from the joint international CZ project.
  - Surveys conducted in project meetings or via email circulation.
- Expansion to broader cohort:
  - An additional 41 Chinese environmental scientists surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, to assess whether the initial China responses were representative of the wider community.
- Additional data collection:
  - Survey responses from 7 British CZO scientists collected via email.

## Calibration steps and values; Fieldwork and laboratory instrumentation; Analytical methods

- Not applicable (N/A) for calibration, fieldwork, instrumentation, and analytical methods in this supporting information.

## Nature and units of recorded values

- Data type: Questionnaire responses (structured survey data).

## Quality control

- Not applicable (N/A) in this documentation.

## Details of data structure

- The dataset folder SurveyScientists contains 3 CSV files:
  - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv: survey results from geoscientists who attended the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China.
  - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv: survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZ/O program.
  - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv: survey results from 7 British CZO scientists collected via email.
- Survey format and coding (examples of questions and response definitions):
  - Q1: Base location (China, UK, Other).
  - Q2: Ever conducted any knowledge transfer to users during research career (Yes/No).
  - Q3: If Yes to Q2, types of knowledge transfer (Traditional, Hybrid, Knowledge exchange, etc.).
  - Q4: Prior awareness of knowledge exchange or co-production concepts (Yes/No).
  - Q5: Examples of different KE activities, with entities worked with and outputs produced (e.g., reports, guidance).
  - Q6: Types of KE outputs produced (policy briefing, best-practice guidance, webinars, training, etc.).
  - Q7: Were outputs created WITH end users (co-produced) or FOR end users (traditional/hybrid) or none; Q7a for elaboration.
  - Q8: KE processes used (e.g., co-designed questions, co-produced outputs, participatory workshops, secondments, etc.); Q8a for other explanations.
  - Q9: If KE activities were performed, were their successes measured? Who measured them? (Yes/No etc.); Q9a for details.
  - Q10: Feasibility of applying KE in the current project; Q10a for explanation.
  - Q11: If KE/co-production were new, interest in using KE in future research; Q11a for rationale.
  - Q12: Interest in further training on KE techniques (Yes/No).
- Response definitions are encoded numerically (e.g., 1=China, 2=UK, 3=Other; 1=Yes, 2=No; etc.), with some questions having multiple selectable outputs.

## Data usage notes

- The dataset supports analysis of:
  - Prevalence and typology of KE activities among environmental scientists in UK/China.
  - Extent of co-production versus traditional KE outputs.
  - Perceived readiness and interest in adopting KE in future projects.
  - Correlations between KE experiences and reporting on measurement of impact or success.

## Storage and access

- Data are organized in a folder named SurveyScientists with three CSV files.
- The documentation notes that datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals, aligning with standard environmental data management practices.

## Considerations and limitations

- Calibration and detailed methodological metadata are not provided (N/A).
- Representativeness concerns: sample includes conference attendees and CZ participants; may not fully generalize to all environmental scientists in China or the UK.
- The data rely on self-reported KE activities, which may introduce reporting bias.

## Key implications for environmental monitoring analytics

- Enables cross-national comparisons of KE practices among environment researchers, informing how knowledge transfer relates to monitoring outcomes and policy uptake.
- Provides a structured basis to link KE activities with downstream environmental decision support tools, guidance, and practice changes.
- Supports assessment of capacity-building needs (training interest) to enhance the integration of KE in environmental monitoring programs.
- Highlights the value of making underlying survey data accessible to analysts and policymakers to improve transparency and reuse in monitoring studies.
