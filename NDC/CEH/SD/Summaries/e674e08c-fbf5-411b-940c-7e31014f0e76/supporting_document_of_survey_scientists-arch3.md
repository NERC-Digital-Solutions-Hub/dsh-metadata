# Supporting information for interpreting

- Overview
  - Describes the experimental design, sampling regime, and data collection methods for a survey of British and Chinese environmental scientists.
  - Aims to explore knowledge management (KM) and knowledge transfer/knowledge exchange (KE) methods used in an international environmental CZ (critical zone) project.
  - Seeks to compare experiences between UK and China to derive helpful insights for environmental monitoring and KE practices.

- Experimental design and sampling
  - Target population: Chinese and British scientists involved in the joint international CZ project; extended to broader Chinese environmental scientists for representativeness.
  - UK scientists chosen for their greater experience in KE research to provide a comparative benchmark.
  - Sample sizes:
    - Chinese (n = 27) and British (n = 16) scientists from the CZ programme, surveyed at project meetings or via email.
    - Additional Chinese scientists (n = 41) surveyed at the 2017 International Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou to assess representativeness of the CZ respondents.
  - Purpose: To understand how KE/knowledge transfer is conducted and how it could inform monitoring approaches and stakeholder engagement.

- Collection methods
  - Primary method: Questionnaire surveys.
  - Administration: In-person at project meetings or via email distribution.
  - Additional data source: Surveys collected from conference attendees to gauge broader practice within the Chinese scientific community.

- Calibration, fieldwork, and analytical methods
  - Not applicable (N/A) or not described (N/A) for calibration steps, fieldwork instrumentation, and analytical methods.

- Nature and units of recorded values
  - The dataset contains survey responses, with coded answer options (e.g., 1, 2, 3, …) as described in the question definitions.

- Details of data structure
  - The dataset folder SurveyScientists contains 3 CSV files:
    - SurveyScientists_GeoConference2017.csv (survey results from geo-scientists at the 2017 Geochemistry Conference in Guizhou, China)
    - SurveyScientists_ChinainCZO.csv (survey results from Chinese and British scientists in the CZ programme)
    - SurveyScientist_UKinCZO.csv (survey results from 7 British CZ scientists collected via email)
  - Data coding guidance embedded in the file descriptions (e.g., Q1, Q2, Q3, etc., with defined response options).

- Core questionnaire content (topics covered)
  - Knowledge transfer experiences: Have you engaged in knowledge transfer to users (policymakers, practitioners, or the public)?
  - Types of knowledge transfer outputs: Policy briefings, best practice guidance, webinars, training, decision-support tools, technical reports, etc.
  - End-user involvement: Were outputs co-produced with end users, produced FOR end users, or created without user involvement?
  - KE processes: Co-design of research questions, co-production of outputs, participatory workshops, secondments to end-user organizations, and other approaches.
  - Evaluation of KE: Whether KE activities have been measured for impact (e.g., changes in farmers’ practices) and by whom.
  - Applicability to current project: Perceived feasibility of applying KE approaches within the project.
  - Interest in KE practices: Willingness to adopt KE and co-production approaches in future research.
  - Training needs: Interest in further training on KE techniques.

- Data quality and governance considerations
  - Quality control is not described (N/A) for this dataset.
  - Metadata completeness and standardization are partially described via the structured CSV questions and coding schemes, but formal QC procedures and data sharing governance are not detailed.
  - Sharing and transparency of underlying data may require consideration under data governance and openness standards.

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks (for the Authors of Monitoring Frameworks archetype)
  - The survey instrument provides a practical approach to measuring stakeholder engagement, KE outputs, and co-production practices—key indicators for evaluating environmental monitoring frameworks.
  - Cross-country sampling and representativeness checks offer lessons for governance on inclusive data sources and stakeholder perspectives.
  - Highlights metadata and data sharing considerations that monitoring programs must address to ensure data quality, comparability, and appropriate governance.
  - The outcomes (types of outputs, processes, and measured impact) can inform dashboards and governance metrics around knowledge translation and policy-relevant monitoring findings.

- Practical notes for use
  - When applying this approach in a monitoring framework context, consider documenting metadata comprehensively, defining standard KE metrics, and establishing data governance to facilitate data sharing and reproducibility.
  - Use the three-file structure as a model for organizing survey data across multiple populations or regions.
  - Leverage the question set to assess readiness for KE integration in monitoring projects and to identify training needs for staff and researchers.
