# Social surveys carried out in Chinese rural villages to the local stakeholders to understand their knowledge learning dynamics and preference.

## Overview
- A 2019 social survey in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province (Loess Plateau) aimed at understanding knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among rural stakeholders.
- Target groups: farmers (167 respondents) and village leaders (11 respondents).
- Data intended to inform monitoring of environmental knowledge, practices, and policy uptake at the local level.

## Study setting and participants
- Location: Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, China; Loess Plateau landscape.
- Stakeholders:
  - Farmers: 167 surveyed across selected towns/villages near research and monitoring stations.
  - Village leaders: 11 surveyed to represent local leadership perspectives.
- Selection rationale: Villages/towns chosen where scientific research and monitoring are concentrated and where village leaders supported the survey.

## Methodology
- Experimental design: Social surveys with both closed and open-ended questions to capture knowledge, learning sources, and preferences.
- Collection approach: Questionnaires distributed in 2019, with item-level details provided in a linked data structure.
- Fieldwork notes: Calibration and analytical methods not provided (N/A in the dataset description).
- Data structure: The dataset archive contains two CSV files:
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv (55 KB)
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv (8 KB)

## Data files and structure
- Survey_Changwu dataset includes two main files:
  - Farmers: responses from 167 farmers.
  - Village leaders: responses from 11 village leaders.
- Table 1 (details) indicates:
  - Year: 2019
  - Landscape: Loess Plateau
  - Counties/Towns: Changewu/Changwu
  - Files: Farmers and Village leaders
  - File names: 
    - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv
    - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv
- Data columns (highlights):
  - Farmers: demographics (village/town, gender, age, education), farming experience, learning sources, usefulness of information from various sources (family, friends, government, seed/fertilizer shops), soil/erosion knowledge, training and government support, environmental practices, barriers to participation, perceived productivity and major challenges, waste management, and environmental issues affecting their farms.
  - Village leaders: stakeholder role, perceived farmer pressures, preferred support methods, engagement with scientists and higher-level government, policy implementation and monitoring, specific policy areas (farm management, water management), communication methods, farmer interest in policies, policy monitoring, and regulatory questions.
  
## Key questionnaire content

- Farmers (selected topics)
  - Demographics: village/town origin, gender, age, education level, tenure of farming on family land.
  - Learning and information sources: where farmers learn farming methods (family, friends, fellow farmers, farm cooperative, village committee, local government, university/college) and how learning from these sources occurs.
  - Perceived usefulness of knowledge: usefulness of knowledge from family, friends, government, and shops.
  - Soil and erosion knowledge: awareness of red soil and soil erosion knowledge sources.
  - Farming practices and impacts: awareness of farm activities affecting neighboring lands; willingness to adopt improvements; training/trust in government or other bodies.
  - Support and training: past government training/financial support; perceptions of government/environment protection training sufficiency.
  - Participation barriers: time, compensation, perceived training usefulness, distance to training sites.
  - Productivity and constraints: factors that could increase productivity; biggest farming challenges (labour, water, land management, technology, fertilizers, regulations, etc.); most expensive inputs.
  - Waste management: current handling of animal waste.
  - Environmental issues: flooding, landslides, soil erosion, forest fires, droughts, or other affecting their farms.
- Village Leaders (selected topics)
  - Community representation: which village/town they represent and major farmer pressures (income, soil decline, water-related issues, other).
  - Support for change: best ways to support farmers to change practices (financial, training, other).
  - Advising on new practices: types of advice provided (new techniques, soil/water conservation, fertilizer use, manure management, etc.) and how such advice is shared (training, farm visits, posters, written instructions, etc.).
  - Collaboration with scientists and government: history of working with scientists and with regional/national officials; perceived usefulness and potential benefits of higher-level engagement.
  - Policy implementation and monitoring: whether their organization links local farmers with government policies; whether they have helped implement policies; which policies they have implemented (farm and water management) and how they are implemented.
  - Farmer engagement with policies: farmer interest in applying policies; monitoring of policy success.
  - Regulation and oversight: whether farming activities are regulated, by whom, and related details.
  - Additional notes: open-ended comments (Q9a, Q13a, Q14a, etc.) capture nuances of policy impact and monitoring experiences.

## Data quality and governance considerations
- Metadata completeness: detailed data dictionary is provided for questionnaire items, but calibration/QA steps are marked as N/A, indicating limited technical QA information in this description.
- Data accessibility and openness: the dataset includes explicit file names and question-by-question structure, aiding transparency and potential data sharing.
- Potential barriers highlighted by the dataset itself: reliance on respondent memory, translation/interpretation of questions, and the need to publicly share survey data.
- Governance implications for monitoring frameworks: the data illustrate how local stakeholders perceive information sources, training needs, policy uptake, and monitoring practices—key for designing transparent, participatory environmental health monitoring programs.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Provides a concrete, ground-level view of knowledge uptake and learning dynamics among rural stakeholders, essential for evaluating policy communication effectiveness and training programs.
- Demonstrates how data on learning sources, perceived usefulness, and willingness to adopt practices can inform the design of governance and data-sharing processes.
- Highlights gaps in metadata, data transformation needs, and the challenges of data sharing and up-to-date information, which are central considerations for building robust environmental health monitoring frameworks.
- Supports assessment of stakeholder engagement, policy implementation, monitoring of outcomes, and the alignment between local practices and higher-level environmental management goals.
