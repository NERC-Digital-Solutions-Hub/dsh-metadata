- The survey aims to illuminate knowledge diffusion, training needs, policy engagement, and perceived environmental and agricultural challenges relevant to watershed/land-use management on the Loess Plateau.
- No calibration or laboratory measurements are involved; data are qualitative/quantitative survey responses compiled into two CSV files.

## Data accessibility and metadata

- Two CSV dataset files are provided with detailed question structures and response formats (Q1–Q30 for farmers; Q1–Q15+ for village leaders).
- The dataset emphasizes the relationship between stakeholder knowledge, training needs, policy engagement, and environmental management in Changwu’s catchment context.
