# Social science survey data from Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, 2019

- Purpose and scope
  - Social surveys conducted in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province (Loess Plateau) in 2019 to understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local farmers and village leaders.
  - Aimed at informing how farming knowledge and practices are learned, shared, and potentially adopted, with attention to soil erosion and land management context.

- Study population and sampling
  - Stakeholders surveyed: farmers (167 individuals) and village leaders (11 individuals) in towns/villages selected by the research team based on local research and monitoring activity and leadership support.
  - Geographic focus: Changwu County within the Loess Plateau; survey sites chosen for proximity to research/monitoring infrastructure and supportive leadership.

- Survey design and data collection
  - Experimental design: social surveys using questionnaires with closed and open-ended items.
  - Fieldwork context: conducted in 2019 with local stakeholders (farmers and village leaders).
  - Data collection outcome: two CSV files encapsulating the survey responses, one for farmers and one for village leaders.

- Data files and structure
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv (55 KB): survey results from 167 farmers.
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv (8 KB): survey results from 11 village leaders.
  - Data structure: detailed columns corresponding to Survey questions (Q1–Q30 for farmers; Q1–Q15 and related sub-items for village leaders), with predefined response categories (e.g., multiple-choice encodings) and some open-ended fields (e.g., “Other (please specify)”).

- Content and key variables (farmers)
  - Demographics: Q2 gender; Q3 age; Q4 highest education; Q5 length of family farming.
  - Learning and information sources: Q6 learning sources; Q7 elaboration on learning methods.
  - Perceived usefulness and knowledge sources: Q8–Q11 assess usefulness of knowledge from family, friends/fellow farmers, government, seed/fertilizer shops.
  - Soil and erosion knowledge: Q12 awareness of “red soil”; Q13 knowledge of soils erosion; Q14 source of erosion knowledge.
  - Farming practices and constraints: Q15 perceived impact of farming activities on neighboring lands; Q16 desired productivity improvements; Q17 government training/support received; Q18 perceived sufficiency of government/environmental training; Q19 perceived sufficiency of financial support for environmental/catchment management.
  - Training participation and interest: Q20 manure/fertilizer management plan encouragement; Q21–Q23 interest in learning different farming approaches and red soil management; Q24 preferred learning modalities; Q25 barriers to participation.
  - Contextual concerns and challenges: Q26 concern about food production rate; Q27 biggest farming challenge; Q28 most expensive farming input; Q29 animal waste management practices; Q30 environmental issues affecting their farm (with an optional Q30a for other issues).

- Content and key variables (village leaders)
  - Leadership role and pressures: Q1 village/town represented; Q2 greatest pressures on farmers (income, soil decline, water issues, etc.); Q3 best ways to support farmers (financial, training, other).
  - Advice and outreach: Q4 advisory topics to farmers (new techniques, soil/conservation/erosion, water, fertilizer use, manure management, etc.); Q5 methods of sharing advice (training, farm visits, posters, written instructions, peer learning, etc.).
  - Collaboration with scientists and governance: Q6 collaboration with scientists on landscape, human impacts, water quality/quantity, pollution, soil erosion, flood risk, etc.; Q7 experience with higher-scale government policy making; Q8 role as a link between policy and farmers.
  - Policy implementation and monitoring: Q9 whether they helped implement policy changes; Q10 policies implemented; Q11 water management policies implemented; Q12 implementation details; Q13 farmer interest in policies; Q13a comments; Q14 monitoring of policy success; Q14a monitoring details; Q15 regulation of farming activities and responsible bodies; Q15a any further notes.

- Data quality and limitations
  - Metadata indicates some sections were not applicable (N/A) for calibration, quality control, and certain instrumentation details.
  - Data are self-reported and locally scoped to Changwu County in 2019; findings may be influenced by local context and respondent bias.
  - The dataset provides structured codes for responses, with some open-ended fields for additional context.

- Potential analyses and uses
  - Descriptive analysis of farmer demographics, learning sources, and perceived usefulness of knowledge from different sources.
  - Cross-tabulations to explore relationships between education level, learning sources, and adoption readiness for soil conservation practices.
  - Analyses linking training receipt (Q17) and perceptions of training sufficiency (Q18) to willingness to participate in future training (Q21–Q24) and barrier factors (Q25).
  - Examination of awareness and knowledge about red soil and erosion (Q12–Q14) and their association with farming practices (Q15, Q28, Q29).
  - Village leader perspectives on pressures, policy implementation, and collaboration with scientists to inform policy design and program delivery.
  - Multivariate modeling to identify predictors of willingness to adopt soil conservation or management practices, and to assess the impact of training and government support on perceived productivity gains.

- Access and provenance
  - Datasets are organized as two CSV files within a Survey_Changwu.zip folder, accompanied by Tables detailing column-by-column question definitions and response mappings.
  - Contextual details include location (Changewu/Changwu County, Loess Plateau) and survey year (2019).
