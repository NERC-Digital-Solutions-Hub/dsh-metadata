# Social surveys carried out in Chinese rural villages to the local stakeholders to understand their knowledge learning dynamics and preference.

## Overview
- 2019 social survey in Changwu County, Shaanxi Province, Loess Plateau, China.
- Participants: 167 farmers and 11 village leaders.
- Aim: understand knowledge learning dynamics and preferences among local stakeholders, including how they access farming knowledge and how they engage with training, government support, and policy.

## Data collection and methods
- Method: questionnaires with closed and open-ended items.
- Field sites: towns/villages identified by the local research team near research/monitoring stations; locations with support from village leaders.
- Data files:
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Farmers.csv (55 kb)
  - For_Survey2nd_Changwu_Village_leaders.csv (8 kb)
- Scope: social science survey data; detailed structure described via a large question set (see Table 1 for column-level details).

## Data structure and content
- Farmers dataset: 2 csv files, comprising Q1–Q30, covering:
  - Demographics: village/town origin, gender, age, education level, length of farming experience.
  - Learning and information sources: where farmers learn farming methods (family, friends, fellow farmers, cooperatives, village committee, local government, university/college) and how they learned (Q7–Q9, Q6–Q7).
  - Knowledge and attitudes: perceptions of usefulness of knowledge from family, friends, government, seed/fertilizer shops; awareness of red soil and soil erosion; knowledge sources.
  - Farming practices and impacts: whether activities affect neighboring lands; most expensive inputs; waste management of animal waste; environmental issues affecting the farm.
  - Training and support: interest in training, types of training desired, barriers to participation (time, payment, perceived usefulness), prior government training/support.
  - Policy and environment: opinions on government environmental protection training and financial support; training desires about red soil erosion and soil management; barriers to engaging in activities.
- Village leaders dataset: Q1–Q15 (plus Q15a), plus Q6–Q12 style items, focusing on leadership perspectives:
  - Represented village/town and principal pressures on farmers.
  - Preferred forms of support for changing farming practices (financial, training, other).
  - Advice provided to farmers on new practices; how this advice is shared (training, farm visits, posters/books, written instructions, farmer representatives, etc.).
  - Collaboration with scientists and higher-level government; role as a policy link between local farmers and government.
  - Policy implementation: which management policies have been implemented; how they are implemented; farmer interest and monitoring of policy success.
  - Regulation and governance: extent to which activities are regulated and by whom; documentation of regulatory details.

## Data quality, provenance, and accessibility
- Calibration and explicit quality control steps are not described (N/A in the record).
- Data structure is documented via a detailed table of questions and response formats, though formatting in the source text is occasionally inconsistent.
- Size and scope: 2 CSV files totaling 178 respondents (167 farmers; 11 village leaders).
- Data provenance: collected in 2019 by a Chinese research team; locations selected near study catchments with stakeholder support.

## Data governance and stewardship considerations
- Metadata and documentation needs:
  - Provide a formal data dictionary / codebook mapping Q numbers to variable names, with complete description of each response code (e.g., what Q2 options mean, how multi-select items are stored).
  - Clarify data types (categorical codes, Likert-like scales, text fields) and any recoding performed.
- Privacy and ethics:
  - Ensure respondent anonymity in public releases; assess whether any direct identifiers exist and how they are handled.
- Interoperability and standardization:
  - Harmonize response codes across the two files where applicable (e.g., multi-select questions, duplicated definitions).
  - Consider aligning coding to a common schema for easier cross-study reuse.
- Data quality and reuse:
  - Document any data cleaning steps performed (e.g., handling of missing values, inconsistent responses).
  - Provide guidance on linking farmers to village leaders (e.g., village identifiers) for integrated analyses.
- Licensing and access:
  - Clarify data licensing, usage rights, and any embargoes or required attributions.
- Longevity and updates:
  - This dataset captures a single cross-section from 2019; consider versioning and noting potential for follow-up waves if available.

## Practical implications for Data Stewards
- This dataset offers rich insights into how rural Chinese farmers and village leaders learn about farming practices, perceive knowledge sources, and interact with policy and training programs.
- Data stewards should prioritize:
  - Producing a comprehensive, user-friendly data dictionary and code mappings.
  - Ensuring privacy protections and clear licensing.
  - Providing guidance on cross-walking question codes to standardized metadata for interoperability with other datasets.
  - Facilitating discoverability by topic (e.g., soil erosion, training, policy implementation) and by stakeholder type (farmers vs. village leaders).
  - Documenting data provenance, field methods, and context to support reproducibility and reliable reuse.
