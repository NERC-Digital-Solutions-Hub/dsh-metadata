# Experimental design/Sampling regime

- Purpose: Social survey conducted in 2018 to understand learning preferences and current knowledge management (KM) methods among local farmers and leaders in Puding County, China (in Chinese).

- Collection method: Interviews were recorded and transcribed with participant consent.

- Data type and units: Transcriptions of interview data (text).

- Data structure and organization: Dataset comprises 31 .rtf transcript files, organized by location with naming conventions:
  - Chenqi_x.rtf (x = 1–7; 16–55 KB)
  - Houzhai_x.rtf (x = 1–10; 15–22 KB)
  - Jinhe_x.rtf (x = 1–8; 17–21 KB)
  - Maguan_x.rtf (x = 1–5; 15–19 KB)

- Data quality and processing: No fieldwork or laboratory instrumentation; no calibration steps or analytical methods documented; no explicit quality control steps provided.

- Language: Chinese.

- Governance and sharing considerations: Interviews were conducted with consent for recording and transcription; no explicit notes on data sharing restrictions, embargoes, or update processes. Data stewardship will require metadata about consent, access rights, and any usage limitations.

- Practical implications for data stewardship:
  - Ensure thorough metadata: language, year (2018), location (Puding County), participants (farmers and leaders), consent status.
  - Maintain clear file-level provenance and naming conventions to enable discoverability.
  - Consider privacy and ethical guidelines for interview data; document any restrictions on sharing or reuse.
