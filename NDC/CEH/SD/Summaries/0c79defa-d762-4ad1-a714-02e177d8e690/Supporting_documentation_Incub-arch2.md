# Laboratory soil incubation respiration rates from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Aim
  - Quantify gas production rates (CO2 and CH4) with depth along soil profiles to assess environmental respiration processes in permafrost-affected subarctic soils.

- Sites and samples
  - Six sites with codes and descriptions:
    - FFU - FireFox Unburnt: unburnt black spruce forest
    - FFB - FireFox Burnt: black spruce forest burnt in 1998
    - BLF - BlackFox: black spruce forest
    - WHF - WhiteFox: white spruce forest
    - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau: peatland plateau near Teslin
    - TW - Teslin Wetland: thawed peatland plateau near Teslin
  - For each site: three soil cores (3 replicates) were collected; four depths per core (A, B, C, D; A is the shallowest).
  - Depths include samples from the active layer and permafrost. Note: TW layer C and D labeled permafrost; these samples come from a wetland formed after permafrost thaw, where the peat is considered permafrost (below the active layer) prior to collapse.

- Sample preparation
  - Remove topmost living vegetation and large roots.
  - If needed, sieve mineral material to remove pebbles from sand, silt, and clay.
  - Prepare soils for incubation by maintaining moisture at water holding capacity.

- Incubation setup and conditions
  - Incubation under two redox conditions: oxic (aerobic) and anoxic.
  - Temperatures: 5°C and 15°C.
  - Aerobic: soil in 0.5 L glass jars; CO2 measured at time 1 and time 2 within 24 h (high temp treatments, including TPP and TW) or 48 h (low temp treatment).
  - Anaerobic: jars flushed with N2 at start; after incubation, 30 mL headspace gas sampled and analyzed for CO2 and CH4.
  - CO2 analysis: EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyser.
  - CH4 analysis: DP-IR Detecto Pak.
  - Corrections: dilution corrections applied to account for actual concentrations in the jar.

- Measurements and outputs
  - Gas production rates calculated from the difference between time 1 and time 2 concentrations, assuming linear increase.
  - Outputs expressed as mg of carbon per day per gram of dry soil:
    - C-CO2
    - C-CH4
  - Soil carbon and nitrogen content expressed as percent of dry mass.

- Data handling notes
  - Production rates and gas concentrations are derived from headspace measurements with standard correction procedures.
  - All depth-specific measurements include both aerobic and anaerobic incubations across the 5°C and 15°C conditions, enabling depth- and temperature-dependent comparisons.

- Permafrost-related note
  - In TW, layers C and D are labeled permafrost; these samples come from a wetland formed when permafrost thawed, where the peatland collapsed, leaving peat that was previously permafrost below the active layer.
