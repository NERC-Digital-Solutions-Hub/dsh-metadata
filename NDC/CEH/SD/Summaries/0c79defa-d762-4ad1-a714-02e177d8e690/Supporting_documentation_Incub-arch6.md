# Laboratory soil incubation respiration rates from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Objective
  - Quantify gas production rates (CO2 and CH4) with depth along soil profiles through laboratory incubations under different conditions (oxic/aerobic and anoxic) and temperatures (5°C and 15°C).

- Sampling design
  - Three soil cores per site, with 3 replicates (as indicated by the replicate column).
  - Four depths per core, coded A (shallowest) to D (deepest).
  - Sites include FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt), BLF (BlackFox), WHF (WhiteFox), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), and TW (Teslin Wetland).

- Depth and permafrost context
  - Samples cover active layer to permafrost (as indicated by soil_depth_interval_cm and Permafrost column).
  - For TW, layers C and D are labeled as permafrost; peatlands formed when permafrost thawed are noted.

- Sample preparation
  - Soil mixed manually; removal of top vegetation and large roots.
  - Mineral samples sieved to remove pebbles (sand, silt, clay).

- Incubation conditions
  - Oxic (aerobic) and anoxic (anaerobic) conditions.
  - Soils kept at water holding capacity; anaerobic incubations include N2 flushing at start and where gas accumulation is greatest.
  - Temperatures: 5°C and 15°C.
  - Incubation vessel: 0.5 L glass jars containing plastic pots with soil.

- Gas measurements
  - Aerobic incubations: CO2 measured at time 1 and time 2 within 24 h (high temp treatment, TPP and TW) or 48 h (low temp).
  - Anaerobic incubations: 30 mL headspace withdrawn and analyzed for CO2 (EGM-4) and CH4 (DP-IR Detecto Pak) in a closed loop.
  - Time points allow calculation of production rates from concentration differences; corrections via dilution where applicable.

- Data calculations and outputs
  - Production rates calculated from the difference between time 1 and time 2, assuming linear increase.
  - Expressed as mg of carbon (as C-CO2 or C-CH4) per day per gram of dry soil.
  - Carbon and nitrogen contents reported as percent of dry mass.

- Notes on data interpretation
  - The note clarifies the permafrost designation for TW C and D layers and the historical context of peatland thaw affecting soil profiling.
