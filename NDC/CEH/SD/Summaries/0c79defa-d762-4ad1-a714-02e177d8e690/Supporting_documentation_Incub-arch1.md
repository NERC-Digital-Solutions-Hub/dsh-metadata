# Laboratory soil incubation respiration rates from permafrost in subarctic Canada

## Objective
- Quantify gas production rates (CO2 and CH4) with depth along the soil profile to understand respiration dynamics in permafrost-affected soils under varying redox conditions and temperatures.

## Samples and sites
- Three soil cores per site, with 3 replicates (replicate column).
- Four depths per core, coded A (shallowest) to D (deepest).
- Sites:
  - FFU - FireFox Unburnt (unburnt black spruce forest)
  - FFB - FireFox Burnt (burnt in 1998)
  - BLF - BlackFox (black spruce forest)
  - WHF - WhiteFox (white spruce forest)
  - TPP - Teslin Peatland Plateau (peatland plateau near Teslin)
  - TW - Teslin Wetland (thawed peatland plateau near Teslin)
- Depths sampled include active layer and permafrost; note permafrost labeling for some TW layers.

## Experimental design
- Samples prepared by manual mixing, removing top vegetation and large roots; minerals sieved to remove pebbles as needed.
- Incubations under both oxic (aerobic) and anoxic conditions.
- Temperatures: 5°C and 15°C.
- Mrs: moist conditions maintained at water holding capacity for aerobic; extra water added for anaerobic to ensure saturation.

## Measurements and calculations
- Aerobic incubations:
  - 0.5 L glass jars containing soil in plastic pots.
  - CO2 measured at time 1 (seal) and time 2 (within 24 h for high temperature treatments, TPP, TW; 48 h for low temperature treatment).
  - Instrument: EGM-4 Infrared Gas Analyzer.
  - Jars opened after time 2; dilution corrections applied to obtain real concentration.
- Anaerobic incubations:
  - Jars flushed with N2 at start and when gas accumulation was greatest.
  - 30 mL headspace samples taken and analyzed in a closed loop for CO2 (EGM4) and CH4 (DP-IR Detecto Pak).
  - Dilution corrections applied to calculate real concentrations.
- Production rates:
  - Calculated from difference between time 1 and time 2 assuming linear increase.
  - Expressed as mg C per day per gram dry soil.
- Additional soil chemistry:
  - Carbon and nitrogen contents expressed as percent dry mass.

## Data interpretation and outputs
- Variables derived:
  - CO2 production rate (C-CO2) and CH4 production rate (C-CH4).
  - Rates by depth (A–D) and by site.
  - Soil organic C and N contents (% dry mass).
- Data intended to support comparisons across depths, sites, redox conditions, and temperatures.

## Special notes on permafrost context
- In TW, C and D layers are labeled as permafrost due to the peatland history: the peatland formed after permafrost thaw and collapse, with the soil profile unfrozen but peat previously deemed permafrost below the active layer.
