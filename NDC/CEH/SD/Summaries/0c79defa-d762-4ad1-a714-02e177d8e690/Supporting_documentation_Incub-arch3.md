# Laboratory soil incubation respiration rates from permafrost in subarctic Canada

- Purpose and scope
  - Quantify gas production rates (CO2 and CH4) with depth along soil profiles under varying conditions to understand environmental health and carbon dynamics in subarctic permafrost regions.
  - Compare across multiple sites representing different forest and peatland environments.

- Sampling design
  - Three soil cores per site with three replicates.
  - Four depths per core, labeled A (shallowest) to D (deepest); data linked via soil_layer and soil_depth_interval_cm.
  - Sites: FFU (FireFox Unburnt), FFB (FireFox Burnt, 1998), BLF (BlackFox), WHF (WhiteFox), TPP (Teslin Peatland Plateau), TW (Teslin Wetland).
  - Includes active layer and permafrost layers; TW D layer noted as permafrost due to thaw history.

- Sample preparation
  - Remove top vegetation and large roots.
  - For mineral soil, sieve to remove pebbles for uniform texture.

- Incubation conditions
  - Oxic (aerobic) and anoxic (anaerobic) incubations.
  - Temperatures: 5°C and 15°C.
  - Moisture maintained at water holding capacity; anaerobic pots flushed with N2 to ensure saturation.

- Measurement protocol
  - Aerobic: soils in 0.5 L jars; CO2 measured at time 1 and time 2 (within 24 h for 15°C, 48 h for 5°C) using EGM-4 IR gas analyzer; corrections for dilution after jar opening.
  - Anaerobic: jars flushed with N2; headspace sampled (30 mL) and analyzed for CO2 (EGM-4) and CH4 (Detecto Pak); dilution corrections applied.

- Calculations and units
  - Production rates derived from the difference between time 1 and time 2 concentrations, assuming linear increase.
  - Reported as mg of C per day per gram of dry soil.
  - Carbon and nitrogen content expressed as percent of dry mass.

- Notes on data interpretation
  - Clarifies permafrost labeling for TW (D layers) due to historical peatland thaw, ensuring correct interpretation of active layer versus permafrost status.
