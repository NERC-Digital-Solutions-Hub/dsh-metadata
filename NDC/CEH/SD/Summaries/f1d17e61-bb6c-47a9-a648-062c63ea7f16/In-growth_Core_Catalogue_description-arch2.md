# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

## Overview
- Provides experimental results on seedling growth and survival from two hyphal exclusion experiments in a subtropical forest.
- Data cover four CSV files and multiple metrics to test how access to root-associated fungal networks influences plant performance and pathogen loads.
- Aims to quantify effects across ten common tree species (five ECM and five AM) within patches dominated by adult trees with different mycorrhizal associations.
- Partly funded by a NERC Discovery Science project; data prepared for ingestion into environmental data infrastructure.

## Data Files and Variables
- Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv: survival status of seedlings across treatments.
- Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv: seedling height, total biomass, and biomass of component parts.
- Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv: percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.
- In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv: environmental context for in-growth cores.
- Variables include: dominant site identifiers, experimental block, mesh treatment (nylon mesh sizes: 35 µm vs. 0.5 µm), botanical names, and mycorrhizal type (ECM or AM).

## Experimental Design
- Two hyphal exclusion experiments to test differential access to root-associated fungal networks.
- Seedlings transplanted into in-growth cores with different nylon mesh sizes, creating differential access to fungal networks.
- Ten tree species sampled (five ECM, five AM).
- Study aims to link fungal network access with growth, fitness, and pathogen loads in forest patches shaped by adult ECM- or AM-associated trees.

## Provenance and Quality Assurance
- Experiments conducted by M. Liang and X. Liu, with input from all authors.
- Data quality checks performed by all authors.
- Raw data provided for each seedling (growth and survival), with site, block, mesh treatment, species, and mycorrhizal type identifiers.
- Data compiled in Excel and exported as CSV for submission to the Environmental Information Data Centre.

## Study Area and Timeline
- Location: Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China (111°53'E, 23°27'N; 150–927 m above sea level).
- Temporal extent: March 2017 to August 2018.
