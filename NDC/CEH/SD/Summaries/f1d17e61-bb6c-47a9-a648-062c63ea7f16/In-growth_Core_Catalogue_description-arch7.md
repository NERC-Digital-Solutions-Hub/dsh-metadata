# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

- Overview
  - A dataset describing seedling growth and survival across two hyphal exclusion experiments in a subtropical forest.
  - Four data files: Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv, Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv, Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv, In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv.
  - Metrics include survival status, height, total biomass, biomass by plant parts, and percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.
  - Ten tree species studied (five ectomycorrhizal ECM, five arbuscular mycorrhizal AM).
  - Experiments test whether differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant–soil feedbacks and quantify effects on growth, fitness, and pathogen loads.

- Data files and key variables
  - Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv: survival status by seedling, per species and treatment.
  - Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv: growth metrics (e.g., height, biomass) by seedling, species, and treatment.
  - Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv: percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas for each seedling/species.
  - In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv: environmental and experimental context (e.g., site codes, experimental blocks, mesh treatment, botanical names, mycorrhizal type).

- Experimental design and variables
  - Two hyphal exclusion experiments using in-growth cores.
  - Mesh treatments with windows of 35 µm vs. 0.5 µm to modulate access to root-associated fungal networks.
  - Seedlings transplanted into cores within a forest area characterized by adult trees that associate with ECM or AM fungi.
  - Variables include survival, growth metrics, biomass composition, root colonisation, experimental block, and mesh treatment.
  - Species set: ten common tree species spanning both ECM and AM associations.

- Study area and temporal coverage
  - Location: Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, south China (coordinates provided in dataset).
  - Elevation: 150–927 m above sea level.
  - Timeframe: March 2017 to August 2018.

- Provenance, quality, and data handling
  - Collected and analyzed by M. Liang, X. Liu, D. Johnson, and colleagues; data quality checks performed by all authors.
  - Raw data captured in Excel spreadsheets and exported to CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Data include dominant-site codes, experimental blocks, mesh treatments, species names, and mycorrhizal type.

- Spatial and GIS considerations
  - Established data model linking seedling outcomes to specific sites, blocks, and mesh treatments within a defined reserve area.
  - Potential to map: seedling survival and growth patterns across blocks, spatial distribution of ECM vs AM associations, and relationships to soil or environmental context captured in In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv.
  - Suitable for GIS-enabled visualization and analyses of plant–soil feedbacks influenced by root-fungal networks.
