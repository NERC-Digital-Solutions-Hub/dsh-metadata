# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

## Overview
- Reports results from two hyphal exclusion experiments on seedling growth and survival in a subtropical forest.
- Four data files: Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv, Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv, Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv, In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv.
- Metrics include survival status, height, total biomass, biomass of plant parts, and percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.
- Seedlings from ten common tree species (five ectomycorrhizal ECM and five arbuscular mycorrhizal AM) transplanted in in-growth cores with nylon mesh windows of 35 µm and 0.5 µm.

## Aim and design
- Test the prediction that differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant–soil feedbacks.
- Quantify how access to root-associated fungal connections affects growth, fitness, and pathogen loads of seedlings in patches dominated by adult ECM- or AM-associated trees.

## Provenance and quality
- Experiments conducted by M. Liang and X. Liu with input from all authors.
- Data quality checks performed by all authors.
- Provides raw growth and survival data per seedling, with identifying codes for dominant sites, experimental block, mesh treatment, botanical names, and mycorrhizal type.
- Data entered in Excel and exported as CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre.

## Study location and time
- Location: Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China (coordinates 111°53'E, 23°27'N; altitude 150–927 m a.s.l.).
- Temporal extent: March 2017 to August 2018.

## Data management and access
- Data stored as raw CSV files; prepared for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Potential uses for data supporters
- Enable end-users to self-serve analyses via dashboards or reports, comparing growth, survival, and mycorrhizal effects across mesh treatments and species.
- Support meta-analyses of plant–soil feedbacks and root–fungal network influences in subtropical forest systems.
- Facilitate data provenance tracking and quality assurance for broader data-sharing initiatives.
