# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

- What the dataset is
  - Results from two hyphal exclusion experiments testing how access to root-associated fungal networks affects seedling growth and survival in a subtropical forest.
  - Four data files: Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv, Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv, Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv, In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv.
  - Metrics include survival status, height, total biomass and biomass components, and percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Two hyphal exclusion experiments using in-growth cores.
  - Windows with different nylon mesh sizes: 35 µm vs 0.5 µm to regulate fungal access.
  - Ten common tree species sampled (five ectomycorrhizal, ECM; five arbuscular mycorrhizal, AM).
  - Seedlings transplanted into cores within forest patches characterized by adult trees associated with either ECM or AM fungi.

- Aims and analytical relevance
  - Primary aim: test whether differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant–soil feedbacks.
  - Secondary goals: quantify how access to root–fungal connections influences growth, fitness, and pathogen loads of seedlings in ECM- vs AM-dominated patches.
  - Data suitable for correlational analyses and predictive modelling of plant performance under varying fungal access conditions.

- Content and variables of interest
  - Survival and growth outcomes for each seedling; height and total biomass plus biomass by component parts.
  - Root colonisation percentage by mycorrhizas (ECM vs AM) per seedling.
  - Experimental metadata: in-growth core mesh treatment, experimental block, site identifiers, species names, and mycorrhizal type.

- Potential analyses and considerations for analysts
  - Modelling seedling growth/survival as functions of mesh treatment (fungal access), mycorrhizal type, species, and block/site, with random effects to account for spatial structure.
  - Investigating interactions between mycorrhizal type (ECM vs AM) and mesh treatment on growth metrics and survival.
  - Linking root colonisation percentages to growth outcomes to assess the strength of mycorrhizal associations under different fungal access scenarios.
  - Consideration of local environmental context and patch-level differences (adult tree mycorrhizal associations) in predictive models.

- Accessibility and usage notes
  - Data prepared for discovery and reuse within environmental data portals; includes raw measurements and descriptive metadata to support reproducibility and cross-study comparisons.
