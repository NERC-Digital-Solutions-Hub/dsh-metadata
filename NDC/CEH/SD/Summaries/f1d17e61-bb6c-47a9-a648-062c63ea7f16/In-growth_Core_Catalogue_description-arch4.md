# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

## Overview
- Reports results from two hyphal exclusion experiments in a subtropical forest.
- Aims to test whether differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant-soil feedbacks and to quantify effects on seedling growth, fitness, and pathogen loads in patches dominated by adult trees associating with ECM or AM fungi.

## Data files and contents
- Four data files: 
  - Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv
  - In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv
- Metrics include: survival status, height, total biomass, biomass by plant parts, percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.
- Seedlings from ten common tree species (five ECM and five AM).
- Experimental setup includes in-growth cores with windows covering different nylon mesh sizes (35 µm vs. 0.5 µm).

## Experimental design
- Hyphal exclusion experiments to assess how access to root-associated fungal networks influences growth and survival.
- Conducted in patches of subtropical forest with adult trees associating with either ECM or AM fungi.
- Mesh treatments (35 vs. 0.5 µm) manipulate access to fungal connections.

## Provenance, quality, and metadata
- Experiments conducted by M. Liang and X. Liu with input from all authors; data quality checks performed by all authors.
- Dataset contains raw growth and survival data for each seedling, plus:
  - dominant site identifiers
  - experimental block
  - mesh treatment
  - botanical names
  - mycorrhizal type
- Data initially entered in Excel and exported as CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre.

## Study site and timeframe
- Location: Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China (111°53'E, 23°27'N; 150–927 m above sea level).
- Temporal extent: March 2017 – August 2018.
