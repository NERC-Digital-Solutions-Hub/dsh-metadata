# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

## What the dataset contains
- Four data files:
  - Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv
  - In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv
- Metrics recorded:
  - Seedling survival status
  - Height
  - Total biomass and biomass of plant parts
  - Percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas
- Species and treatment scope:
  - Ten common tree species (five ectomycorrhizal, five arbuscular mycorrhizal)
  - Seedlings transplanted in in-growth cores with two mesh sizes (35 µm vs. 0.5 µm)
  - Two hyphal exclusion experiments to test root-associated fungal network access
- Provenance codes:
  - Dominant sites, experimental block identifiers, mesh treatment, botanical names, and mycorrhizal type included

## Aims and scientific questions
- Test the prediction that differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant–soil feedbacks
- Quantify how access to root-associated fungal connections influences:
  - Growth and fitness of seedlings
  - Pathogen loads within patches dominated by adult trees with ECM or AM associations

## Provenance and quality assurance
- Conducted by:
  - Minxia Liang, David Johnson, David F. R. P. Burslem, Shixiao Yu, Miao Fang, Joe D. Taylor, Andy F. S. Taylor, Thorunn Helgason, Xubing Liu
- Data quality checks performed by all authors
- Data characteristics:
  - Raw growth and survival data for each seedling
  - Identifying codes for dominant study sites
  - Experimental block, mesh treatment, species names, and mycorrhizal type
- Data handling:
  - Collected in Excel, exported to CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)

## Location and temporal coverage

## Data management and openness
- Data are prepared for sharing via the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC)
- Emphasizes raw data accessibility, traceable provenance, and clear documentation
- Metadata and dataset structure support replication and secondary analyses

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates practical workflow for selecting and validating environmental health measures (seedling performance, mycorrhizal status, root-fungal connectivity)
- Highlights data governance considerations (metadata availability, data provenance, quality checks, and open data sharing)
- Addresses common framework challenges:
  - Data gaps and accessibility by creating a well-documented, shareable dataset
  - Metadata completeness around experimental design and mycorrhizal associations
  - Data transformation and standardization (Excel to CSV) for interoperability
  - Clear communication of complex findings through structured data and associated documentation
