# Experimental data testing soil fungal network effects on seedling survival and growth in a Chinese subtropical forest

## Overview
- Reports results on seedling growth and survival for two hyphal exclusion experiments in a subtropical forest.
- Four data files: Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv, Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv, Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv, In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv.
- Metrics include survival status, height, total biomass and components, and percentage root colonisation by mycorrhizas.
- Seedlings from ten common tree species (five ectomycorrhizal [ECM], five arbuscular mycorrhizal [AM]).
- Seedlings transplanted in in-growth cores with nylon mesh windows of 35 µm and 0.5 µm to manipulate access to root-associated fungal networks.
- Aim: test how differential access to root-associated fungal networks regulates plant–soil feedbacks and quantify effects on growth, fitness, and pathogen loads in patches dominated by adult ECM- or AM-associated trees.
- Partly funded by NERC Discovery Science project NE/M004848/1 (Explaining niche separation in tropical forests: feedbacks from root-fungal symbioses and soil phosphorus partitioning).

## Data files and contents
- Four CSV files contain raw data:
  - Tree_Seedling_Survival.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Growth.csv
  - Tree_Seedling_Root_Colonization.csv
  - In-growth_Core_Enviroment.csv
- Variables include:
  - Survival status, seedling height, total biomass and constituent parts, and mycorrhizal root colonisation percentages.
  - Dominant-site codes, experimental block, mesh treatment, botanical names, and mycorrhizal type.

## Experimental design
- Two hyphal exclusion experiments conducted in a subtropical forest.
- In-growth cores with two mesh sizes (35 µm vs. 0.5 µm) to modulate access to root-associated fungal networks.
- Ten tree species analyzed (five ECM, five AM).
- Purpose: quantify how access to root-fungal connections affects growth, plant fitness, and pathogen loads.

## Provenance and data quality
- Experiments conducted by M. Liang and X. Liu with input from all authors.
- Data quality checks performed by all authors.
- Raw data collected on growth and survival for each seedling; includes site codes, experimental block, mesh treatment, species names, and mycorrhizal type.
- Data were entered in Excel and exported to CSV for ingestion into the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Study area and temporal extent
- Location: Heishiding Nature Reserve, Guangdong Province, China (111°53'E, 23°27'N; elevation 150–927 m a.s.l.).
- Temporal extent: March 2017 to August 2018.
