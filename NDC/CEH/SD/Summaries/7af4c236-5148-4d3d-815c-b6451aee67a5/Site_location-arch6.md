# East Stoke gauging station, Dorset, UK

## Overview
- Map-like text listing key water bodies in the area: East Stoke gauging station; River Hooke; Sydling Water; River Cerne; South Winterborne; River Frome; River Piddle
- Scale bar indicates distances up to 16 km
- Represents a Dorset hydrological network context with multiple rivers linked to the gauging site

## Relevance to Data Support
- Illustrates how data from a single gauging station relates to a network of nearby rivers
- Provides a context for creating data products that let users explore river connections and distances
- Supports potential use cases in hydrological monitoring, flood risk assessment, and local water management

## Potential Data Products
- Visualizations of the river network and spatial relationships
- Dashboards or maps showing proximities and connections between East Stoke and surrounding rivers
- Self-serve tools for exploring flow-related data from the gauging station alongside related waterways
- Reports or charts summarizing geography, catchment links, and distances
- Early prototypes to gather user feedback and inform iterative improvements

## Data Tasks to Meet Aims
- Identify and verify data sources for East Stoke and each listed water body
- Clean and harmonize data across multiple formats and systems
- Analyze spatial relationships (connectivity, catchment links) and compute distances along waterways
- Develop user-friendly outputs with guidance on how to use them
- Share early prototypes, gather feedback, and advocate for improved data creation where gaps exist

## Challenges and Considerations
- Patchy data quality across datasets and formats
- Accessing data from multiple systems or repositories
- Communicating complex hydrological/spatial information clearly to end users
- Ensuring outputs are widely used, reused, and promoted within the organisation

## Next Steps / Opportunities
- Develop a basic data product: a map plus a simple dashboard integrating East Stoke data with nearby rivers
- Improve data sourcing and integration for hydrological metrics
- Engage stakeholders to promote adoption and collect feedback for iterative enhancement
