- This document outlines approaches for identifying environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy, and to inform future decisions.

## Aim

- Identify environmental health measures that enable policy scrutiny, evaluation, and future decision-making.

## Who they are

- Managers in government departments or environmental quangos responsible for deciding on and implementing environmental health monitoring approaches.

## How they meet their aims

- Engage with stakeholders and experts to determine which measures provide useful insight.

- Ensure data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and communicated clearly through reports, charts, or dashboards.
- Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, share underlying data appropriately, and implement data governance processes.

## Particular Challenges

- Lack of data or data of insufficient quality.
- Lack of timely access to data.
- Silos within and between organisations hinder collaboration.
- Public data sharing requirements can impede utilisation of existing data.
- Keeping data up to date complicates data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata hampers quick assessment of data suitability.
- Data formats require effortful transformation to be usable.
- Difficulty in communicating complex findings clearly.
- Establishing data governance to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and kept up to date.
