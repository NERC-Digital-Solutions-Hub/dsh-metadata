# Brief description of the dataset

## Overview
- Dataset produced by CEH Dorset (2004–2006) for nutrient and related chemistry in the River Frome, Dorset.
- Sampling conducted at the gauging weir at East Stoke using Epic water samplers; occasional manual dip sampling, especially during storm events.
- Data intended to support high-resolution environmental monitoring and inform policy, with emphasis on data quality, openness, and clear presentation.

## Sampling context and location
- Location: River Frome, East Stoke gauging weir (National Grid Reference SY 867868), CEH River Laboratory.
- Sampling period: 2004–2006.
- Sampling method: Predominantly automated sampling with Epic water samplers; occasional manual sampling during storms.

## Analytical chemistry methods
- Deteminands analyzed with standard colorimetric methods using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
- Total phosphorus (TP): determined by autoclave digestion with acidic potassium persulphate, reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate to form a molybdenum-phosphorus complex, measured colorimetrically at 880 nm (reference Eisenreich et al., 1975).
- Other determinants (SRP, TON, Si): filtered river water (0.45 μm membrane) and analyzed by standard spectrophotometric methods (DoE 1981, 1993; Murphy and Riley, 1962).
- Quality control: QA standards run alongside each batch.

## Data format and measures
- Date/time format: day/month/year hours:minutes.
- TP: total phosphorus concentration comprising dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered samples.
- Suspended sediment concentration: mass retained on Whatman GF/C filter per litre of river water.
- TON: total oxidisable nitrogen (equivalent to total dissolved nitrogen in nitrate/nitrite form; nitrate dominates in river waters).
- Dissolved reactive silicon: molybdate-reactive silicon in 0.45 μm filtered water.
- Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): molybdate-reactive phosphorus that passes 0.45 μm filtration; also known as filterable reactive phosphorus.

## Data governance and usage notes
- Data quality emphasized through standard QA procedures; reference to broader work highlighting high-resolution nutrient monitoring.
