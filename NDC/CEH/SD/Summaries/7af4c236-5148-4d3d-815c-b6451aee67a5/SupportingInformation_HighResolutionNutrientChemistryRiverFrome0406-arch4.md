# Brief description of the dataset

- Origin and timeframe: Chemistry dataset produced by CEH Dorset between 2004 and 2006; sampling and analysis conducted by Mike Bowes.
- Location and sampling: Collected from the River Frome at the East Stoke gauging weir (National Grid Reference SY 867868), using Epic water samplers and the CEH River Laboratory; occasional manual samples taken with a dip sampler during storm events.
- Analytical chemistry methods: Standard colorimetric analyses using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
  - Total phosphorus (TP): Determined by autoclave digestion with acidic potassium persulphate, followed by reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate to form a molybdenum-phosphorus complex measured at 880 nm.
  - Other determinands: River water filtered through a 0.45 µm cellulose nitrate membrane to measure SRP, TON (primarily nitrate in rivers), and Si using standard spectrophotometric methods.
  - Quality control: QC standards run alongside each batch.
- Data products and definitions:
  - TP: Concentration of dissolved plus acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered water.
  - Suspended sediment concentration: Mass of solids retained on a Whatman GF/C filter per litre of river water.
  - TON: Total dissolved nitrogen present as nitrate and nitrite (in rivers, nitrate dominates).
  - Dissolved reactive silicon (Si): Molybdate-reactive silicon in a 0.45 µm filtered sample.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): Molybdate-reactive phosphorus that passes through a 0.45 µm filter (also known as filterable reactive phosphorus).
- Data format: Date/time recorded as day/month/year hours:minutes.
- Additional context: The TP measurement combines dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus from unfiltered water.
