# East Stoke gauging station, Dorset, UK

## Document context and scope
- Location-based data record for East Stoke gauging station in Dorset, UK.
- Reference to connected rivers/events: River Hooke, Sydling Water, River Cerne, South Winterborne, River Frome, River Piddle.
- Includes a map or schematic showing spatial relationships and a distance scale (km).

## Data types and variables
- Time-series hydrological measurements likely including water level and discharge (flow) data.
- Associated metadata such as measurement timestamps, units, and reference datums.

## Metadata and standards
- Need for consistent metadata to support discovery and reuse:
  - station identifier, operator, and measurement period.
  - variables measured, units (e.g., meters, cubic meters per second), datum used.
  - data collection methods, sensor types, calibration records.
  - geographic coordinates and coordinate system, data quality flags, and data provenance.

## Data governance, sharing, and access
- Datasets should be stored, managed, and shared via appropriate portals/catalogues.
- Consider publishing mindset to create usable, discoverable datasets for users.
- Clarify data ownership, licensing, and access rights; determine if embargoes or proprietary restrictions apply.
- Provide guidance and tools to data creators to meet standards; ensure data can be discovered and re-used by others.

## Data quality and processing
- Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) procedures needed:
  - validation of sensor readings, calibration logs, outlier detection, gap handling.
  - data cleaning, transformation, and, if applicable, standardization to common formats.
- Document any transformations or processing steps performed before sharing.

## Data availability, updates, and lifecycle
- Processes to ensure timely data delivery and updates to shared datasets.
- Systems should support ongoing updates, versioning, and clear notes on data provenance.
- Awareness of data limitations (gaps, potential embargoes, proprietary constraints) and how they affect usage.

## Interoperability and formats
- Preference for interoperable data formats (e.g., CSV, WaterML, NetCDF) and consistent units.
- Harmonization across multiple rivers/sources in the same station to enable cross-cutting analyses.

## Practical challenges for Data Stewards
- Incomplete picture of user needs and priorities.
- Timely ingestion of data from multiple streams and systems.
- Ensuring data creators meet metadata and quality standards.
- Handling large volumes of data from continuous monitoring.
- Dealing with legacy or non-interoperable databases and formats.

## Recommendations for data stewardship
- Establish a clear metadata schema and ensure complete documentation for each dataset.
- Create or leverage standardized data ingestion pipelines with QA/QC checks.
- Coordinate with data creators on timely data submission and adherence to standards.
- Maintain provenance records and document all data transformations.
- Implement consistent data formats and units to support interoperability across rivers and portals.
- Regularly review data sharing agreements, licensing, and access controls to balance openness with stewardship.
