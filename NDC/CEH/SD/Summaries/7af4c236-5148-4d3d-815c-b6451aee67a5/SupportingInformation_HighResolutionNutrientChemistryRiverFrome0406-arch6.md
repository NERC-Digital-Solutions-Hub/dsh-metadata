# Brief description of the dataset

- The dataset is a chemistry dataset produced by CEH Dorset between 2004 and 2006, with sampling and analysis conducted by Mike Bowes.
- Samples were collected from the River Frome at the gauging weir at East Stoke, Dorset (grid reference SY 867868) and analyzed at CEH River Laboratory; manual samples were sometimes taken during storm events.
- Sampling site and timing indicate focus on high-flow or storm conditions.

- Analytical chemistry methods:
  - All determinands analyzed by standard colorimetric methods using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
  - Total phosphorus (TP) determined by digesting samples with acidic potassium persulphate in an autoclave at 121°C, followed by reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate to form a molybdenum-phosphorus complex measured colorimetrically at 880 nm.
  - Other determinands: river water filtered through a 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane; analyzed for soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP), total oxidisable nitrogen (TON, dominated by nitrate in river waters), and silicon (Si) using standard spectrophotometric methods.
  - Quality control standards analyzed with each batch.

- Format of the dataset:
  - Date/time recorded in day/month/year hours:minutes format.

- Key parameter descriptions:
  - Total phosphorus: includes dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered water.
  - Suspended sediment concentration: mass of solids retained on Whatman GF/C filter per liter of river water.
  - Total oxidisable nitrogen (TON): total dissolved nitrogen present as nitrate and nitrite (nitrate dominates in river waters).
  - Dissolved reactive silicon: molybdate-reactive silicon that has passed through a 0.45 μm filtered sample.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus: molybdate-reactive phosphorus that has passed through a 0.45 μm filter; also known as filterable reactive phosphorus.
