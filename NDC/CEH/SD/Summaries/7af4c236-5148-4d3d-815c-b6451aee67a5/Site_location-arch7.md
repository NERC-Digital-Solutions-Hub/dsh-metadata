# East Stoke gauging station, Dorset, UK

## Context for GIS Specialists
- Focus: create map-based data visualisations to help policy colleagues, clients, and the public understand hydrological features.
- Workflow emphasis: collaborate with end users, verify and quality‑check data, clean and transform data, and integrate datasets from multiple sources and resolutions.
- Analytical focus: identify significant spatial features, decide how best to present them, and iterate through testing and user feedback.

## Purpose of the map product
- Visualise hydrological features around East Stoke to support comprehension and exploration of water networks.
- Demonstrate where the East Stoke gauging station sits within the surrounding rivers and watercourses.

## Key spatial elements depicted
- Point: East Stoke gauging station (hydrological data site).
- Rivers and watercourses: River Hooke, Sydling Water, River Cerne, South Winterbourne, River Frome, River Piddle.
- Spatial relationships among rivers and the gauge location.
- Map scale indicator showing distances (0, 4, 8, 16 km) and a north orientation cue.

## Data workflow considerations for GIS work
- Data discovery and verification: identify suitable hydrological datasets for rivers and gauge data.
- Data integration: combine datasets from multiple sources, potentially across different resolutions.
- Data quality and standards: ensure consistency and reliability across layers.
- Handling large/complex datasets: package and present data in manageable, map-friendly formats.
- Data cleaning and transformation: standardise attributes, projections, and geometries.

## Visualization and presentation guidance
- Present river networks as line features with clear styling to convey flow and connectivity.
- Represent the gauging station as a distinct point with appropriate metadata (e.g., station ID, elevation, data availability).
- Use a clear, user-friendly coordinate system and basemap to support interpretation.
- Include a legend and metadata to aid end-user understanding and reproducibility.

## Use cases and audience impact
- Policy colleagues, clients, and the general public can explore the spatial layout of rivers and the gauging station.
- Facilitates discussion of hydrological monitoring, catchment relationships, and related planning or policy decisions.

## Challenges and considerations highlighted
- Data availability and resolution gaps across different sources.
- Inconsistent data standards complicating integration.
- The need to package large or complex datasets into accessible map products.
- Skill development within teams to carry out cleaning, transformation, and GIS analysis effectively.
