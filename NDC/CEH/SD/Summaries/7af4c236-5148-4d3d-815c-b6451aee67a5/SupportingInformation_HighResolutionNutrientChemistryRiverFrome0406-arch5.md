# Brief description of the dataset

## Overview and provenance
- Produced by CEH Dorset between 2004 and 2006.
- Sampling and analysis carried out by Mike Bowes.
- Samples taken from the River Frome at the East Stoke gauging weir, Dorset (National Grid Reference SY 867868) using Epic water samplers; manual samples taken occasionally with a dip sampler, usually during storm events.

## Analytical chemistry methods and quality control
- All determinands analyzed by standard colorimetric methods using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
- Total phosphorus determined by digesting samples with acidic potassium persulphate in an autoclave at 121°C, then reacting with acidic ammonium molybdate to form a molybdenum-phosphorus complex measured at 880 nm.
- Other determinands measured on filtered river water (0.45 µm cellulose nitrate filter): SRP, TON (nitrate/nitrite, with nitrate dominating in river waters), and silicon using standard spectrophotometric methods.
- Quality control standards analyzed alongside each batch.

## Dataset content and format
- Date/time format: day/month/year hours:minutes.
- Definitions of key variables:
  - Total phosphorus: dissolved plus acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered water.
  - Suspended sediment concentration: mass of material retained on a Whatman GF/C filter per litre of river water.
  - Total oxidisable nitrogen (TON): total dissolved nitrogen present as nitrate and nitrite.
  - Dissolved reactive silicon: molybdate-reactive silicon in 0.45 µm filtered water.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus: molybdate-reactive phosphorus that passes through a 0.45 µm filter (also known as filterable reactive phosphorus).

## Data governance considerations for reuse
- The dataset clearly specifies provenance, sampling methods, analytical techniques, units, and key variable definitions, supporting data discovery and appropriate reuse.
- Users should consult the referenced J Hydrol. article for broader context and methodology.
- Documentation notes are present for QC procedures, but additional metadata (e.g., data stewardship details, update plans) are not provided in this summary and may require direct inquiry for ongoing governance or timely updates.
