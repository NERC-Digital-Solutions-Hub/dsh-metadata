# Brief description of the dataset

- Produced by CEH Dorset between 2004 and 2006; sampling and analysis conducted by Mike Bowes. Samples collected from the River Frome at the East Stoke gauging weir (National Grid Reference SY 867868) using Epic water samplers, with occasional manual dip sampling during storm events.
- Analytical chemistry methods:
  - All determinands analysed by standard colorimetric methods using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
  - Total phosphorus determined by autoclave digestion with acidic potassium persulphate, then reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate and colorimetric measurement at 880 nm.
  - Other determinands: river water filtered through a 0.45 µm membrane and analysed for SRP, TON (nitrate plus nitrite, with nitrate dominating in rivers), and Si using standard spectrophotometric methods.
  - Quality control standards analysed alongside each batch.
- Reference for methodology: Bowes MJ, Smith JT, Neal C. The value of high resolution nutrient monitoring: a case study of the River Frome, Dorset, UK. Journal of Hydrology 2009; 378: 82-96.
- Format and contents:
  - Date/time recorded as day/month/year hours:minutes.
  - Total phosphorus concentration includes both dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in an unfiltered sample.
  - Suspended sediment concentration = mass of solids retained on Whatman GF/C filter per litre of river water.
  - Total oxidisable nitrogen (TON) = total dissolved nitrogen present as nitrate and nitrite (nitrate dominates in river waters).
  - Dissolved reactive silicon = molybdate-reactive silicon that passes through a 0.45 µm filtered sample.
  - Soluble reactive phosphorus (filterable reactive phosphorus) = molybdate-reactive phosphorus that passes through a 0.45 µm filter.
- Dataset handling and purpose:
  - Emphasises standardised data collection and quality assurance, suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Demonstrates high-resolution nutrient monitoring and can be used to increase dataset value when combined with other data or made accessible for broader analysis.
