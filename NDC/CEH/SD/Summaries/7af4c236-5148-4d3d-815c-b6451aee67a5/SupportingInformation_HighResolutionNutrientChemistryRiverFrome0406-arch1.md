# Brief description of the dataset

- Produced by CEH Dorset between 2004 and 2006; sampling and analysis conducted by Mike Bowes.
- Samples collected from the River Frome at the East Stoke gauging weir, Dorset (National Grid Reference SY 867868) at the CEH River Laboratory; occasional manual samples taken with a dip sampler during storm events.
- Analytical chemistry performed with standard colorimetric methods using a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
- Total phosphorus determined by digestion with acidic potassium persulphate in an autoclave at 121°C, followed by reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate to form a molybdenum-phosphorus complex measured colorimetrically at 880 nm.
- Other determinands (SRP, TON, Si) analyzed after filtering river water through a 0.45 μm cellulose nitrate membrane, using standard spectrophotometric methods.
- Quality control standards run alongside each batch.
- For more information, see Bowes et al. (2009) Journal of Hydrology.

## Analytical methods and determinands

- Determinants and instruments:
  - All determinations via colorimetric methods on a Seal AQ2 discrete analyzer.
  - Total phosphorus: digestion with acidic potassium persulphate, autoclave 121°C, reaction with acidic ammonium molybdate, measured at 880 nm.
  - SRP, TON, Si: filtered samples (0.45 μm) analyzed via standard spectrophotometric methods.
- References for methods:
  - DoE (1981, 1993); Murphy and Riley (1962); Eisenreich et al. (1975) for TP digestion.
- QA:
  - Quality control standards analyzed with every batch.

## Data format and variable definitions

- Date/time format: day/month/year hours:minutes.
- Total phosphorus: sum of dissolved and acid-extractable particulate phosphorus in unfiltered water.
- Suspended sediment concentration: mass of solids retained on Whatman GF/C filter per liter of river water.
- Total oxidisable nitrogen (TON): total dissolved nitrogen present as nitrate and nitrite (nitrate-dominated in river waters).
- Dissolved reactive silicon (DRSi): molybdate-reactive silicon passing a 0.45 μm filtered sample.
- Soluble reactive phosphorus (SRP): molybdate-reactive phosphorus passing a 0.45 μm filtered sample; also known as filterable reactive phosphorus.
