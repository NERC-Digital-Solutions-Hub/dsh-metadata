# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

- Aims to provide annual, high-resolution land cover maps for the UK to support monitoring and decision-making.
- Product consists of seven datasets split between Great Britain and Northern Ireland: three per region (10 m Classified Pixels, Land Parcels, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels) plus a 1 km summary raster covering both GB and NI.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 83% for full thematic detail.

## What the data are and how they are structured

- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Derived from multiple Classification Scenes using Bootstrap Training and Random Forest.
  - Output: first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class; second band = classification confidence.
  - Does not undergo Land Parcel Spatial Framework generalisation to preserve fine features below 0.5 ha MMU.
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by intersecting the 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
  - Provide parcel-level attributes and a fixed spatial framework for change detection.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Rasterised version of the Land Parcel data with bands: dominant land cover (mode), mean confidence (conf), and pixel purity (purity).
- 1 km Summary rasters (GB and NI)
  - Summary of 25 m data to provide dominant class, percent cover by class, and aggregated results at 1 km resolution.
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2 based, resampled to 10 m; four seasonal composites (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) with 10 spectral bands; occasional cloud gaps handled by the classifier.
- Context Rasters
  - 10 m context layers used to reduce spectral confusion (terrain, proximity to buildings/roads/water, foreshore and coastal masks, etc.).
  - GB and NI have region-specific context rasters to improve classification performance.
- Classification Scenes
  - GB: grid of 32 Classification Scenes (approx. 100 x 100 km tiles) to cover land surface; NI: single 49-band Classification Scene (40-band Sentinel-2 plus NI context rasters).
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Minimum parcel size ~0.5 ha; designed to represent discrete land units and reduce noise; historic parcel identifiers may differ from previous releases.

## Methodology: how the map is produced

- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic, requires no new field campaigns.
  - Uses historic, wall-to-wall maps (LCM2020–2022) with >80% probability and consistent class across years to build training data for the current map.
  - Helps provide a large training set for better RF learning; minor changes over the interval (e.g., rotations) may reduce training suitability for some classes (e.g., arable vs improved grassland).
- Random Forest classification
  - Balanced training via sampling with replacement; each bag yields 10,000 samples.
  - Produces the 10 m Classified Pixel product and associated confidence.
  - Classified technology stack includes Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL; all open source.
- Validation and accuracy assessment
  - 33,107 validation points across 21 classes from GB countryside survey, open data inventories, and field/image-interpretation points.
  - Overall accuracy 83% for full thematic detail (referenced in Appendix 4).
- Data provenance and reproducibility
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; methods and production details documented in accompanying references (e.g., Marston et al. 2023/2024).
  - Formal note that method changes can yield small differences year-to-year.

## Data products and accessibility (scope for analysts)

- Datasets and metadata
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel (vector) products (GB and NI)
  - 1 km Summary Rasters (GB and NI)
  - Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters
- Usage guidance
  - 10 m pixels are not generalised by the Land Parcel framework to preserve detail; calibration/validation focused on the 25 m parcel dataset.
  - The 1 km products are summaries and may exhibit small rounding errors; sums of percentage covers may not exactly equal 100 due to rounding.
- Citations and DOIs
  - Each dataset has its own DOI; recommended to cite the respective data product when using outputs (see Table 5 in the document).
  - References Marston et al. (2023/2024) provide overview and methods.
- Display and visualization
  - Appendix 5 and Appendix 6 provide colour recipes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (including a color-blind friendly version) and accompanying QGIS symbol files.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and their context

- LCM2023 uses 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan Broad Habitats (BAP), but not identical to BAP definitions.
- Classes are presented with notes on potential spectral confusion and density of training data; some BAP Broad Habitats are split or aggregated for mapping efficiency.
- Appendices outline detailed definitions for each class and guidance on how these map to BAP Broad Habitats (Appendix 1 and Appendix 2).

## Known issues and caveats

- Minor vector land parcel gaps: some parcels missing in vector products; negligible impact on 1 km summary rasters. 10 m classified pixels unaffected.
- Annual method changes: small differences in methods across years may cause apparent changes that are due to technique rather than real land cover change.
- Training data limitations: Bootstrap Training may be less effective for areas with rapid or unusual recent changes (e.g., specific crop rotations in arable vs improved grassland).

## Practical implications for data-driven questions

- Strengths
  - High-resolution (10 m) pixel-level maps with explicit confidence metrics.
  - Large, consistent training data across years enabling change detection and trend analysis.
  - Spatial framework (Land Parcel) supports robust change monitoring and per-parcel analyses.
- Limitations
  - Local-scale accuracy can vary by class; some spectral confusions persist (e.g., various grassland types, peat-related classes).
  - Differences between parcel-based and pixel-based representations may affect cross-year comparisons; awareness of MMU and framework changes is important.
- Recommended approach for analysts
  - Use 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels for stable, parcel-level analyses and change detection.
  - Leverage 10 m Classified Pixels for detailed mapping where fine features matter, with attention to confidence bands.
  - Utilize context rasters and seasonal composites to interpret potentially confounded classifications.
  - Reference the DOIs and Marston et al. papers for methodological context and reproducibility.
