# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- Annual UK land cover map produced by UKCEH; builds on previous LCM series (LCM1990–2022).
- LCM2023 consists of seven datasets: three regional datasets for Great Britain and Northern Ireland (GB and NI) plus a 1 km summary raster product covering both GB and NI.
- Land cover is classified into 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, aligned with the Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats where possible, and produced using automated methods to enable yearly updates.
- Overall formal validation accuracy is 83%.

## Data products and structure
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Derived from multiple Classification Scenes; each pixel holds:
    - Band 1: Most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer)
    - Band 2: Class membership probability (confidence)
  - GB uses 32 Classification Scenes; NI uses a single 49-band Classification Scene (Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite plus Context Rasters).
  - 10 m pixels are not generalized by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine-scale features.
- Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create land parcel attributes.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Rasterised version of the Land Parcel data with three attributes carried per parcel:
    - Band 1: Dominant class ("mode")
    - Band 2: Mean confidence ("conf")
    - Band 3: Parcel purity ("purity")
  - Minimum parcel size (MMU) ~0.5 ha; used to reduce noise and enable robust time-series comparisons.
- Vector Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - GIS vector delineation of land parcels with unique identifiers (gid; note: gid differs from older LCM2015 identifiers due to framework reordering).
- 1 km Summary Raster data (GB and NI)
  - Summarises 25 m rasters to 1 km cells.
  - Outputs: dominant class (1 band), dominant aggregate class (1 band), and percentage cover (21 bands for classes; 10 bands for aggregates).
  - Rounding may cause sums to be slightly above/below 100%; coastal cells may sum to less than 100% due to mapping extent.
- Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters
  - Seasonal composites derived from Sentinel-2 (four seasons) with 10 m context rasters to improve disambiguation of spectrally similar classes.
- Data quality and provenance
  - Datasets provide DOIs for citation and traceable data lineage.

## Production methods and governance
- Bootstrap Training and Random Forest classification
  - Bootstrap Training: automatic, self-starting training using historic LCM maps (LCM2020–2022) to sample current imagery; selects high-probability pixels (>80%) that agree across three years.
  - Random Forest classifier trained on Bootstrap Training samples; aims for balanced learning across classes.
  - Training data limitations: arable and improved grassland transitions in a three-year window are harder to capture; such cases may rely on additional datasets (e.g., UKCEH Land Cover Plus: Crops).
- Contextual and spectral data
  - Classification Scenes: GB divided into tiles (~100 km scales; some larger in remote areas) to manage regional phenology variation; NI uses a single 49-band scene.
  - Context rasters (terrain, distance to features, foreshore masks, etc.) added to reduce spectral confusion.
- Validation
  - 33,107 validation points across all 21 classes; uses a composite reference dataset from field surveys, open data inventories, and manual interpretation.
  - Reported overall accuracy: 83%.
- Data custody and citations
  - Each dataset has a DOI; recommended citation includes Marston et al. (2024a–g) and Morton et al. (2011/2023) depending on product.
  - Disclaimer: annual method variations may cause slight differences between maps; changes over time reflect both real change and methodological updates.

## Metadata, access, and stewardship
- Coordinate systems and extents
  - GB: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
  - NI: Irish TM75 grid (EPSG: 29903)
  - GB extent: ~0–700000 E, 0–1300000 N; NI extent truncated to relevant area.
- Scale and resolution
  - 10 m classified pixel data; 25 m land parcel rasters; 1 km summary rasters.
- Parcel counts
  - GB parcels: 6,741,294; NI parcels: 902,252.
- Data provisioning and updates
  - LCM2023 is designed for annual updates; method evolution is expected to yield improvements and potential re-application of methods to improve temporal consistency.
  - Users are advised that differences with earlier maps can arise from both real changes and method changes.
- Governance considerations for data stewards
  - Clear provenance through Bootstrap Training and RF-based classification.
  - Transparent validation and per-class accuracy information supported by Appendix 4.
  - Availability of DOIs and recommended citations enables traceable data lineage and reproducibility.
  - Awareness of potential discrepancies with historical parcel identifiers due to framework changes.

## Known issues and caveats
- Vector land parcel products may have a small number of missing polygons; negligible impact on 1 km rasters, but affects some vectors.
- 10 m Classified Pixels are validated against 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels rather than the 10 m product, so spatial validation results may differ by product type.
- Class-level confusion remains (e.g., between various grassland types, bog, peat-associated classes, and some coastal vs freshwater distinctions) despite the use of Context Rasters.
- Saltwater vs Freshwater classification can be confused in tidal areas; coastal water mapping is lower priority and may incur some lower accuracy.
- Some limitations in separating BAP Broad Habitats spectrally; Appendix 1 discusses interpretive nuances and potential misclassifications.

## Usage guidance for data stewards
- Use the 10 m Classified Pixels for high-resolution mapping and change detection at fine scales; combine with 25 m Parcel data for stable time-series analysis.
- Leverage the 1 km summary rasters for broad-scale overview and rapid assessments, bearing in mind rounding and coastal area effects.
- When tracking changes over time, rely on the annual series to distinguish real land cover change from methodological updates; use Bootstrap Training history to understand classifier evolution.
- Refer to the BAP crosswalk (Appendices 1–2) to interpret land cover classes in the context of biodiversity planning and reporting.
- Document and communicate method version when distributing derivatives or conducting longitudinal analyses to ensure reproducibility.
