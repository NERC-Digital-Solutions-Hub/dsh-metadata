# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- User guide for UKCEH Land Cover Map 2023 (LCM2023).
- Product suite: seven geospatial datasets (three per Great Britain and Northern Ireland) plus a 1 km summary raster. Includes:
  - 10 m classified pixel dataset
  - Classified land parcels
  - 25 m pixel rasterised land parcels
  - A 1 km summary raster product (GB+NI)
- Classification approach: automated using Classification Scenes derived from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images plus Context Rasters; Bootstrap Training and Random Forest (RF) classifier.
- Annual production aims to improve temporal consistency, enable change detection, and help differentiate real change from classification error.
- Overall formal validation accuracy: 83%.

## UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes mapped to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats (not always a one-to-one match).
- In texts, UK BAP Broad Habitats are italicised to distinguish them from UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
- Appendix guidance explains relationships and mapping decisions, including special cases (e.g., Freshwater vs Saltwater, Urban vs Suburban, specific splits like Heather vs Heather grassland).

## Datasets and Product Suite ( GB and NI )
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets
  - Produced by mosaicking Classification Scenes; each pixel gets:
    - The most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (integer)
    - The associated classification probability (confidence)
  - GB uses 32 Classification Scenes; NI uses a single Classification Scene for NI.
  - 10 m pixels are not generalized by the Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine details (e.g., narrow features). Validation for this dataset is separate from the 25 m parcel dataset.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework (minimum parcel size ~0.5 ha, MMU).
  - Parcels typically dominated by a single land cover class; used for data cleaning, change detection, and easier GIS handling.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterisation of the Land Parcel dataset to 25 m grid; three bands carry per-parcel attributes:
    - Band 1: dominant land cover (mode)
    - Band 2: mean confidence (conf)
    - Band 3: parcel purity (purity)
- 1 km summary rasters
  - Summary rasters produced by aggregating 25 m rasters to 1 km cells.
  - Outputs include dominant class per 1 km pixel and percentage cover per class and per aggregate class.
  - Percentage products are integer values; sums may deviate from 100 due to rounding; coastal pixels may sum to less than 100 due to mapped area fractions.
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Four seasonal composites (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) derived from Sentinel-2; 10 bands used.
  - Some cloud gaps may occur, but the classification tolerates partial spectral information.
- Context Rasters
  - Context rasters added to reduce spectral confusion:
    - Great Britain: height, aspect, slope; distance to buildings, roads, tidal water, freshwater; foreshore, woodland, and saltmarsh masks.
    - Northern Ireland: height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, roads; foreshore, tidal water.
- The UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - A long-standing framework (derived from generalisation of national cartography) used to create land parcels.
  - Ensures parcels are discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, etc.) and typically dominated by a single land cover.
  - 0.5 ha MMU; GB and NI parcel geometries are stable, but GID identifiers may not match older datasets.

## Production Methodology
- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training dataset generation using historic LCM maps (LCMs 2020–2022) to sample current satellite imagery.
  - Pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across three years are used to bootstrap training data.
  - Helps leverage wall-to-wall historic coverage without expensive new field data.
- Random Forest classification
  - RF classifier trained on Bootstrap Training samples (balanced by undersampling/bootstrapping).
  - Each 10 m pixel mosaic classified to yield class membership and a probability/confidence value.
- Software and workflow
  - Custom UKCEH software integrating WEKA (machine learning) with PostGIS and GDAL.
  - Based on open-source components.

## Validation, Quality, and Known Issues
- Validation
  - 33,107 validation points across all 21 classes; overall accuracy 83%.
  - Reference data sources include GB countryside surveys, open data inventories, Rural Payments Agency data, and bespoke validation points.
- Known issues
  - A small number of polygons are missing from the vector land parcel products, causing nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised parcels; negligible effect on 1 km products.
  - 10 m classified pixels dataset remains unaffected by these parcel vector gaps.
- Citing and provenance
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; Table 5 lists DOIs and primary references (including Marston et al. 2023/2024 works).
  - Disclaimer: annual changes reflect both real land cover change and methodological changes between years.

## Data Access, Formats, and Metadata
- Coordinate systems
  - Great Britain: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
  - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid TM75 (EPSG: 29903)
- Extents and coverage
  - GB and NI coverage; GB parcel counts approximately 6,741,294 parcels; NI parcels approximately 902,252.
  - Pixel resolutions: 10 m (GB and NI for classified pixels); 25 m (parcels rasterised); 1 km summary rasters aggregate the 25 m data.
- Datasets and naming
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
  - Land Parcel Products (GB and NI)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (GB and NI)
  - 1 km Summary Rasters (GB and NI)
- Visualization and color
  - Appendix 5 provides recommended color schemes for displaying the 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes.
  - Appendix 6 provides color-blind-friendly color schemes.
  - QGIS symbology files (lcm_raster.qml and lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml) accompany the data for quick map styling.

## Practical Considerations for GIS Workflows
- Use contexts and parcel framework to reduce spectral confusion and enable robust change detection across years.
- The 10 m classified pixels preserve fine-grained features but come with class probabilities; use the probability band to assess confidence.
- The 25 m parcel rasters provide a more generalized, Z-order-friendly product suitable for standard GIS analyses and long-term change detection.
- The 1 km rasters are useful for coarse-scale analyses and cross-border comparisons.
- Be mindful of differences and potential mismatches between LCM2023 and earlier LCM products due to updated identifiers and processing changes.
- When comparing with older datasets (LCM2015 or earlier), use the provided Appendix 4 correspondence and DOIs to interpret cross-year changes.
