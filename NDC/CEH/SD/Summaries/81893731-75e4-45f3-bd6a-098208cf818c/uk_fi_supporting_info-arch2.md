# Collection of water samples:

- Scope and study area
  - Fieldwork conducted autumn (September–November) 2018–2020
  - UK sites across England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland; collaboration with Faroese Geological Survey (Jarðfeingi) for Faroe Islands
  - Sampling at sites with peat or organic soils; water bodies including pools, headwaters, streams, inlets, reservoirs, lakes, outlets
  - Sites located across catchments with multiple locations per catchment; access constraints observed

- Sampling methods
  - In situ site variables: pH, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, water temperature; concomitant air temperature, pressure, humidity
  - Grab water samples (50 mL) collected at each site; filtered in the field through 0.45 µm syringe filters; samples kept cold (cool bag in field, cool box in transit) and stored at 4 °C in the lab
  - Water chemistry analysis performed on filtered samples: dissolved organic/inorganic carbon, absorbance at eight wavelengths, dissolved nutrients, cations, metals, and anions
  - Organic matter sampling (≈ one third of sites): large water sample filtered to remove particulates, concentrated to ≈100 mL, evaporated to dryness; residue used to characterize DOM and POM

- Organic matter analysis
  - DOM and POM analyzed for elemental content (C, H, N, O) using Elementar Vario MICRO cube
  - Treatments to remove inorganic carbonates applied prior to organic carbon assessment

- Quality assurance and data validation
  - Lab QA: 10% of samples re-analyzed in replicate; instruments calibrated at run start and with ongoing checks
  - Data QA: replicate results compared; within 95% agreement averaged; if discordant, re-analysis performed
  - CHNO-derived metrics restricted by physical property considerations

- Datasets and key contents
  - UK_FI_Water_Chemistry (N = 448)
    - Site metadata: site code
    - Environmental conditions at sampling: air temperature, humidity, air pressure, bank temperature (10 cm soil probe), water temperature
    - Water chemistry at site: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO)
    - Lab-based chemistry: DOC, SUVA254, E4/E6, DON, Prop_DON, DOP, Prop_DOP, concentrations of Ca, K, Mg, Na, Al, Mn, Fe, Pb, Cd, Co, Cu, Ni, Zn, Li

- Data management and accessibility
  - Datasets created from field and lab analyses
  - Data stored and prepared for upload to appropriate data portals to support transparent monitoring and policy assessment over time
