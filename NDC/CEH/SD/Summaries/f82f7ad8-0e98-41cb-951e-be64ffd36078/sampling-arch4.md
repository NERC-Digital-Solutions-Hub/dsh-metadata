# Sampling Design

- Study period and location
  - July 2015 to December 2015
  - Gurue district, Zambezia province
- Village selection and design
  - Ten villages chosen to create a land scarcity gradient from land-abundant to land-constrained
  - Villages selected during a scoping visit with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation
  - Gradient-based sampling intended to capture diversity in land use and pressures

- Data collection methods and participatory activities
  - Participatory maps
    - Village leader organizes participants in the village center
    - Led by a research assistant fluent in the local language (Elomwe)
    - Group discussions lasting 1–2 hours
    - Ground-illustrated notes using a field protocol legend (points for description, check, notes; features like streets, community limits, houses, fields, crops, water sources, energy sources, forest products, and other elements)
  - Seasonal calendar
    - Village leader convenes a group; discussions take about one hour
    - Conducted by a field assistant in Elomwe
    - Collects: main subsistence and cash crops; average household cropland; field isolation vs blocks; seasonal timelines for key crops (sowing, growing, harvest) across crops such as maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya
  - Trend analysis
    - Village leader facilitates discussions with a group; one-hour sessions
    - Cards and stone voting to illustrate changes over time across topics:
      - Agricultural production (land under cultivation, soya area, productivity)
      - Land availability and use
      - Forest and forest products
      - Wellbeing and migration trends
    - Topics evaluated over years and changes (e.g., deforestation, crop pests, market access)
  - Land allocation and access
    - Questions on how families obtain land/forest for new fields
    - Considerations of migrants, settlers, and natives
    - Triggers for opening new land (commercial crops, fertility, land loss, capital, tractors)
    - Vegetation type conversion (native forest, secondary forest, shrub land, etc.)
    - Location preferences for commercial crops (most fertile land, newly opened land, proximity to home)
  - Village profiles
    - Interviews with village leader and key persons
    - Guideline coverage: village structure, foundation year, war displacement and return, education, health, water, land tenure (DUAT), markets and distance, migration patterns, livelihoods (charcoal, agriculture, livestock, others), external actors, and external commercial activities
  - Interview with local leader details
    - Charcoal: production locations, sales, licenses, associations, chainsaws, external producers
    - Agriculture: main crops, productivity, field locations and sizes, marketing outside the village, extension services, training, processing of soya, possible conflicts, producer associations, historical land use, deforestation concerns
    - Livestock and other products: main animals, sales, pasture, other forest products
    - Origin of forest products; sources if no forest locally
    - Natural disasters or shocks and impacts
  - Change and drivers assessment
    - Social change: most notable changes, whether conditions improved or worsened
    - Environmental changes: forest area, biodiversity, water, soil quality; implications for daily life; beneficiaries vs. those affected; future change expectations
    - Reasons for changes: deforestation, soil fertility loss, market access, climate, etc.
  - Wealth ranking
    - All households in each village ranked by wealth
    - Led by local leaders with Elomwe-speaking assistant
    - Qualitative notes accompany the ranking (categories: very poor, poor, middle, rich) and potential movement between categories

- Data themes and variables captured
  - Land and agriculture
    - Cropland area per household; land under soya; productivity indicators
    - Land availability perceptions and constraints
    - Field location, isolation vs blocks; vegetation conversion
  - Crops and farming practices
    - Main subsistence and cash crops (e.g., maize, sorghum, manioc, beans, rice, vegetables, soya, etc.)
    - Seasonal calendars for sowing, growing, and harvesting across crops
  - Forestry and natural resources
    - Forest area changes; forest products (timber, charcoal, honey, fruits, construction materials)
  - Wellbeing and social factors
    - Quality of life indicators; migration trends; access to services
  - Village structure and livelihoods
    - Village foundation, education, health, water, markets, migration, livelihoods activities
  - Conflict and risk
    - War impacts, post-war recovery, natural disasters, crises
  - Wealth and social organization
    - Wealth categories, potential mobility between categories

- Language, protocol, and operational notes
  - Fieldwork conducted with local language support (Elomwe)
  - Exercises follow a standardized field protocol with timelines (group sessions ranging from 1–2 hours, 1-hour calendar sessions)
  - Interviews and profiles structured to capture a mix of quantitative indicators and qualitative context
  - Documentation includes structured legends, annual/year-based trend prompts, and mapped, ground-illustrated data collection

- Practical aims for data use
  - Build a multi-village, gradient-based data set on land scarcity, agricultural change, forest use, and household wellbeing
  - Enable cross-village comparisons and trend analysis over time
  - Inform data governance considerations such as data quality, metadata, discoverability, and user-centered data products through participatory and community-informed methods
