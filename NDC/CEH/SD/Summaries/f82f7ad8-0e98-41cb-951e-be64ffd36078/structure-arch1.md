# Details of data structure

- Overview
  - Dataset comprises 34 RTf documents and 20 CSV documents.
  - Each document contains interview transcripts from one of the study villages.
  - Interviewees’ names are kept anonymous.

- Data files and their content
  - Participatory_map_engl (10) and Participatory_map_port (10): maps created with village groups.
  - Seasonal_calendar_port (3) and Seasonal_calendar_engl (4): seasonal calendars developed with villages.
  - Trendanalysis_port (5) and Trendanalysis_engl (10): trend analyses conducted with village participants.
  - Village_profiles (1): profile data from two-week Lioma pre-visit in July 2015; interviews with village leaders/representatives.
  - Wealthranking_qual (11): qualitative information from wealth ranking exercises across study villages.

- Data collection and processing
  - Exercise led by a research assistant with groups of 3–8 villagers in each village; field protocol followed.
  - Notes taken in local language; transcripts prepared in Portuguese.
  - Translations to English performed by another assistant and checked by a third party.
  - Field work included a two-week pre-visit in July 2015 covering 13 villages in Lioma.

- Language and translation
  - Original notes in local language; transcripts produced in Portuguese.
  - English versions created via translation and third-party verification.

- Temporal and geographic scope
  - Study located in Lioma region; data collection occurred around July 2015.
  - Included multiple villages (13 in Lioma during pre-visit; overall study villages across several exercises).

- Anonymity and ethics
  - Names of interviewees are kept anonymous.

- Data provenance and quality control
  - Clear documentation of who led exercises, adherence to field protocol, and translation workflow (Portuguese to English with verification).

- Implications for analysis
  - Requires harmonization across language versions and data types (RTF and CSV).
  - Cross-dataset synthesis possible across participatory maps, seasonal calendars, trend analyses, village profiles, and wealth rankings.
  - Consider potential translation-related nuances and ensure proper metadata for reproducibility.
