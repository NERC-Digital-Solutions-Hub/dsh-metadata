# Sampling Design

- Period and site: July 2015 to December 2015; Gurue district, Zambezia province.
- Village selection: 10 villages chosen along a land-scarcity gradient driven by expanding agriculture and population density; selected to have similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation.
- Data collection approach: combination of participatory and structured methods to capture environmental and socio-economic conditions; led by researchers and language-capable assistants (Elomwe); field protocol followed.

## Participatory maps

- Process: village leader convenes a group in the village centre; exercise led by a research assistant fluent in Elomwe.
- Time: typical group discussion lasts 1–2 hours.
- Method: field-ground illustration using natural materials; all protocol items discussed and mapped.
- Output elements: features such as streets, community limits, neighbouring communities, topography (mountains/valleys), rivers, houses, fields, crops, land uses (subsistence vs cash crops), forests, energy sources, forest products, pests, threats, construction materials, etc.

## Seasonal calendar

- Process: village leader organizes group discussion; 1 hour per discussion; field protocol followed.
- Participants and content: main subsistence and cash crops listed and ranked; questions on cropland area, field distribution, proximity to home, and land access.
- Seasonal crop mapping: detailed month-by-month calendar for sowing, growing, and harvest periods for maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya, and other crops with blank cells to be filled as applicable.

## Trend analysis

- Process: similar participatory setup with group discussions; documented by a language-capable assistant.
- Activities: discussion and illustration of historical years with ground cards to capture changes (e.g., post-war return, soya introduction, notable events).
- Tools: stone voting exercises to depict changes over time across topics.
- Topics tracked over years:
  - Agricultural production (land under cultivation, soya area, productivity).
  - Land availability (scarcity, suitability, coping strategies).
  - Forest and forest products (area, availability, restrictions, scarcity, coping).
  - Wellbeing (quality of life, meaningful changes, inclusivity of benefits, migration trends and conflicts).

## Land allocation

- Questions focus on access to land/forest for new fields:
  - Who decides land allocation (residents vs leaders)?
  - Is the process identical for migrants, settlers, natives?
  - Timing and rationale for opening new land (production goals, fertility, land loss, economic capacity, machinery).
  - Types of vegetation converted to agricultural land (native forest, secondary forest, shrub land, others).
  - Preferred locations for commercial crops (most fertile land, newly opened land, proximity to home).

## Village profiles

- Interview with village leader and key persons; guided by a field researcher and language assistant.
- Coverage areas: village structure (HH numbers, bairros, leaders), foundation and wartime displacement/recovery, education (schools, pupil numbers, attendance, origins), health (centres, issues), water (boreholes), land (DUAT, conflicts), market access (distance, frequency, main products), migration patterns and drivers, livelihoods (LH) and community activities (COM).
- Soya-specific questions: timeline of introduction, production models, contracting companies, extension services, training, processing, market conflicts, producer associations, prior land use, deforestation concerns.
- Other products: forest products, origin of inputs, producers, and sources if village forest is lacking.

## Change and natural disasters

- Sections cover social change and environmental change:
  - Social change: most notable changes since a defined period; perceived direction and impact.
  - Environmental change: changes in forest area, flora/fauna, water availability/quality, soil quality; implications for daily life; beneficiaries vs. those adversely affected.
  - Reasons: drivers such as deforestation, soil degradation, fire, market access, and commercial agriculture.

## Wealth ranking

- Method: household wealth ranking within each village, led by researchers and language-capable assistants.
- Participants: leaders and other key community figures.
- Output: qualitative categorisation into Very poor, Poor, Middle, Rich; notes on mobility between categories and context for the wealth stratification.

## Outputs and data management (implied)

- Standard outputs anticipated: clear reports, maps, and charts.
- Data handling: datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to support transparency and reuse.
- Key objective for analysts: integrate these standardized data streams to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time, and to allow broader access and reuse by others.

## Particular Challenges

- Increasing the value of datasets by linking them with other relevant data sources (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Enabling broader access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs.
