# Sampling Design

- Study context and period
  - Location: Gurue district, Zambezia province, Mozambique
  - Timeframe: July 2015 to December 2015
  - Purpose: Develop a land-scarcity gradient by selecting ten villages at different stages of land constraint with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation

- Participatory maps
  - Process
    - Village leader organizes a group in the village center
    - Exercise led by a research assistant fluent in Elomwe
    - Group discussions last 1–2 hours
    - All items in the field protocol discussed and illustrated on the ground using natural materials
  - Data produced
    - Map layers corresponding to community boundaries, neighboring communities, streets, mountains/valleys, rivers, houses, fields, crops, subsistence and cash crops, fallow land, soil types, water sources, markets, schools, health facilities, churches/essential buildings, energy sources, forest products (timber, charcoal, honey, etc.), pests, devastators, and construction materials
    - A legend system (Legend 1–3) and standard field prompts for consistent recording

- Seasonal calendar
  - Process
    - Village leader and assistant conducted 1-hour group discussions following the field protocol
  - Data produced
    - Crop-specific calendars for subsistence and cash crops (e.g., maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya) detailing sowing, growing, and harvesting periods
    - Questions covering cropland area, field measurement methods, land fragmentation (isolated vs. block fields), and cropland distribution over the year
    - Additional prompts on land use timing and agricultural priorities

- Trend analysis
  - Process
    - Village leader convened group discussions in the village center
    - 1-hour group sessions guided by a Elomwe-speaking assistant and field protocol
  - Data produced
    - Year-specific discussions and ground illustrations on:
      - When people returned after war, start of soya production, and other notable changes
      - Changes in agricultural production, land availability, forest access, and wellbeing
      - Migration trends, market access, and potential conflicts
    - Cards used to discuss years/events and a stone-voting exercise to depict changes across topics:
      - Agricultural production
      - Land availability
      - Forest and forest products
      - Wellbeing
      - Land allocation processes and vegetation conversion
      - Preferred locations for commercial crops

- Land allocation and vegetation change
  - Topics covered
    - How families obtain land/forest for new fields
    - Equity of access (migrants, settlers, natives)
    - Triggers for opening new land (production goals, soil fertility, land loss, economic capacity, tractor use)
    - Types of vegetation converted to agriculture (native forest, secondary forest, shrub land, others)
    - Preferred locations for growing commercial crops (most fertile land, newly opened land, proximity to home)

- Village profiles and interviews
  - Interview structure
    - With village leader and/or key person
    - Led by a researcher with Elomwe-speaking assistant
    - Guideline-based covering:
      - FOUNDATION: village foundation year, war-related displacement and return
      - EDUCATION: schools, pupil numbers, attendance, origin of pupils, education levels
      - HEALTH: main health issues, health centre, medicine access
      - WATER: boreholes, location, water quality
      - LAND: DUAT status, land conflicts, land constraints
      - MARKET: nearest market, distance, frequency, principal products
      - MIGRATION: migration trends, origins/destinations, reasons, demographic effects
      - LIVELIHOOD ACTIVITIES: main activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock), onset timing
      - COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES: external actors’ involvement (charcoal, agriculture, livestock)
  - Focus areas for soya and forest use
    - Soya production: start time, production model, contracting company, extension/training, processing, conflicts, producer associations, prior land use and deforestation concerns
    - Other forest products: types, origins, and market participation
  - Change and drivers
    - Social and environmental changes, drivers (deforestation, soil fertility, market access, climate factors)
    - Implications for daily life, beneficiaries, and potential future village trajectories

- Wealth ranking
  - Procedure
    - All households in each village ranked by wealth
    - Conducted by researchers and local language-speaking assistant
    - Participating group comprised of leaders (e.g., leader, secretario, regulo)
  - Outputs
    - Qualitative notes and a wealth categorization (Very poor, Poor, Middle, Rich)
    - Assessment of mobility between categories and potential transitions

- Data collection considerations for GIS specialists
  - The study yields multiple GIS-relevant data types:
    - Participatory map layers representing land use, settlements, infrastructure, and natural features
    - Attribute-rich legend entries (descriptions, checks, notes) for map features
    - Time-based data from seasonal calendars and trend analysis for temporal GIS analyses
    - Village profiles and leadership interviews as structured attribute datasets
    - Change over time indicators (agriculture, land, forest, wellbeing) suitable for time-series or multi-temporal mapping
  - Data integration opportunities
    - Combine participatory maps with official spatial data (boundaries, land tenure, infrastructure)
    - Create thematic layers for subsistence vs. cash crops, land allocation, and forest products
    - Use trend and wealth data to contextualize spatial patterns (e.g., land access, migration corridors)
  - Practical considerations
    - Language and protocol consistency (Elomwe) for reliable field data
    - Standardized field prompts to ensure comparable map features across villages
    - Documentation of foundation years, war impacts, and post-war changes to support historical GIS analysis
