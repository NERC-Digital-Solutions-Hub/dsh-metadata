# Sampling Design

- Study period and location: July 2015 to December 2015; Gurue district, Zambezia province.
- Village selection: Ten villages chosen along a land scarcity gradient (from land-rich to land-constrained) with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation to enable comparative analysis.
- Overall aim of the design: To capture environmental health and livelihood dynamics across varied land availability contexts, informing monitoring and policy decisions.

## Data collection methods and instruments

- Participatory maps
  - Conducted in village centers; led by a research assistant fluent in Elomwe.
  - One group discussion per village, lasting 1–2 hours.
  - Field protocol guided discussion; maps illustrated on the ground with natural materials.
  - Collected data includes village features such as streets, community limits, neighboring communities, topography, water sources, markets, schools, health facilities, energy sources, forest products, pests, fauna, construction materials, and other key assets.

- Seasonal calendar
  - Group discussions, approximately 1 hour, led by a field assistant in Elomwe.
  - Structured questions on main subsistence and cash crops, landholdings, field proximity and isolation, and crop-specific calendars (sowing, growing, harvest periods) for crops like maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, and soya.

- Trend analysis
  - Village-level discussion with year-based change illustrations using cards and stone voting to depict changes over time.
  - Focus areas include: agricultural production (cultivated area, soya expansion, productivity), land availability, forest and forest products, and wellbeing (quality of life, migration trends, conflicts).

- Land allocation
  - Questions on how land/forest is allocated for new fields and whether processes differ for migrants, settlers, and natives.
  - Considerations of timing for opening new land and drivers (e.g., demand for commercial crops like soya, land fertility, financial capacity, tractor use).
  - Vegetation types converted to agriculture and preferred locations for commercial crops (most fertile land, newly opened land, proximity to home, etc.).

- Village profiles and interviews
  - Interviews with village leaders or key persons; guided by a standardized structure.
  - Topics include village foundation and wartime displacement, education (schools, pupil attendance), health (centers, prevalent problems), water (boreholes, quality), land and tenure (DUAT, conflicts), markets, migration, livelihood activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock), and external market participation.
  - Specific modules on charcoal, agriculture (main crops, field locations, processing, soya production models and actors, extension services, training, conflicts, associations, historical land use, deforestation concerns), livestock, and other forest products (timber, honey, medicinal plants).
  - Natural disasters and shocks, social and environmental changes, causes behind changes, and future expectations.

- Wealth ranking
  - All households within each village are ranked by wealth with participation from village leadership.
  - Qualitative notes accompany the ranking, and transitions between categories (very poor to poor, poor to middle, middle to rich) are explored.

## Data characteristics and indicators

- Spatial indicators
  - Village maps capturing land use, infrastructure, and resource access (roads, markets, schools, health facilities, forests, water sources).

- Temporal indicators
  - Seasonal crop calendars enabling analysis of crop timing and potential climate/seasonality effects.
  - Trend data on production, land availability, forest use, and wellbeing across years and events (e.g., post-war rebuilding).

- Agricultural and land-use indicators
  - Cropland extent; area under soya; overall productivity; land availability; land allocation processes; conversion of vegetation types to agriculture.

- Forest and natural resource indicators
  - Forest area and accessibility; forest product availability; extraction patterns; potential deforestation from commercial crops.

- Wellbeing and migration indicators
  - Quality of life changes; migration trends and causes; potential conflicts arising from changing livelihoods and land use.

- Socioeconomic indicators
  - Wealth rankings; household-level assets and standing within the community; capacity for land expansion.

## Timing, logistics, and scope

- Field teams
  - Use of local language capabilities (Elomwe) to facilitate participation and data accuracy.
  - Structured field protocol to ensure consistency across villages.

- Outputs
  - A combination of participatory maps, seasonal calendars, trend illustrations, land-allocation narratives, village profiles, and wealth rankings to inform monitoring, policy evaluation, and future decision-making.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks

- The design provides multi-dimensional environmental health measures, including spatial, temporal, and socio-economic indicators, aligned with monitoring needs for policy scrutiny and future planning.
- It emphasizes stakeholder participation, data verification through triangulation, and standardized data collection templates to enhance comparability and reduce data silos.
- By highlighting data-driven challenges (e.g., data access, metadata, and governance considerations) it demonstrates practical pathways for producing transparent, shareable outputs that can inform future environmental health monitoring and governance.
