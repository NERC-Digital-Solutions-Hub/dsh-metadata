# Methodology

- Field protocols were prepared in Portuguese for each exercise, ensuring local relevance and consistency.
- Training of assistant/translator: initially, the lead researcher worked with one assistant; the assistant was trained before each interview, and later conducted exercises independently.
- Triangulation and focusing: topics were discussed with various groups to validate information from multiple perspectives; contextual information from interviews, conversations, and focus groups helped refine focus.
- Composition of group: village leaders gathered participants as requested; focus groups included both men and women with inclusive invitations.
- Translation: a translator/native speaker accompanied the researcher; questions were translated between Portuguese and Elomwe as needed.
- Note taking: notes were captured by the lead researcher and the assistant.
- Discussion: after each interview, information was discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding; clarifications were sought via locals when needed.
- Transcript in English: at the office, notes were written in English; assistant notes in Portuguese were translated to English.
- Back-up: several backups were prepared for all documents.
