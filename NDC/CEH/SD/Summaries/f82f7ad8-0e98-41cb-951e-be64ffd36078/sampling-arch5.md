# Sampling Design

## Overview
- Timeframe: July 2015 to December 2015
- Study site: Gurue district, Zambezia province
- Objective: select villages along a land-scarcity gradient to collect structured, participatory and household-level data; ensure infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation are similar across sites to enable comparisons.

## Study Site and Sampling
- Ten villages selected to represent a gradient from abundant land to intense land constraints.
- Selection guided to maintain comparable infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation.

## Data Collection Methods and Tools
- Participatory maps
  - Village leader convenes participants; assisted by a local-language research assistant (Elomwe)
  - Group discussions last 1–2 hours
  - Field data illustrated on the ground with natural materials
  - Data captured include features such as community limits, neighbourhoods, mountains/valleys, rivers, houses, fields, crops, land use, water sources, energy sources, forest products, and construction materials
- Seasonal calendar
  - Group discussions guided by field protocol and local language support
  - Structured questions cover main subsistence and cash crops, cropland, field isolation, and crop calendars (sowing, growing, harvesting periods) for crops like maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya, etc.
- Trend analysis
  - Group discussions with year-by-year illustration using cards and a stone-voting exercise
  - Topics include: agricultural production, land availability, forest/forest products, wellbeing, migration
  - Focus on changes over time: land under cultivation, cropping-lot dynamics, productivity, forest area/products, quality of life, and related drivers (war, new crops, market changes, disasters)
- Land allocation
  - Assesses processes for establishing new land/forest areas
  - Questions cover decision-making authority, eligibility (migrants, settlers, natives), timing, drivers for expanding land, vegetation conversion (native forest, secondary forest, shrub land), and preferred locations for commercial crops
- Village profiles
  - Interviews with village leaders and key figures
  - Structured guideline covering: village structure (leaders, schools, health facilities), foundation and wartime displacement, education, health, water, land tenure, markets, migration, livelihoods (LH activities like charcoal and agriculture), and external commercial activities
  - Detailed subsections on charcoal and agriculture (main crops, productivity, field locations, market links, extension services, training, processing, potential conflicts, associations)
  - Forest products and origin of materials; natural disasters; perceived social and environmental changes; causal factors
- Wealth ranking
  - Household wealth ranking conducted with village leadership
  - Categories: Very poor, Poor, Middle, Rich
  - Qualitative notes on characteristics and mobility between categories

## Data Variables and Templates
- Agricultural and land variables
  - Main subsistence crops and main cash crops with priority rankings
  - Cropland area, land under soya, productivity, land availability
  - Forest area and forest products (timber, honey, charcoal, etc.)
  - Quality of life indicators and migration trends
- Crop calendars
  - Seasonal calendars for key crops (maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya) with sowing, growing, and harvest periods
- Village and household profiling
  - Village foundation, migration history, education and health indicators, water access, land tenure (DUAT), markets
- Qualitative and participatory data
  - Changes over time in agriculture, land, forests, wellbeing, and social dynamics
  - Narratives on drivers of change and future expectations
- Documentation
  - Each data collection activity is accompanied by dates, interviewer identifiers, community names, and protocol adherence notes

## Data Governance, Quality and Provenance
- Standardized field protocols and templates ensure consistency across sites
- Activities are led by trained personnel and, where possible, local-language assistants to maintain clarity and inclusivity
- Rich metadata is embedded in the process (dates, villages, interviewees, roles)
- Data are captured through a mix of qualitative (interviews, group discussions, wealth ranking) and quantitative elements (cropland area, crop calendars, rankings)
- The design supports traceability, potential updates, and cross-site comparability across the ten villages

## Key Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Capturing a complete picture of user needs and ensuring data usefulness for diverse stakeholders
- Timely collection and processing of data from multiple villages
- Achieving adherence to data standards across varied topics (agriculture, land, forests, livelihoods)
- Integrating data from different formats and tools (maps, calendars, cards, interviews)
- Handling large, multi-layered datasets and updating them over time
- Managing data arising from non-interoperable local contexts (e.g., unique village practices, local terminologies)

## Endnotes and Outputs
- The protocol yields comprehensive village profiles, trend analyses of agricultural and environmental changes, land allocation patterns, wealth rankings, and a nuanced understanding of local livelihoods and governance dynamics
- Outputs are designed to support data discoverability and practical use by researchers, policymakers, and practitioners working on land, agriculture, forest resources, and community development in similar contexts
