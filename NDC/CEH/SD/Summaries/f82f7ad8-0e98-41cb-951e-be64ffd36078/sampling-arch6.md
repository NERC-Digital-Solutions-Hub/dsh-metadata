# Sampling Design

- Study period and site: July 2015 to December 2015; Gurue district, Zambezia province.
- Village selection: Ten villages chosen along a land scarcity gradient (from abundant land to land-constrained), with similar infrastructure, soils, rainfall, and vegetation to enable comparison.
- Data goal: Build a baseline and capture changes related to land use, agriculture, forest resources, and livelihoods to inform policy and community planning.

## Data Collection Approach

- Participatory methods: Led by a village leader with a research assistant fluent in the local language (Elomwe); sessions held in village centers; use of ground illustrations and natural materials.
- Time investment: Each participatory exercise typically required 1–2 hours for maps; 1 hour for seasonal calendars; duration guided by field protocol.
- Language and protocol: Fieldwork conducted per a standardized protocol, with translation support to ensure consistency and understanding across groups.

## Participatory Maps

- Purpose: Elicit spatial perceptions of village boundaries, land features, and resource access.
- Process: Group drawings and discussions using a legend to describe features such as streets, community limits, houses, fields, crops, water sources, markets, schools, and natural resources.
- Outputs: Ground-marked maps indicating local land uses, notable features, and access points, enabling spatial data integration.

## Seasonal Calendar

- Focus: Document crop calendars and farming timing for major crops (e.g., maize, manioc, beans, vegetables, soya) across sowing, growing, and harvest periods.
- Data collection: Group discussion and illustration of timing for each crop, including period-specific activities and land use.
- Outputs: A seasonality framework to align agricultural planning with local practices and to support time-series analysis.

## Trend Analysis

- Purpose: Capture historical changes and key turning points in the village context.
- Method: Group discussions and card-based year discussions, followed by stone voting on prioritized topics.
- Topics tracked:
  - Agricultural production: land under cultivation, crop area (e.g., soya), productivity, reasons for changes, pest trends.
  - Land availability: perceived land constraints, access, and responses to scarcity.
  - Forest and forest products: forest area changes, access restrictions, availability of forest products, and scarcity responses.
  - Wellbeing: changes in quality of life, inclusivity of benefits, and migration trends.
- Time reference: Yearly comparisons to identify drivers and impacts over time.

## Land Allocation and Use

- Land allocation process: How families obtain land/forest for new fields; roles of residents versus leaders; criteria for new land opening.
- Inclusivity: Examination of whether processes differ for migrants, settlers, and natives.
- Decision drivers: Triggers for new land opening (economic needs, soil fertility, land loss, capacity to farm, mechanization).
- Vegetation conversion: Types converted to agriculture (native forest, secondary forest, shrub land, etc.).
- Cropping location preferences: Preference for most fertile land, newly opened land, or land near home.

## Village Profiles

- Interview framework: Conducted with village leaders and key persons; data gathered through structured guidelines.
- Core domains:
  - Foundation and history: village founding, wartime displacement and return.
  - Education: schools, pupil numbers, attendance, origin of pupils, education level.
  - Health: key health problems, health facilities, traditional medicine presence.
  - Water: boreholes, location, water quality.
  - LAND: DUAT status, land conflicts, constraints.
  - MARKET: nearest markets, distance, frequency, principal products.
  - MIGRATION: migration trends post-war, origins and destinations, drivers, conflicts.
  - LIVELIHOODS (LH ACTIVITIES): main activities (charcoal, agriculture, livestock, others), onset timing.
  - COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES (COM ACTIVITIES): external actors' commercial activities in the village.
- Livelihood specifics:
  - AGRICULTURE: major crops (including soya), productivity, field locations and distances, off-village sales, extension services, training, processing and potential conflicts or deforestation links.
  - SOYA: production timeline, contractual models, company partners, training, extension services, and producer associations.
  - LIVESTOCK and OTHERS: types, sale patterns, pasture, and additional marketable products.
  - FOREST PRODUCTS: major products used or traded, sources, and market involvement.
  - ORIGIN of products: supply chain and local versus external sourcing.
  - NATURAL DISASTER: past shocks (floods, pests, droughts, conflicts), timing, and who was affected.
- Outputs: Rich village and household context, land-use dynamics, and market/linkages illustrating how villages function within broader regional systems.

## Wealth Ranking

- Procedure: All households within each village ranked by wealth with participation from local leaders and language-capable assistants.
- Structure: Leadership participants, household characteristics, and qualitative notes.
- Wealth categories: Very poor, Poor, Middle, Rich, plus notes on movement between categories (e.g., very poor to poor; poor to middle; middle to rich).
- Rationale: Provides socio-economic context to interpret disparities in access to land, resources, and markets.

## Outputs and Data Use

- Data products likely produced from the study:
  - Participatory maps and associated attribute legends.
  - Seasonal calendars outlining crop timing and management.
  - Trend analysis results showing historical changes across key domains.
  - Land allocation guidelines and village-level land-resource insights.
  - Village profiles detailing governance, infrastructure, livelihoods, and market access.
  - Wealth rankings and accompanying qualitative descriptors for targeting interventions.
- Potential uses: Informs policy planning, resource management, agricultural extension, land governance, forest conservation, and community development initiatives; supports comparative analysis across villages along the land scarcity gradient.

## Data Quality, Access, and Challenges

- Quality controls: Standardized field protocol, use of local language facilitators, structured checklists, and illustrated mapping to ensure consistency.
- Data integration: Cross-village comparability achieved through uniform data collection instruments and shared conceptual frameworks (e.g., seasonal calendars, trend prompts).
- Challenges to consider:
  - Memory biases in trend recollections and year-based assessments.
  - Sensitivity around land tenure, resource access, and migration topics.
  - Variability in participation and potential power dynamics within groups.
  - Translating nuanced participatory outputs into comparable quantitative indicators.
