# Field protocols

## Overview
- Field protocols were prepared in Portuguese for each exercise, establishing standardized procedures.

## Training and staffing
- Initially, the lead researcher and one assistant/translator conducted exercises.
- The assistant was trained on interview objectives and question delivery before each session.
- Later, the trained assistant conducted exercises independently.

## Triangulation and focus
- Information was validated by discussing topics repeatedly with different groups/persons.
- Context from interviews, conversations, and focus groups helped to progressively refine interview focus.

## Group composition and inclusivity
- The village leader typically gathered a group as requested.
- Focus groups included both men and women; everyone was explicitly invited to contribute.

## Translation and language management
- A translator/assistant fluent in the local language accompanied the researcher.
- Questions could be translated between Portuguese and Elomwe as needed.

## Note-taking and documentation
- Notes were taken by the lead researcher and the assistant.
- After fieldwork, notes were transcribed into English; assistant notes in Portuguese were translated to English.

## Post-interview discussion and clarification
- After each interview, information was discussed with the assistant or a colleague to improve understanding.
- Clarifications were sought with locals if needed.

## Data backups
- Multiple backups were prepared for all documents to safeguard data.
