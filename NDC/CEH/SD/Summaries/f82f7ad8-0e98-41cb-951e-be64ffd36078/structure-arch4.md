# Details of data structure

## Overview
- A dataset of interview transcripts from 13 Lioma villages, collected during a field study in July 2015.
- Comprises 34 RTF documents and 20 CSV documents containing transcripts of interviews.
- Interviewees are anonymized.
- Data collected through multiple exercises, each with specific thematic outputs.

## Data collection, processing, and provenance
- Exercises led by a research assistant (RA) with groups of 3–8 villagers per village.
- Field protocol strictly followed; notes taken in the local language.
- Transcripts prepared in Portuguese; translations to English performed by another assistant and finally checked by a third party.
- Lead researcher and RA collaboratively conducted portions of the Trendanalysis across villages.

## Language and translation workflow
- Primary data in Portuguese; English translations provided for analysis.
- Translation chain includes a secondary translator and a third-party quality check to ensure accuracy.

## Scope and context
- Two-week pre-visit in July 2015.
- Data collected through interviews with village leaders or representative individuals and additional group activities (participatory maps, seasonal calendars, trend analyses, wealth rankings).
- All data recorded in Portuguese; English transcripts compiled after field work.

## Data governance and quality considerations
- Anonymization of interviewees to protect identities.
- Multiple formats (RTF and CSV) and multilingual content requiring harmonization.
- Clear documentation of field procedures and translation/validation steps to support data quality and reproducibility.

## Access, discoverability, and documentation needs
- Metadata should capture: village, exercise type, language, transcript status (Portuguese/or English), and translators/validators.
- Documentation needed to link each document to its fieldwork event, village, and participants while preserving anonymity.
- Consideration for consolidating disparate formats into a cohesive, searchable data catalog.
