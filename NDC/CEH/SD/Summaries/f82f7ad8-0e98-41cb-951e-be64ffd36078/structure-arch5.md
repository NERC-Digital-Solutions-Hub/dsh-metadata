# Details of data structure

## Overview
- The dataset comprises 34 RTF and 20 CSV documents containing interview transcripts from study villages.
- Interviewee names are kept anonymous.

## Data inventory
- Participatory_map_engl: 10
- Participatory_map_port: 10
- Seasonal_calendar_port: 3
- Seasonal_calendar_engl: 4
- Trendanalysis_port: 5
- Trendanalysis_engl: 10
- Village_profiles: 1
- Wealthranking_qual: 11

## Data collection and processing workflow
- Exercises conducted by a research assistant with groups of 3–8 villagers in each village.
- Field protocol followed; notes taken in the local language; transcripts prepared in Portuguese.
- Translations to English conducted by another assistant and finally checked by a third party.

## Language, translation, and quality checks
- Local language notes; Portuguese transcripts; English translations.
- Multistage quality checks ensure translation accuracy and consistency.

## Anonymization and privacy
- Interviewee identities are anonymized.

## Data formats and sharing
- File formats include RTF and CSV.
- Transcripts cover multiple exercises and language stages (Portuguese and English).

## Provenance and quality assurance
- Clear documentation of field leadership, translation workflow, and third-party checks.
- Adherence to field protocol documented across exercises.

## Implications for data governance (Data Stewards)
- Maintain anonymization, robust translation provenance, and clear metadata.
- Implement standardized metadata fields (dataset type, village, language, translator, date, field protocol, anonymization status, file format).
- Ensure versioning, access controls, and update processes are in place.
- Facilitate data discovery via proper cataloguing and linkage between related files (e.g., village-specific folders and exercise types).

## Notes for cataloguing and future work
- Each file corresponds to a specific village and exercise; capture mapping and provenance in metadata.
- Track language pair (local language to Portuguese to English) and translator credits for transparency.
