# Section 1: Overview

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the data submitted for the Bislak River Styles Report and the paper “River Styles and stream power analysis reveal the diversity of fluvial morphology in a Philippine tropical catchment.”
  - Initial analyses conducted March–October 2020; methods are discussed in Section 2; analyses and data gathering were led by Tolentino, Perez, and Guardian, with the rest of the authors reviewing River Styles classification.
- Data assets produced
  - Segment-stream power shapefiles and spreadsheets
    - Derived using TopoToolbox V2 to extract the stream network and compute catchment areas; only alluvial channels (>1 km^2) used.
    - Data cleaned with non-parametric quantile regression and quantile carving (τ = 0.5) to ensure downstream decreasing elevations; slope averaged over 0.2 km segments (1129 segments); outputs include mean elevation, mean slope, median catchment area per segment length.
    - Validation of stream network position against Google Earth imagery.
    - Omega (Ω) computed for constant total stream power using the relationship Ω = 0.44 χ A S, with γ (unit weight of water), A (catchment area), and S (slope) as inputs.
    - Resulting files: shapefiles with segment-level stream power attributes and .csv spreadsheets of stream power partitioned by River Style.
  - River Style identification shapefiles
    - Stage One River Styles identification following the River Styles Framework (confinement, planform, geomorphic unit assemblage, and bed material texture).
    - Outputs include polygon shapefiles for landscape units (lowland, upland, hills, catchment) and polylines for isohyet and river styles.
    - Classification informed by Google Earth imagery (reach-level, ~1:75k to 1:10k; unit scales ~1:5k to 1:500) and ground-truthing; expert judgement governs classification due to multilayer criteria.
- Processing workflow and data standards
  - Data processing and analysis steps are anchored in established methods and references (Section 2 provides full details).
  - Data are organized to enable downstream analyses by River Style, with stream power and geomorphic attributes linked to spatial units.
- Data lineage and authorship
  - Data gathering and analyses conducted by a core team in 2020; Section 2 provides methodological detail.
  - Supporting documentation and multiple CSV and segment files accompany the shapefiles to enable replication and transparency.
- Supporting documentation and metadata
  - A comprehensive set of CSVs accompanies the spatial data, including:
    - RS_Complete_Confined_Floodplain_Pockets.csv, RS_Complete_Confined_Gorge.csv, RS_Complete_Confined_Steep_Headwater.csv, RS_Complete_Laterally_Unconfined_Braided.csv, RS_Complete_Laterally_Unconfined_Deltaic.csv, RS_Complete_Partly_Confined_Bedrock.csv, RS_Complete_Partly_Confined_Planform_Low_Sin.csv, RS_Complete_Partly_Confined_Plan.csv, and several variants with column headers and details specified (e.g., FID, X, Y, Z, Strahler/Shreve orders, area, distance to outlet, slope, chi values, ks n values, Stream Power).
    - Segment-level files: Bislak_200m_segment.csv and Bislak_50m_segment.csv, mapping attributes such as stream_pow, coordinates, elevations, stream orders (Strahler/Shreve), flow accumulation, distance to outlet, gradient, chi (0.45 and 0.79 concavity indices), normalised channel steepness (ksn), and related area/distances.
  - Detailed metadata structure includes coordinate axes (x, y, z), lineage identifiers (FID), river style names, segment identifications, and multiple derived metrics.
