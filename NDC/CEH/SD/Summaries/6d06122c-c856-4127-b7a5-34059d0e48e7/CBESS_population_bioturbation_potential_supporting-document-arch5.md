# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) population bioturbation potential in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats..

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides population bioturbation potential (BPp) data derived from field observations to assess ecosystem function in coastal habitats.
  - BPp calculated from data collected at 6 sites across 2 locations, covering 2 habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh) with winter and summer 2013 sampling.
  - Sampling included 3 replicates across 22 quadrats at 4 spatial scales.

- Study sites and habitat contrasts
  - Locations: Essex (Abbotts Hall, Fingringhoe Wick, Tillingham Marshes) and Morecambe Bay (Cartmel Sands, Warton Sands).
  - Habitat contrasts: saltmarsh with differing soil types (clay in Essex, sandy soils in Morecambe Bay) and mudflats with sediment differences (cohesive clays in Essex vs coarser sediments in Morecambe Bay).
  - Essex and Morecambe Bay saltmarsh regions differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation; mudflats differ in sediment texture accordingly.

- Personnel
  - Staff responsible: Christina Wood and Martin Solan.

- Data collection and processing
  - Field methods (CBESS campaign, winter and summer 2013): 3 cylindrical cores per quadrat (10 cm depth, fixed in 4% buffered formalin in seawater), sieving through 0.5 mm, preservation, and taxonomic identification to species level.
  - Abundance and biomass: counts per species per replicate; biomass measured by weighing samples after drying; data standardized to a per-square-meter basis.
  - BPp calculation: BPp = BPi × Ai, where Ai = individual species abundance per square meter and BPi = (sqrt biomass) × mobility × reworking rate. Abundance and biomass are combined to produce per-sample BPp per species.
  - Data handling: raw data input by two people with double-checking; biomass cross-checked against abundance data; BPp calculations double-checked.
  - Calibration and data checks: calibration indicated as NA where applicable; data quality checks performed on inputs and derived BPp values.

- Data formats and content
  - File formats: CSV.
  - Dataset fields include: Row Number, Season (Winter or Summer), Location (Essex or Morecambe), Site (e.g., AH, FW, TM, CS, WS), Quadrat Number (Mudflat or Saltmarsh), Scale (A–D with defined meter ranges), Replicate number, Measurement Type (BPp), and species-specific BPp values (e.g., Arenicola marina, Ampharete lindstroemi, etc.) with corresponding abundance/biomass figures.
  - The dataset records BPp for numerous taxa (e.g., Arenicola marina, Hediste diversicolor, Macoma balthica, Mytilus edulis juveniles, Crangon crangon, Carcinus maenas, etc.) across habitats and sites.

- Documentation and metadata
  - Dataset includes detailed field descriptions for variables (e.g., Season, Location, Site, Scale, Replicate, Measurement Type) and species-level BPp measurements.
  - Procedures and formulas for BPp calculation are documented, along with data checking and quality control steps.

- Data governance, availability, and challenges
  - Public sharing considerations: data quality controls and provenance are described; potential sharing constraints (e.g., embargoes or disclosure risks) are acknowledged in governance context.
  - Key challenges relevant to data stewards: timely access from multiple sites, ensuring adherence to metadata standards across systems, interoperability across platforms, handling large multi-site datasets, and updating or maintaining legacy databases.

- Reuse considerations and caveats
  - No planned repeats for the sampling beyond the 2013 CBESS field campaign, which may affect long-term comparability.
  - Users should consider context of habitat contrasts, site-specific sediment types, and seasonal sampling when interpreting BPp results.
  - Documentation is thorough for data structure and processing, but users may need to reference exact species-level BPp calculation parameters and replicate handling for reproducibility.
