# Coastal biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) population bioturbation potential in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats..

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a detailed dataset on population bioturbation potential (BPp) in mudflat and saltmarsh habitats as part of CBESS.
  - Aims to enable assessment of environmental health, ecosystem functioning, and inform monitoring decisions.

- Study design and locations
  - Data collected from 6 sites across 2 locations: Essex and Morecambe Bay.
  - Each location includes 2 habitat types: mudflat and saltmarsh.
  - Sampling occurred during winter and summer 2013; no planned repeats beyond the campaign.

- Sampling and field procedures
  - At each site, 3 replicates across 22 quadrats were sampled at 4 spatial scales.
  - Sediment cores: 3 cylindrical cores per quadrat (10 cm depth, 10 cm diameter) fixed in 4% buffered formalin in seawater.
  - Cores were sieved; organisms identified to species (or appropriate taxon) and counted for abundance; biomass weighed (0.0001 g precision as needed).
  - Biomass and abundance data used to compute BPp for each sample.

- Variables, measurements, and BPp calculation
  - Primary output: Population bioturbation potential (BPp) per sample population.
  - BPp calculation (as described in the dataset):
    - BPp = BPi × Ai
    - Ai = individual species abundance per m^2
    - BPi = (√Bi) × Mi × Ri
    - Bi = biomass per m^2; Mi = mobility; Ri = reworking
  - Species-level data includes abundance and biomass for a wide range of taxa (e.g., Arenicola marina, Hediste diversicolor, Macoma balthica, Crangon crangon, and many others), enabling BPp calculations across taxa and habitats.
  - Location-specific habitat descriptions emphasize contrasting sediment types, soil textures (clay vs. sandy), inundation frequency, creek structure, and vegetation.

- Data handling and quality assurance
  - Raw data input by two people with subsequent double-checking.
  - Biomass data cross-validated against abundance data to ensure consistency.
  - BPp calculations validated and double-checked.
  - Data are organized with detailed provenance, including staff responsible for data collection and processing.

- Dataset structure and metadata
  - File format: CSV.
  - Detailed dataset field descriptions provided, including:
    - Row numbering for original input order.
    - Seasonal, location, site, and quadrat identifiers.
    - Scale categories (A–D) representing spatial extents.
    - Replicate numbers and measurement type (BPp).
    - Species-level entries with corresponding BPp or count values.
  - Metadata include explicit descriptions for each variable and a comprehensive list of observed taxa and their BPp-related measurements.
  - Clear handling of missing data (NA indicates no data in cells).

- Accessibility, documentation, and governance
  - Comprehensive documentation of field methods, laboratory procedures, and data processing steps to support reproducibility.
  - Includes explicit descriptions of measurement types, specimen processing, and data transformations.
  - Provides a transparent trail from raw counts and biomass to the final BPp values, with explicit formulae and quality checks.

- Relevance for monitoring framework authors
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data lifecycle: study design, rigorous field sampling, taxonomic identification, biomass and abundance measurement, computation of a functional metric (BPp), and thorough QA.
  - Highlights the importance of detailed metadata, standardized field formats, and clear data provenance for monitoring outputs.
  - Shows how a complex ecological indicator (BPp) can be decomposed into species-level contributions across multiple habitats and seasons, aiding policy evaluation and decision-making.
  - Underlines the value of documenting calculation methods and data checks to ensure transparency and comparability across monitoring initiatives.
