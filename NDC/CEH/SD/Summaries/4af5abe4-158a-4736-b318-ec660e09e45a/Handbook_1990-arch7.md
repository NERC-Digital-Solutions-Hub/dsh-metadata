# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview and Aims
- Update land use databases and ensure outputs are current for ecological monitoring and modelling.
- Combine satellite imagery (top-down) with ground-truth field surveys (bottom-up) using the ITE Land Classification System.
- Resurvey in 1990 to monitor changes; expand sample to 512 sites (128 new, 128 previously surveyed); enhance data capture and collaboration.
- Standardise field recording to minimise observer variation; quality control and a clear Field Handbook are essential.

## Data Structure, Standards, and Outputs
- Primary data products are map-based GIS outputs derived from detailed field records.
- Data collection uses Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and 1:10,000 scale maps; annotated with coded attributes.
- Coding system employs primary and secondary codes; alpha codes used to compress multi-code information on maps (e.g., A for boundary details). Never use X or 0 as alpha codes; I/J confusion avoided; sequences extend beyond Z to AA, AB, etc.
- Universal and specialized codes cover: land use, vegetation, boundaries, buildings/structures/communications, physiography, inland water, boundaries, verge/road types, etc. Codes exist for “no longer present,” boundary conditions, and various boundary/landscape elements.
- Data quality relies on standardised recording, field validation, and documentation in FABs; API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) aids feature identification but ground-truthing prevails.

## Field Procedures, Planning, and Permissions
- Planning divides sample squares into six groups with teams of about 85 squares each; teams are flexible and coordinators manage logistics.
- Permission to access land is critical; if refused for all parts or for significant portions, adapt by abandoning that square or relocating to a replacement square.
- Permissions are sought from landowners/farmers; prior contact recommended but may introduce delays. Identity cards and project briefings are standard.
- Documentation highlights ownership details, contact information, and a scoring of owner cooperation to inform subsequent surveys.
- If permission issues arise, escalate to Station Coordinators for guidance and replacement square selection.

## Equipment and Field Tools
- Equipment provided by Merlewood: FABs, aerial photographs, detailed maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, marker plates, sampling gear, navigation aids.
- Local ITE stations supply location aids, pencils, cameras, field books, first-aid, etc.
- Personal gear and field clothing are the surveyor’s responsibility.

## Mapping, Data Recording, and API
- Each square is mapped on enlarged 6" (1:10,000) sheets; multiple data codes annotate land cover and features.
- FABs compile pages by section (ownership, farmer information, physiography/water, cover types, boundaries, buildings/communications, etc.); all parts must be neatly completed.
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) assists feature identification, boundary indications, and feature placement; if ground evidence conflicts, field data prevail.
- Minimum mapping units: 1/25 hectare; minimum mappable length: 20 meters.
- Boundaries must be clearly marked and distinguished between actual and interpreted boundaries; codes reflect edge definitions and “no longer present” statuses where applicable.

## Plot Types and Vegetation Recording (6.2)
- Quadrats (6.2.2):
  - Large: five 200 m2 quadrats per square, pre-positioned and relocated where necessary.
  - Small: five 2x2 m quadrats placed in natural/semi-natural vegetation types.
  - Permanent marking: metal plates placed near quadrat corners to aid relocation; plates may be positioned differently in various terrains.
  - Nested recording: inner 4 m2 quadrats recorded first; species and 5% cover estimates documented; subsequent nested quadrats add more species data; final cover estimates cover all species ≥5%.
  - Detailed standard forms require location, land use, physiography, slope, shade, grazing, and a full species list with percentages.
  - Permanent markers and sketches/FAB backs reveal plot location, measurements, and landmarks; photographs accompany plots for context.
- Linear plots (6.2.3; 6.2.4):
  - Hedge, streamsides, and roadsides: up to five 1 m wide linear plots per square, aligned to the dominant vertical feature; location determined to minimize overlap and avoid bias.
  - Boundary plots prioritized; if necessary, relocate to nearest permissible boundary feature and document.
  - Plots marked with fixed plates; recording captures all species within plot, with cover estimates.
  - 1978 rules for locating plots (hedges, streams, roadsides) guide relocation when squares were previously surveyed; ensure minimum separations (e.g., 10 m apart).
- Species identification (6.2.5):
  - Surveyors identify to species where possible; certain difficult genera are recorded as accepted combinations (e.g., Cardamine hirsuta/flexuosa) to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list; non-listed species go to “Other.”
- Sampling design discusses a two-tier approach with permanent plot markers to enable future longitudinal comparisons.

## Freshwater Biota and Sampling (Section 7)
- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP) is conducted in each square when possible.
- 7.1 IFE biota sampling is described separately; 7.2 NELUP sampling focuses on water beetles.
- Two standing-water samples per square reflect typical habitat types (lakes, ponds, pools, ditches, calcareous/acid flushes, bogs, and superficial water features); samples are preserved with formalin and logged with square, date, and observer details.
- Clear site descriptions accompany samples and transport arrangements are arranged to Merlewood.

## Photography (Section 8)
- Photograph every vegetation plot to document general appearance and landmark context.
- Plot numbers are displayed on a board in the photo for reference.

## Procedures Subsequents (End-of-Day and Data Transfer)
- End-of-day checks ensure no features are omitted; data should not be transcribed again unless necessary due to damage or map loss.
- FABs and samples are to be transported to ITE stations promptly for processing.

## Data Integration, QA, and Future Work
- The Countryside Survey 1990 aims to standardise methods across observers, enabling reliable change-detection analyses and integration with satellite-derived data.
- Permanent markers, relocation protocols, and documented field methods enable repeat sampling and robust GIS-based analysis in future cycles.

## Contact and Reporting
- Background information and coordination are managed by ITE and Merlewood Research Station; further updates or clarifications can be obtained through the project contacts listed in the handbook.
