# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and background
  - Series of GB surveys to sample data from the natural environment, enabling updates to land-use databases and informing ecological modelling and monitoring.
  - Field Handbook establishes standard guidelines for data collection, recording, and quality control to enable consistent, comparable data across observers and years.
  - Two-tier data approach linking bottom-up field data with top-down satellite imagery to produce land-cover maps and ground-truth data; ongoing monitoring to identify trends and changes by 1990 and beyond.

- Aims for data collection and outputs
  - Capture land-cover, landscape features, vegetation, soils, and habitat information across a standardized 1 km grid.
  - Create a consistent Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and maps to enable self-serve data use and later analysis.
  - Build datasets suitable for linking field observations with remote sensing, allowing projection and trend analysis.

- Planning and logistics
  - 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990, allocated to six ITE stations; six teams (~85 squares each).
  - Each square planned for approximately three survey days; flexible scheduling to accommodate access, travel, and leave.
  - Travel efficiency prioritized; no overtime payments initially; time off in lieu for accumulated travel/field time.

- Equipment and field tools
  - FABs, 1:10,000 aerial photographs, large-scale maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, pens, markers, survey poles, measuring tapes, navigation tools, and safety gear.
  - Additional station- and surveyor-provided items (maps, cameras, field guides) and personal equipment.

- Field procedures and permissions
  - Early site reconnaissance to assess access, risks, and permissions; obtain permission to survey the full square where possible.
  - If permission is refused, predefined procedures govern whether to abandon the square, survey remaining parts, or relocate to a new square.
  - Engagement with farmers/landowners is encouraged to gain cooperation and background information; maintain a formal ownership/contact record and a courtesy note log.

- Data recording and FAB structure
  - FAB combines three elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling described in Section 7.
  - Mapping (6.1) involves annotating 1:10,000 maps with a standardized set of data codes; use of primary and secondary codes; alpha codes to compress long codes; ensure logical data linkages (e.g., boundary types follow vegetation codes).
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) provides guidance for identifying features not on OS maps and for boundary delineation; any API-derived boundaries are ground-truthed and may be overridden by field evidence.
  - Filling in the FAB (6.1.2) requires neat, legible entries; every page of the FAB must record the square number, ownership, land-use, and other metadata; inclusion of a clear sketch and permanent marking details for relocatability.

- Mapping and coding standards
  - Use of an extensive coding scheme to describe land cover, boundaries, boundaries type, vegetation types, and other landscape features; primary codes represent dominant classifications, with secondary codes to describe mosaic or subordinate classes.
  - Boundaries must be clearly marked on maps and coded; if a boundary no longer exists, mark as no longer present (code 999).
  - Minimum mappable units and measurement conventions defined to maintain consistency across observers and years.
  - Aerial photo conventions specify how to mark API-derived features (e.g., dashed lines for boundaries, crosses for isolated features) and how to reconcile API data with ground evidence.

- Vegetation sampling methodology
  - Two sizes of plots:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots (for broad vegetation mapping) plus nested 4 m2 plots for finer detail.
    - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) placed in five different land-cover types not already represented by large quadrats.
  - Permanent markers placed to enable precise relocation in future surveys.
  - Quadrats laid out with a North/South and East/West orientation; plotting details, nested sampling, and cover estimates recorded in % bands (5% increments).
  - Species lists include a restricted core list (about 200 common taxa) with allowances for unlisted taxa; bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a pre-defined list.
  - Photographs taken for each vegetation plot; detailed sketch maps and measurement notes accompany FAB entries.

- Sampling and plot types
  - Quadrat plots (large and small) record species presence, cover, and a range of habitat attributes (land-use, physiography, slope, aspect, shading, grazing pressure).
  - Linear plots:
    - Hedge/trunk-boundary plots (hedgerows), streamside plots, and roadside plots.
    - Each linear plot has defined width and placement rules, with relocation procedures when hedges/streams change.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots to be revisited; updated placement rules ensure plots remain representative and non-overlapping.

- Species identification and data quality
  - Guidelines emphasize species-level recording where feasible, but allow certain combinations for difficult taxa to maintain consistency with historical data.
  - Explicit lists for bryophytes and lichens; recommended to press unidentified species for later identification.
  - Emphasis on accuracy, careful field judgment, and avoidance of over-interpretation in the lab.

- Freshwater biota and sampling
  - Two freshwater biota sampling streams:
    - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE) per external handbook.
    - Freshwater biota from standing waters (NELUP) focused on water beetles; multiple sites per square to reflect two characteristic habitats (lakes/lochs, ponds, pools, flushes, bogs, etc.).
  - Sampling sites clearly marked; bottles labeled with square, date, and surveyor details; samples preserved and transported to Merlewood.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Photography required for vegetation plots to capture landscape context and features relevant to local landmarks.
  - End-of-day data review recommended to ensure completeness; data and FABs transported to ITE stations promptly for processing.

- Data integrity, accessibility, and archival
  - Permanent markers and relocation techniques implemented to enable precise future comparisons.
  - Detailed protocols for data entry, sketching, and cross-validation to minimize transcription errors.
  - Outputs anticipated include updated land-cover maps, improved ecological baselines, and integrated datasets for landscape analysis and policy support.
