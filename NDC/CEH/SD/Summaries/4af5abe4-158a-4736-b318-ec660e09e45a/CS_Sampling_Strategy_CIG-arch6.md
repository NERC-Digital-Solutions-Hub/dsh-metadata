# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Emphasises the long-term linkage to previous surveys and the importance of understanding prior concepts to interpret current results.

- Core methodology
  - Uses a stratified, random sampling framework based on the ITE Land Classification as the stratification system.
  - Sampling unit is the 1 km square; aim to sample squares representative of the landscape by combining environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) into land classes.
  - Early surveys selected centre squares within a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares were assigned to classes to create a robust stratification.

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (key milestones)
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes derived from environmental attributes using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1228 centre 1 km squares.
    - 8 squares per class were sampled (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984 (Second field survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total); used the 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; repeat vegetation and habitat mapping data collected.
  - 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification and separate country estimates)
    - Classification extended to allow Scotland reporting; total classes increased to 40.
    - To support England, Scotland, and Wales estimates, the framework was adjusted to produce country-unit estimates.
    - Added subdivisions and aggregations to create 40 strata; included 19 additional squares overall plus country-specific adjustments; upland habitat sampling module introduced.
  - 2007 (Welsh adjustments and Wales-only reporting)
    - Introduced country-unit subdivisions for England with Wales and for Wales (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Increased total strata to 45; added 43 squares in Wales to ensure six squares per Welsh class; England classes adjusted accordingly.
    - Wales erhielt upland-focused sampling within the framework.

- Survey design and sampling framework (CS2000 and CS2007)
  - England, Scotland, and Wales sampling numbers are detailed by land class and by survey year, with tables showing total squares, strata areas, and sampling rates (e.g., 1:x values).
  - Tables and figures illustrate the distribution of sample squares across land classes and the geographic allocation (England, Wales, Scotland).
  - Wales-specific framework (CS2007) creates five Welsh country-unit classes and expands Wales sampling to improve Wales-only estimates.
  - An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland areas to improve accuracy for upland habitats.

- Outputs and data products
  - Land Classification maps and the corresponding classification maps for England with Wales and Scotland.
  - Tables listing the number of sample squares by class and by survey year; sampling rates and stratum areas.
  - National estimates of habitat areas derived from class means and class areas; methods discussed for consistency across surveys.
  - Publications accompanying each survey (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990 main report; CS2000 and CS2007 outputs).

- National estimates and consistency considerations
  - Creation of national estimates is sensitive to changes in land classification; a 2006 scoping note emphasizes that updating the classification affects estimate consistency.
  - For GB consistency, prefer using the latest classification, even if it means multiple classifications across surveys; cross-survey comparability can be maintained through transparent methodology and variable reporting.
  - Table 4 documents sample sizes per class across different classifications to illustrate the continuity challenge.

- Uplands and country-specific reporting
  - Upland habitat estimates receive targeted sampling to improve precision in England and Wales.
  - Wales and Scotland receive dedicated country-unit classifications and sampling to facilitate Wales-only and Scotland-only reporting.

- Data governance and quality considerations
  - Recognises potential biases if sampling is not representative of each land class or country unit.
  - Highlights the importance of stratification to reduce sampling error and ensure national estimates reflect the diversity of GB landscapes.
