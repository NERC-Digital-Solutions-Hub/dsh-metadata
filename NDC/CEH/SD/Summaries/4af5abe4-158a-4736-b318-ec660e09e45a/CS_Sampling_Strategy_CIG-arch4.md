# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Core approach: stratified, random sampling built on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s countryside.
- Purpose: enable national and country-level estimates of habitat features and changes over time, with a clear data lineage from classification to sample selection to estimates.

## Core concepts and data governance
- Stratified sampling: GB partitioned into discreet strata (land classes) to minimize bias and ensure typical representation across environmental gradients.
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares; centre square selected with four surrounding squares allocated to the same class to form a stable, class-based sample.
- ITE Land Classification: evolves from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define Land Classes; used as the basis for sampling strata and for estimating national habitat areas.
- National estimates: produced by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
- Data lineage: methodology links back to iterative developments in land classification, ensuring traceability across surveys.

## Timeline and evolution of the Land Classification and sampling framework
- 1978 (Initial survey): 32 Land Classes derived from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15x15 km grid); 8 samples per class (256 total) across GB; 6039 km squares used when including surrounding squares.
- 1984 (Second field survey): sampling expanded to 12 squares per Land Class (384 total); same classification framework used for historical estimates.
- 1990 (CS1990 – All Squares approach): classification expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; added Land Cover Map linkage; resulted in a revised but conservative Land Classification.
- 1990s developments: greater emphasis on regional and local estimates; attempt to classify all squares led to partial mismatches with the original 1228 centre squares; around 62% correspondence, with non-matching squares typically falling into neighboring classes.
- 2000 (CS2000): addressing policy-driven needs for separate country estimates.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Aggregation of under-represented rump classes within countries.
  - 19 additional squares to improve representation; upland habitat module introduced to strengthen upland estimates.
  - 40 Land Classes overall, with refined country-specific allocation.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-focused reporting drives further refinement.
  - England-Wales and Scotland country-unit maps redefined; five new Wales-specific country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - 43 additional Welsh squares added to ensure adequate representation; England saw no equivalent increase but some classes (5e, 15e) operate with as few as 4 squares per class.
  - Wales becomes the most intensively sampled country by proportion; overall sampling maintained across the three countries.

## Sampling details and outputs
- Sample sizes ( Illustrative totals ):
  - 1978: 256 squares (8 per 32 classes) across GB.
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class, across 32 classes).
  - 1990: 508 squares (All Squares Land Classification approach); repeat vegetation sampling from CS1978.
  - 2000 (CS2000): substantial expansion to enable country-level reporting; ~569 total samples across GB (with country-specific allocations and upland module).
  - 2007 (CS2007): ~591 total samples; Wales-specific expansions for country-unit reporting; 45 strata (post-subdivisions) reflecting country units.
- Country-level reporting:
  - England with Wales and Scotland established as separate reporting units.
  - Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England in later Welsh allocations.
- Upland module:
  - An additional module added to CS2000 (funded by DETR, MAFF, WO/CCW) including 30 extra squares focused on upland and marginal upland habitats to improve accuracy for those regions.

## Data quality, comparability, and notes
- Consistency across surveys:
  - Changing Land Classifications affects national stock estimates; two approaches to reporting national estimates:
    - Use the latest classification per survey for internal consistency.
    - Use a fixed original classification for cross-survey consistency (less preferred for within-survey comparisons).
  - Table 4 provides example allocations under the Original (1990) Land Classification for cross-survey comparison.
- Representation concerns:
  - Early adjustments (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) addressed under-representation of certain classes, and ensured adequate country-specific representation.
  - Wales-specific subdivisions and class expansions improved precision for Wales reporting but increased the number of strata and sampling requirements.

## Outputs and application
- Outputs include national and country-specific estimates of habitat areas and changes over time, grounded in stratified sampling and the ITE Land Classification.
- Visual maps accompany the sampling framework (e.g., revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; sample square maps).
- Foundational references and methodological documents underpining the sampling strategy and Land Classification evolution are listed for further reading.

## Appendix: Brief history of the ITE Land Classification (high-level)
- 1) 1978: Initial Land Classification and first field survey (32 classes; 8 per class).
- 2) 1984: Second field survey with expanded sampling (12 squares per class).
- 3) 1990: All GB squares classified; counts-based expansion and linkage to satellite-derived land cover; broader use for regional estimates.
- 4) 1998: Revised classification allowing Scotland-only reporting; classes increased to 40.
- 5) 2007: Further refinements for Wales-only reporting; classes increased to 45; country-unit subdivisions implemented.
