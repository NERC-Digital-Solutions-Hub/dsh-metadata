# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1 Version: 1: 10-12-2014

## Overview
- Dataset summarises Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain between 1990 and 2007, using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- national estimates are provided for Habitats 1–17, as aggregated by Land Class.
- The accompanying file is CS90_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp.
- Mapping methodology and statistical basis are described in referenced literature (Maskell et al., 2008; Barr, 1991; Scott, 2007).

## Methodology and data lineage
- National estimates of % change are calculated from 1km survey squares using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al. (2008); Land Classification 2007 vector dataset described in Bunce et al. (2007).
- Foundational references include Scott (2007) Technical Report No.4/07 (statistical generation of national estimates from 1km squares) and earlier Land Classification work (Bunce et al., 1996; 1981/1991).
- Data provenance includes Countryside Survey UK results (2007) and field/mapping handbooks (Barr 1991; Maskell et al. 2008).

## Access, rights, and citations
- Acknowledgement required for all uses:
  - "Acknowledgement: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology Countryside Survey © Database Right/Copyright NERC- Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. All rights reserved."
- Core references and publications for context and methodology are provided (e.g., Carey et al. 2008; Scott 2007; Bunce et al. 2007; Maskell et al. 2008; Barr 1991; Jackson 2000).

## Data quality, limitations, and considerations
- Based on 1990–2007 change estimates anchored to the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Derived from 1km survey squares; subject to classification changes and potential inconsistencies across years and land classes.
- Methodological documentation exists in the referenced technical reports and handbooks (e.g., CS Technical Reports, Field Mapping Handbook).

## Governance, stewardship, and usage practices
- Data custodians: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC – Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Ensure proper metadata, including file name, date (Version 1, 10-12-2014), data sources, and methodological references.
- Enforce acknowledgment in all downstream products (datasets, maps, publications, presentations).
- Maintain alignment with the cited methodologies (ITE Land Classification 2007; 1km-square sampling design) and preserve links to source publications for reproducibility.
- Consideration for future updates or re-analyses should follow the same classification framework and referencing.
