# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

- The Countryside Survey (CS) data track Broad Habitat area change in Great Britain from 1990 to 2007.
- Estimates are national percentages of change for 17 Broad Habitat types, derived from the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Mapping methodology and national estimates are described in referenced reports (Maskell et al., 2008; Barr, 1991; Scott, 2007).

## Methodology and scope

- National estimates of Broad Habitat change (1990–2007) are calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- The estimation process and its linkage to the 1 km CS survey squares are detailed in Scott (2007) Technical Report No. 4/07.
- Supporting mapping methodology is described in Maskell et al. (2008) and Barr (1991).

## Data usage, access, and governance

- Acknowledgement: “Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology. Countryside Survey ©. All rights reserved.”
- Data usage requires public sharing of outputs and appropriate citation of CS sources.
- Metadata quality and data governance are important for verifying suitability and ensuring datasets meet standards.
- Potential barriers noted in monitoring frameworks context (for similar datasets): data gaps, access delays, data silos, metadata inadequacy, transformation requirements, and transparent data sharing considerations.
