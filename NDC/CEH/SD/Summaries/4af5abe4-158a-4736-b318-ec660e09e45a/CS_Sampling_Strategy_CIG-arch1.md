# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Introduction
  - Documents the evolution of the sampling framework behind Countryside Survey from its origins in the ITE Land Classification (ITE-LC) over the last 30+ years.
  - Emphasises the need for a stratified, random sampling design to ensure representative, unbiased national and country-level estimates of habitats and land use.
  - Describes how the 1 km square sampling units, their stratification into land classes, and successive survey rounds have been used to detect change over time.

- The ITE Land Classification: Development and purpose
  - Early work created an environmental stratification system (ITE Land Classification) by grouping larger areas based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) rather than solely on species.
  - The approach originated from multivariate classification (Indicator Species Analysis) at a local level and was scaled up to national coverage to stratify Great Britain.
  - The Land Classification provided the framework to divide the landscape into discrete strata (land classes) with similar ecological characteristics, enabling efficient, representative sampling.

- Countryside Survey 1978: First sampling framework
  - Used the centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid to generate classified squares; 1228 centre squares were classified, and four surrounding squares were grouped with each centre square to form 6040 classified squares in total.
  - Sampled eight 1 km squares within each of the 32 Land Classes, yielding 256 survey squares nationwide.
  - National habitat estimates were produced by multiplying the mean habitat area per square by the land-class area, then aggregating across all classes.
  - Emphasised the need for stratified random sampling to avoid bias from purely random selections.

- Countryside Survey 1984: Second field survey
  - Retained the same sampling framework but increased sample size by 50%: 12 squares per land class, total of 384 squares surveyed.
  - Included eight previously visited squares and added 128 new squares, improving national estimates.
  - Used the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates, with results reported in subsequent literature.

- Countryside Survey 1990: All Squares Land Classification & third field survey
  - Began extending the Land Classification to cover every GB square, not just a subset.
  - Conducted the first survey using the updated framework, surveying 508 squares; repeated measures included the 1984 quadrats.
  - Linked to the first Land Cover Map derived from satellite data.
  - Found that reconciling the 1990 land-class map with the 1978/1984 classifications produced only about 62% exact correspondence; most non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes, and overall class characteristics remained stable.
  - Implementation included urban and sea corrections to improve regional estimates.

- Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2000
  - Addressed the need for regional (England, Scotland, Wales) estimates and upland habitat accuracy.
  - Introduced a revised Land Classification that allowed separate country estimates, creating country-unit versions of land classes and, where needed, aggregating under-represented rump classes to maintain balanced representation.
  - Expanded the sampling to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country; added additional squares (including 19 extra for Wales) and some targeted increases to maintain consistent sampling rates across England and Wales.
  - Added a dedicated upland module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
  - Resulted in a larger, more country-specific sampling framework (CS2000), with adjusted class maps for England-with-Wales and Scotland.

- Developments of the ITE Land Classification for Countryside Survey 2007
  - Responded to devolution-driven needs for Wales-only reporting and Wales-specific environmental policy requirements.
  - Wales received additional Welsh-specific class sub-divisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) for better Wales-only estimates.
  - Increased total strata to 45; added 43 additional squares in Wales to ensure minimum representation in each Welsh class.
  - England saw no Welsh-square additions beyond compensating adjustments; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with only four squares but were deemed adequately precise for reporting purposes.
  - Wales, England, and Scotland were reflected in revised Land Class maps for CS2007, with country-specific sampling distributions summarized in accompanying figures and tables.

- Summary of key design and data considerations
  - Across surveys, the strategy centers on a stratified, random sampling approach using the ITE Land Classification as the framework for strata.
  - The number of squares per land class has been adjusted over time to improve precision and to enable country-level reporting (England with Wales, Scotland, and Wales-only outputs).
  - Revisions to the Land Classification were necessary to maintain representativeness as data coverage expanded to cover all GB squares and as policy needs demanded country-specific estimates.
  - Special modules (uplands) and targeted increases in Wales ensured better statistical accuracy for under-sampled regions or habitat types.

- Endnotes and acknowledgments
  - Documentation includes acknowledgments of contributors and references, highlighting statistical guidance and historical context for the Land Classification and sampling strategy.
  - Note on national estimates: different classifications may affect cross-survey consistency, but the approach seeks to balance comparability with the need for country-specific, policy-relevant reporting.
