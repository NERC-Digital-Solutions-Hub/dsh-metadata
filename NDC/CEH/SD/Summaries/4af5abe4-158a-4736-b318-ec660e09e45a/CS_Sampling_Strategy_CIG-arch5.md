# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, showing how the ITE Land Classification has evolved and underpins the sampling framework and national estimates over 30 years.

- Core concept: Use stratified, random sampling based on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative sampling across diverse GB landscapes and to minimize bias, with stratification mirroring ecological and land-use variation.

- Historical progression:
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 1 km squares classified into 32 land classes using environmental attributes; eight samples per class (256 total); center-square approach with surrounding squares also classified.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey): Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve national estimates.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey): Land Classification updated to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; interest in land use and habitat mapping; linkage to first Land Cover Map.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification & 4th Field Survey): GB-wide revision enabling Scotland-only reporting; total of 40 land classes.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Framework adjusted for separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland); sub-division and aggregation of land classes created 40 strata; added squares to improve representation; uplands module added for England & Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements led to further Welsh-specific class subdivisions (5 new Welsh classes, total 45 strata); additional squares allocated to Wales (43 extra, minimum 6 per Welsh class); England adjustments maintained precision with a small reduction in some classes.

- Data products and outputs:
  - Land Classification maps and class descriptions; tables showing number of squares per class and per country; maps illustrating sampling framework across England, Wales, and Scotland.
  - Tables detailing sample counts, strata areas, and sampling rates (e.g., per class and per country) for 1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, and 2007.
  - National estimates methodology: habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the land area of that class.

- Data governance, provenance, and documentation:
  - Clear lineage of classifications and sampling designs across surveys; careful documentation of when and why classifications were updated and how this affects cross-year comparability.
  Note: The document discusses consistency considerations (e.g., using the latest classification for internal consistency vs. cross-survey consistency) and provides guidance on when to apply country-specific vs GB-wide classifications.

- Country-specific considerations:
  - England, Scotland, and Wales treated as distinct reporting units with dedicated sampling adjustments to ensure reliable Wales-only and Scotland-only estimates.
  - Wales required additional Welsh-class subdivisions and targeted upland sampling to improve precision for that country.
  - Isle of Man and cross-border considerations addressed in framing of country estimates.

- Practical and methodological implications for Data Stewards:
  - Data custodians must track changes in Land Classification across survey waves to preserve interpretability and comparability.
  - Documentation should capture the rationale for adding sub-classes and extra squares, especially for Wales and upland modules.
  - Metadata should include survey year, country unit, Land Class definitions, sample counts, and sampling rates to enable reproducible estimates.
  - Updates to datasets should align with the designated classification for the respective reporting unit and indicate any cross-year reclassification effects.

- Endnotes and further reading:
  - Acknowledgements and references provide sourcing for methodologies, classifications, and datasets.
  - CS2007 preparation documents outline Wales-specific reporting methodology and statistical guidance.
