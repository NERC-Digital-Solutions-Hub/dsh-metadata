# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Purpose and Scope
- National countryside survey (Countryside Survey 1990) combining field data with satellite imagery to update land cover maps and monitor changes.
- Two main data streams: mapping/vegetation data and sampling (including new ground-truth and up-to-date ecosystem information).
- A two-tier approach: bottom-up field surveys aligned with a top-down remote-sensing framework to link land-cover maps with field observations.
- Objectives include identifying data gaps, tracking landscape changes, and enabling ecological modelling and policy-relevant assessments.

## Data Architecture, Standards and Tools
- Data collected via a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) and 1:10,000 maps; standardized coding system with primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and more.
- Codes are used to annotate maps; alpha-numeric codes are combined to represent complex features while saving space.
- Two main data streams: comprehensive mapping and detailed vegetation sampling; permanent markers (metal plates) and guided relocation enable consistent re-visits over time.
- Universal coding conventions (e.g., 888–999 range for “to map” and other universal codes) to support cross-site comparability and future integration.
- Species and bryophyte/lichen lists are predefined; certain combinations are accepted when species-level ID is uncertain to maintain consistency with historical surveys.
- Data management emphasizes field-built records, neat FAB completion, and clear documentation to ensure data are analysable and reproducible.

## Planning and Permissions
- Six survey groups (from six ITE Research Stations) cover the sample squares; each team has about 85 squares.
- Flexible working arrangements; travel time optimization; no automatic overtime—time off in lieu for large overtime accumulations.
- Permissions from landowners/farmers are required for full-square access; prior contact encouraged to smooth engagements.
- If access is denied, predefined contingency procedures apply (abandon square, or survey sub-areas if possible); documentation of ownership and permissions is required.

## Equipment and Field Preparations
- Equipment mainly includes FABs, aerial photographs, site maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, survey poles, tapes, and personal gear.
- Local stations provide additional tools; surveyors carry personal gear and, where needed, reference materials, cameras, and field aids.
- Clear instructions on marking and locating survey plots with permanent markers to enable accurate relocation in future years.

## Field Procedures and Data Recording (FAB)
- On arrival: quickly assess the square, obtain access permissions for the full square, and plan a route that ensures full square coverage.
- On completion: review records for omissions and ensure clarity and completeness.
- Data collection emphasizes entire-square coverage, careful field judgment, and consistency between observers.
- FAB structure includes sections on ownership, farmer information, physiography, land use, vegetation, and boundary details; data are organized to support systematic analysis and cross-square comparability.

## Mapping (6.1) and Aerial Photo Interpretation (API)
- Mapping involves annotating large-scale maps with data codes for land cover and landscape features; combinations of codes allow detailed representation (dominant uses, boundaries, etc.).
- API provides guidance for identifying features not on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees) and for marking boundaries, noting conflicts with ground truth, and using dashed lines or crosses as appropriate.
- Full FABs and maps are compiled into Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) for each square.

## Data Recording: Filling in the FAB (6.1.2)
- FABs must be neat and legible; essential fields include square series number, ownership details, and land units per owner.
- Data entry follows a structured order, with clear guidance on mapping codes, boundary types, and ownership/cooperation ratings.
- A detailed page-by-page guide supports consistent documentation, including how to handle complex mosaics and how to append notes when necessary.

## Vegetation Sampling and Plot Types (6.2)
- Quadrats (large 200 m2 and nested 4 m2) and multiple linear plots form the core vegetation sampling framework.
- Sampling plan: 5 large quadrats per square plus 5 smaller quadrats across five different land-cover types; additional sampling in linear features (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides).
- Permanent markers (metal plates) locate quadrats for accurate relocation; complex sites may use boundary features for placement when necessary.
- Location/Relocation rules describe how to adapt plotting when land-use or boundaries change since earlier surveys.
- Plot layout emphasizes representative sampling across habitats; if a plot cannot fit within a feature, adjustments are documented with measurements and sketches.

## Plot Layout Details
- Quadrats are placed with North/South and East/West orientation; nested quadrats capture species diversity and cover estimates (5% increments).
- Permanent marking near the square’s corner or along a boundary ensures future relocation feasibility.
- Details for boundary plots, linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides), and extra verge plots are specified to capture variation in linear features.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots are referenced and updated as needed (with relocation to maintain sampling integrity).

## Species Identification and Data Granularity
- Field survey aims for species-level identification where possible; defined combinations are allowed to maintain consistency where species-level ID is uncertain.
- Extensive lists are provided for crops, grasses, forbs, mosses/lichens, and ferns to standardize recording and ensure comparability across sites and years.

## Freshwater and Other Sampling (7)
- Freshwater biota sampling (on behalf of IFE) and NELUP sampling focus on freshwater and standing-water biota, including water beetles.
- Each square yields two samples from standing waters, chosen to reflect the square’s two characteristic habitat types.
- Sampling is standardized with labeling, proper preservation (formalin), and prompt return to Merlewood for processing.

## Photography and Documentation
- Photography captures vegetation plots to illustrate general appearance and landmarks; plot numbers are clearly displayed on boards at plot edges.

## Post-Survey Procedures and Logistics
- End-of-day checks ensure no features are omitted; data and FABs should be returned to ITE Stations promptly, with minimal reworking unless damage necessitates it.

## Data Governance, Community, and Collaboration
- Emphasizes central standardization and rigorous data quality control to enable robust cross-site comparisons and long-term trend analyses.
- Encourages co-ownership and collaboration with the wider data community to strengthen data systems and analytical capacity.
- Training and Handbook prerequisites (clear definitions, coding schemes, and procedures) are highlighted as vital for consistent data recording and quality assurance.
