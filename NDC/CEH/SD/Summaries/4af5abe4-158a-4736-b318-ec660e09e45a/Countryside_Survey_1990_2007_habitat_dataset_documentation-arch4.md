# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview
- Provides national estimates of Broad Habitat percentage change (increase or decrease) between 1990 and 2007 for 17 Broad Habitat types.
- Uses the 2007 ITE Land Classification to generate estimates from Countryside Survey data.
- Mapping methodology and data provenance described in referenced technical reports and publications.

## Data Content and Structure
- Source: Countryside Survey data (© NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology).
- File reference: CS90_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp.
- Key outputs: For each Broad Habitat (Columns 1–17) the percentage change in area.
- Land Classification context: LC2007 (numeric code) and LC2007_COD (text description) describe the ITE Land Class used.
- Categories covered (examples):
  - Column1: Broadleaved, Mixed and Yew Woodland
  - Column2: Coniferous Woodland
  - Column3: Boundary and Linear Features
  - Column4: Arable and Horticulture
  - Column5: Improved Grassland
  - Column6: Neutral Grassland
  - Column7: Calcareous Grassland
  - Column8: Acid Grassland
  - Column9: Bracken
  - Column10: Dwarf Shrub Heath
  - Column11: Fen, Marsh, Swamp
  - Column12: Bog
  - Column13: Standing Open Waters and Canals
  - Column14: Rivers and Streams
  - Column15: Montane
  - Column16: Inland Rock
  - Column17: Urban
- Temporal scope: Change estimates cover 1990–2007.

## Data Provenance, Methodology, and References
- Core methodology: National estimates are derived from the 1 km survey framework, using the 2007 ITE Land Classification (as detailed in Scott 2007; Bunce et al. 2007).

## Data Quality, Gaps, and Practical Challenges
- Data quality considerations:
  - Data are a synthesis across multiple surveys, with potential gaps in granularity for certain habitats.
  - Verification of data content and format may be challenging.
- Practical challenges highlighted:
  - Understanding user needs across diverse audiences.
  - Achieving an overview of available data due to fragmentation.
  - Paywalls, data protection barriers, and data standards variability.
  - Lack of consistent metadata and coordination within the sector, risking duplication of effort.
- Implications for data management:
  - Emphasizes the need for clear metadata, consistent standards, and accessible, discoverable datasets.
  - Encourages coordination with wider data communities to strengthen practice.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Strategic use:
  - Leverage national-scale change estimates to inform policy discussions, land-use planning, and habitat restoration priorities.
  - Align Countryside Survey data with internal data portfolios to identify gaps and opportunities for new data collection.
- Data governance and collaboration:
  - Establish clear attribution and metadata practices for reuse in reports and dashboards.
  - Foster cross-network collaboration to reduce duplication and improve data discoverability.
- Data quality improvement:
  - Prioritize verification workflows for data content and format, and develop standardized metadata to ease integration.
  - Monitor updates to the ITE Land Classification and related methodologies to maintain consistency over time.
