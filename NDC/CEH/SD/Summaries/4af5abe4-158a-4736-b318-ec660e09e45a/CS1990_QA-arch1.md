# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose: Outline the scope and results of the quality assurance (QA) exercise for the 1990 Countryside Survey, with recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in future surveys.

## Background and aims
- Field surveys involve many recorders, producing natural variation despite training and supervision.
- QA sought to quantify field recording accuracy, explain observer-related differences, relate findings to prior work, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Methods (QA design)
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed using original sketch maps; two independent assessors; limited to 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes.
  - 1991 (June–Sept): added photos of plots; extended to more squares; each square visited near the original survey date.
- Plot types covered (six types total):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots)
  - Linear plots: road verges, hedges aligned with water bodies, streamsides; boundaries
- Plot relocation methods:
  - Used sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates (where possible) to relocate plot corners.
  - Aimed to relocate the buried plate marking a quadrat corner; also recorded landcover and boundary features at nine points per quarter.
- Concordance measures (three indices for species lists):
  - Percentage agreement
  - Agreement (excluding potential T1-year recording errors)
  - Agreement (assuming T1 as reference)
  - % accuracy (adjusted for T2 changes)
- Additional QA: assessors’ ability to annotate photographs, and evaluation of mapping codes and landuse classifications.

## Key findings

- Overall accuracy and agreement
  - 1990 autumn QA initial agreement around 45% (early estimate); full 1991 QA with photographs showed higher agreement, with overall percentage concordance of 60.9%.
  - When adjusting for seasonal differences (e.g., species not present in autumn but present in summer), the apparent discrepancy between years reduces; still, real ecological changes plus recording differences remain.
  - Initial efficiency of recording in 1990 surveys averaged around 74% (with room for improvement).

- Sources of variation in species records
  - Major sources of discrepancy (per Tables 3–4):
    - A: Apparent mis-identifications
    - B: Species overlooked in the original survey
    - C/D: Over- or under-recording due to seasonal effects, management changes, or mis-location
    - J: Mysteries of insufficient explanations
  - Seasonal and annual effects can mimic real ecological change; drought and crop management significantly influence observed species lists.
  - In upland areas, seasonal effects are less pronounced; in lowland, arable areas, bigger discrepancies appear.

- Plot relocation and use of photographs
  - Plate relocation success (Autumn 1990): 71% recovery rate with five-minute search.
  - 1991 QA using photographs and ground markers:
    - Plate/plot relocation: ~65%/87% (varied by plot type)
    - Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy, especially for complex or unenclosed sites.
  - Recommendation: photographs plus ground markers greatly aid relocation; Y plots (small 4 m2) are particularly challenging.

- Plot types and landclass effects
  - No significant difference in % accuracy across plot types overall, but significant differences between landclass aggregates.
  - UP (upland) areas show distinct vegetation (moorland/heath/bog) influencing axis scores; lowland arable/class aggregates show more variability due to management and crop changes.
  - Overall axis analyses (DECORANA) indicate a shift consistent with prior vegetation-change patterns between 1978–1988 and 1990–1991, though year-to-year variation complicates interpretation.

- Vegetation cover estimates
  - Comparison of cover values from 1990 and 1991 shows few significant changes for individual species; several grasses show differences, but many changes reflect seasonal or recording variation.
  - Bryophytes and certain grasses require improved training and clearer guidelines for cover coding.

- Mapping and landuse codes
  - Primary landuse codes: strong concordance (approx. 88% overall).
  - Boundary codes: lower concordance (~80%), influenced by assessor repetition and interpretation.
  - Codes and qualifiers show two trends: high conscientiousness and interpretive variation due to code definitions.
  - Point-by-point landuse and boundary mapping generally reliable in lowlands; upland vegetation interpretation more variable.

- Mapping of species cover
  - At a nine-point grid: single dominant species concordance ~81%; two co-dominants drop to ~34%; three co-dominants ~5%.
  - Conclusion: focus mapping on the two most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.

- Longitudinal/ecological gradient (DECORANA)
  - Axis 1 shifts show a gradient from upland to lowland vegetation; observed changes largely align with previous surveys, though the magnitude varies by plot type and landclass.
  - The mean axis shift between 1990 and 1991 is not statistically robust across all data due to sample size, but upland areas show clearer consistent patterns.

- Recommendations and improvements (summary)
  - Lichens: retain recording with potential habitat context (Training materials).
  - QA timing: perform QA as close as practical to the initial survey; same-year QA preferred to minimize seasonal confounding.
  - Photographs: ensure assessors annotate photos and link to plots; use photographs to re-establish exact positions.
  - Metal plates: continue using metal markers to mark X plots where feasible, particularly in enclosed land.
  - Y plots positioning: define 4 m2 plots with survey tape; orient with the side rather than diagonal; place corner at SE corner.
  - Documentation and training: enhance field handbooks for species like grasses; emphasize bryophyte recording in wetland communities; consider expanding allowable bryophyte lists in habitat-specific surveys.
  - Seasonality and year consistency: QA should be restricted to the same season and year as original survey.
  - Landuse coding: subdivide certain upland codes (e.g., 102 upland grassland) and create a dedicated lowland rush pasture code; recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with its own primary code.
  - Boundary coding: restrict primary boundary codes to hedge status and use qualifying codes for composition; refine forb-cover and hedge condition codes (e.g., clarifying 138–140).
  - Mapping simplification: reduce emphasis on broad species cover; record only the two most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.
  - Additional improvements: provide simple dichotomous keys for landuse codes; allocate more attention to boundary feature coding; develop clearer guidance for moss/lycophyte and bryophyte inclusion.

## Conclusions and implications for future surveys
- Photographic aids and site-informing sketches are essential for accurate plot relocation, especially in unenclosed or remote areas.
- Seasonal and climatic differences between survey years can cause substantial variation in species lists; QA should ideally be conducted in the same year and season as the original survey to minimize these effects.
- High concordance in landuse primary codes demonstrates robust mapping practices, but boundary and qualitative codes require clearer definitions and training to reduce misclassification.
- The QA exercise provides concrete, actionable recommendations to improve data reliability, from field methods (plot marking, photography, plot positioning) to data coding (landuse, boundary, and species cover) and training emphasis (bryophytes, grasses, and habitat-specific species lists).
