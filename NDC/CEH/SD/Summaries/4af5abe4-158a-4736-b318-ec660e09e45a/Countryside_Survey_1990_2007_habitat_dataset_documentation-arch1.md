# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1

## Overview and scope
- Version: 1; Date: 10-12-2014.
- Data describe national estimates of Broad Habitat percentage change between 1990 and 2007 for 17 Broad Habitat types, calculated using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Estimates are summarized by Land Class (ITE Land Classification 2007).
- Mapping methodology described in Maskell et al. 2008; related foundational methods in Barr 1991; Scott 2007 (statistical derivation from 1 km sample squares).

## Methods and classification
- Based on the 2007 ITE Land Classification to categorize Broad Habitats.
- National estimates derived from the Countryside Survey data for 1990 and 2007.
- Mapping methodology and cross-walks described in cited references (Maskell et al. 2008; Barr 1991; Bunce et al. 1996/2007; Scott 2007).

## Usage and interpretation
- Suitable for national-scale assessment of habitat change by broad habitat type and land class between 1990 and 2007.
- Useful for trend analysis, cross-tabulation with land class, and informing policy decisions at a national level.
- Not designed for fine-grained local analyses (e.g., local authority level) due to its national scope and classification framework.
