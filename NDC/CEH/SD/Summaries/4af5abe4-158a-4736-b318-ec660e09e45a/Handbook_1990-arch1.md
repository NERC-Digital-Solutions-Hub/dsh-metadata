# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aim and scope
  - Update land-use databases, monitor changes, and support ecological modelling and decision-making.
  - Build on earlier ITE work (1977/8, 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System.
  - Couple ground field data with satellite imagery to construct a Britain-wide land cover map and link bottom-up survey with remote sensing.
  - Survey 512 sites in 1990 (expanded by 128 sites from previous surveys); 6 ITE Research Stations will field teams (~85 squares each).
  - Emphasize standardisation, data quality, and making datasets discoverable with metadata.

- Survey design and planning
  - Six groups of sample squares; each group assigned to a station; teams plan travel and recording to minimise non-productive work.
  - Expected survey effort: about three days per square; flexible scheduling; limited/overtime considerations (time off in lieu for large overtime).
  - Planning options include daily local travel, short relocations, or longer away blocks (week(s)) with occasional weekend work.

- Equipment and field readiness
  - Provided by Merlewood: FAB field assessment booklets, aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, field handouts, weatherproof materials, markers, sampling gear, navigation aids, and ID kits.
  - Local ITE stations supply locating maps, basic tools, cameras, reference books, and personal gear.
  - Surveyors may also bring personal equipment (clothing, packs, etc.).

- Permissions and access
  - Seek access permissions to ensure full-square coverage and goodwill of landowners.
  - Prior communication via letters to known farmers/occupants; on-site confirmation of permissions before recording begins.
  - Procedures if permission is refused:
    - Abandon the square or switch to a replacement square.
    - If partial access is possible, continue with the accessible area; otherwise, document and relocate.
  - Maintain farmer/landowner contact for background information and potential additional contacts.

- Data recording and field documentation (FAB)
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (plus vegetation plots described in Section 7).
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) and associated maps are the primary data collection tools, with extensive coding rules to capture land cover, boundaries, ownership, vegetation, and infrastructure.
  - Use alpha-numeric coding (primary and secondary codes) to annotate features; plan to maintain consistent coding order (e.g., dominant use first for mixed categories).
  - Boundaries must be clearly recorded; “no longer present” boundaries get the code 999; ensure precise end-point definitions.
  - Aerial photo interpretation (API) provides guidance on identifying features not on OS maps; still subordinate to ground truth.

- Mapping and coding conventions
  - Enlarge to 1:10,000 scale for mapping; annotate maps with data codes; combine multiple numeric codes into an alpha code to save space (use capital letters; avoid X/0/I confusion).
  - Each square is fully surveyed, including edge corners; use coded boundaries to demarcate land-use types and landscape features.
  - FABs must be neatly completed; each page includes square series number, ownership details, and page-specific instructions.
  - Ownership and farmer-interaction data are recorded to aid future surveys and stakeholder engagement.

- Vegetation and landscape data collection (6.2)
  - Field survey methods include vegetation quadrats, linear plots adjacent to features, and boundary/hhedgerow/stream/roadside sampling.
  - Permanent markers: large 200 m2 quadrats marked with metal plates for reliable relocation; nested 4 m2 and smaller quadrats recorded within larger units.
  - Small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) placed in diverse semi-natural or natural land cover types to capture habitat diversity.
  - Plot relocation rules: relocate quadrats if land use changes; document changes; when necessary, move to closest alternative land-cover type and record details.
  - Laying out plots uses strings and survey poles; grids oriented to N-S/E-W axes; photographs taken to document plots and landmarks.

- Vegetation sampling specifics (6.2.2–6.2.5)
  - Field method: Standardised plots with nested quadrats; record broad environmental attributes (land use, physiography, slope, shading, grazing, etc.).
  - Species data: record up to 200 common species per plot; for each, determine approximate cover in 5% increments; mark unlisted species in a catch-all section.
  - Plot types:
    - Large quadrats: 5 x 200 m2; 5 x 4 m2 quadrats in semi-natural vegetation.
    - Linear plots: up to 5 boundary plots, hedgerow plots, streamsides, and roadsides.
    - Boundary rules and placement relative to dominant vertical feature (hedge, fence, ditch, or grass strip).
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots and adjustments to adapt to 1990 square conditions; position marks placed at field edges, boundary features, or nearby permanent landmarks.
  - Species identification: strive for species-level identification; where difficult, allowed accepted combinations to maintain consistency with previous surveys; bryophytes and lichens are recorded using predefined lists.
  - Universal and boundary codes cover structures, roads, verges, hedges, walls, and other landscape features; a wide set of codes enables multi-attribute descriptions per feature.

- Freshwater sampling (Section 7)
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square:
    - Freshwater biota from flowing waters (IFE sample) described in a separate handbook.
    - Freshwater biota from standing water (NELUP sampling, water beetles focus).
  - Sampling locations should reflect the two most characteristic water habitats: lakes/lochs, ponds, dried-up streams, calcareous/acid flushes, sphagnum bog pools, vehicle tracks, etc.
  - Samples collected with sieve and preserved in formalin; each sample labeled with square number, date, and surveyor.
  - Samples transported back to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography and data delivery
  - Print films photographed for each vegetation plot to capture general appearance and notable landmarks.
  - Plot numbers displayed on a board at the plot edge; photography supports future verification and analysis.

- Post-survey procedures
  - End-of-day data quality check: read back forms to ensure no omissions.
  - Move data and FABs promptly to ITE stations for processing; avoid post-hoc re-recording unless damage occurred.
  - Documentation and sample transport for consistency and traceability.

- Data outputs and potential uses for analysts
  - Rich, standardised datasets across land use, vegetation communities, boundaries, ownership, physiography, hydrology, infrastructure, and land management practices.
  - Detailed vegetation data include 200 common species lists, cover percentages, and species combinations for difficult identifications.
  - Spatial data from 1:10,000 maps, large and small quadrats, and multiple linear plots enable landscape-scale correlations, trend analysis, and modelling of land-use change.
  - Permanently marked plots ensure repeatability for future resurvey and long-term monitoring.
  - Data intended to support a Britain-wide land-cover map and connect with bottom-up field data and remote sensing.

- Data management and accessibility
  - Emphasis on data provenance, metadata, and making datasets discoverable through portals.
  - Datasets are designed to be reusable for future analyses and cross-temporal comparisons with earlier surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988).
  - Comprehensive codebook and field handbook definitions accompany the data to aid interpretation and replication.
