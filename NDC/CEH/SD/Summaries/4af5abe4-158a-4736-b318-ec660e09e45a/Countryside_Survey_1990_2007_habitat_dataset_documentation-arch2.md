# Broad Habitat area estimates of change for Great Britain, summarized by ITE Land Class 1 Version: 1: 10-12-2014 Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology and Hydrology

## Overview
- Presents national estimates of broad habitat percentage change (1990–2007) for Habitats 1–17, using the 2007 ITE Land Classification.
- Based on Countryside Survey data and the CS90_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp file.
- Aims to quantify changes in habitat areas by land class to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Data and scope
- Source: Countryside Survey data from Great Britain, maintained by NERC – Centre for Ecology and Hydrology.
- Timeframe: Change in broad habitat area between 1990 and 2007.
- Classification: 2007 ITE Land Classification (ITE Land Classification of Great Britain 2007).
- Mapping and methodology: Described in Maskell et al., 2008 and Barr, 1991; statistical derivation of national estimates from 1 km survey squares described in Scott, 2007.
- Output format: CS90_07_Broad_Habitat_Change_Map.shp containing national change estimates by Broad Habitat and Land Class.
