# Countryside Survey 1990 Quality Assurance Exercise

- A quality assurance (QA) study of the 1990 Countryside Survey, outlining scope, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in ecological survey statistics.

## Overview and purpose (archetype relevance)
- Aimed to quantify the accuracy of field recording, explain differences in recordings (observer error, timing, location), relate findings to prior surveys, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Highlights the importance of data governance: consistent standards, metadata, and processes to ensure data are usable, up-to-date, and comparable over time.

## Methods and data collected
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 survey squares; relied on original survey sketches for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Expanded to include photographs of individual plots; each 1 km square visited within 14 days of the original survey date; additional self-assessment of some squares.
- Plot types (six total): X-quadrats (200 m2), Y-plots (4 m2), road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; plus related location features.
- Plot relocation and plate markers:
  - Used original sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates to relocate quadrats/plots.
  - Assessed recovery rates for plates and plots (e.g., autumn 1990 plate recovery 71% with five-minute search; 1991 recovery 65% for plates, 87% for plots).
- Data quality metrics:
  - Species concordance measures (percentage agreement; common species shared; overall accuracy).
  - Four concordance indices defined (i–iv) to assess agreement and accuracy between time 1 (T1) and time 2 (T2) records.
  - Initial efficiency of recording (percentage accuracy after removing certain variations).
- Mapping and coding:
  - Land-use codes (primary and secondary), boundary codes, and vegetation-cover coding assessed for reliability and consistency.
  - Annexes and tables summarize code usage, agreement, and the frequency of primary codes across landclass aggregates (lowland arable, lowland grassland, marginal areas, upland).

## Key findings on data quality
- Overall agreement and variability:
  - Combined analyses yielded an overall agreement of about 60.9% across plots; when accounting for seasonal differences and other factors, initial efficiency of recording around 74% approached the maximum attainable efficiency reported in the literature.
  - In 1991 QA, a significant increase in species per plot (approx. 13% overall) was observed, largely due to real ecological differences between the drought year (1990) and a more normal growing season in 1991, with an estimated 27% of the increase attributable to greater recording efficiency and 73% to actual ecological change.
- Plot-type and landclass differences:
  - X plots showed higher search efficiency; Y plots were difficult to relocate; road verges and hedges were relatively easier; upland plots showed less seasonal effect than lowland squares.
  - Lowland arable (LC) areas exhibited the lowest recording accuracy, while other landclasses were closer to each other in accuracy.
- Species and cover data:
  - Some species showed genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata) while others appeared affected by under-recording in the original survey (e.g., Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).
  - Bryophytes and certain grasses were under-recorded; recommendations call for targeted training and expanded lists where habitat-specific surveys necessitate bryophyte data.
  - Cover estimates: significant differences in some species’ cover between T1 and T2, but overall patterns indicate that only a subset of cover data were consistently reproducible across times.
- Mapping and codes:
  - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable (around 88–95% concordance overall for landuse primaries; boundary primaries around 80–83% depending on conditions and assessor pairing).
  - Some codes caused mis-matches (marsh 102; upland grassland 102; wet heath; and boundary codes 321–323); inconsistencies largely due to interpretation and code definitions.
  - Annex analyses show substantial agreement for land-use codes but notable variation and ambiguity in some qualifiers and boundary descriptors.
- Data integration and ecological interpretation:
  - DECORANA analysis (First Axis) indicated shifts along ecological gradients over time but with substantial scatter driven by crop changes, plot relocation errors, and changes in cover values.
  - Across years, the index suggested overall directional shifts consistent with known land-use changes, but individual plots exhibited substantial variance.
- Implications for data management:
  - The QA highlighted the value of photographs for relocating plots, the importance of precise plot positioning, and the need for robust, explicit coding rules to ensure reproducibility.
  - Seasonal timing and the year of observation strongly influence species lists and vegetation cover; thus, QA should align closely with the year and season of the original survey.

## Implications for data governance and data stewardship
- Data quality and reproducibility are sensitive to:
  - Standardized plotting procedures and clear, unambiguous coding schemes.
  - Documentation of plot locations, distances to landmarks, and orientation details to minimize relocation errors.
  - Consistent timing (season/year) between baseline surveys and QA activities to avoid confounding climate-driven changes with observer differences.
- Recommendations emphasize governance actions to:
  - Establish and maintain standardized metadata for plots, including photographic annotations and plate locations.
  - Maintain and update land-use and vegetation coding frameworks to reduce ambiguities and ensure comparable future datasets.
  - Document data provenance and data quality assessments to support long-term discoverability and re-use.

## Recommendations for future surveys (selected highlights)
- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys with species-habitat context; augment training with species and habitat references.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey date to minimize seasonal/year-to-year variation confounding assessments.
- Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and explicitly relate them to the corresponding plot; include distance to nearby features to aid relocation; annotate and reference metal plates.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots wherever feasible, especially in enclosed land; plan for relocation in unenclosed uplands (may require more manpower).
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a tape measure; orient the side rather than the diagonal north-south and place the plate at the southeast corner.
- Recommendation 6–7: (Implied ongoing improvements) Ensure photographs and sketches capture essential locational cues and consider additional support tools to aid precise relocation.
- Recommendation 8: Sub-divide upland grassland code (102) into more precise categories (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland) to reflect management and vegetation differences; better differentiate lowland vs upland classifications.
- Recommendation 9: Add a distinct code for lowland rush pasture to improve land-use mapping fidelity.
- Recommendation 10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with a primary code to improve consistency in habitat classification.
- Recommendation 11: Restrict primary boundary coding to hedge, and use qualifying codes to capture species composition and boundary characteristics; improve consistency in boundary coding.
- Recommendation 12: For vegetation mapping, focus coding on the two most prevalent species at a point to enhance reproducibility; reduce reliance on extensive cover codes that are prone to misinterpretation.

## Mapping, coding, and data quality specifics (summary)
- Land-use codes:
  - Primary land-use coding shows high reliability across squares; some ambiguity remains for marsh, upland, and marginal categories.
  - Proposals include expanding the range of primary codes, adding simple dichotomous choices, and focusing mapping on dominant species to improve reproducibility.
- Boundary and cover coding:
  - Boundary codes (e.g., hedges) show good agreement when clearly defined; mis-matches often arise from ambiguous hedge composition and lack of codified forb-cover conventions.
  - For cover, recording the two most prevalent species and restricting to top cover classes improves consistency; full multi-species cover listings are less reproducible over time.

## Endnotes and relevance to ongoing stewardship
- The Countryside Survey 1990 QA exercise demonstrates the critical role of rigorous QA for large, multi-plot ecological datasets.
- Provides a framework for data governance: standardized field methods, explicit coding rules, robust metadata (including photographs), and season/year-aligned QA activities.
- Highlights the need for ongoing training, clear documentation, and adaptable coding schemes to maintain data quality as datasets scale and evolve.
