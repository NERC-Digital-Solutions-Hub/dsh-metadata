# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Aim and Context
- Purpose: use standardized data to assess and monitor environmental condition and policy performance over time.
- Background: ITE conducted major GB surveys in 1977/8 (ecological data, vegetation/soils), 1984 (land cover mapping with a 1 km2 sample unit), and 1988 (reduced km2 sampling). 
- 1990 survey: resurvey to provide current, ground-truth datasets and to link top-down remote sensing with bottom-up field data, enabling trend analysis and pattern detection.
- Outputs: datasets, maps, and reports that categorize environmental health against standards; data quality assurance and storage in appropriate portals; emphasis on standardization and cross-site comparability.

## Who and How
- Audience: analysts and organisations with established monitoring responsibilities; staff with topic expertise and analytical skills who apply standardized approaches.
- Data handling: verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data from established sources; apply standardized analytical methods; present outputs (maps, charts, reports); ensure datasets are stored/uploaded to portals.

## Study Design and Sampling Framework
- Sampling frame: Countryside Survey 1990 comprises 512 squares drawn from six groups, allocated to six ITE Research Stations (about 85 squares per station).
- Design principles:
  - Maintain consistency with previous surveys while expanding coverage; include satellite-era land cover data for a Britain-wide map.
  - New resurvey aims: 128 additional sites (total 512); increased detail and collaboration; ground-truth data to aid bottom-up and top-down integration.
  - Standardization: acknowledge observer variation; implement quality control and a Field Handbook to ensure consistent recording.
- Logistics and planning:
  - Flexible daily travel plans; no overtime initially; travel costs prioritized to minimize returns to sites; multiple planning options (local travel, short/long relocations).
  - Permissions: advance contact with farmers/landowners; obtain permission for access; procedures for refusals to minimize wasted effort.

## Equipment and Field Tools
- Provided by Merlewood:
  - FABs (Field Assessment Books), aerial photographs, 1:10,000 maps, project handouts, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear, measuring tools, navigation aids, and ITE identity cards.
- Local station contributions: maps to locate sites, basic field gear, reference books, cameras, first aid, etc.
- Typical field kit emphasizes mapping, recording, and location stability rather than heavy instrumentation.

## Field Procedures and Data Recording
- General field approach:
  - On arrival: survey area, assess access problems, seek permission for full square coverage, plan a route for thorough examination, and review records for omissions after surveying.
- Permissions:
  - Justification: ensure legal access, maintain farmer/landowner goodwill, and obtain background information.
  - Process: letters to owners, in-country confirmations during visits; if permission is refused for parts of a square, predefined protocols guide data collection or replacement.
- Data Recording (FAB):
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
  - FAB structure emphasizes neat, legible completion; series numbers on every page; use of pencil when possible; field-defined units if needed.
  - Ownership and farmer information: ownership of land units recorded; contact notes scored for cooperation (0–3 scale) to guide future engagement.
  - Physiography/Inland water/Coastal data: standardized physiographic and water-body categories (lakes, rivers, canals, ditches, etc.) with detailed boundary and edge coding.
  - Land cover and vegetation types: use of a coded matrix of primary and secondary codes; attention to mosaic mapping and dominance; limits on mapping to minimum mappable units; cross-referencing with boundary types when needed.
  - Special categories: boundary, boundary gaps, hedgerows, fences, walls, gates, buildings, roads, verges, and other human-made features have dedicated codes and descriptive rules.
- Mapping (6.1):
  - Annotate enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with a comprehensive code system; use alpha-numeric codes to condense multiple attributes.
  - Always map at least one primary code per feature; link related codes logically (e.g., cover codes followed by species codes).
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API): optional adjunct to identify features not on OS maps, such as isolated trees or boundary delineations; use conservative interpretation aligned with ground truth.
- Filling in the FAB (6.1.2):
  - The Field Assessment Booklet combines FAB pages with maps; pages must be completed neatly; keep square number at the top; use a consistent coding approach; when in doubt, reference the predefined code lists; include a sketch of plot layout and distances; take a photograph of each plot edge and marker.
- Plotting and Coding:
  - Codes are split into primary and secondary categories; Alpha codes (A, B, etc.) compress multiple numeric codes to save space.
  - Boundaries: differentiate actual vs. interpreted boundaries; mark remnants of old boundaries with specific codes.
  - Edge-case mapping rules: minimum mapping areas, edge delineation, and handling of non-vegetated units (e.g., bracken) with special marks.
- Species and vegetation data:
  - Species lists include ~200 common taxa (herbs, grasses, bryophytes) with a mechanism to add unlisted species.
  - 5 large quadrats (200 m2) per square, plus nested smaller quadrats (4 m2, etc.); up to five linear plots adjacent to boundaries, hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
  - Permanent plot markers placed for long-term relocatability; use metal plates or boundary-based markers; maintain accurate positional data and sketches.
  - Freshwater sampling (NELUP and IFE collaborations) and water beetle sampling procedures are documented separately but integrated into square-level sampling.

## Vegetation Sampling and Plot Types
- Quadrat-based vegetation sampling:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots; nested within for detailed species inventories; all vascular plants recorded; limited bryophyte/lichen list; cover estimated in 5% increments; permanent marking for relocation.
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types; used to capture fine-scale variation.
- Linear plots:
  - Up to 5 linear boundary plots (1 x 10 m) along boundaries adjacent to fields; hedgerow plots; streamsides; roadsides.
  - Location rules prioritize the closest, representative placement to the core quadrat; maintain a 10 m minimum separation between plots on the same feature.
  - Additional verge plots along different road types to capture variation in road-adjacent vegetation.
- Plot relocation and 1978 rules:
  - For squares previously surveyed, relocate original plots as closely as possible; if features (hedgerows/streams) no longer exist, document and relocate to nearest permissible feature; at least 2 plots may be moved per square, with constraints on distance to maintain coverage.

## Data Coding, Management, and Universal Codes
- Codes:
  - A comprehensive hierarchical coding system for land cover, vegetation, boundaries, buildings, and roads; primary and secondary codes ensure logical data relationships.
  - Use of universal codes for boundary types, hedgerow components, tree canopies, and boundary condition (e.g., stockproof, gaps, laying, trimming).
  - Alpha codes condense multiple numeric codes to a single character, with rules about ordering (dominant cover first, etc.).
- Species and vegetation:
  - A curated list of common crops (barley, wheat), grasses, forbs, rushes, sedges, ferns, mosses/lichens; combinations allowed where identification is uncertain.
  - Major species are coded with standard numbers (e.g., Lolium, Calluna, Nardus) and percent cover categories; major shrub/tree species have explicit canopy-height and age qualifiers.
- Data integrity:
  - Emphasis on field-based decision-making to avoid post-hoc coding; if on-site information conflicts with API or maps, ground truth takes precedence.
  - Dotting lines and notes used to capture uncertain or contextual information.

## Aerial Photography and Documentation
- API conventions:
  - Delineate boundaries and features on aerial images with dashed lines; mark isolated features with crosses; indicate boundaries no longer present with diamonds.
  - Use unaltered copies of baseline maps to guide interpretation; guidance notes included.
- Photography:
  - Photograph each vegetation plot for reference and landmark alignment; ensure plot number is visible and tied to the FAB entry.

## Sub-Survey Procedures and Next Steps
- Freshwater biota sampling:
  - Two freshwater biota samples per square: flowing water (IFE) and standing water (NELUP, water beetles); sampling protocols described in separate manuals.
  - Mark sample points on the same map as the IFE point; label with NELUP identifiers and brief habitat notes.
  - Samples are preserved and transported per specified chain-of-custody procedures.
- Photography and post-survey actions:
  - Ensure plots are well-photographed; review FABs for omissions; transfer FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly; ensure relocation markers remain traceable for future surveys.
- Long-term goals:
  - Maintain consistent data series to enable robust trend analyses of land cover change, vegetation composition, and landscape features.
  - Strengthen data interoperability with satellite-derived land cover maps through the two-tier approach (ground-truth + remote sensing).

## Output and Impact for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- The Countryside Survey 1990 provides a standardized, repeatable framework to quantify environmental health and land-use change over time.
- Rich datasets include: mapped land-cover categories, vegetation inventories, boundary and habitat structure, ownership and farmer context (for governance and access insights), and complementary freshwater biota data.
- With explicit QA, standardized field methods, and persistent markers, the data are suitable for longitudinal analyses, cross-square comparability, and integration with remote-sensing products to evaluate policy performance and ecological change.
