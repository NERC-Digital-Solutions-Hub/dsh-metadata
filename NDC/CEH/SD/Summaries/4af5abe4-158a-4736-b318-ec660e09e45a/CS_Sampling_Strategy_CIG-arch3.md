# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Introduction
- The field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007 is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, which began in 1978.
- Understanding the current strategy requires tracing 30+ years of development of the land classification and sampling design, as prior methods underpin present practice.

## The Importance of Stratification
- Stratified, random sampling is used to minimise bias and ensure samples are representative of the whole population.
- Land is stratified into discrete classes (ITE Land Classes) to reflect ecological differences across Britain, analogous to stratifying by demographic factors in surveys.
- Stratification enhances precision and ensures diverse land forms, climates, and uses are represented in the sample.

## Development of the ITE Land Classification
- Early work (mid-1970s) classified areas by environmental attributes using 1 km squares; a central square and surrounding squares formed a classification framework.
- Initial classification produced 32 classes, describing broad environmental types (altitude, geology, climate, vegetation, etc.).
- The Land Classification was designed to support national ecological surveys by providing the basis for stratified sampling and scalable estimates.

## The Sampling Framework: Countryside Survey 1978 (CS1978)
- Sampling unit: 1 km squares, with eight samples per land class (total of 256 squares).
- The 32 land classes, derived from a base classification of 1228 centre squares (plus surrounding squares), formed the strata.
- National estimates of habitat areas were calculated as the mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class.

## The Sampling Framework: Countryside Survey 1984 (CS1984)
- Sample size increased by 50%: 12 squares surveyed per land class (total of 384).
- Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates, with design changes to reflect the updated sampling.

## Countryside Survey 1990: All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
- Land Classification updated to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea adjustments included.
- Field survey expanded to 508 squares.
- Integrated the first full Land Cover Map (from satellite data) with the sampling framework.
- National estimates produced using the 1990 Land Classification; results published in CS1990 main report.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
- Re-evaluation of sample sizes and the need for country-specific estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) and upland habitat reporting.
- The Land Classification was extended so every GB square could be classified, enabling regional and local estimates.
- Implemented separate country estimates:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (England with Wales; Scotland).
  - Aggregation of under-represented rump classes within each country.
  - Allocation of additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimums per class per country).
- A new uplands module was added to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Table and maps (CS2000) show the distribution and numbers of squares across the revised framework.

## Wales-specific and England adjustments (CS2007 preparation)
- Post-devolution demand for Wales-only reporting prompted further refinements:
  - Creation of country-unit versions of several land classes (five new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Expansion to 45 strata (from 40) to better represent the three countries.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43 extra in total) to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
  - England adjustments to compensate for Welsh squares removal; some English classes remained at four squares per class.
- Wales gained more intensive sampling to support Wales-only environmental policy needs.
- England and Wales share a revised England-with-Wales and Scotland framework, as shown in updated land-class maps.

## The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey: CS2007
- CS2007 continued the country-specific approach and expanded the sampling framework to 45 strata.
- Wales received substantial additional sampling to support Wales-specific reporting; England-adjustments were made accordingly.
- The uplands module remained a key component to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
- Summary tables show the numbers of squares by class and country, illustrating the move toward country-specific estimates and improved representation.

## Summary of Key Effects and Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- The strategy ensures representative coverage through stratified, random sampling based on an evolving land classification system.
- Over time, the framework has shifted from a single GB-wide approach to explicit country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) and Welsh-specific classes.
- Additional sampling in Wales and upland regions improves precision for country-specific environmental policy reporting.
- The Land Classification has been progressively refined and expanded (32 → 40 → 45 classes; country subdivisions) to better reflect geographic and policy needs.
- The approach provides a transparent, repeatable method for generating national, regional, and country-specific estimates, enabling comparability across survey cycles.

## Notes on Outputs and Documentation
- Results have been published as main reports and country-specific summaries, with accompanying maps and statistical tables illustrating sample distributions and class representations.
- The methodology emphasizes reproducibility, with explicit references to sampling frames, class definitions, and the evolution of the classification system across CS1978–CS2007.
