# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose: Quantify accuracy of field recording in the Countryside Survey 1990, explain observer error, relate findings to previous work, and recommend methodology improvements to enhance accuracy and confidence of statistics.

## Overview of the QA program

- Aims of QA
  - Measure accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
  - Explain differences in recording due to observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors like drought.
  - Compare conclusions to previous ITE survey work.
  - Recommend survey method modifications for future surveys.

- QA design and timeline
  - Two independent QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors evaluated results.
    - 1991 (June–Sept): added photographs of individual plots to aid relocation; included an expanded itinerary with a single 1 km square from each of the 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment group squares.
  - Plot types covered (six): 200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots, 1 O m plots (various linear features), verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries.
  - Sub-sampling: one quarter of each square resurveyed to include each plot type represented in the square.
  - Relocation aids: sketch maps, photographs, metal plates for plot corners; used standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedures.

## Key methods and measurements

- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Autumn 1990 plate recovery: 71% recovery with a five-minute search.
  - 1991 QA (with photos): overall performance improved as relocation methods were enhanced; plates and plots recovered more reliably when photographs and exact location context were used.
  - Three relocation categories identified for squares:
    - (i) Plate/plot relocated successfully
    - (ii) Plate found but relocation uncertain but acceptable
    - (iii) Plate not found; insufficient information to relocate satisfactorily

- Species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Multiple indices used to compare plot species lists between times (1990 vs 1991 QA):
    - Percentage agreement, common species over both times, and other concordance measures.
  - Initial mean species per plot:
    - 1990: ~20.2
    - 1991 QA: ~20.9–23.4 depending on plot type (statistically significant increase overall when all plots are pooled).
  - Seasonal and drought effects:
    - A portion of observed differences is attributed to seasonal changes and the unusually dry year of 1990 versus more normal growing conditions in 1991.
  - Overall percentage agreement across 21 squares (full data set): about 60–61% (with higher values when accounting for seasonality and plot type).
  - When removing T2 differences due to seasonal/management changes, initial accuracy estimates improved (approximately 74%).

- Sources of error (categories)
  - A Mis-identification (initially)
  - B Species overlooked at T1 (original survey)
  - C Over-recording or over-zealous recording
  - D/ J Location-related errors (mis-location, mis-orientation, misalignment)
  - E/F Changes due to management or seasonal effects
  - I2 Variations (species present but not recorded at T2 or relocated)
  - I1/I2 variations reflect season, crop changes, and relocation challenges

- Landuse mapping and boundary coding
  - Primary landuse codes: generally reliable (high concordance between 1990 and 1991 QA; ~88–95% range for various code sets).
  - Boundary codes: slightly less concordant (~80–83%), with some improvement when the same assessors re-surveyed squares.
  - Level qualifiers and boundary detail: substantial interpretation required; mapping codes tended to be consistent but with notable variability in complex boundary scenarios.
  - Upland vs. lowland differences: upland areas (MA, UP) showed different patterns of accuracy; lowland arable areas (LC) had relatively poorer performance.

- Mapping of vegetation and species cover
  - Comparison of cover values for principal species showed significant differences for some common grasses and forbs; in many cases, differences reflected seasonal or management changes rather than pure recording error.
  - Co-dominants and multi-species occurrences had low concordance, highlighting challenges in capturing vegetation structure consistently.
  - Recommendation: focus mapping on the most prevalent species per parcel and reduce reliance on detailed cover estimates to improve reproducibility.

## Major findings by topic

- Plot relocation and data quality
  - Photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy, especially in unenclosed terrain.
  - Small plots (Y-plots) were particularly difficult to relocate accurately; metal plates helped but were time-consuming in upland unenclosed areas.
  - Plate-based relocation is effective but requires extra manpower in difficult terrains.

- Species recording accuracy and change statistics
  - A real, season- and drought-influenced change in species composition was detected between 1990 and 1991 for many plots.
  - Some observed changes are attributable to under-recording in the original 1990 survey, particularly for grasses and bryophytes, and not purely to ecological change.
  - When considering group-level patterns, many broad-scale trends align with expectations from prior ECOLUC work, though year-to-year variation complicates single-year change interpretation.

- Landuse and boundary coding
  - Primary landuse codes were robust; mis-match mainly occurred in more complex or less common categories (e.g., bog, rush pasture).
  - Ambiguities in boundary coding often stemmed from ambiguous hedges or undefined forb cover codes.

- Vegetation mapping and cover
  - High concordance for presence/absence at broad scales, but poor concordance for co-dominant and multi-species arrangements at fixed points.
  - Mapping of support species at fine scale showed limited reproducibility; recommended to emphasize dominant species and simplify cover coding.

## Recommendations (selected key points)

- Field data collection and recording
  - Retain lichens in general surveys; enhance training with specimen samples and habitat context.
  - QA should be conducted as close as practical to the initial survey time to minimize seasonality effects.
  - Photographs should be annotated by surveyors and linked to the plot location; ensure photos include nearby reference features and distances.
  - Use metal marker plates to mark X plots in enclosed land wherever possible; plan for additional manpower in rugged upland areas.
  - For 4 m2 Y-plots, define location with a survey tape; orient sides (not diagonals) and place the plate at the SE corner; improve field positioning protocols.

- Data handling and coding
  - Subdivide upland grassland (102) into clearer categories (upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland) and add more explicit categories for lowland/rooted vegetation types.
  - Introduce a dedicated code for lowland rush pasture and give wetlands (bog/marsh) explicit, consistent primary codes.
  - Restrict or simplify boundary codes to reduce ambiguity; consider using broader categories for hedges and boundary compositions.
  - Increase emphasis on primary landuse codes and reduce reliance on detailed cover codes; ensure consistent interpretation of boundary and vegetation codes.
  - Mapping of vegetation cover: record only the most prevalent species per parcel to improve reproducibility; avoid excessive emphasis on co-dominants and multi-species co-occurrence in point-by-point mapping.
  - For species mapping, expand bryophyte coverage in habitats where they are diagnostically important (e.g., wetlands, mires) and add targeted taxa lists to training materials.

- Training, QA design, and timing
  - Include bryophyte and relic taxa in training and QA exercises where they are ecologically important.
  - Schedule QA in the same year as the main survey (to avoid climate- and season-related divergences) and keep QA season consistent with the survey season when feasible.
  - Provide explicit guidance on plant identification, especially grasses, and distinguish similar taxa (e.g., Holcus species) in training materials.

- Data products and visualisation
  - Recognize that primary landuse codes and boundary codes underpin reliable GIS mapping; consider creating standardized GIS-ready code sets with clear definitions.
  - Use photographs and annotated sketches as a standard part of data capture for GIS applications.
  - When presenting change statistics, accompany with caveats about seasonal effects and land-management changes to avoid misinterpretation of single-year shifts.

## Conclusions

- Photographic aids and well-defined ground markers significantly improve plot relocation and data fidelity for GIS-based products.
- Seasonality and drought strongly influence observed species composition; QA should be aligned temporally with the main survey to minimize confounding factors.
- Mapping codes are generally robust for broad landuse classes, but more granular categories, particularly for upland and wetlands, require clearer definitions and possibly re-structuring.
- Simplifying cover coding and focusing on dominant species enhances reproducibility and utility for map-based data products.
- The report provides extensive recommendations to improve data quality, mapping reliability, and the usefulness of GIS-ready outputs for future Countryside Surveys.
