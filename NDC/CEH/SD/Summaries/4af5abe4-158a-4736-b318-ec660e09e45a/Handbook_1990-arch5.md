# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Long-term data collection to monitor land use, update land cover databases, and support ecological analyses and modelling.
  - Builds a two-tier approach linking field surveys with satellite imagery and bottom-up ground-truthing via the ITE Land Classification System.
  - Emphasizes current datasets, comparability across years, and standardised field recording to enable robust trend analyses.

- Data governance and standards (relevance for Data Stewards)
  - Standardised Field Handbook to minimise observer variation; explicit guidance for consistent data capture, quality control, and documentation.
  - Clear data structures and coding conventions (FABs) to ensure interoperable, machine-readable records across sites and years.
  - Permanent markers and relocation plans to support repeat surveys and long-term data integrity.

- Planning and sampling design
  - 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990, split among six ITE Research Stations; each square allocated to teams with defined workload.
  - Sampling framework includes:
    - Large vegetation quadrats (two 200 m2 “valley plots”) and five additional large quadrats per square.
    - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) in natural or semi-natural land covers.
    - Up to five linear plots per square in hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides.
  - Sampling density and spatial placement guided by land cover types, accessibility, and previous survey data; relocation rules defined for changed or degraded sites.

- Equipment and data collection tools
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, enlarged maps (1:10,000), and related handouts from Merlewood.
  - Local equipment (maps, drawing tools, navigation, camera) and surveyor-provided gear (clothing, field tools).
  - Standardised coding boxes and alpha-numeric codes to streamline data entry and minimize ambiguities.

- Data recording and coding (FAB-centric)
  - FABs comprise mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; also include ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water, and land-use attributes.
  - Use of primary and secondary codes; ensure dominant code order (e.g., dominant land use first).
  - Edge and boundary delineation rules; codes for boundaries, fences, hedges, walls, and urban–rural interfaces.
  - Special coding for non-vegetative features (buildings, roads, verges, quarries, etc.) with colour conventions for urban contexts.
  - Size, position, and boundary details must be recorded on every FAB page; neatness and legibility crucial for later analysis.

- Mapping, API, and FAB filling (section highlights)
  - Mapping involves annotating 1:10,000 maps with data codes and maintaining a linkage between on-ground features and map records.
  - Aerial photography interpretation (API) supports boundary identification and feature validation but is subordinate to field verification.
  - FAB filling guidance includes: square number on every page, ink/ pencil use, mosaic mapping decisions, and notes when single primary codes are insufficient.

- Vegetation recording and plot types (6.2)
  - Large Quadrat data collection uses nested 4 m2 counts within 200 m2 plots; progress through nested quadrats to build an overall cover estimate.
  - Permanent marking with metal plates to enable future relocation; field notes and sketches document plot geometry and reference features.
  - Location and relocation rules for quadrats when land use has changed; method to locate new quadrats near original boundaries if necessary.
  - Boundary and linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) with explicit laying-out rules, one-meter widths, and right-hand plate placement when facing the feature.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots are retained to ensure continuity with earlier surveys; 6.2.5 guidelines for species identification emphasize consistent taxonomy and acceptable species combinations when identification is uncertain.

- Data types and species handling
  - Plant surveys cover a comprehensive list of herb, grasses, forbs, and woody species; bryophytes and lichens are recorded in a restricted list.
  - Use of 5% cover bands; up to three cover codes per mosaic; explicit handling of species with <5% cover (not recorded).
  - Specific field guides and species combinations are permitted when precise identification is challenging; emphasis on replicability across surveys.

- Sampling specifics (Section 7)
  - Freshwater biota sampling from flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP); two samples per square when feasible.
  - Standardised sampling protocol for water beetles and related biota; careful labeling and formalin preservation for transport to Merlewood.

- Photography and data quality assurance
  - Photograph each vegetation plot to document general appearance and landmark context; plot number clearly visible in frame.
  - End-of-day quality checks to avoid omissions; FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly to minimise data loss.

- Procedures after survey
  - Post-field data handling emphasizes not overwriting records; only re-map and re-record in exceptional circumstances (e.g., due to damage).
  - Timely transport of FABs and samples back to the appropriate ITE station; documentation prepared for future cycles.

- Practical implications for Data Stewards
  - The handbook provides a rigorous framework for ensuring data discoverability, traceability, and reusability across time.
  - Detailed metadata, coding schemas, and procedural documentation support governance, auditability, and cross-site comparability.
  - Long-term data integrity is supported by permanent field markers, standardized plot relocation, and documented survey histories.

- Documentation and authorship
  - Document credit: Colin Barr, 1990 (revised February 1991); emphasizes ongoing methodological consistency and transparency for future resurvey iterations.
