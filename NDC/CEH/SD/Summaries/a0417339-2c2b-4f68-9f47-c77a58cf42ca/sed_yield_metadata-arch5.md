# Sediment yield measurements for fire-affected locations in the United Kingdom (2018-2019), Tenerife (2018-2019) and Australia (2019-2020)

## Dataset scope and purpose
- Monitors sediment transport during rain events in burned areas.
- Aims to support understanding of erosion dynamics and the effectiveness of different mulching and burn-severity conditions on sediment yield.

## Data files and content
- Data files: sed_yield_ma.csv, sed_yield_ts.csv, sed_yield_sw.csv
- Dataset includes calculated sediment yields per site, plot, and collection date (units: tonnes per hectare, T/ha).
- Features recorded: plot id, treatment, date, sediment yield per plot, and collection date.

## Spatial and temporal coverage
- Madre del Agua, Tenerife, Spain: UTM 28N 28R 343340 3119657; 17/08/2018 to 14/11/2019.
- Thompson reservoir, Victoria, Australia: UTM 55H 441956 5822296; 13/05/2019 to 14/01/2020.
- Higher Swineshaw reservoir, Manchester, UK: UTM 30U 566670 5927917; 03/08/2018 to 30/10/2019.

## Data collection and processing methodology
- Setup: Six erosion plots (3 m x 8 m) with sediment fences per treatment, following Robichaud et al. 2002.
- Collection: Sediments weighed in the field; a subsample taken to determine water content.
- Laboratory processing: Subsampled material oven-dried at 105°C for 48 hours, re-weighed to correct field weights.
- Calculation: Sediment yields (T/ha) computed by dividing corrected sediment weights by plot area.
- Periodicity: Data collected after rain events with precipitation depths > 10 mm.

## Treatments, replication and experimental design
- Madre del Agua (Tenerife): Control; wood mulch (C); 1.5 T/ha pine needle mulch (n1); 5 T/ha pine needle mulch (n2); 8 T/ha wood chips mulch (w1); 12 T/ha wood chips mulch (w2).
- Thompson (Australia): Fire severity levels Low, Moderate, High.
- Swineshaw (UK): High (HS) and Extreme (ES) burn severities (per Parsons et al. 2010).
- Replication: 6 plots per treatment.

## Data quality, completeness and governance
- Completeness: Full record.
- Data provenance: Collected following a standardized protocol; includes clear documentation of plot treatments and collection dates.
- Metadata depth: Includes precise location (coordinates/UTM), dates, treatment types, and measurement details to support reuse and reproducibility.
