# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Purpose and scope
  - Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest (North East Wales) using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland habitats over the next 20–30 years.
  - Established in 1998; powered by solar and wind; involves replicated drought and warming treatments with control plots.

- Spatial context and layout
  - Location: upland west‑Atlantic moorland, dominated by Calluna vulgaris ( Heather ) with additional species present.
  - Site coordinates/grid: SJ019519, 53.055°N, -3.465°W (53°03'19"N,  -03°27'55"W).
  - Experimental design: 9 plots in total (three replicates per treatment: warming, drought, and control) arranged in blocks to balance treatments.
  - Appendix includes detailed plot layout and quadrat arrangement.

- Climate treatments and operation
  - Drought treatment
    - Retractable polyethylene roof over 4 m x 5 m plots; reduces annual rainfall by ~20% and growing-season rainfall by up to ~80% during active periods.
    - Operation months historically May–Sept (1999–2011), adjusted to Apr–Oct since 2012.
    - Roof triggers on rainfall sensors; curtains do not operate in high winds (>10 m/s).
  - Warming treatment
    - Retractable aluminium mesh curtains reducing infrared loss; ~14% annual rainfall reduction due to rain retraction after detection.
    - Roofs retracted during rain; wind limits apply.
  - Treatments are monitored and timed with sensors; detailed timing and reductions provided per year.

- Site and soil context
  - Soil: humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial and illuvial horizons (E and Bh horizons described where visible).
  - Soil and ecosystem characteristics summarized for planning and mapping analyses.
  - Vegetation includes Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum, and other mosses and grasses; annual litterfall and biomass data collected.

- Data types and datasets (overview)
  - AWS meteorological data (daily; 1999–present): temperature, humidity, rainfall, radiation, PAR, wind, etc. Sensor details and height changes documented.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data (daily; 1998–present): soil and air temperature, soil moisture, at multiple depths; various sensor technologies over time.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry (site-level): storage rain gauge plus biweekly chemical analyses (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4).
  - Throughfall data (plot-level rainfall; biweekly): plot-level rainfall captured; used to derive treatment-specific rainfall adjustments.
  - Groundwater/Water table depth (from 2009): measurements via permeable tubes; biweekly.
  - Soil respiration (fortnightly and high-resolution): CO2 efflux measured with collars and infrared gas analyzers; multiple instrument generations (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated setups) and data conversion details.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measured with static chambers connected to GC; sampling at multiple time points; calibration details included.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): occasional years (2002–2004, 2011) using chambers and IRGAs; includes biomass adjustments.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient and response-curve measurements (Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum); PAR and CO2 conditions varied; leaf-level measurements with mass/area considerations.
  - Vegetation survey data (Pin‑point biomass): annual biomass estimates from pin-point method (1998–2012, with earlier and later years); species codes and biomass conversions detailed.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer (2001–2004; 2003–2004) to assess canopy status.
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth, pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf numbers, growth timing across species; pathogen indicators recorded.
  - Vegetation chemistry: elemental composition (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and structural indicators (lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates).
  - Litterfall: monthly/irregular collection (1999–2002; pooling and conversion to g m−2).
  - Root biomass: multiple timepoints (2003–2013) using soil cores; extraction and measurement protocols described.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012); DOC-based calculations and correction factors.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: N-min rates from paired cores with KCl extracts; iterative sampling and analysis.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density: core-based density and carbon content in organic and inorganic layers; SO M and SOC mass per m2 calculated.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tension samplers; pH and major ion analyses (NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4).
  - Data handling notes: not all data stored in EIDC; legacy data practices noted; contact points for details.

- Data quality, processing, and governance
  - Data quality control via basic visual/ graphical checks; legacy datasets may reflect older methodologies and documentation practices.
  - Multiple instrument platforms over time require careful unit conversions and cross-calibration notes (detailed conversion factors provided for CO2 flux units and related calculations).
  - Data processing sometimes involved infilling or selective replication due to data loss or measurement issues; throughfall treatment means may exclude plots with data issues.

- Access, contact, and usage notes for GIS work
  - Primary contacts for data details: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) and Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk) at CEH Bangor.
  - Data description and naming conventions are provided for integration into map-based data products.
  - GIS applications can map treatment layouts, plot positions, sensor locations, and time-series data across years to support policy, client, or public-facing visualizations.
  - The documentation emphasizes the need to integrate dataset types with their spatial-temporal contexts for robust map visualizations and exploratory analyses.

- Appendix highlights
  - Appendix 1: Site and plot layout (plot coordinates, grid references).
  - Appendix 2: Quadrat layout and measurement frames.
  - Additional plot and sensor codes (e.g., LYS for lysimeters, PQ for point quadrats) and detailed plot maps are available for GIS mapping and metadata tagging.
