# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- A climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming for upland moorland habitat over the next 20–30 years.
- Established in 1998; site dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with additional species including Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum; humo-ferric podzol soil with variable horizons.
- Site designed for automated, remote operation powered by solar and wind; data collection spans abiotic and biotic responses to treatments.

## Site information

- Location: Clocaenog Forest, Wales (53°03′19″N, -3°27′55″W).
- Ecosystem: upland west-atlantic moorland; dominant vegetation includes Calluna vulgaris (>60% biomass); bryophytes and other heath species present.
- Growing season: typically June–August; shoulder seasons April–May and September–October; winter dormancy November–February.
- Soil: humo-ferric podzol; horizons E and Bh variably visible; E horizon depth 6–17 cm when present.

## Climate change treatment information

- Treatments and design: two climate treatments (drought and warming), each with three replicate plots (4 m x 5 m) and three control plots (n = 9 plots total).
- Drought treatment:
  - Operating period: May–Sept (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October.
  - Mechanism: retractable polyethylene roof over plot area triggered by tipping-bucket rainfall sensor; reduces annual rainfall by ~20% (and ~80% of rain during drought periods due to sensor limits).
- Warming treatment:
  - Mechanism: retractable aluminium mesh curtains covering warming plots; reflect 96–97% of infrared radiation, reducing night-time heat loss.
  - Rainfall interactions: roofs retract during rain to minimize rainfall exclusion; overall site rainfall reduction ~14%.
  - Wind constraint: curtains disabled in winds >10 m/s to prevent damage.
- Timing and metrics are documented in detailed tables (e.g., annual drought reductions, warming growing degree days).

## Equipment, protocols and data processing methodology

- On-site automated weather station (AWS) plus plot-based micro-meteorological sensors; data collected from 1998/1999 onward.
- Data types and frequencies (examples):
  - AWS meteorological data: daily, 1999–present (temperature, humidity, rainfall, radiation, PAR, wind, pressure).
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily soil/air temperature and soil moisture, 1998–present.
  - Rainfall: site-level storage gauge and rain chemistry (biweekly; 1998–present).
  - Throughfall (plot-level rainfall): biweekly; used to derive treatment-specific rainfall changes.
  - Water table depth: biweekly since 2009.
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly; multiple measurement systems (1999–2014+), including automated and manual methods.
  - Trace gases (CH4, N2O): measurement with static chambers; periodic sampling (1999–2000, 2007–2009).
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): 2002–2004, 2009–2011 using different chamber systems; respiration estimates derived from: NEE minus biomass adjustments.
  - Photosynthesis: ambient and response-curve measurements (2001–2007; species include Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum).
  - Vegetation surveys (plant biomass): pin-point method across multiple years (1998–2012, with pre- and post-treatment calibrations).
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from 2000–2004.
  - Phenology, annual growth and pathogens: spring phen development and maximum shoot elongation measured for key species (1999–2009, with selected years).
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, cations, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates (green and litter material) annually.
  - Litterfall: monthly (1999–2002), then less frequent; biomass converted to g m^-2; carbon and nitrogen analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple years (2003–2013) via soil cores and WinRHIZO analysis.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: periodic core-based incubations; ammonium and nitrate analyses.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density: core-based analyses; conversions to g m^-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tensioned samplers; monthly to biweekly sampling.
- Data processing notes:
  - Legacy practices: some methods and documentation predate current best practices; conversions and calibrations described for each dataset.
  - Units: CO2 fluxes converted to mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1; cross-method conversions (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, etc.) detailed.
  - Pin-point biomass: conversion factors and calibration tables provided to translate pin hits to biomass (g m^-2).
- Data scope:
  - Comprehensive suite of abiotic and biotic measurements across treatments, plots, and years; not all datasets stored in the same repository after 2015.

## Implications for environmental data analysis

- Rich, multi-decadal, multi-variable dataset enabling assessment of drought and warming impacts on upland moorland ecosystems.
- Standardised collection protocols and documented data processing steps facilitate cross-study comparisons and temporal trend analyses.
- Some legacy data caveats suggest careful handling of older methodologies and unit conversions when integrating with newer datasets.
- Data accessibility challenges highlight the importance of linking underlying datasets to policy performance and environmental health monitoring initiatives.
