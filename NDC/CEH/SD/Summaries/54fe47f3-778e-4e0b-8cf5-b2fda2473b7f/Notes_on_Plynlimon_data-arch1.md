# Plynlimon hydrochemistry data

- Time period covered: March 2016 to March 2019
- Sampling regime
  - March 2016 – July 2017: sampling fortnightly
  - August 2017 – November 2018: stream samples every 4 weeks; rain sample every 2 weeks
  - December 2018 onwards: all samples every 4 weeks
- Collection methods
  - See Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv for detailed procedures
- Sample sites
  - See Plynlimon_site_information.csv for site locations and related notes
- Laboratory instrumentation and measurements
  - See Description_of_column_headings.csv for details on instrumentation, units, and recorded values
- Nature and units of recorded values
  - See Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Analytical methods
  - See Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Details of data structure
  - See Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Notes on reported values
  - Values below the limit of detection (LOD) are recorded as half the LOD
  - LOD values are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv
  - Determinants and methods described using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST)
- Quality control and calibration
  - pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measured at CEH Bangor; participate in LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing
  - Other chemical analyses performed at CEH Lancaster; UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses
  - Data checked for missing values; blank cells indicate missing data due to insufficient sample, instrument failure, or fieldworker error
- Other information useful to interpretation
  - For consistency with earlier Plynlimon hydrochemistry data, Carregwen rainfall chemistry (C) rainfall measurements are taken from a rain gauge near Hafren (B) rather than the Carregwen Standard gauge site (A J); rainfall measurements at Carregwen began in September 2010
