# Plynlimon hydrochemistry data description (2016–2019)

- Sampling regime
  - Data cover March 2016 to March 2019.
  - Fortnightly sampling from March 2016 to July 2017.
  - August 2017 to November 2018: stream samples every four weeks; rain samples every two weeks.
  - December 2018 onward: all samples every four weeks.
  - Additional details available in Plynlimon_site_information.csv.

- Collection methods and sample sites
  - Methods and procedures documented in Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv.
  - Sample sites described in Plynlimon_site_information.csv.
  - Laboratory instrumentation detailed in Description_of_column_headings.csv.

- Nature and units of recorded values; Analytical methods
  - Recorded values, units, and analytical methods described in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
  - Full determinant and method descriptions available in Description_of_column_headings.csv, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST) where possible.

- Data structure and reporting
  - Data structure details provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
  - LOD handling: values below the limit of detection are recorded as half the LOD.
  - LOD values listed in Description_of_column_headings.csv.

- Quality control and calibration
  - pH, conductivity, and alkalinity analyses performed at CEH Bangor laboratories.
  - CEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing scheme for QA against other laboratories.
  - Other chemical analyses performed at CEH Lancaster (Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group); facility UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses.
  - Data checked for missing values; blanks indicate missing data due to sample insufficiency, instrument failure, or fieldworker error.

- Additional interpretation notes
  - To maintain consistency with previously published Plynlimon hydrochemistry data, rainfall volumes for Carregwen rainfall chemistry (C) are recorded from a Hafren gauge near the B sample site (not the Carregwen gauge A/J site). Rainfall data for Carregwen started in September 2010.
