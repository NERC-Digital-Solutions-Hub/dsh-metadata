# Plynlimon hydrochemistry data (March 2016 – March 2019)

- Overview
  - Dataset covers hydrochemical measurements from March 2016 to March 2019, with varying sampling frequencies over time.
  - Documentation references multiple CSV files for full metadata (site information, field measurements, methods, and column descriptions) to ensure consistency and interoperability.
  - Data are aligned with CAST (CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus) terminology where possible.

- Sampling regime
  - March 2016 – March 2019.
  - Fortnightly sampling: March 2016 – July 2017.
  - August 2017 – November 2018: stream samples every 4 weeks; rain sample every 2 weeks.
  - December 2018 onward: all samples every 4 weeks.
  - For details on sampling sites and methodologies, refer to the linked CSV files (Plynlimon_site_information.csv, Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv).

- Collection methods
  - Refer to Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv for detailed collection procedures.

- Sample sites
  - Refer to Plynlimon_site_information.csv for site locations and identifiers.

- Laboratory instrumentation and analytical methods
  - Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for instrumentation, units, determinants, and analytical methods.

- Nature and units of recorded values; data structure
  - Refer to Description_of_column_headings.csv for the specific units, data types, and column descriptions.

- Notes on reported values
  - For values below the Limit of Detection (LOD), reported as half the LOD (between 0 and LOD).
  - LOD values are provided in Description_of_column_headings.csv.
  - Full determinant and method descriptions are available within Description_of_column_headings.csv, using CAST vocabulary where possible.

- Quality control and calibration
  - pH, conductivity, and alkalinity measured at CEH Bangor laboratories.
  - CEH Bangor participates in the LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing scheme to ensure cross-laboratory quality.
  - Other chemical analyses conducted at CEH Lancaster’s Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group; facility is UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005 for many analyses.
  - Data quality checks include handling of missing values; blank cells indicate missing data due to insufficient sample, instrument failure, or fieldwork error.

- Other information useful for interpretation
  - Rainfall data notes: Carregwen rainfall chemistry measurements (C) use a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) site rather than the Carregwen gauge (A) for consistency with historical data.
  - Carregwen rainfall measurements began in September 2010.
