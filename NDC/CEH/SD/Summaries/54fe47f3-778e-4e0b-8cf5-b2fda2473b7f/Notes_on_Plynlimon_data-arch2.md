# Plynlimon Hydrochemistry Data (March 2016 – March 2019)

## Overview
- Time period: March 2016 to March 2019
- Sampling cadence:
  - March 2016 – July 2017: Fortnightly
  - August 2017 – November 2018: Stream samples every four weeks; rain samples every two weeks
  - December 2018 onward: All samples every four weeks
- Additional details and site information available in linked CSV files

## Collection methods and site details
- Collection methods: Plynlimon_field_measurements_and_methods.csv
- Sample sites: Plynlimon_site_information.csv
- Laboratory instrumentation: Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Nature and units of recorded values: Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Analytical methods: Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Data structure: Description_of_column_headings.csv

## Data handling and documentation
- Notes on reported values:
  - Values below detection limit (LOD) are reported as halfway between 0 and LOD
  - LOD values are specified in Description_of_column_headings.csv
- Full determinant and method descriptions: where possible, using the CEH Analytical Services Thesaurus (CAST) via http://vocabs.ceh.ac.uk/evn/tbl/cast.evn

## Quality control and calibration
- pH, conductivity, and alkalinity analyses: CEH Bangor laboratories
- Quality assurance: CEH Bangor participates in LGC AquaCheck Proficiency Testing
- Other chemical analyses: CEH Centralised Analytical Chemistry Group (Lancaster); UKAS-accredited to ISO 17025:2005

## Data completeness and interpretation
- Data checks: missing values present; blank cells indicate missing data
- Reasons for missing data: insufficient sample (e.g., rain), instrument failure, or fieldworker error

## Data compatibility and consistency
- Rainfall data context:
  - Rainfall volume for Carregwen rainfall chemistry (C) recorded from a rain gauge near the Hafren (B) sample site, not the Carregwen site
  - Rainfall data at Carregwen started in September 2010
- Consistency with previously published Plynlimon hydrochemistry data ensured

## Data access and storage
- Data are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals (as part of standard monitoring workflows)
- References to external data definitions and methods are available in the linked CSV files for traceability
