# Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018 - RBR SoloT

- Scope and purpose: High-resolution water temperature profile collected to support environmental monitoring; data include temperatures measured at 10-minute intervals over 2018.
- Location and spatial context: Durleigh Reservoir, latitude 51.1210, longitude -3.0403.
- Temporal extent: 22/02/2018 to 05/10/2018.
- Depths and measurement setup: Temperature chain with RBR SoloT thermistors at 1 m depth intervals from surface (0 m) to bottom (6 m); expects readings at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 m.
- Data format and units: Temperature values reported in degrees Celsius; date-time format is dd/mm/yyyy HH:MM.
- Metadata and accompanying files: Temperature metadata file accompanies the dataset, detailing the location and deployment specifics.
- Data quality and gaps: Missing data for thermistors at 1 m, 2 m, and 3 m due to corrupted files during download from the thermistors.
- Provenance: Deployed by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain in 2018; citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.
- Implications for monitoring frameworks: Highlights typical data governance and quality challenges, including data completeness, metadata availability, and the need for reliable data transfer to ensure timely, usable datasets for environmental health monitoring.
- Considerations for data management and sharing: Metadata availability and data integrity are crucial; missing depth data underscores the importance of robust QA, documentation, and notes on data gaps when informing policy and decisions.
