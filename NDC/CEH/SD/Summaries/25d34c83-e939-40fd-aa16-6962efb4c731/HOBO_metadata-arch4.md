# Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018 - HOBO TidbiT

## Overview
- Time-series dataset of water temperature from Durleigh Reservoir collected in 2018.
- Five thermistors positioned at depths from surface (0 m) to bottom (4 m) on a temperature chain.
- Temperature readings every 10 minutes from 02/22/2018 to 10/05/2018.
- Temperature units: Fahrenheit (oF).

## Data Details
- Location: Durleigh Reservoir; coordinates Lat 51.1215, Lon -3.0445.
- Instrumentation: HOBO TidbiT v2 loggers (Onset).
- Depth channels: 0 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m.
- Timestamp format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:ss.
- Data collectors/deployers: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.

## Provenance & Metadata
- Metadata indicates a temperature dataset with explicit depth arrangement and deployment details.
- Metadata and dataset should be cited together with the provided attribution.

## Data Quality & Access Considerations for Data Leaders
- Ready-to-use high-frequency data (10-minute intervals) with clear depth stratification.
- Units in Fahrenheit may require conversion for cross-project interoperability.
- Temporal coverage spans February to October 2018; assess for any data gaps not specified in the metadata.
- Metadata includes location, depths, instruments, and investigators, supporting discoverability and reuse; verify if additional metadata (calibration, time zone, data gaps) exists for full quality assessment.

## Usage & Reuse
- Suitable for reservoir thermal profiling, stratification studies, and cross-depth comparisons.
- Could support long-term or multi-year analyses when combined with comparable datasets.
- Proper citation of Slavin & Wain (2018) is required for redistribution or publication.
