# Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018 - HOBO TidbiT

## Overview
- Metadata describing water temperature measurements taken at Durleigh Reservoir in 2018.
- Five HOBO TidbiT v2 thermistors positioned on a depth chain from surface (0 m) to 4 m depth.
- Temperatures recorded at 10-minute intervals over 22 February 2018 to 5 October 2018.
- Temperatures reported in Fahrenheit (oF).
- Deployment and authors: temperature chain deployed by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Dataset citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.

## Spatial and temporal details
- Location: latitude 51.1215, longitude -3.0445.
- Depth positions: thermistors at 0 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, and 4 m.
- Time coverage: 02/22/2018 00:00:00 to 10/05/2018 23:59:59 (local time per format).
- Date/time format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:ss.

## Measurement specifics
- Sensor type: HOBO TidbiT v2 loggers (Onset).
- Depth profile captured via a temperature chain across 0–4 m.
- Temporal resolution: 10-minute intervals.
- Temperature unit: Fahrenheit (oF).

## Data quality and provenance
- Metadata provides deployment details and responsible researchers.
- Source is a single-site reservoir study; ensure alignment with GIS workflows requiring unit conversions or timestamp harmonization.
- Citation required for dataset usage.

## GIS uses and considerations
- Create a multi-depth time series per location for visualization of vertical temperature profile changes over time.
- Potential to generate surface temperature maps or depth-wise temperature rasters if spatially extended (requires additional spatial coverage data).
- Prepare for unit conversion (to Celsius if needed) and confirm time zone for temporal analyses.
