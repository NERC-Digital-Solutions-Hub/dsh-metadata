# Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018 - HOBO TidbiT

## Overview
- Metadata for water temperature measurements at Durleigh Reservoir in 2018.
- Five thermistors positioned at 1 m depth intervals from surface (0 m) to bottom (4 m).
- Temperature readings taken every 10 minutes, from 02/22/2018 to 10/05/2018.
- Temperature units: Fahrenheit (oF).
- Instrumentation: HOBO TidbiT v2 loggers (Onset).
- Deployment conducted by Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Dataset should be cited as: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.

## Location and Instrumentation
- Location coordinates: Lat 51.1215, Lon -3.0445.
- Five thermistors on a temperature chain covering 0–4 m depths.
- Data collection equipment: HOBO TidbiT v2 loggers.

## Data Characteristics
- Timestamp format: mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:ss.
- Depths: 0 m, 1 m, 2 m, 3 m, 4 m.
- All temperatures reported in oF.
- Metadata specifies deployment and serials but does not detail QA/calibration steps.

## Provenance and Citation
- Data creators/deployers: Emily Slavin and Danielle Wain.
- Citation: Slavin, E.I., Wain, D.J. 2018. Water temperature measurements from Durleigh Reservoir 2018.

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Time period: 02/22/2018 – 10/05/2018.
- Single-site dataset at Durleigh Reservoir (latitude/longitude provided).

## Metadata, Quality, and Standards
- Provides essential metadata: location, depths, instrument type, sampling interval, time format, and units.
- Lacks explicit QA/validation notes, calibration details, and data completeness indicators.

## Data Management and Sharing Considerations
- Data should be uploaded to appropriate data portals and catalogued.
- Ensure clear versioning and update pathways if additional measurements are added.
- Respect any sharing limitations or embargoes; maintain clear provenance and citation in reuse.

## User Guidance and Best Practices for Data Stewards
- Use for analyzing vertical temperature profiles across 0–4 m depth with 10-minute resolution.
- Maintain consistent unit handling (oF) and timestamp interpretation (mm/dd/yyyy HH:MM:ss).
- Reference the dataset citation when distributing or linking to external work.
