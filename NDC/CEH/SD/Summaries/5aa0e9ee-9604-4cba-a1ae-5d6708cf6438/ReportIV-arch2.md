# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years on from the establishment of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Primary monitoring of above-ground productivity, plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity) in relation to five management themes:
  - Mowing (set at ~6 cm sward height, monthly May–Sept)
  - Fertilisation (nitrogen and/or lime)
  - Insecticide application (Dursban 4)
  - Trampling (not a deliberate treatment, but a site-level/plot activity consideration)
  - Grazing exclusion (fencing from April 1998)
- Experimental design comprises 5 replicate blocks on downslope gradients, with 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots. Treatments are allocated randomly and include both fertilised and unfertilised categories, plus control and insecticide plots.

- Long-running botanical monitoring has tracked productivity, composition, and diversity since 1998 baseline surveys. Data collection includes:
  - Automatic weather station records (precipitation, temperature, radiation)
  - Above-ground biomass estimates via 0.5 m2 clippings per plot, measured annually
  - Soil pH, soil moisture measurements
  - Botanical surveys using 0.5 m2 point analysis (2000–2002) with 100-hole grid and 25-pin touches
  - Bryophyte and liverwort identification to species in 2002
  - Additional small-scale surveys (litter, cover estimates, biomass sorting by species)

- Key analytic framework:
  - CSR functional classification (Grime) to interpret shifts in plant strategies under different stress and disturbance regimes
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) on point-analysis data to separate improved vs unimproved plots and to identify species groupings
  - Split-plot ANOVAs to test treatment, year, and their interaction on biomass
  - Examination of relationships among soil pH, moisture, and biomass productivity

- Site management and data collection details:
  - Treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (no inputs); Nitrogen; Lime; Nitrogen & Lime; Insecticide
  - Insecticide applied after mowing; lime and nitrogen applied in spring
  - 1998 baseline botanical survey placed Sourhope site as NVC community U4d (Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland)
  - 1999 onward: five summer cuts to 6 cm; nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots
  - 2002 saw additional data collection efforts, including 2002 point-analysis surveys and expanded bryophyte identification

- Major findings by theme

  1) Mowing effect
  - Uniform mowing (6 cm) across the site is associated with a decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis by more than 40% since 2000, suggesting a site-wide response rather than a treatment-specific effect.
  - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in more fertile plots (lime or nitrogen present)
  - Stress-tolerant (S) species expand across most plots except the nitrogen & lime combination, indicating disturbance reduction and nutrient enrichment as drivers
  - Bryophyte expansion (mosses) across the site, potentially aided by the 6 cm mowing height and reduced grazing disturbance
  - Overall, mowing fosters a shift toward mosses and stress-tolerant species, with reduced dominance of some competitive grasses

  2) Fertilisation effect
  - Nitrogen and/or lime addition consistently increases above-ground biomass productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime show the strongest productivity
  - Some signs of productivity peaking in N+L plots as soil pH approaches ~7.0, with potential moisture limitations contributing to stress
  - High lime application leads to elevated soil pH (near 7) and altered moisture dynamics; in some plots, higher pH correlates with reduced biomass under certain conditions
  - Functional shift: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderals) species expand in N+L plots, while stress-tolerant species dominate unfertilised plots

  3) Insecticide effect
  - Dursban 4 insecticide application is associated with changes in plant diversity in line with some prior studies: reductions in diversity are not uniformly observed and depend on life-history groups and subsequent seasons
  - Possible mechanism: reduced herbivory may allow more palatable, competitive species to persist; however, evidence for a direct causal link to higher diversity is not conclusive
  - Overall, insecticide treatment does not show uniform, unambiguous increases in diversity, but patterns align with complex plant–herbivore interactions

  4) Trampling effect
  - 2002 C2 plots (first-year heavy sampling activity) show pronounced productivity declines, likely due to trampling during 13CO2 pulse measurements
  - Indicates that procedural disturbances can transiently suppress vegetation productivity in sensitive plots

- Plant community composition and diversity trends
  - Shifts in species frequency show increased dominance of Festuca rubra in fertilised plots and a relative decline of Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
  - Two grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) become dominant in N- and/or Lime-treated plots, contributing to higher fertility-associated biomass but lower overall diversity in some treatments
  - Bryophyte (moss) hits rise across the site, particularly in unimproved plots, contributing to a higher bryophyte fraction of total hits and biomass over time
  - Point Analysis findings (2002) reveal reduced dominance by Agrostis spp. and increased presence of Festuca rubra in fertilised treatments
  - Shannon Diversity Indices: declines occur in nitrogen-and-lime plots by 2002, while diversity increases are observed in several other treatments (notably insecticide-treated plots)

- Functional-group dynamics (CSR framework)
  - Stress-tolerators (S) expand in unimproved plots; competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups become more prevalent in fertilised plots
  - In lime- and N+L-treated plots, C-S-R species tend to dominate, indicating improved growth conditions but altered disturbance regime
  - Lime and/or nitrogen treatments tend to suppress SR/C-S-R bryophyte-dominated or ruderal components in some cases, reflecting shifts in resource availability and disturbance

- Endnotes on data and interpretation
  - Biomass productivity increased across treatments from 1999–2002, with the strongest gains in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; 2002 saw a general reduction in biomass relative to 2001, with a pronounced gradient along slope blocks
  - Soil moisture and pH exhibit a strong inverse relationship; lime-induced pH elevation to near 7 correlates with moisture dynamics and biomass responses
  - PCA of point-analysis data generally separates improved vs unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together; some nitrogen-treated samples align with limed plots, suggesting partial functional similarity under certain conditions
  - Bryophyte expansion coincides with mowing and reduced disturbance, particularly in unimproved plots

- Implications for environmental monitoring and data value
  - The Sourhope site demonstrates how a standardized monitoring framework can reveal multi-factor ecological responses (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) and their interactions
  - The observed shifts in functional composition (CSR) and in bryophyte dominance highlight the importance of including below-ground and bryological components in monitoring frameworks
  - The combination of biomass, species composition, soil chemistry, moisture, and diversity indices provides a robust dataset for evaluating policy-relevant environmental health and management outcomes over time
  - Data integration across management regimes can enhance value beyond single-output analyses, aligning with goals to increase dataset utility for broader environmental monitoring and modelling efforts

- Summary conclusion
  - Management regimes markedly shape vegetation productivity, composition, and diversity at Sourhope, with fertilisation (especially N+L) driving the strongest productivity gains but also associated with reduced diversity in some plots
  - Mowing and disturbance reduction promote stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated communities, while liming elevates soil pH and interacts with moisture to influence biomass
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are complex and context-dependent; trampling during additional sampling can temporarily suppress productivity
  - Overall, the site provides a rich, standardized dataset illustrating environmental health and policy-performance signals over time, suitable for cross-cutting analyses and data-sharing initiatives
