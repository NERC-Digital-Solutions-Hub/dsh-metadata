# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Presents soil and vegetation data from Sourhope field site, with detailed records for Blocks 4 and 5, plus ECOTRON plots.
- Documents soil profile descriptions, chemical/physical analyses, auger samples, moisture indicators, and vegetation surveys across multiple horizons and micro-sites.
- Aims to support long-term monitoring of soil health, biodiversity, and ecosystem responses to management.

## BLOCK 4 – SOIL PROFILE, RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE
- Site context
  - Block 4 profile with horizon sequence from LF (0–1 cm) through FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx (up to 95 cm).
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous/organic-rich surface, gravely horizons, and igneous stones within Ah–Cx horizons.
  - Noted presence of many igneous stones (andesite) and variable structure across horizons.
- Soil profile descriptions
  - LF: fibrous, moist; sharp boundary to FH.
  - FH: fibrous, moist; abundant fine roots.
  - H: dark, amorphous; moist; blocky structure; roots present.
  - Ah: dark sandy silt loam; moist; granular/blocky structure; many small igneous stones; common larger andesite stones.
  - Abg: pink-grey with mottling; coarse sandy silt loam; varied mottling; numerous small stones.
  - B sg: brown with mottling; sandy silt loam; angular blocky to platy structure; roots present; many igneous stones.
  - C gx: reddish-brown to brown; sandy clay loam; massive/partly platy structure; very abundant very small stones.
- Soil analysis (BLOCK 4 PROFILE)
  - Horizons sampled: FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx (Wt in mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Key patterns: N and C highest in surface horizons (FH/H/Ah), C:N varies by horizon; exchangeable Ca, Mg, K show horizon- and block-level variation; acidity evident (low pH around 4.0–5.0 in CaCl2/pH(H2O)).
- Auger samples (BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES)
  - Subsamples 4A–4F with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Variability across sub-samples; some horizons show higher organic indicators (LOI) and variable nutrient contents.
- Vegetation survey (BLOCK 4)
  - Plot-level records (A–F subplots per plot), species presence/absence counts, and totals per subplot.
  - Data presented as species totals and counts across subplots, enabling association with soil horizons and blocks.
- ECOTRON subplot (BLOCK 4) [ECOTRON PLOT]
  - Soil: single profile with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Vegetation: subplot-level presence/absence and counts, structured similarly to other blocks.

## BLOCK 5 – SOIL PROFILE, RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE
- Site details
  - Block 5 site details: grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; imperfect drainage; major soil subgroup Brown forest soil with gleying; igneous/andesite rocks.
- Soil profile descriptions
  - LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg horizons described (0–100 cm total), with color/mottling, structure, root presence, and abundant igneous stones noted (especially Ah, AB, Bg, BCg).
- Soil analysis (BLOCK 5 PROFILE)
  - Horizons sampled with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Observed horizon- and block-level differences in nutrient pools and acidity; higher clay/loam content in deeper horizons; Ca and Mg distribution varies with depth and horizon type.
- Auger samples (BLOCK 5 AUGER SAMPLES)
  - Subsamples 5A–5F with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
  - Notable N and C values across auger samples; variable LOI and pH indicating soil development with depth and micro-site differences.
- Vegetation survey (BLOCK 5)
  - Plot-level data across subplots (5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F) with presence/absence and totals for multiple species; information structured to align with soil horizons and plot design.
- ECOTRON data
  - ECOTRON soil analysis and vegetation data analogous to Blocks 4 and 5, enabling cross-site comparisons within the Ecotron-linked monitoring framework.

## ECOTRON PLOT
- Soil analysis
  - Single ECOTRON soil analysis: Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation
  - ECOTRON plot vegetation surveyed with subplots A–F, recording species totals and per-subplot counts, enabling comparison with main blocks.

## Data governance, management, and accessibility
- Data are catalogued with MLURI barcodes and integrated into the ECN/SERAD networks, with Sourhope designated as a core site.
- Archival samples exist to support long-term storage and re-analysis; emphasis on openness and data management standards at the data source.
- Metadata completeness is variable; inadequate metadata is highlighted as a barrier to data reuse and verification, impacting straightforward integration into monitoring frameworks.
- Public sharing of underlying data is manageable but can be constrained by governance requirements and metadata gaps, requiring careful data governance and documentation.

## Key considerations for monitoring frameworks
- The datasets provide a comprehensive baseline of soil chemical/physical properties and vegetation composition across multiple horizons and micro-sites, suitable for tracking changes due to management or extensification scenarios.
- Multi-horizon and multi-plot design supports analyses of vertical soil gradients and spatial heterogeneity within hillside landscapes.
- The integration with ECN Micronet and the inclusion of archive samples support cross-site comparisons and long-term trend assessments.
- Metadata quality and governance processes are critical to ensure datasets are readily usable in monitoring frameworks; ongoing attention to metadata standardization, data sharing policies, and dataset provenance is required.
- Data quality notes highlight occasional block-level anomalies in auger sampling and partial subplot sampling in Year 1, which should be accounted for in long-term trend interpretation.

## Appendices and data accessibility
- Appendices provide block-specific soil and vegetation data, profile descriptions, and complete tabular data for blocks 4 and 5, enabling in-depth re-analysis and cross-site comparisons where metadata are documented.
- The ECOTRON dataset, including soil and vegetation data, is available to support broader environmental monitoring and policy-relevant assessments.
