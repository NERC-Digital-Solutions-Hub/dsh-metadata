# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Purpose and scope
  - Document a long-term soil–biodiversity research site established in 1998 on Sourhope, combining soil, vegetation, and management experiments.
  - Part of the Environmental Change Network (ECN) framework; linked to broader programmes (e.g., SERAD Micronet).
  - Aimed to study relationships between soil properties, vegetation, climate, and management, with data intended for multi-site analysis and long-term monitoring.

- Site setting and data coverage
  - Location: Sourhope Farm, Rigg Foot slope, Scottish Borders; five blocks (1–5) with multiple plots/subplots, plus an Ecotron area.
  - Land use: predominantly grasslands with managed grazing; long-term grazing history and fencing to control external impacts.
  - Experimental design: randomized main plots with subplots for treatments (e.g., Lime, Nitrogen, Lime+N, Biocide, Fallow) and an Ecotron sub-plot; data collected across blocks, plots, horizons, and Ecotron.

- Data collection and methods
  - Vegetation data
    - Quadrat sampling: 50 x 50 cm quadrats; five randomly selected subplots per main plot; 25 points per quadrat.
    - Data recorded as presence/absence with abundance cues; used to derive species frequencies and assign NVC communities.
  - Soil data
    - Profiling: 0–30 cm auger cores per plot in a “W” pattern; horizon-based profile pits (up to 1 m where possible).
    - Horizons named and described (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, BCx, C, with blocks and depths varying by plot).
    - Laboratory analyses: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; LOI; pH (H2O and CaCl2); samples archived at -80°C.
    - Data structure: block- and plot-level data with horizon-specific measurements; detailed Auger data per plot and horizon.
  - Data management and archiving
    - Data organized by block, plot, horizon, and subplot; Appendix-style cross-references (Appendix A) and long-term archival samples.
    - ECOTRON and other subplots provide multi-factor, controlled-environment contexts.
  - Data scope and limitations
    - Some analyses sampled only a subset of subplots (e.g., initial vegetation surveys), so results are indicative rather than exhaustive.
    - Some blocks show anomalous soil patterns requiring careful interpretation in cross-block comparisons.

- Data analysis approaches
  - Vegetation analyses
    - Twinspan clustering; alignment with National Vegetation Classification (NVC) and indicator species analyses.
    - Identification of dominant species and community patterns across slope positions and blocks.
  - Soil data analyses
    - Correlation analyses among variables (N, C, LOI, moisture, pH, cations).
    - Regression to identify drivers of soil properties; consideration of principal components to summarize major variation drivers.
  - Interpretation and integration
    - Assessing species richness across positions; mapping of indicator/diffuse communities; exploring block- and plot-level differences in soil chemistry and moisture.
    - Linking vegetation patterns with soil properties under different treatments and environmental contexts.

- Key findings and data patterns
  - Vegetation
    - Dominant species across plots: Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta.
    - Species richness generally increases downslope; highest diversity up to ~17 species; some edge plots less diverse.
    - NVC designation commonly U4d (with variants such as U5b in moister upper blocks); indicator species include Deschampsia flexuosa, Deschampsia cespitosa, Agrostis canina, Holcus mollis, Ranunculus repens, Carex binervis, Juncus effusus.
  - Soils
    - Surface horizons acidic (pH around 4.5 in H2O); very high LOI values in upper horizons (up to ~77%), indicating substantial organic matter.
    - Major extractable cations: Ca most abundant, followed by Mg; Na generally low; K variable by block/horizon.
    - Block-level differences observed for several elements; some blocks (notably 4 and 5) show near-surface anomalies; horizon-specific chemistry (e.g., Ah, AB, Bg, BCg) reveals complex deposition and weathering patterns.
  - Climate and site context
    - Data integrated with ECN and Micronet baselines to contextualize vegetation–soil responses under climate and management scenarios, supporting long-term ecological and agricultural insights.
  - Data scope and accessibility
    - Detailed data for each block (including Block 4 and Block 5 soil profiles) and Ecotron plots; data suitable for cross-linking vegetation, soil chemistry, and physical properties.
    - Long-term archive supports multi-level analyses (block, plot, horizon, Ecotron) and potential cross-site comparisons.

- Practical considerations for data use
  - Use as a long-term, multi-factor dataset to examine extensification, biodiversity, and agricultural outputs under different nutrient and management regimes.
  - Be mindful of sampling gaps (subset subplots) and block-specific anomalies when performing cross-block comparisons.
  - Data can be cross-referenced with climate records and ECN frameworks to study soil–vegetation–climate interactions over time.

- Data deliverables and accessibility
  - Substantial, multi-dimensional dataset: vegetation and soil data by block, plot, horizon, and subplot; archived samples for long-term preservation.
  - Appendices and cross-referenced tables (Appendix A) facilitate integrated analyses across vegetation and soil datasets.
  - ECOTRON data provide complementary controlled-environment context for targeted analyses.
