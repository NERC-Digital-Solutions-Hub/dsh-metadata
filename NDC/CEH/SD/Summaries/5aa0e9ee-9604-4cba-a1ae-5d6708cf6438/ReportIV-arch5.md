# SUMMARY

- Context and Aims for Data Stewards
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on above-ground biomass (productivity), species composition, and diversity at Sourhope.
  - The study links above- and below-ground biodiversity, with a botanical monitoring component complemented by 16 Phase I projects and ongoing Phase II activity.
  - Data stewardship goals include robust governance for multi-year, multi-factor experiments, ensuring datasets are usable, up-to-date, and discoverable.

- Study Design and Data Structure
  - Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, Scottish Borders; 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient.
  - Plots and treatments: Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells delineate allocation to different research groups.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime (N&L), Insecticide (formerly Biocide); plot-level management includes mowing site-wide, insecticide application, and spring nutrient amendments.
  - Site management chronology: Mowing monthly May–September to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing in certain plots; nutrients added in spring for designated plots.
  - Data collection timeline: Regular data since 1998 baseline; annual biomass sampling from randomized 0.5 m^2 cells; baseline vegetation survey in 1998; ongoing point analysis surveys in 2000–2002; soil sampling for pH since 1998; soil moisture measured in 2002; weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002).
  - Scope and volume: 11,621 soil samples collected since project start; extensive vegetation and bryophyte inventories; multiple appendices with species lists and site activity.

- Data Collected and Metrics
  - Above-ground productivity: Biomass harvested five times per summer (1999–2002) from 0.5 m^2 cells; results show a general long-term rise in biomass across treatments, with nitrogen and lime combinations yielding the highest productivity.
  - Soil properties: Soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth; liming raises pH toward ~7.0 in lime-treated plots; nitrogen also raises pH modestly.
  - Soil moisture: Measured in 2002; higher moisture correlates with lower pH.
  - Plant diversity and composition: Point Analysis (100-hole grid) across years; bryophytes (mosses) increasingly abundant, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus; Botany data include species frequency, biomass, and a longitudinal comparison of dominant taxa (Agrostis spp., Festuca spp., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, etc.).
  - Functional groups: Plants categorized into stress tolerators (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR; shifts observed with treatments, notably expansion of C-S-R in N+L plots and persistence of stress-tolerant species in unimproved plots.
  - Diversity indices: Shannon Diversity Index calculated across baseline (1998) and subsequent years; 2002 indices show treatment-dependent changes, with notable declines in N&L plots relative to improvements in insecticide-treated plots.
  - Multivariate analyses: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of 2002 point analysis data demonstrates clear separation between improved and unimproved plots; species loadings identify groups such as Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, and Trifolium repens as indicators of fertile conditions, contrasted withFestuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp. in less fertile plots.

- Key Findings and Trends (2002 and longer-term)
  - Mowing effect: Reduction in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments, suggesting a site-level mowing impact; Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertile plots with lime or nitrogen; bryophyte expansion (mosses) linked to reduced disturbance and mowing height (~6 cm).
  - Fertilisation effect: Nitrogen (and lime) enhances productivity; combined N+L yields the strongest biomass growth, though potential saturation/soil moisture limitations and near-neutral pH in some plots may constrain further gains.
  - Soil–productivity relationships: Positive associations between higher soil pH and biomass in lime- or nitrogen-treated plots; moisture can modulate this relationship; exceptionally high pH with lime may reduce productivity if moisture is limiting.
  - Insecticide effect: Possible link between reduced herbivory and increased diversity, though definitive causation is not established; observed shifts suggest benefits to certain palatable species under particular nutrient/soil conditions.
  - Trampling effect: 2002 biomass decline in C2 plots largely attributable to trampling during 13CO2 labelling pulses, highlighting how experimental handling can influence productivity measurements.
  - Biodiversity dynamics: Bryophyte hits rise across the site, especially in unimproved plots; domain shifts in dominant vascular species reflect treatment-related fertility and disturbance regimes; overall diversity trends show treatment-dependent patterns over time.

- Data Quality, Metadata, and Access
  - Baseline and longitudinal data: A 1998 baseline exists for vegetation; ongoing surveys in 2000–2002 with standardized 0.5 m^2 sampling cells and a consistent measurement regime.
  - Taxonomic updates: Bryophyte identifications were expanded to species level in 2002, affecting comparability with earlier years; species lists are documented (Appendix 3).
  - Data gaps and issues: 2002 weather data gaps due to a station malfunction (summer and autumn periods); occasional substitutions from Konza station data for missing periods; documented in Appendix 5.
  - Data availability: Full details and datasets available via the Soil Biodiversity website (http://www.nerc-merlewood.ac.uk/soilbio/index.html) or from CEH, Grange-over-Sands; appendices include: site activity, weather, biomass by plot, rank analyses, bryophyte and vascular lists, and PCA results.
  - Data organization: Treatments, blocks, plots, sub-plots, and cell-level sampling well-documented; Appendix 1 provides a map of treatments; Appendix 2 lists treatment application dates and rates; Appendix 6–8 summarize biomass and species-level data across years.

- Governance, Challenges, and Recommendations for Data Stewards
  - Challenges highlighted for data management:
    - Incomplete capture of user needs and priorities at different project scales.
    - Timely collection and transfer of data from diverse researchers and plots.
    - Harmonizing data across many systems, plots, and formats (e.g., plant taxa, functional groups, bryophyte taxonomy).
    - Handling large, multi-year datasets with evolving methodologies (e.g., changing bryophyte identification, differential mowing schedules).
    - Managing data integrity when site conditions (e.g., trampling during experiments) influence measurements.
    - Data gaps due to instrument failures and the need for data imputation or cross-site substitutions.
  - Governance implications:
    - Maintain rigorous, linked metadata for treatments, blocks, plots, and cells to enable reproducibility and cross-study integration.
    - Preserve a stable taxonomic reference list and document taxonomic updates (e.g., bryophyte species attributions) to support longitudinal analyses.
    - Ensure clear versioning and provenance for data collected by multiple projects and researchers.
    - Provide documentation on data collection protocols (timing, mowing, sampling methods) and any deviations over time.
    - Establish data access pathways and ensure availability of Appendices and raw data (biomass, soil chemistry, point analysis, PCA outputs) for secondary analyses.
    - Log and communicate any data quality issues (e.g., weather station outages) and decisions about data substitution or interpolation.
  - Recommendations for future data stewardship:
    - Create consolidated metadata schemas that align with multi-project, long-term biodiversity studies.
    - Develop a centralized data dictionary mapping plot-level treatments to corresponding data fields (biomass, pH, moisture, diversity indices).
    - Archive taxonomic changes with notes on year-specific revisions and their impact on longitudinal analyses.
    - Ensure accessibility of key datasets ( biomass by year, site-level pH/moisture, point analysis results) through a stable data portal and via CEH contacts.

    - 2002 data include a documented mismatch due to weather station malfunction; some dates were supplemented with external station data.

- Overall Implications for Data Stewardship
  - The Sourhope dataset provides a rich, multi-year, multifactor dataset on plant productivity, biodiversity, and soil–plant interactions under controlled management regimes.
  - It demonstrates the importance of detailed metadata, consistent sampling designs, taxonomic updates, and transparent handling of data gaps for long-term ecological data.
  - For data stewards, the key priorities are robust metadata, standardized treatment-to-data mappings, clear provenance, and accessible documentation to enable reuse by diverse user groups across the Soil Biodiversity Programme and beyond.
