# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Describes soil profiles and related soil-chemistry and vegetation data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, plus ECOTRON plots.
- Includes horizon-by-horizon descriptions, auger samples, lab analyses (nutrients, C/N, pH, moisture, LOI), and vegetation surveys by plot/subplot.
- Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite; soil subgroups: Brown forest soil with gleying; site context includes coordinates, altitude, slope, drainage, and block design.
- Data are linked to MLURI barcodes for samples and are part of a long-term soil-vegetation dataset with potential cross-site integration (ECN/SERAD Micronet context).

## Data collected and structure
- Horizon-level soil profiles (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5):
  - BLOCK 4 horizons and depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–4 cm; H 4–8 cm; Ah 8–29 cm; Abg 29–40 cm; Bsg 40–61 cm; Cgx 61–95 cm.
  - BLOCK 5 horizons and depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–5 cm; H 5–7 cm; Ah 7–25 cm; AB 25–35 cm; Bg 35–49 cm; BCg 49–70 cm; Cg 70–100 cm.
  - Descriptions emphasize fibrous roots, texture (often sandy to clay loams), mottling, boundary sharpness, and presence of igneous stones (andesite).
- Chemical and physical analyses per horizon (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5):
  - %N, %C, C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; pH (H2O and CaCl2); moisture and organic matter indicators.
  - BLOCK 4 includes detailed values across horizons for major cations, nutrient indicators, and soil strength/structure observations.
  - BLOCK 5 includes similar horizon-level data with additional BCg/Bg horizons showing clear mottling and clay/loam transitions.
- Auger samples (AUGER SAMPLES):
  - For each sub-sample (e.g., 4A–4F; 5A–5F): weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Vegetation data:
  - Species totals and counts by plot/subplot for BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, including presence/absence and totals per subplot.
  - ECOTRON PLOT vegetation survey data also included.
- Site details and context:
  - BLOCK 5 site details include grid reference NT8544019520, altitude 315 m, slope 5°, imperfect drainage, and soil series (SH 74714 Sourhope, Bellshill); major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; dominant rock type: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- Archiving and provenance:
  - MLURI barcodes assigned to horizons and auger samples; data linked to ECN and SERAD Micronet contexts; samples archived for long-term storage.

## Sampling methods and treatments
- Horizons and depth sampling:
  - Systematic horizon description and sampling per block with specific depths for each horizon (0–100 cm range in BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5).
  - Auger sampling conducted across blocks with multiple sub-samples per horizon; detailed chemical data collected per horizon and per auger sample.
- Vegetation sampling:
  - Subplots sampled within plots (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, etc.) with presence/absence and counts of plant species; species totals reported per plot/subplot.
- Experimental context:
  - SITE DESIGN includes historic data from Sourhope with multi-block replication and horizon-specific measurements; soil management history includes grazing/mowing patterns and presence of stones in parent horizons.

## Data management and metadata
- Organization and identifiers:
  - Data structured by block, plot, and horizon; each sample and horizon linked with MLURI barcode; accompanying metadata includes depth, horizon name, description, and lab analyses.
- Descriptive metadata:
  - Site details, horizon descriptions, and horizon-specific measurements provided to support reproducibility and cross-site analyses.
- Documentation and analysis:
  - Data prepared to support long-term biodiversity and ecosystem studies; compatible with ECN/Micronet data sharing and cross-site meta-analyses.

## Data quality and limitations
- Coverage and completeness:
  - Some subplots and horizons have missing data fields (e.g., Na values); dataset contains both detailed horizon data and auger sample data with occasional gaps.
  - Block-level variability observed; some horizons show strong mottling, redox features, and variable structure.
- Interpretational caveats:
  - Horizon descriptions include a mix of field notes and lab results; some blocks (e.g., with complex lithology or abundant igneous stones) require careful interpretation when aggregating across horizons or plots.
- Temporal scope:
  - Data reflect baseline to early follow-up stages; long-term trends intended to be explored through subsequent analyses.

## Archiving, storage, and access
- Archiving:
  - Horizon and auger samples catalogued with MLURI barcodes; physical samples stored for long-term preservation.
- Access and sharing:
  - Data linked to ECN and Micronet programs; baseline and horizon-level datasets prepared to enable reuse, integration, and meta-analyses across sites.

## Governance considerations for Data Stewards
- Metadata completeness and standardization:
  - Maintain consistent naming for horizons, plots, and subplots; harmonize measurement units and horizon nomenclature across blocks.
- Data provenance and lineage:
  - Capture sampling dates, lab methods, barcode mappings, and depth/description changes to ensure traceability.
- Data quality management:
  - Document data gaps, block-specific anomalies, and data cleaning/normalization steps; flag horizon-level uncertainties.
- Data sharing and collaboration:
  - Align with ECN and Micronet policies; apply clear licenses and note any embargo periods; enable cross-site comparability via harmonized variable definitions.
- Data preservation:
  - Preserve archived soil samples and digital records; ensure ongoing accessibility of horizon descriptions, lab results, and associated vegetation data.

## Practical takeaways for data stewards
- The dataset offers rich, multi-layered soil and vegetation data across replicated blocks with horizon-level chemistry, auger samples, and species inventories.
- Ensure robust metadata (sample IDs, block/plot/horizon details, depth, treatment, units) and maintain archive samples for future re-analysis.
- Document data limitations (partial subplot sampling, missing values, horizon-specific anomalies) and guide users on appropriate interpretation and use.
- Leverage ECN/Micronet context to enable integration with other long-term soil biodiversity datasets and facilitate cross-site comparative analyses.
