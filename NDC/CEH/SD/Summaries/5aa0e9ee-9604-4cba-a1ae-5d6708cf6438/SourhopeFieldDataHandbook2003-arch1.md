# Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003

## Aim and scope
- Document the Sourhope Soil Biodiversity Field Site and its long-term experiments designed to study relationships between soil biodiversity, vegetation, and soil processes under controlled perturbations.
- Combine multi-site field measurements with long-term data to inform understanding of environmental change and ecosystem function.
- Emphasize data collection, sampling methods, analyses, and the creation of reusable datasets with metadata.

## Site context and experimental framework
- Location: Sourhope Experimental Farm, Bowmont valley, near Kelso, Scotland; upland, humid climate with altitude range across fields.
- Geology and soils: Underlain by andesitic lavas (Old Red Sandstone) with soil suites ranging from acid brown forest soils to gleys and podzols; notable blocks show block-level variability in soil chemistry.
- Land use: Predominantly grassland with moors and conifer plantations; managed grazing programs and breeding programs in place; on-site laboratories and facilities support research.
- Experimental design (overall): Long-term, multi-block field experiment with structured blocks, plots, and subplots; six main treatments randomized within blocks; grazing and mammalian access controlled; treatments implemented as perturbations rather than direct land-management simulations.
- Treatments: 
  1) Control (untreated) 
  2) Lime (applied annually)
  3) Nitrogen (NH4NO3 applied biannually)
  4) Lime & Nitrogen (combination)
  5) Biocide (disruption of biological activity)
  6) Fallow (no plant cover; initially included but retained as additional controls)
- Vegetation and management: Regular mowing and simulated grazing in plots; grazing history tracked; mammal-proof fencing used during experiments.

## Data collection and sampling methods
- Vegetation sampling:
  - 50 x 50 cm point quadrats, across five of the fifteen subplots per main plot.
  - 25 points per quadrat; presence/absence (with potential abundance estimates) recorded.
  - Sampling started in mid-1990s with ongoing data management and analyses referenced in appendices.
- Soil sampling and analysis:
  - August 1998: 30 x 0–30 cm auger cores per plot in a W-pattern; soil pits at pathways above each block for horizon descriptions.
  - Sample handling: portions analyzed immediately; archival storage at -80°C (CEH Merlewood).
  - Depth horizons intensively described (Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx, etc.) with detailed textural and colour descriptors.
- Measured soil variables:
  - Physical/chemical: %N, %C, C:N ratio; exchangeable Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition (LOI); pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2); horizon depth data.
  - Soil profiles and horizon descriptions across blocks show heterogeneity in texture, structure, and mottling.
- Data handling and analysis:
  - Correlation and regression analyses to explore relationships among soil variables.
  - Block and column effects accounted for; data used to classify soil properties and intra-/inter-block variability.
  - Datasets organized with horizon-level and plot-level metadata; datasets intended to be discoverable with metadata in portals.

## Block 4 and Block 5 profiles (selected details)
- Block 4 (Rigg Foot, Sourhope):
  - Profiles include horizons LF (0–1 cm) to Cgx (61–95 cm) with detailed soil descriptions (fibrous, moist to friable textures; abundant fine roots; presence of andesite stones).
  - Analytical results (selected): FH ~1–4 cm; Ah 8–29 cm; AB 29–40 cm; Bs 40–61 cm; Cx 61–95 cm; notable values in FN horizons show high LOI (up to 73–77 in some FH/A horizons); pH H2O around 4.7–4.9; Ca, Mg, K, and other cations variable by horizon and block.
  - Key pattern: acidic surface horizons with high organic matter content and significant horizon differentiation; block-level differences in exchangeable cations and pH reflect spatial heterogeneity.
- Block 5 (Rigg Foot, Sourhope):
  - Profiles extend from LF (0–1 cm) to Cg (70–100 cm) with horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; and high variability in texture and mottling.
  - Analytical results (selected): FH to Ah horizons show %N 0.65–2.17 and %C up to ~33–34%; C:N ratios generally in mid-teens; Ca values in FH and upper horizons frequently high; pH H2O ~4.5–5.2; CaCl2 generally ~3.6–4.1; LOI values notable in upper horizons (tending to high in FH). Depth intervals show pronounced horizon development and mottling across BCg and Cg horizons.
  - Key pattern: stronger horizon differentiation with notable Ca variation and mottling; deeper horizons retain substantial mineral content and variable pH.
- Auger and horizon datasets (Block 4 and Block 5 augers):
  - Depth-structured data provide %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, LOI, pH, etc., across multiple mini-samples within horizons.
  - Across auger samples, correlations observed among %N, %C, LOI, C:N, and exchangeable cations, consistent with patterns seen in profile descriptions.

## Vegetation survey: community patterns
- Dominant taxa and community structure:
  - Dominant grasses and forbs include Agrostis capillaris (Acp), Festuca rubra (Fr), Nardus stricta (Ns), Anthoxanthum odoratum (Ao); Poa pratensis (Pp), Trifolium repens (Tr) also common.
  - NVC classification identifies the site as U4d—Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile grassland with Luzula multiflora-Rhytidiadelphus loreus subcommunity; occasional U5b (Nardus stricta-Galium saxatile) in moister, higher-slope microhabitats.
- Multivariate insights:
  - Four major community groups emerge with indicator species such as Deschampsia flexuosa and Deschampsia cespitosa.
  - Edge plots tend to host D. flexuosa and Holcus mollis; interior-edge distribution patterns observed.
- Bryophyte and vascular patterns:
  - Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus dominates bryophyte components; co-occurrence patterns for Poa pratensis, Galium saxatile, Potentilla erecta, Trifolium repens documented.
  - Localized patterns for Luzula multiflora and Carex binervis noted.

## Ecotron and site-level data
- Ecotron soil site:
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT): Wt ~6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100 g; Mg 1.7 meq/100 g; pH H2O ~4.79; pH CaCl2 ~3.82.
- Ecotron vegetation survey:
  - Subplots show varying species counts across plots and subplots, providing a habitat-scale view of plant community composition and diversity.

## Data use, management, and implications
- Purpose: enable analysis of how soil biodiversity and plant communities respond to perturbations (lime, nitrogen, biocide, and combinations) within upland grassland ecosystems.
- Key analytical aims:
  - Identify dominant vegetation communities and their associations with soil properties.
  - Quantify relationships among soil nutrients, moisture, organic matter, and pH across blocks and horizons.
  - Develop models linking soil microbial-plant interactions to ecosystem function and potential land-management outcomes.
- Data accessibility and reuse:
  - Datasets are structured for cross-block comparison, horizon-level and plot-level analyses, and long-term reuse.
  - Appendices and site data provide block-by-block soil/vegetation details to support replication and re-analysis.

## End-state and broader context
- Sourhope aims to illuminate how soil biodiversity and plant communities respond to controlled perturbations within upland grasslands, informing land-management policies and contributing to long-term environmental change understanding through well-documented, reusable datasets.
