# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- The provided text presents detailed, block-level soil and vegetation data for Rigg Foot, Sourhope, focusing on BLOCKS 4 and 5, with supplementary ECOTRON data.
- Data types include full soil profiles, auger samples, soil chemistry and physical properties, vegetation surveys, and site metadata.
- Data are recorded with standardized identifiers (MLURI barcodes), at multiple spatial scales (site, block, plot, subplot) and depths, enabling longitudinal analyses and cross-site comparisons within broader networks.

## Key data assets and structure

- Site and block metadata
  - Location identifiers (grid reference NT8544019520 for Block 5; general Sourhope site context), altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, and parent material.
- Soil profile data (per block)
  - Depths and horizons (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg/BCg, Cg), with detailed color descriptions, texture, structure, moisture, roots, and boundary characteristics.
  - Block-specific horizon nomenclature and boundary notes (e.g., LF 0-1 cm; FH 1-5 cm; Ah 7-25 cm in Block 5; etc.).
- Soil analysis and chemistry
  - Per horizon: weight, %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Auger samples: analogous chemical properties (A–F sub-samples per plot), including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture metrics, LOI, and pH measures.
- Vegetation surveys
  - Plot- and subplot-level species presence/absence and totals, with notable indicator species and community patterns described for each plot.
- Ecotron and ancillary data
  - ECOTRON PLOT data include soil analysis, vegetation inventories, and related measurements for controlled-environment experimentation.
- Temporal and archival context
  - Data designed for longitudinal analyses, with baseline and subsequent sampling plans; samples archived for long-term storage; integration into wider networks (ECN, SERAD).

## Measurements and variables captured

- Soil profile characteristics
  - Depths and horizon delineations; color and mottling; texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam); structure (blocky, granular, platy); root presence; boundary clarity.
- Soil chemical and physical properties
  - Nitrogen and carbon content (%N, %C), carbon-to-nitrogen ratios, cation contents (Ca, Mg, K, Na), moisture-related metrics, LOI, pH in water and CaCl2.
- Auger sample analyses
  - Same chemical suite as horizon samples, aligned to specific auger depths; supports finer-scale comparisons within plots.
- Vegetation data
  - Species inventories, plot-level totals, and subplot-level occurrences, enabling vegetation classifications (e.g., NVC-associated grassland types) and indicator-species analyses.
- Data provenance
  - Each sample tied to a barcode, horizon depth, and plot/block, ensuring traceability and reproducibility.

## Data quality, coverage, and challenges

- Coverage and sampling
  - Variable sampling across blocks and horizons; some subplots have missing data or irregular coverage, requiring cautious interpretation for site-wide summaries.
- Anomalies and heterogeneity
  - Notable block-to-block variance in soil parameters; some horizons show unusual readings (e.g., anomalous moisture loss, LOI, pH), underscoring spatial heterogeneity and the need for robust spatial-statistical handling.
- Metadata and standardization needs
  - Consistent horizon naming, depth intervals, and unit conventions are essential for cross-block integration and long-term comparability.
- Data integration
  - Integrating soil and vegetation datasets across blocks, plots, and subplots poses challenges for meta-analysis and cross-site synthesis, despite a strong multi-layer design.

## Data governance, accessibility, and archival

- Data provenance and networks
  - Data generated under ECN and SERAD frameworks; cross-site relevance supports broader biodiversity and soil-plant interaction studies.
- Archival and reuse
  - Long-term sample archiving (e.g., soil samples) and machine-readable data (barcodes, horizon-specific data) facilitate future analyses and method replication.
- Accessibility and outputs
  - Detailed block- and plot-level tables, horizon-specific datasets, and appendix-style data compilations (e.g., Appendix A) support replication, re-use, and comparative studies.

## Implications and opportunities for Data Leaders

- Longitudinal value
  - Rich, multi-scale, time-series data enabling analysis of soil-vegetation dynamics, upland grassland responses, and biodiversity patterns over time.
- Cross-site synthesis potential
  - Alignment with ECN and SERAD networks enables cross-site comparisons and policy-relevant insights on soil-plant interactions.
- Data strategy opportunities
  - Develop centralized, machine-actionable data repositories with standardized metadata schemas, horizon nomenclature, and depth intervals.
  - Implement consistent data governance: metadata templates, data quality checks, and clear documentation of sampling protocols.
  - Facilitate data portals for researchers and policymakers to access block- and plot-level soil and vegetation datasets, with provenance and versioning.
- Practical recommendations
  - Harmonize horizon naming conventions and unit reporting; document sampling densities and coverage per block.
  - Integrate soil and vegetation datasets through a common data model to support meta-analyses and cross-block syntheses.
  - Maintain robust archival practices (e.g., horizon-level archives, sample storage metadata) to ensure future comparability and re-analysis.

## Endnotes: data access and documentation signals

- Block-level and ECOTRON datasets include detailed soil profiles, auger sample analyses, and vegetation inventories with explicit horizon descriptions and chemical properties.
- The data structure supports replication, longitudinal analysis, and networked collaboration within the Sourhope site and broader environmental-change research programs.
