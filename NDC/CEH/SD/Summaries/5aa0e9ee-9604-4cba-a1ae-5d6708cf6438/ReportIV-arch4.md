# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Primary aims: understand soil biodiversity and the functional roles of soil organisms, linking below-ground processes with above-ground plant communities.
  - Experiment combines 24 Phase I and Phase II projects, with botanical monitoring of above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity, in addition to extensive soil and microfauna work.

- Site design, management, and data collection (Methods)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots randomized, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; research groups assigned to sub-plots using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2 (no treatments applied), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA).
  - Site-level management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied after mowing; spring application of nitrogen and/or lime in designated plots.
  - Data collection (since 1998–1999 onward):
    - Above-ground biomass: clippings from random 0.5 m^2 cells, dried and weighed, collected across five summer cuts each year.
    - Baseline vegetation survey (1998) and recurring Point Analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m^2 cells with 100-point grid to record species at each point.
    - Soil measurements: soil pH (5 cm depth), soil moisture (theta probe in 2002), weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999 onward).
    - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
  - Data footprint: extensive Appendix data including site map, treatment summaries, species lists, weather data, biomass records, and point analysis results.

- Key findings (Results)
  - Biomass productivity
    - Overall long-term increase in above-ground biomass across all treatments from 1999 to 2002, with nitrogen and lime (N+L) plots showing the strongest productivity.
    - 2002 saw a general drop in biomass across most treatments relative to 2001; Control 2 plots showed the largest decline (≈13.7% to 31.2% depending on comparison), with block-position effects (down-slope vs. upslope) influencing productivity.
    - The most productive plots remained those receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 consistently less productive than Control 1 across years.
  - Soil chemistry and productivity
    - Lime dramatically increased soil pH to near 7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
    - Positive, strong relationship between higher soil pH and biomass when considering all treatments, though the relationship varied by treatment (positive for some, mixed or negative when both N and Lime were applied).
    - Higher soil pH coupled with lower soil moisture in lime- and nitrogen-enhanced plots suggests potential moisture-limited growth under certain conditions.
  - Plant community composition and functional groups
    - Mowing (site-level disturbance reduction) favored stress-tolerant and competitive-stress tolerant (C-S-R and SR/C-S-R) species, with Festuca rubra expanding notably in more fertile plots.
    - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by about 40% since 2000 across treatments, suggesting mowing-induced selective pressures or other site-level factors.
    - Bryophytes expanded across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus increasing in hits; bryophyte contribution to total hits grew from 10.8% (2001) to 19.9% (2002), especially in unimproved plots.
    - Point Analysis and PCA revealed clear separation between improved (fertilized) and unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct group, with nitrogen-treated samples sometimes clustering toward limed plots.
    - Shannon Diversity Index: diversity declined in 2002 for nitrogen + lime plots (≈15% drop versus baseline), while other treatments showed increases, notably insecticide-treated plots.
    - Functional groups (S = stress tolerant, CSR = competitive-stress tolerant, SR/CSR = stress-ruderal/competitive-stress-ruderal)
      - By 2002, a majority of live vascular plant hits fell into SR/CSR groups, with C-S-R species expanding in N+L plots and stress-tolerant species expanding in unimproved plots.
      - Across years, significant treatment effects on the relative abundance of functional groups emerged, particularly for SR/CSR and CSR cohorts.
  - Insecticide effects
    - The insecticide (Dursban) treatment showed patterns suggesting herbivore pressure influences on plant diversity and composition, but direct causal links to diversity metrics are not definitively established due to data limitations and complexity of plant–insect interactions.
  - Trampling and plot-specific effects
    - C2 plots (introduced in 2002) experienced rapid productivity declines likely due to trampling during intense sampling and 13CO2 pulse experiments, illustrating how specific experimental activities can transiently affect productivity.

- Data quality, limitations, and context for interpretation
  - 2002 data gaps due to weather station malfunction (late July–November period); adjacent station data were substituted for missing periods.
  - Site access restrictions and foot-and-mouth disease in the early 2000s impacted site activity and data collection cadence.
  - Detailed appendices provide comprehensive data per plot, block, treatment, and year, enabling reanalysis and cross-project synthesis.

- Implications for data leadership and data strategy
  - Demonstrates the value of a long-term, multi-dimensional data system to track productivity, diversity, and functional traits across interacting treatments and management practices.
  - Highlights the importance of standardized metadata, clear documentation (Appendices with treatment regimes, species lists, and measurement protocols), and data provenance to enable cross-project reuse.
  - Reveals the need for robust data quality controls and contingency planning for data gaps (e.g., weather station failures) and external disruptions (e.g., disease outbreaks).
  - Underlines the benefit of integrating above-ground and below-ground data streams (biomass, soil chemistry, moisture, and biodiversity surveys) to interpret ecosystem responses to management interventions.

- Endnotes and references
  - Includes a comprehensive list of foundational literature on plant functional types, grazing, insect–plant interactions, and biodiversity in grassland ecosystems.
  - Appendices document site activity, species lists (including bryophytes), and the detailed results tables and figures underpinning the analyses.
