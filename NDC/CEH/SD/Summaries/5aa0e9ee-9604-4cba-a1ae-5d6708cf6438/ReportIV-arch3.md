# SUMMARY

- Purpose and context
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, focusing on linking soil biodiversity research with above-ground plant productivity, diversity, and functional traits.
  - Main aim: understand how above- and below-ground components respond to management and to identify monitoring measures relevant for policy evaluation and future decisions.

- Experimental design and site management
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; within each block, 6 main plots with randomised treatments; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots with a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell for group allocation.
  - Treatments (applied annually since 1999):
    - Control 1 and Control 2 (no treatments)
    - Nitrogen (N), Lime (CaCO3), and Nitrogen + Lime (N&L)
    - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA, applied after mowing)
  - Site management: universal mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept); insecticide applied post-mowing in insecticide plots; treatments applied in spring (N and/or lime). 
  - Data collection and activity: on-site weather station; biomass via regular 0.5 m2 sampling; baseline and repeated point- analysis surveys (July/August 1998, 2000–2002); periodic soil pH measurements; soil moisture measurements; additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass sorting.

- Data collection methods and analyses
  - Above-ground productivity: clipping and oven-drying to measure biomass per 0.5 m2 cell; five mowing seasons per year across plots.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998; annual point analysis using a 0.5 m2 cell with a 100-hole grid and a pin-down method; bryophyte and vascular plant identification; bryophytes quantified to species in 2002.
  - Soil and microclimate: soil pH at ~5 cm depth (0.1 M H2O); soil moisture with theta probe; Automatic Weather Station for rainfall, temperature, and radiation.
  - Data analyses: split-plot ANOVA (Treatment x Year), PCA on point-analysis data, calculation of Shannon Diversity Indices, analysis of functional group composition (CSR framework: Stress-tolerant S, Competitive-C, Ruderal-R and SR/C-S-R combinations).

- Key results and trends (2002 data and longer-term context)
  - Biomass productivity
    - A consistent hierarchy by treatment persists, with the strongest biomass in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; overall 2002 biomass declined relative to 2001 across most treatments (13.7% to 31.2% reductions, depending on treatment).
    - A slope-position effect: blocks lower on the slope showed greater declines in biomass.
    - Long-term trend (1999–2002): biomass has generally increased relative to the 1999 baseline, despite 2002 declines.
  - Fertilisation and soil chemistry
    - Lime has a strong, highly significant effect on increasing soil pH to around 7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
    - A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH (r ≈ -0.68); improved plots (lime/N) tend to be drier.
    - Across all plots, higher pH is positively correlated with above-ground productivity, though the relationship varies by treatment (positive when considering all plots; within N or lime alone positive; within N+L the relationship may be negative due to other interacting factors like moisture).
  - Plant community composition and functional types
    - Dominant species increasingly shift away from Agrostis capillaris/vinealis toward Festuca rubra, especially in fertile (N and/or Lime) plots.
    - Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis decline by over 40% since 2000, broadly across treatments, suggesting mowing and management uniformity may disadvantage these species.
    - Festuca ovina and Festuca rubra dynamics shift with fertility; Festuca rubra increases notably in improved plots.
    - Bryophyte abundance increases across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; bryophytes account for up to ~20% of total hits in 2002 (up from ~7–11% earlier years).
    - Point Analysis reveals treatment-associated shifts in the frequency of typical improved-pasture grasses (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra) vs unimproved pastures (Festuca ovina, Anthoxanthum odoratum).
  - Functional groups (CSR framework)
    - In 2002, C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups dominate most plots; nitrogen + lime plots show expansion of C-S-R species, suggesting faster-growing, competitive traits under increased soil fertility.
    - Stress-tolerant (S) species are particularly prevalent in unimproved plots; ruderal components decline with disturbance regimes altered by mowing and reduced grazing.
    - Among treatments, N&L plots show the strongest shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal combinations; lime-only and insecticide plots show different patterns, with SR/C-S-R components reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - While there is a suggestion that insecticide-treated plots may support higher diversity, the evidence is not definitive; complex plant–insect interactions complicate straightforward attribution.
  - Trampling effect
    - First-time sampling in C2 plots in 2002 indicates substantial productivity reductions likely due to trampling during intensive activity (e.g., 13CO2 pulse experiments), highlighting a confounding factor in productivity interpretation for these plots.
  - Diversity measures
    - Shannon Diversity Indices: 2002 shows a 15% decline in diversity for N&L plots relative to the 1998 baseline, while other treatments show increases (up to 29% in some insecticide plots). Overall, improved plots tend to be less diverse than unimproved ones in 2002, driven by dominance of fertilized, fast-growing species.
  - Multivariate patterns
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of the 2002 point-analysis data separates improved (fertilised and limed) plots from unimproved plots; some nitrogen-treated samples cluster with limed plots, indicating convergent vegetation characteristics under certain conditions.
  - Net site- and plot-level summaries
    - Bryophyte contribution to biomass has increased over time, particularly in unimproved plots.
    - The relative abundance of key grasses and bryophytes has shifted in response to mowing, disturbance, and fertility treatments.
    - A general pattern of increased productivity under fertilisation is tempered by potential moisture limitation and high pH in lime-treated plots.

- Data quality, accessibility, and governance implications (relevant to monitoring frameworks)
  - Data breadth and depth: long-running, multi-year dataset with weather, soil chemistry, biomass, and detailed plant community surveys; over 11,600 soil samples collected to date.
  - Metadata and provenance: rich metadata in appendices (treatment maps, species lists, sampling protocols), but some data gaps were encountered (e.g., 2002 weather station outage resulted in missing dates; substitute data from nearby stations used for certain periods).
  - Open data considerations: the programme emphasises data sharing and clear presentation of underlying data (necessary to meet data governance and openness standards at source).
  - Analytical approaches: robust use of ANOVA, PCA, and diversity indices; documentation of model structure (split-plot ANOVA) facilitates reproducibility and decision-making.
  - Barriers and challenges for monitoring
    - Data gaps and access timing
    - Silos between organisations
    - Public sharing requirements for datasets
    - Metadata adequacy and data transformation needs
    - Ensuring data governance, storage, and up-to-date practices
