Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

## Overview
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute), monitoring focused on above-ground biomass production, plant community composition, and diversity under five main site treatments.
- Five replicate blocks with randomised plot-level treatments; mowing conducted monthly May–Sept; nitrogen and/or lime added to designated plots; insecticide (Dursban 4) applied to insecticide plots.

## Site management and treatments
- Mowing: monthly cuts to ~6 cm height across the whole site (since 1999).
- Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied after mowing to insecticide plots.
- Fertility treatments: Nitrogen and/or Lime added in spring (annual rates documented in Appendix 2).
- Treatments:
  - Control 1 and Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen & Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (formerly Biocide plots)
- Data collection since 1999 includes above-ground biomass, climate data from on-site weather station, soil pH, soil moisture, and periodic point analysis/botanical surveys (e.g., 1998 baseline; 2000–2002 surveys).

## Key results: productivity and composition (2002)
- Above-ground biomass:
  - Overall productivity remained higher in fertilised plots; plots with both nitrogen and lime (N&L) were most productive.
  - 2002 showed a general drop in biomass across many treatments versus 2001; reductions ranged from 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2).
  - Slope position influenced productivity: Block 1 bottom of slope had larger gains in some years; Block 5 (upper) showed bigger decreases in 2002.
- Fertilisation effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increased productivity since 1999.
  - Lime raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in 2002; very high lime rates led to higher pH and potential moisture stress concerns.
  - Higher pH and lower moisture in lime- and nitrogen-treated plots may contribute to stress in dry periods and chlorosis symptoms.
- Mowing and plant community response:
  - Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000 across most treatments; likely a site-level response to mowing and uniform disturbance rather than a single treatment.
  - Festuca rubra expanded markedly, especially in lime- and nitrogen-containing plots, associated with higher productivity.
  - Bryophytes expanded broadly, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus rising across the site; mosses increased particularly in unimproved plots.
- Insecticide effects:
  - Shannon Diversity Index (plant diversity) highest in insecticide-treated plots; 2002 values suggest a possible link between reduced herbivory and increased diversity, though causality remains tentative.
  - Insecticide plots showed relatively lower frequency of bryophytes and shifts in certain grass/diversity patterns.
- Trampling (C2 plots):
  - The first year of C2 sampling (2002) coincided with intense 13CO2 pulses, likely suppressing vegetation growth and contributing to a notable drop in productivity relative to C1 plots.

## Functional groups and diversity (Point Analysis)
- Point Analysis (2000–2002) shows treatment-driven changes in species frequency:
  - Improved plots (N, Lime, N&L, Insecticide) dominated by grasses typical of improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) in higher proportions; Control and Insecticide plots showed lower representations of these species.
  - Unimproved plots (Control, Insecticide) retained more Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
- Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts):
  - Bryophyte hits increased over 2000–2002, with notable rise in unimproved plots; 2002 bryophyte hits reached 19.92% of total vs 10.82% in 2001 and 6.48% in 2000.
- Litter (dead vegetation) hits:
  - 2000: no significant differences between treatments; 2001–2002: higher litter hits in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting greater plant turnover or biomass accumulation in fertilised plots.
- Diversity (Shannon index):
  - Baseline: no differences; 2000–2002: significant treatment differences emerged, increasing in most treatments except Nitrogen & Lime, which showed a 15% decline relative to baseline by 2002.
- Functional groups (CSR framework; stress tolerators S, competitive-stress-ruderal CSR, and SR/CSR):
  - In 2000–2002, clear treatment differences emerged:
    - Nitrogen & Lime plots: C-S-R groups expanded, indicating broader competitive-stress tolerance in more fertile conditions.
    - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant (S) species became more prominent, consistent with lower nutrients and disturbance.
    - SR/CSR groups declined in lime-treated and insecticide plots, indicating shifts away from ruderal species in those environments.
  - By 2002, significant differences among treatments in CSR groups confirmed that N&L plots are more competitive-stress oriented, while unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant groups.

## Soil chemistry, moisture, and productivity relationships
- Soil pH:
  - Lime dramatically raised pH toward ~7.0 in upper soil layers; nitrogen also increased pH but to a lesser extent; untreated plots remained near baseline pH.
- Soil moisture and pH relationship:
  - Negative correlation between moisture content and pH (r = -0.68; n = 120).
- pH and productivity:
  - Strong positive link between soil pH and biomass when considering all plots; within individual treatments, the relationship varied:
    - Positive association overall, but reduced or inverted in plots with nitrogen or lime alone; strongest positive trend across all plots when pooled.
    - The relationship suggests that higher pH (lime) and adequate moisture support higher productivity, but extremely high pH or moisture stress can limit growth in some treatments (e.g., high lime with low moisture).
- Nutrient and pH interactions:
  - Fertilised plots (N, Lime, N&L) show complex interactions between pH, moisture, and productivity; high lime rates may reduce productivity under drier conditions due to moisture stress and chlorosis signals observed in 2002.

## Discussion highlights (interpretive insights)
- Mowing effect:
  - Consistent reduction of Agrostis capillaris/vineailis likely due to homogeneous mowing regime; Festuca rubra expands in fertile plots, mosses increase with regular mowing and absence of grazing; suggests disturbance regime strongly shapes community composition.
- Fertilisation effect:
  - Fertilisation boosts productivity, especially with combined N&L; however, very high lime application push pH near 7.0 and may reduce moisture, potentially depressing productivity in dry periods.
  - Functional shifts (C-S-R dominance in fertilised plots) reflect species using improved conditions to accelerate growth.
- Insecticide effect:
  - Insecticide plots show higher diversity in 2002, potentially linked to reduced herbivory allowing more palatable species to persist; however, evidence is not definitive and depends on insect control efficacy.
- Trampling effect:
  - 2002 C2 plot productivity decline linked to intensive activity around 13CO2 pulse experiments; trampling likely suppressed growth in several plots.

## Implications and takeaways for analysts
- Disturbance and nutrient regimes jointly shape productivity and plant functional structure; mowing reduces some fine grasses but promotes mosses and Festuca rubra in fertile zones.
- Fertilisation elevates productivity but can alter soil chemistry (pH, moisture) and shift community towards competitive species, potentially reducing diversity in fertile plots over time.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are observable but require cautious interpretation; potential benefits depend on interactions with plant traits and herbivory dynamics.
- The CSR framework is a useful lens to interpret shifts in functional composition under different treatments, highlighting how nutrient addition and disturbance drive dominance of C-S-R communities in fertile plots and S-dominated communities in unfertilised plots.
- Ongoing monitoring of soil moisture, pH, and bryophyte dynamics is important to anticipate long-term sustainability and biodiversity outcomes under sustained management regimes.
