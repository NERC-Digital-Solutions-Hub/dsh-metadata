REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Introduction
- Large field experiment at Sourhope, part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aimed to provide a broad monitoring context for detailed group studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Baseline data survey conducted in 1998; measurements designed to link with other datasets and standards.
- 2001 site management impacted by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change of site officer, but core management activities continued per the Site Management Plan.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near long-term average (839 mm in 2001; 1999–2001 showed variability around prior years).
- Total radiation similar to previous years; average soil moisture slightly higher; average temperatures slightly reduced.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear hierarchy among treatments with biomass peaking in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, attributed to changes in personnel and switch from manual to mechanical cutting.
- Biomass normalised against the C1 treatment to compare treatment effects.
- ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass indicates:
  - Significant differences between improved (N and/or Lime) vs non-improved plots.
  - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
  - No significant block effects.
- Nitrogen and Lime (N and/or N+L) generally most effective at increasing biomass; Lime and Nitrogen+Lime often yield higher productivity than controls or Biocide.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime addition continued to raise topsoil pH (0–5 cm) to:
  - ~6.19 in limed plots.
  - ~6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime (N&L) plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but less than lime-containing treatments.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- July 2001 Point Quadrat survey replicated 2000 protocol; high inter-surveyor consistency.
- 2001 saw 58% more plant hits than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (possibly from reduced grazing since 1998).
- Clear treatment differences in dominant species:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide or N&L plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more prevalent in fertilised plots, especially with both Nitrogen and Lime.
  - Species typical of poorer pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Species counts: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting possible reduction in diversity with higher fertility.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) shows:
  - Clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
  - Unimproved plots tend toward dominance by bryophytes and lower-diversity assemblages; improved plots show greater presence of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, etc.
- Relative species abundance in relation to biomass:
  - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass.
  - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tend to decline as biomass increases.
- Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity noted: columns E and F (slope-facing) more acidic than other columns, a pattern amplified by treatment distribution (many controls/biocide in those columns).
- Underlying spatial differences likely contribute to pH variation within N&L-treated columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation Biomass
- Some plots consistently low in biomass (outliers), while several central plots show higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
- Positive correlation observed between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant differences in biomass across blocks (statistical ANOVA results).

## Data Collection and Management (Overview)
- Monitoring schedule included soil sampling, biomass harvesting, pH measurements, and botanical surveys (Point Quadrat method).
- Weather data collected via an Automatic Weather Station and shared with the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager.
- Site activity and management documented, including adjustments due to 2001 FMD restrictions and a change in site management.

## Endnotes
- Species codes and figures illustrating biomass trends, pH changes, PCA results, and species abundance provide detailed links between treatments, soil chemistry, and vegetation responses.
- Overall, the data support the value of standardized, long-term monitoring to assess how nutrient inputs and liming influence biomass production, soil chemistry, and plant community composition, while highlighting spatial heterogeneity within experimental sites.
