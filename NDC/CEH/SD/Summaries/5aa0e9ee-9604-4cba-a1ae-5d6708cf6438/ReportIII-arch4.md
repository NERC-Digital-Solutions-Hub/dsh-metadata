# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; field experiment at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
- Aimed to provide context for detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons; Baseline Data Survey completed in 1998.
- Monitoring across years 1999–2001 with protocols documented to facilitate interpretation and data sharing among research groups.
- 2001 management and data collection were affected by external events (FMD restrictions) and staff changes, but core management activities continued.

## Data Collected and Methods
- Weather data: Automatic Weather Station tracked at Sourhope; headline measures compiled 1999–2001 (rainfall, radiation, temperature, soil moisture).
- Above-ground biomass: Regular summer biomass measurements across plots with five mowing dates per year; data normalized to a reference plot (C1) for year-to-year comparisons; ANOVA used to test treatment effects and year interactions.
- Soil pH: Surface soil (top 5 cm) pH measured; lime generally raised pH; nitrogen additions also increased pH modestly; controls near baseline since 1998.
- Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys conducted in July 2001 (and 2000 for comparison); species identified and quantified via “hits” per species; PCA used to explore community differences by treatment.
- Site activity and data schedule: Detailed 1998–2001 activity schedule (Table 2) and data collection dates (Table 1) documented; field methods included mowing, clippings, oven-drying, and 0.5 m2 sampling cells with a 100-cell point frame for plant surveys.
- Species codes and data handling: Extensive species coding and supplementary figures/tables (e.g., Fig 1–Fig 9, Tables 3–6) to support cross-year comparisons and analyses.

## Key Findings
- Weather and growing conditions:
  - 2001 rainfall near long-term average; radiation similar; slightly cooler temperatures and higher soil moisture relative to previous year.
- Biomass responses:
  - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass; peak production in July/August each year.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 2000, likely due to staff/technique changes (shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears); normalization to C1 used to compare treatments across years.
  - Nitrogen and/or lime additions consistently promoted biomass; ANOVA shows significant differences between improved vs unimproved plots and notable year-by-treatment interactions.
- Soil chemistry (pH):
  - Lime applications raised surface pH; October 2001 averages: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38; nitrogen alone also raised pH but less than lime.
  - Control plots remained near baseline values since 1998.
- Plant community composition:
  - 24 species identified in unimproved plots vs 18 in improved plots, suggesting a slight decrease in diversity with nutrient/enhancement treatments.
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments in 2001; Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased and were more prominent in fertilized plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more abundant in N- and/or lime-treated plots.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - PCA generally separates fertilized/limed plots from control/biocide plots; biomass positively correlates with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while certain other species (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes) decline as biomass increases.
- Relationship between biomass and soil/vegetation:
  - Positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - Higher biomass in centrally located plots; some outliers with low biomass correspond to edge plots or heterogeneous conditions.
  - Greater litter presence linked to higher fertility (N and/or lime) and turnover.

## Site Heterogeneity and Implications
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: Columns E and F at the site showed comparatively more acidic plots, influencing local plant communities.
- Biomass distribution varied by location, with central plots generally exhibiting higher biomass.
- Strong pH–biomass relationship underlines the importance of soil chemistry as a driver of productivity and community composition.
- These heterogeneities highlight the need for careful strata-aware analyses and robust metadata to interpret treatment effects across a spatially variable field site.

## Data Quality, Access and Management
- Data quality checks included cross-survey reliability; 2001 Point Quadrat results showed no significant difference between surveyors.
- Weather data were regularly downloaded and transmitted to the MLURI data manager, ensuring centralized data governance.
- Documentation and metadata accompany the dataset (treatment codes, plot identifiers, and species codes) to support discoverability and cross-study collaboration.

## Challenges and Management Changes
- Management disruptions in 2001 due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site access from February to May; operations continued under controlled protocols.
- Change of Officer in Charge in May 2001; ongoing adherence to a Site Management Plan, with adjustments to timings (e.g., first biocide application delayed) to accommodate restrictions.
- Despite disruptions, core measurements (liming, nitrogen, pH assessments, biomass collections) largely proceeded as scheduled.

## Implications for Data Leadership and Strategy
- Incorporate explicit documentation of site-level heterogeneity and methodological changes (e.g., mowing method shift) in data governance to ensure accurate interpretation across years.
- Emphasize standardized protocols and robust metadata to support replicability, cross-year comparisons, and integration with wider research networks.
- Link multi-omics or multi-variable data (biomass, soil pH, nutrient inputs, vegetation composition, weather) to enable holistic data-driven decision-making.
- Ensure data discoverability and accessibility across projects, with clear provenance, versioning, and update processes to support ongoing collaboration within the data community.
