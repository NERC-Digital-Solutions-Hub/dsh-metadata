# RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context and purpose
  - Large field experiment on Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to provide broad context for detailed studies and enable cross-year comparisons; baseline data survey completed in 1998.
  - Data and outputs designed to help groups recognise links with their data and to facilitate comparisons across years.

- Data collection and management (types, cadence, and protocols)
  - Automatic Weather Station: daily headline measures (rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, air/soil temperatures at multiple depths) for 1999–2001.
  - Above-ground biomass: multi-year, five summer harvests per year (May–Sep); sampling from 0.5 m^2 sub-plots within each main plot; annual biomass totals summed and ln-transformed for analyses.
  - Soil pH: measurements in the upper 5 cm (distilled water) to monitor lime and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (plus an earlier July 2000 survey for comparison); 25 plots per year across five blocks and six treatments (incl. Controls and Biocide), with a 100-cell frame and targeted 25 hits per quadrat.
  - Additional surveys: minirhizotron-related and disturbance/nutrient surveys for specific projects.
  - Data handling and analysis: Genstat 5 used for ANOVA; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) applied to point-quadrat data; outputs include figures and tables to aid cross-year comparisons.
  - Schedule references: main data collection and activity timelines are detailed (Table 1; Fig. references).

- Management and site events in 2001
  - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (Feb–May 2001) limited site access; protocol-based sampling by officers continued with enhanced oversight.
  - Change of site Officer in Charge in May 2001.
  - Biocide application in May 2001 missed; subsequent applications completed.

- Key findings by data theme
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - Weather broadly near long-term average; rainfall close to average after very wet preceding year; slight dip in mean temperature; soil moisture modestly higher than before.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy: nitrogen and/or lime additions increased biomass relative to unimproved plots; peak biomass in July/August across treatments.
    - 2001 showed a substantial rise in biomass versus previous years, attributed to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalising biomass to a reference plot (C1) indicated continued positive effects of nitrogen and lime; ANOVA showed significant treatment-year interactions, but no significant block effects.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Liming raised surface pH (0–5 cm): October 2001 pH ~6.19 in lime plots and ~6.38 in nitrogen+lime plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, but to a lesser extent; control plots remained close to baseline since 1998.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - Species richness: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; improved plots (N, L, N&L) had 18 species, suggesting some diversity loss with fertility improvements.
    - Treatment-driven shifts: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased and were most frequent in N and N&L plots; Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra increased in fertilised plots, notably with lime.
    - Improved plots favored species associated with improved pastures (e.g., F. rubra, P. pratensis); less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) were more prominent in unimproved plots.
    - PCA showed clear separation between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; major species associations aligned with treatment type (e.g., F. rubra and P. pratensis with improved plots).
    - Biomass correlation: higher above-ground biomass correlated with higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; species associated with higher turnover (litter increase) were more frequent in nitrogen and/or lime plots.
  - 3. Site heterogeneity
    - Spatial heterogeneity: columns E and F exhibited more acidic plots; underlying site-wide heterogeneity influences pH in some columns.
    - Biomass patterning: higher biomass generally observed in more central plots; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant block-level differences detected.

- Data quality, reliability, and notes for reuse
  - Inter-observer reliability: Point Quadrat observations in 2001 showed no significant difference between two surveyors (NS; p = 0.18).
  - Data richness: multiple years (1999–2001) with cross-cutting measurements (biomass, pH, botanical surveys, weather) enabling cross-variable analyses.
  - Documentation and outputs: tables, figures, and Appendix 1 provide annualised biomass values and detailed results (e.g., ANOVA tables, PCA plots, species lists) to support secondary analyses and data integration.

- Notable appendices and outputs
  - Appendix 1: Annualised above-ground biomass for each plot (plus block-mean values).
  - Tables and figures illustrating treatment effects, pH changes, biomass trends, and botanical community shifts (e.g., Table 4–6; Fig. 1–9).

- Implications for data use
  - The dataset offers a robust, multi-factor view linking fertilisation (N, Lime) and disturbance (Biocide) to biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition across years.
  - Suitable for cross-year trend analysis, treatment effect assessments, and exploration of spatial heterogeneity within a managed field experiment.
  - Provides a template for data integration across related projects and for informing data product development (dashboards, summaries, self-serve analyses) in data-support contexts.
