# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-scale field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, Scotland.
- Aimed to provide broad monitoring context for detailed studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Data presentation aligns with Report II to help cross-study links and year comparisons; baseline data from 1998 referenced.

## Monitoring Design and Data Collected
- Site management and context
  - Two 2001 management events: government restrictions during Foot and Mouth Disease (Feb–May 2001) and a change of officer in charge.
  - Despite disruptions, key management activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued under an agreed Site Management Plan.
- Data collection and types
  - Automatic Weather Station (2001): headline measures including rainfall, radiation, temperatures at multiple depths, and soil moisture; data transmitted to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH Merlewood.
  - Above-ground biomass: multiple plots with treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide); five summer mowing periods per year; biomass dried and weighed; data ln-transformed for ANOVA.
  - Soil pH: measurements in the upper 5 cm; lime raised pH notably (to 6.19 in limed plots, 6.38 in N&L plots); nitrogen alone also raised pH (less than lime).
  - Botanical composition: July 2001 Point Quadrat survey using a 100-cell grid and 25 pin drops per plot; two surveyors covered roughly half the quadrats each; 2001 hits 58% higher than 2000, indicating denser sward.
  - Site activity and data collection schedule: detailed in Table 1 (1998–2001) with mowing, biomass sampling, botanical surveys, soil and weather measurements.
- Data handling and quality controls
  - Inter-surveyor comparison: no significant difference between surveyors in 2001 (NS, p = 0.18).
  - Data analyses: biomass analyses using ln-transformed data; split-plot ANOVA; PCA used to explore vegetation community shifts.
  - Data governance: references to data management pathways (CEH Data Manager) and the need for metadata and data sharing in monitoring contexts.

## Key Findings Relevant to Monitoring
- Weather
  - 2001 rainfall and radiation near long-term averages; slight temperature decrease and higher soil moisture versus previous years.
- Biomass and treatments
  - Clear hierarchy in biomass responses across treatments; peak biomass typically in July/Aug.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 2000 across treatments; attributed to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments most effective at boosting biomass; nitrogen plus lime most pronounced.
  - Normalization against C1 (Control 1) used to track treatment effects year-to-year.
- Soil pH management
  - Lime application continued to raise soil pH; Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline pH.
- Plant community and biodiversity
  - 24 species detected in unimproved treatments vs 18 in improved (N and/or Lime) plots, suggesting a trend toward reduced diversity in more fertile/improved plots.
  - Species shifts with treatments: Agrostis capillaris declined in 2001 across all treatments; Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis increased in fertilized/improved plots; species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) more common in N/L plots.
  - Diversity metrics (plant hits) increased overall from 2000 to 2001 but with a different pattern by treatment; more homogeneous, unimproved plots contrasted with more diverse signals in improved plots depending on species.
  - PCA separated improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved plots; biomass positively associated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while bryophytes and Nardus stricta tended to decline with higher biomass.
  - Litter frequency increased in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Site heterogeneity
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns on the right side of the slope tended to have more acidic plots, particularly among N and/or Lime plots.
  - Biomass variation showed central plots generally higher; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant block differences.

## Data Quality, Interpretation, and Limitations
- Data quality checks demonstrated consistent data collection despite staffing changes and field access restrictions.
- Transformations and statistical analyses (ANOVA, PCA) supported interpretation of treatment effects and community shifts.
- Field disruptions (FMD restrictions) and personnel changes introduced potential inconsistency; monitoring design needed to account for such contingencies and ensure metadata captures these events.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates the value of integrated, multi-metric monitoring (climate, productivity, soil chemistry, and flora) to interpret policy-relevant environmental health questions.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Standardized protocols and documentation to enable cross-year comparisons.
  - Robust metadata and data governance to support data sharing and reuse across projects.
  - Monitoring design that accounts for site heterogeneity and spatial structure (block and column effects).
  - Contingency planning for field access disruptions and personnel changes to preserve data continuity.
  - Use of complementary analytical approaches (ANOVA, PCA) to disentangle treatment effects from site variation and to reveal community-level responses beyond simple biomass metrics.

## Recommendations and Lessons for Future Monitoring
- Strengthen data governance and metadata practices to reduce barriers to data sharing and ensure dataset quality at source.
- Plan for and document field access disruptions and operational changes; incorporate redundancy in sampling and clear protocols to minimize comparability issues.
- Maintain standardized, repeatable measurement methods across years and teams; include inter-surveyor calibration as a routine quality check.
- Integrate productivity, soil chemistry, and biodiversity indicators early in monitoring designs to capture holistic environmental health impacts and potential policy implications.
- Leverage multivariate analyses (e.g., PCA) to detect shifts in plant communities that accompany management actions and soil amendments, informing adaptive management decisions.
