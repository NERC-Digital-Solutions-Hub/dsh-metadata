# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report (2002)

- Overview
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focusing on a large field experiment at Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
  - Monitoring targets: above-ground biomass (productivity), plant species composition, and relative abundance (diversity).
  - Three major management processes driving botanical changes: mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide use; trampling is also discussed.
  - Study aims linked to below- and above-ground biodiversity, with a botanical survey establishing baseline vegetation type (NVC community U4d).

- Site and experimental design (spatial context)
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots, randomly assigned treatments; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system used to allocate research activities.
  - Treatments include: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen and Lime (N&L), and Insecticide (formerly Biocide).

- Treatments and management (temporal pattern)
  - Site-wide mowing: monthly during May–September to ~6 cm height.
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing to Insecticide plots.
  - Fertility treatments: nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring (rates specified in Appendix 2 and 5).
  - In 1999–2002, field activity included extensive use of research groups continuing work, including 13CO2 pulses and trace gas measurements in 2002.

- Data collection and variables (spatially explicit elements)
  - Weather and climate: on-site Automatic Weather Station provides regular measurements (rainfall, radiation, temperatures) since Feb 1999.
  - Above-ground productivity: biomass estimates from randomly selected 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots S, T, U, V; samples collected each mowing event and oven-dried for weight.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998 survey; annual point analysis surveys in July/August 2000, 2001, and 2002 using a 0.5 m2 cell within sub-plots; 100-hole grid with 25-point reflections; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil properties: soil pH (about every 5 cm depth, typically March and August 2002), soil moisture (theta probe measurements in 2002 within point-analysis cells).
  - Additional small-scale surveys: vegetation cover within subsamples, biomass sorting by species, and species lists (Appendices 3 and 6–8).
  - Data notes: 2002 weather data has a gap due to a station fault; replaced with data from Konza station for affected periods.

- Key findings by thematic areas (2002 results)
  - Mowing effect
    - Dominance shifts: Festuca spp. increase; Agrostis spp. decline, possibly due to mowing rather than grazing.
    - Stress-tolerant taxa expand in unfertilised plots; bryophyte abundance increases, aided by ~6 cm sward height maintenance.
    - Moss expansion linked to reduced disturbance; effects more pronounced in less fertile plots.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime increase above-ground productivity; highest biomass in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
    - Productivity in fertilised plots may be nearing a peak, potentially related to rising soil pH (~7.0) and reduced soil moisture.
    - Functional shifts: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expand in N&L plots; stress-tolerant species dominate unfertilised plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Insect herbivory interactions are complex; evidence suggests reduced herbivory may favor certain palatable species, contributing to higher diversity in some contexts.
    - Cautious interpretation: direct causal links between insecticide and Shannon diversity index are not definitively established.
  - Trampling effect
    - New C2 plots (introduced in 2002) show reduced productivity, likely owing to trampling during 13CO2 pulse sampling rather than a treatment effect per se.

- Biodiversity and functional groups (point analysis and PCA)
  - Point analysis shows shifts in species composition across treatments; benefits observed for Festuca rubra in fertilised plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses/liverworts) decline in areas with nitrogen or lime; overall proportion of bryophyte hits increases across years, especially in unimproved plots.
  - Functional group analysis (CSR framework: stress-tolerators, competitors, ruderals) reveals:
    - 2000–2002: significant treatment differences in SR/C-S-R distributions.
    - N&L plots favor C-S-R dominance; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators.
  - Diversity trends (Shannon index): declines in nitrogen-and-lime plots contrasted with increases in several other treatments; 2002 showed notable divergence in diversity patterns by treatment.

- Data products and GIS implications (mapping and spatial analysis)
  - Spatial layout and treatment mapping:
    - Plot-level and block-level treatment allocations (mapable by block, plot, subplot, and 0.5 m2 cell).
    - Potential to produce time-series maps of biomass productivity per plot and per mowing cycle (1999–2002).
  - Species distribution and habitat mapping:
    - Point analysis results provide per-species hit counts by treatment and year; enables creation of species distribution maps, heatmaps of dominant taxa by treatment, and bryophyte distribution layers.
  - Soil properties and productivity surfaces:
    - Soil pH and moisture content mapped across plots and cells; relationships with biomass productivity can be modeled spatially.
  - Multivariate and pattern mapping:
    - PCA results from 2002 point analysis define axes separating improved vs unimproved plots; latent vectors highlight associations with fertile indicators (Poa pratensis, Festuca rubra, Trifolium repens) versus less fertile taxa (Festuca ovina, Agrostis spp., Luzula spp.).
  - Slope- and position-aware analyses:
    - Observed productivity gradient along the slope (lower blocks vs upper blocks) suggests incorporating topography as a factor in spatial models.

- Methods and design details (for GIS data modelling)
  - Experimental design: 5 blocks x 6 plots per block; plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m analysis cells; 16 projects with Phase I data plus Phase II fieldwork.
  - Data collection cadence: monthly mowing; biomass sampling at each mowing event; annual point analysis; soil and weather data collected regularly; 2002 field activity included intensive lab-based data collection.
  - Data management: multiple Appendix datasets (Appendix 1–8) documenting maps, species lists, biomass by plot, and pollen/biogeography data; 2002 weather data gap noted but largely fillable with nearby station data.

- Challenges and notes for GIS users
  - Data accessibility and consistency: data spread across many plots, cells, years, and data types; consistent geospatial referencing and coding are essential for integrative mapping.
  - Bryophyte identification improvements: in 2002 bryophyte species-level data enhanced; ensure species-level GIS layers reflect updated taxonomy.
  - Missing 2002 weather data: plan for data imputation or use of external stations for gaps when building time-series layers.
  - Trampling events and treatment interactions: account for non-treatment-related disturbances (e.g., sampling activity) in spatial analyses of productivity.

- Conclusions and implications for map-based data products
  - Clear, interpretable map layers can be produced for:
    - Treatment distributions and changes over time (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide, trampling).
    - Biomass productivity surfaces per year and per mowing event.
    - Species and bryophyte distribution and abundance maps by treatment.
    - Soil property maps (pH, moisture) and their relationship to productivity.
    - Functional-group and diversity landscapes (CSR-based regional maps, diversity heatmaps).
  - The integrated spatial view supports understanding how management regimes drive biodiversity and productivity dynamics at Sourhope, aiding policy, stakeholder communication, and public engagement through map-based visualisations.
