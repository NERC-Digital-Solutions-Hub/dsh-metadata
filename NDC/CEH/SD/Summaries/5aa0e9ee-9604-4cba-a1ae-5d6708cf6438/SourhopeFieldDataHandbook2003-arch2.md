# SOIL ANALYSIS OF RIGG FOOT, SOURHOPE

## Overview
- Presents soil analyses and vegetation surveys for Rigg Foot (Sourhope) focusing on Block 4 auger samples, Block 5 soil profiles and auger samples, and ECOTRON plots.
- Aims to establish baseline soil chemistry, moisture characteristics, and depth-graded profiles to support long-term environmental monitoring and policy-relevant interpretation.
- Metrics capture soil nutrient status, acidity, organic content, carbon/nitrogen dynamics, moisture loss, and pH in different extractants; linked with vegetation data to relate soil conditions to plant communities.

## Data collected and key metrics
- Measured variables across samples:
  - Weight (mg); %N; %C; C:N ratio; Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g)
  - %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - pH in water (pH(H2O)); pH in CaCl2 (pH(CaCl2))
- Depth horizons and samples include Block 4 auger samples (4A–4F) and Block 5 profiles (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with horizon-wise data.
- Block 4 auger typical ranges (examples):
  - %N: ~0.51–0.58; %C: ~6.80–8.02; C:N: ~12.6–14.3
  - Ca: ~1.01–2.96 meq/100 g; Na: ~0.12–0.15; K: ~0.58–0.81; Mg: ~0.58–1.59
  - %Moisture loss: ~4.29–5.15; LOI: ~14.60–17.96
  - pH(H2O): ~4.45–4.82; pH(CaCl2): ~3.64–4.05
- ECOTRON PLOT (Block 1 data in ECOTRON SITE):
  - Wt: 6.089 mg; %N: 0.59; %C: 8.22; C:N: 13.83
  - Ca: 2.76; Na: 0.15; K: 0.62; Mg: 1.7
  - %Moisture loss: 4.79; LOI: 17.42; pH(H2O): 4.79; pH(CaCl2): 3.82
- Block 5 auger samples (5A–5F) and profile data include horizon-wise chemistry (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture, LOI, pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2).

## Block 4 – auger samples and vegetation
- Block 4 auger data (samples 4A–4F) provide mineral and organic composition across sub-samples with depth-related variation.
- Vegetation surveys for Block 4 (plots 4A–4F) show species presence/absence and totals per plot/subplot, indicating community composition and potential microhabitat variation across plots.

## Block 5 – site details, soil profile, auger samples, and vegetation
- Site details:
  - Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude ~315 m; slope ~5°; soil drainage: imperfect
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite
- Soil profile (Block 5) depths and horizons:
  - FH (0–1 cm), H (1–7 cm), Ah (7–25 cm), AB (25–35 cm), Bg (35–49 cm), BCg (49–70 cm), Cg (70–100 cm)
  - Descriptions indicate a gradient from organic-rich, acidic surface horizons to structured mineral horizons with mottling and varying stone content
- Block 5 auger analyses (5A–5F) across horizons document:
  - N and C contents, C:N ratios; Ca, Na, K, Mg; %Moisture loss; %LOI; pH(H2O) and pH(CaCl2)
  - Top horizons generally acidic (low pH); increasing C/N and LOI with organic-rich Ah horizon
- Block 5 vegetation surveys (plots 5A–5F) show subplot-level species totals and distribution patterns, illustrating how plant communities relate to soil depth and chemistry.

## ECOTRON soil site and vegetation
- ECOTRON PLOT soil analysis:
  - Indicates low to moderate organic content with acidity (pH around 4.8 in H2O)
  - Nutrients include Ca ~2.76 meq/100 g, Mg ~1.7 meq/100 g, Mg and K moderate; MoI and LOI reflect organic-rich surface
- ECOTRON vegetation survey captures species totals by subplot, enabling cross-site comparisons with standardised sampling within the ECN/SERAD framework.

## Data interpretation and applicability for monitoring
- Provides a robust baseline of soil chemistry, texture indicators, organic content, and moisture characteristics across multiple blocks and depths.
- Enables interpretation of how soil properties may influence vegetation composition and how management or climate might alter soil health over time.
- Data align with monitoring networks (ECN, Micronet) to support nationwide and international comparisons and policy-relevant outputs.

## Data management, value, and access
- Data are organized by block, plot, and horizon with standardized metrics to facilitate comparability and reuse.
- Emphasizes archiving, cross-site linkage, and accessibility of raw data and metadata to support reproducibility and secondary analyses.
- The integrated soil and vegetation datasets support long-term monitoring, scenario testing, and evaluation of environmental health and policy performance over time.
