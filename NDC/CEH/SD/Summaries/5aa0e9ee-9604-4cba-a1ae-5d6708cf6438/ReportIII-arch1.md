# RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Long-term field experiment at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed to monitor context for detailed studies, link results across years, and manage data collection with standardised protocols.
  - 2001 site activity affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions (visitor bans Feb–May) and a change of site Officer in Charge; management activities otherwise proceeded per the 2001 Site Management Plan.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather largely unremarkable relative to prior years.
    - Rainfall in 2001 near long-term average (839 mm); prior years: 1999 ~845 mm, 2000 ~1209 mm.
    - Radiation ~3439–3473 MJ m-2; average temperatures slightly lower in 2001.
    - Average soil moisture content higher in 2001 (0.37 m3 m-3) than 2000 (0.35 m3 m-3).

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Treatments show a consistent hierarchy of biomass; peaks typically in July–August each year.
    - 2001 biomass markedly higher than 1999–2000, likely due to changes in personnel and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - After normalising to the C1 (control) treatment in each year, nitrogen and/or lime additions had the strongest positive influences on biomass.
    - ANOVA on log-transformed biomass indicates:
      - Significant differences between improved (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots.
      - Significant interaction between treatment and year.
      - No significant differences between blocks.
    - Annual and cross-year trends suggest nitrogen and lime benefits persist across years, with mechanical mowing contributing to elevated biomass in 2001.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime continued to raise soil pH in the top 5 cm.
    - October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen plus lime (N&L) plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone increased pH, but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (August 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 point-quadrat survey replicated by two surveyors; no significant inter-surveyor difference.
    - 2001 hits (species observations) were 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments, suggesting denser sward, possibly from prior grazing removal in 1998.
    - Treatment-specific shifts in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris (A. capillaris) declined across all treatments in 2001.
      - Festuca species (F. ovina, F. rubra) increased across treatments; most associated with fertilised plots (notably those with nitrogen and/or lime).
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed higher abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots retained species linked to poorer pastures (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
    - Diversity: 24 species in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting diversification/contraction patterns with tract-level fertility changes.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicated clear separation of improved plots (N and/or L) from unimproved (control/biocide); unimproved plots tended to cluster with bryophytes and Nardus stricta, while improved plots showed more Festuca rubra–related associations.
    - Biomass correlations with species composition:
      - Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass.
      - Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, etc.) declined as biomass increased.
    - Litter frequency increased in nitrogen and/or lime plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slope-facing right side) tended to have more acidic plots, although this is partly confounded by higher proportions of Control/Biocide in those columns.
    - Underlying spatial pattern exists: low pH in certain columns aligns with different community composition.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values varied by plot location; central plots often showed higher biomass (examples include N&L plot 2E, Lime plot 2C, Biocide plot 2D, Control 1 plot 2B).
    - A strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass was observed.
    - No significant biomass differences among blocks (statistical test: Genstat ANOVA, p > 0.05).

- Notes on data and analysis
  - Biomass estimates derived from five mowing events per summer; data were log-transformed for ANOVA.
  - Point Quadrat botanical data used a standardized 25-cell sampling grid with 100-cell frame; counts translated into “hits” per species.
  - Statistical significance reported for year-by-treatment and treatment-by-year interactions; overall block effects were not significant.
  - Appendix 1 provides annualised biomass per plot (2001) and supplementary data.

- Key implications
  - Fertilisation with nitrogen and lime promotes higher above-ground biomass and shifts plant communities toward more productive grasses (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis).
  - Soil pH increases with liming, linking higher pH to greater biomass and changes in species composition.
  - Management changes (e.g., mowing method) can influence measured biomass and apparent treatment effects; data normalization is essential to compare years.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the field influences biomass outcomes; site characteristics such as pH and slope orientation should be considered in interpretation and design of future experiments.
