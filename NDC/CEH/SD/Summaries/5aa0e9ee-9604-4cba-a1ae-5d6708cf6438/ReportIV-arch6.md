# SUMMARY

- Overview: Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Scottish Borders), the site has been monitored for above-ground productivity (biomass), plant species composition, and diversity, under five main plot treatments (Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime) plus an Insecticide treatment. The study links above- and below-ground processes and explores how management actions shape plant communities and functional types.

- Aims and approach to data: Track how mowing, fertilisation, and insecticide impacts on productivity and community structure drive ecological function. Use standardized data collection across blocks and plots, with repeated biomass harvests, point analysis surveys, soil pH and moisture measurements, and weather data to understand patterns and drivers.

- Site and treatments (data sources): Rigg Foot/Sourhope site with 5 blocks on a downslope gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots for other research groups. Treatments applied annually include mowing (site-wide) and plot-level applications of nitrogen, lime, their combination, or insecticide (Dursban 4). Data collected since 1999 include:
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 samples (dried, weighed) before each of five summer cuts.
  - Point analysis surveys: 0.5 m2 cells with 100-point grids in July/August (1998 baseline; 2000–2002 surveys).
  - Bryophyte and vascular plant identification to species, with 2002 bryophyte species-level effort.
  - Soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe in 2002).
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (1999–2002).

- Key results by major management effect:
  - Mowing effect
    - Agrostis spp. declines (≈40% drop since 2000) across most treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing rather than a single treatment driver.
    - Festuca rubra expands, particularly in fertile, lime- or nitrogen-added plots.
    - Stress-tolerant species rise across most plots; bryophytes (mosses) increase with mowing and absence of grazing, contributing to higher bryophyte hits, particularly under unimproved conditions.
    - Regular mowing (≈6 cm sward) may promote bryophyte growth and reduce certain grasses via a more uniform disturbance pattern than grazing.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently boost above-ground productivity; most productive plots are those with both nitrogen and lime.
    - Soil pH in lime-treated plots approaches 7.0; higher pH and lower soil moisture in these plots may eventually limit productivity if lime application continues.
    - A potential productivity peak is suggested in plots with both N and lime, possibly linked to very high lime levels (near pH 7) and moisture constraints.
    - The combination of nitrogen and lime can favour competitive, CSR-type species, while unimproved plots promote stress-tolerant species.
  - Insecticide effect
    - In 2002, Shannon diversity index tends to be higher in insecticide-treated plots, suggesting potential promotion of diversity via reduced herbivory or other indirect effects; however, evidence is cautious and may reflect complex plant–insect dynamics.
    - The pattern aligns with prior studies indicating that insect herbivory can alter plant diversity, with responses varying by life history and intensity of control.
  - Trampling effect
    - First-year biomass sampling in C2 plots (introduced in 2002) shows marked productivity reductions likely due to trampling during labelled 13CO2 pulse experiments, confounding plot-level treatment effects.
  - Functional groups and community structure
    - CSR framework applied to plant functional types (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress tolerators CS-R; stress-ruderal CS-R; SR/CSR): unimproved plots show stronger S presence; N and/or Lime plots show shifts toward competitive (C) and CSR-type assemblages.
    - By 2002, CS-R and SR/CSR groups expand in N+L plots; S remains prominent in unimproved plots; limed and/or nitrogen-treated plots show reduced bryophyte dominance and different monocot/dicot patterns.
  - Biodiversity and community composition (Point Analysis and PCA)
    - 2002 point analysis shows higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in improved plots (N, Lime, N&L) compared with controls or insecticide plots.
    - Agrostis spp. (capillaris and vinealis) decline across treatments, suggesting mowing and disturbance patterns favor other grasses.
    - Bryophyte hits rise across treatments, particularly in unimproved plots; mosses become a larger component of total hits over time.
    - PCA using ranked species hits reveals clear separation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together; some nitrogen-treated plots align with limed plots, while others align with controls or insecticide plots.
  - Diversity indices
    - Shannon diversity indices decline in nitrogen and lime treatments relative to baseline, while increases occur in several other treatments (notably insecticide plots) over 2000–2002.
  - Biomass trends (1999–2002)
    - Long-term upward trend in biomass across treatments since 1999, but 2002 shows reduced biomass relative to 2001 in several treatments.
    - The nitrogen+lime combination yields the strongest productivity, with control plots generally less productive; block position on the slope also influences productivity, with lower slope blocks showing larger percentage declines.

- Weather context and data implications:
  - 2002 featured low April and September rainfall with wetter periods in February, July, and late year; mild winter 2001/02. Such climate variability interacts with treatment effects, particularly moisture and pH-driven productivity responses.
  - Weather data support interpretation of biomass and species responses in relation to moisture availability and pH-driven nutrient dynamics.

- Data interpretations and implications for data use
  - Disturbance regime (mowing) and nutrient status (N, lime) interact to shape biomass production and community composition.
  - Functional-type shifts (S to CS-R/SR-CS-R in fertilised plots) indicate potential changes in ecosystem function under different management.
  - Insecticide effects suggest potential avenues for maintaining higher plant diversity, but causal links require careful interpretation due to complex plant–insect interactions and concurrent site factors.
  - Trampling and experimental activities can confound treatment effects, underscoring the need for careful experimental design and documentation of site-specific disturbances in data products.
