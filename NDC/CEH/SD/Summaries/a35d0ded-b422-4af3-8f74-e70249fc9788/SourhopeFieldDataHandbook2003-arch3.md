# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Aim and scope
- Long-term field site and monitoring framework to study soil-vegetation interactions under controlled perturbations and inform sustainable management and policy monitoring.
- Emphasizes transparent data use, metadata, data sharing, and cross-project data integration to support policy-relevant evaluations.

## Study site and experimental design
- Source: Sourhope Field Data Handbook, Sourhope Experimental Farm, UK; upland grassland on base-poor, damp mineral soils; core ECN site with SERAD Micronet involvement.
- Experimental layout: block-based design with nested plots (e.g., Block 4 and Block 5 detailed) and six main treatments randomly assigned within blocks:
  - Control, Lime addition, Nitrogen addition, Lime + Nitrogen, Biocide, Fallow (later reclassified as additional controls).
- Management during experiments: plots cut regularly in growing season, grazing removed or restricted, mammal-proof fencing to control wildlife interactions.
- Data focus: vegetation composition, soil properties, and their interactions under imposed perturbations; designed for long-term monitoring and cross-project data sharing.

## Data collection methods and variables

- Vegetation surveys
  - Method: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats within randomly selected subplots; 25 points per quadrat recorded for presence/absence (with potential abundance cues).
  - Timeline: initial survey recorded in mid-1998; across blocks and plots to capture community structure.
  - Outputs: species lists, dominance tables, block/plot level associations; identification of indicator species and community groups.
  - Classification: National Vegetation Classification (NVC) and Twinspan analyses to delineate communities and subcommunities.

- Soil sampling and analyses
  - Methods:
    - 0–30 cm auger cores in systematic W-pattern per plot.
    - 1 m trenches/pits for profile descriptions and horizon-specific sampling (horizons FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
    - Samples archived at -80°C for long-term storage; sub-samples prepared for immediate analyses.
  - Variables measured:
    - Physical/chemical: %N, %C, C:N ratio, LOI, moisture content, pH (H2O and CaCl2), extractable Ca, Na, K, Mg and other cations; pH and moisture profiles by horizon.
    - Horizon- and block-level chemistry: distinct patterns across FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, with surface horizons typically more acidic and higher LOI.
  - Data outputs: block/site means, correlations, regression analyses; multivariate patterns indicating drivers of variability (e.g., %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, LOI, moisture).

- Profile descriptions and ancillary data
  - Horizon-by-horizon soil descriptions with textural/structural notes; detailed block- and horizon-level chemistry and physical properties.
  - Appendices and data files (e.g., Block 4 and Block 5 profiles, MLURI barcodes) provide granular data for replication and longitudinal analyses.

- Data management and storage
  - Standardized identification via MLURI barcodes; long-term archiving and data archiving aligned with ECN data-sharing practices.
  - Structured data organization by block, plot, and horizon; references to internal datasets and analyses (e.g., Separate analyses documents and data sheets).

## Block-specific highlights (illustrative of data structure and depth)

- Block 4 (Soil profile and analyses)
  - Horizons documented: LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, B sg, C gx, with horizon-specific colorings, textures, and boundaries.
  - Depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–4 cm; H 4–8 cm; Ah 8–29 cm; Abg 29–40 cm; B sg 40–61 cm; C gx 61–95 cm.
  - Key soil variables by horizon: %N, %C, C:N, Ca, K, Mg, Na (where present), moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Vegetation data at plot level include species counts and totals, with community indicators emerging from the block’s gradient in moisture and soil chemistry.

- Block 5 (Soil profile and analyses)
  - Horizons documented: LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, with depth ranges similar to Block 4.
  - Notable variability in horizon chemistry and structure across the block; Ca and Mg often high near surface horizons; deep horizons show variation in C and N and in mineralogy.
  - Auger samples (4A–4F, 5A–5F) provide replicated horizon-level measurements including %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH, and pH CaCl2.

- Ecotron soil site (controlled environment reference)
  - Provides baseline soil chemical properties (Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg) and physical properties (moisture loss, LOI, pH) for comparison with field plots.

- Vegetation surveys across blocks
  - Plot-level species totals and indicator species identified; communities largely align with NVC units (e.g., Festuca ovina-Agrostis capillaris-Galium saxatile) with subcommunities distinguished by moisture gradients and species composition.

## Data governance, accessibility, and policy relevance

- Data richness and traceability
  - Comprehensive metadata via grid references, block/plot identifiers, horizon-based soil descriptions, and barcodes enabling reproducibility and traceability.
  - Long-term archive strategy supports ongoing monitoring and future policy-relevant evaluations.
- Governance considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a multi-layered data architecture: treatments at plot level, nested sampling at subplot/horizon levels, and integration with climate context.
  - Highlights the importance of standardized, repeatable methods and consistent data formats for longitudinal monitoring.
  - Balances openness with practical constraints (data sharing barriers, data quality assurance, timely access to originators’ data) and stresses robust metadata and data governance processes.
- Practical implications for policy and monitoring
  - Provides a structured approach to assess policy-relevant outcomes (vegetation biodiversity, soil health, carbon/nitrogen dynamics, ecosystem function) under different management actions.
  - Shows how to link vegetation data with soil chemistry and climate context to interpret ecosystem responses to liming, nitrogen amendments, biocide use, and fallow strategies.

## Endnotes and appendices (data availability and usage)

- Appendix A and related data files contain block- and plot-level soil and vegetation data, horizon-specific measurements, and species inventories.
- The dataset serves as a baseline for long-term environmental monitoring and supports future comparisons and policy-relevant evaluations of soil biodiversity and grassland ecosystem health.
