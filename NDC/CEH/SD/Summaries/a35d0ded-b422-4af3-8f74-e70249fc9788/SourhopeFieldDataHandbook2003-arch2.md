# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Aim and Scope
- Standardised, field-based environmental monitoring data to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Focuses on soil biodiversity, vegetation, and soil chemistry at Sourhope, linked to national/international networks (ECN, SERAD Micronet).
- Emphasises data verification, quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, storage, and accessible outputs (reports, maps, charts).

## Site, Design, and Sampling (Sourhope / Rigg Foot)
- Location and setup
  - Sourhope in Bowmont valley, Scotland; Rigg Foot soil biodiversity site on north-facing slope (~309 m a.s.l.); five blocks (1–5) across a slope gradient.
- Experimental layout
  - Block-wide design with six treatments per plot: Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime+Nitrogen, Biocide, Fallow (reclassified as control in some contexts).
  - Each block includes main plots (12 m × 20 m) subdivided into fifteen 4 m × 4 m subplots (A–Q); an Ecotron plot at Silwood Park integrated for controlled environment work.
- Vegetation and soil sampling
  - Vegetation: 50 cm × 50 cm quadrats within five randomly selected subplots per main plot; presence/absence data with 25 data points per quadrat; late July–early August 1998 first survey.
  - Soils: profile pits (one per main plot, 1 m deep) and auger cores (0–30 cm, W-pattern, 30 cores per plot); samples archived at -80°C; horizon descriptions and chemical analyses planned.
- Data management and networks
  - Data stored and uploaded to portals; linked with ECN and SERAD Micronet for long-term integration.

## Methods and Outputs (Vegetation and Soils)
- Vegetation data
  - Outputs: species lists per subplot/plot, dominance patterns, community classifications; analyses via Twinspan, National Vegetation Classification (NVC) comparisons, and association analyses.
- Soil sampling and analysis
  - Profile data: horizons under each main plot described (Ah, H, FH, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.); horizon-specific sampling.
  - Auger data: 0–30 cm cores with analyses for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Laboratory work: chemical analyses conducted by MLURI; emphasis on pH, organic matter (LOI), N, C, C:N, exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na).
- Data outputs and accessibility
  - Outputs include horizon-by-horizon chemistry tables, moisture loss, LOI, pH values, and exchangeable cations by block/horizon; integrated vegetation-chemistry analyses.
  - Archiving planned to support long-term ECN/SERAD analyses and re-analysis with new methods.

## Key Findings (Vegetation)
- Dominant taxa and community structure
  - Dominant grasses: Agrostis capillaris, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta; bryophyte Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus widespread.
  - Many plots align with National Vegetation Classification designations U4d and U5b, with subcommunity variations.
- Community groups and indicators
  - Four main community groups identified; indicator species include D. flexuosa (edge plots), D. cespitosa (scarce), Agrostis canina, Holcus mollis, Ranunculus repens.
  - Core community centered on A. capillaris, A. odoratum, F. rubra, N. stricta with moisture, fertility, and microtopography driving variation.
- Species richness and distribution
  - ~25 species recorded; richness tends to increase downslope; higher diversity on mid/lower plots than edge plots.
  - Microhabitat differences (edge, damp furrows, moisture/fertility gradients) influence species composition and NVC associations.
- Subplot vs plot-level patterns
  - Subplot-level indicator species reveal micro-scale heterogeneity within the broader community framework.

## Key Findings (Soils and Chemistry)
- General soil characteristics
  - Soils are acidic and humic in the 0–30 cm layer; site mean pH around 4.6 (H2O); surface horizons rich in organic matter (LOI).
  - Exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na) show block- and horizon-scale variability; Ca and Mg more abundant in surface horizons.
- Horizon and depth profiles
  - Profiles vary across blocks with horizon morphology; surface horizons (FH, H, Ah) enriched in LOI and organic matter; deeper horizons show gleying/altered subtypes under wetter conditions.
- Chemistry relationships
  - Positive correlations among %N, %C, C:N, LOI, moisture loss, and exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K); pH and cation relationships reflect fertility gradients.
  - Multivariate patterns (e.g., principal components) indicate %N, %C, C:N, LOI, moisture, Ca, Mg as major site-variability drivers; pH contributes an independent, smaller portion.
- Block-specific patterns
  - Some blocks exhibit anomalous element patterns in near-surface horizons, though randomized block design mitigates treatment biases.

## Data Outputs, Applications, and Monitoring Value
- Outputs and interpretations
  - Vegetation: species lists, plot-level dominance, NVC designations, and Twinspan groupings.
  - Soils: horizon-by-horizon chemistry, moisture metrics, LOI, pH, and exchangeable cations with block- and horizon-level summaries.
  - Integrated analyses: relationships between vegetation, soil chemistry, and microhabitat variation; potential links to management treatments.
- Monitoring relevance
  - Provides standardized, long-term data for environmental health assessment, soil biodiversity, and grassland ecosystem responses to management and climate variation.
  - Supports ECN and SERAD Micronet monitoring goals, enabling climate–soil–vegetation interaction studies and policy-relevant analyses.
- Data accessibility and value
  - Core datasets and archived samples enable reproducibility and future re-analysis with new methods or metadata.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Data Value
- Data integration and linking
  - Ambition to increase data value by linking soil biodiversity and vegetation data with air, water, invertebrates, and landscape datasets.
- Data access and transparency
  - Emphasis on enabling access to underlying data for broader scrutiny, cross-site comparisons, and policy-focused analyses.
- Long-term perspective
  - Sourhope as a long-running monitoring resource to evaluate climate variability, land-use changes, and management impacts over time.
