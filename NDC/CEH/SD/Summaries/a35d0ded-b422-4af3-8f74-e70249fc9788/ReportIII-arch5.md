# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview: NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme study at Sourhope (Scottish Borders) to provide a broad context for detailed studies and year-to-year comparisons. Site management and experimental design described in Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998). Data types, collection dates, and measurement protocols outlined to facilitate cross-group data use and comparisons.
- Data governance context:
  - Data collected across weather, biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition, with a structured measurement schedule (Table 1 reference).
  - 2001 disruptions and changes affecting data collection:
    - Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions Feb–May 2001 limited site access; activities conducted by Officers in Charge per an agreed timetable; resumption under vet-approved protocol.
    - First biocide application in May 2001 missed; subsequent four applications completed.
    - Change of Officer in Charge after May 2001.
  - Data handling implications: need to document event-driven gaps and protocol adjustments, and note a likely biomass measurement shift due to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears (see 2.2).

## 1. Introduction (Key Context)

- Field site: Sourhope farm, long-term field experiment within the Soil Biodiversity programme; aims to provide context for other studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
- Monitoring scope: broad-scale measures to accompany detailed studies; procedures and measurement dates aligned with prior reports for comparability.
- Data accessibility: emphasis on enabling cross-study links and year-by-year trend analysis.
- Data collection framework: explicit data types, dates, and site management events documented to support data provenance and quality assessments.

## 2. Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 weather: headline measures generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall: near long-term annual average (after very wet previous year).
- Radiation: little change from prior years.
- Temperature and soil moisture: average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Treatment hierarchy: consistent biomass ranking across sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 anomaly: substantial biomass increase versus previous years, likely due to personnel changes and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001.
- Normalisation: all treatment data expressed relative to C1 to identify persistent effects of nitrogen and lime.
- Statistical signals: significant differences between improved plots (N and/or L) versus non-improved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant differences between blocks.
- Implication for data governance: ensure metadata captures changes in cutting method and personnel to account for potential biases when comparing biomass across years.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime effect: continued rise in soil pH in upper 5 cm, with limed plots averaging 6.19; N+L plots averaging 6.38.
- Nitrogen effect: nitrogen alone also increased pH, but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots: little to no change since baseline (Aug 1998).
- Implication: pH shifts align with treatment, important for interpreting plant community and biomass data; document lime application timing and rate for reproducibility.

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- Survey method: July 2001 Point Quadrat protocol closely matched July 2000; inter-surveyor consistency confirmed (no significant difference between surveyors).
- Density change: total hits in 2001 58% higher than 2000 across all treatments, suggesting denser sward, possibly due to removal of grazing stock in 1998.
- Species and treatment effects:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; remained most abundant only in Control 1 and Limed plots.
  - Festuca species increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen (F. ovina) and Nitrogen+Lime (F. rubra) plots.
  - Improved plots (N and/or L) showed more Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots dominated by species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
- Species richness: 24 species in unimproved (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen+Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity decline in the most improved plots.
- Multivariate analysis: PCA differentiates nitrogen and/or lime plots from control/biocide plots; unimproved plots associated with Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum; improved plots associated with Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis.
- Biomass correlation: higher relative abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis correlates with higher biomass; increases in litter observed with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
- Data governance note: capture and preserve the linkage between botanical composition, biomass, and soil chemistry, including the impact of management changes (e.g., mowing method) on observed trends.

## 3. Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in Surface Soil pH and Plant Community Composition
- Spatial heterogeneity: prior year report noted acidic columns (E and F) on the right/up-slope; persistent low-pH signals in columns with Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments, suggesting an underlying spatial pattern despite treatment effects.

### 3.2 Variation in Vegetation Biomass
- Biomass outliers: certain plots show notably low biomass (e.g., Control 1 5A; Control 2 1D; Nitrogen 2A; Lime 5B; Nitrogen+Lime 1A; Biocide 1E).
- Spatial pattern: higher biomass tends to be in centrally located plots (e.g., Nitrogen+Lime 2E; Lime 2C; Biocide 2D; Control 1 2B).
- pH-biomass link: strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- Blocks: no significant difference in biomass between blocks (statistical result noted).
- Governance implication: document spatial heterogeneity and its potential confounding effects when comparing treatment effects; consider geospatial metadata and stratified analyses for future data integrity.
