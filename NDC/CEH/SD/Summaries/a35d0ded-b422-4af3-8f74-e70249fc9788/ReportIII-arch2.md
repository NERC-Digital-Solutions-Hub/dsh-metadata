# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The Sourhope field experiment is part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at the MLURI Sourhope site in the Scottish Borders. A baseline data survey (Nov 1998) framed the monitoring, with a prescribed wide set of measurements to provide a common context for year-to-year comparisons across research groups.
- Data collection follows standardized protocols and is designed to enable cross-year links with other datasets, quality assurance, and transparent reporting. Measurements and dates are detailed in Table 1 of the report.
- In 2001, two management events affected operations:
  - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site access from February to May; work resumed under a formal protocol.
  - Change of site Officer in Charge occurred in May 2001, with continued management planned under the 2001 Site Management Plan.

## 2. RESULTS

- 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data were broadly unremarkable; rainfall near the long-term average after a very wet prior year; annual radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; higher than previous years’ soil moisture.

- 2.2 Above-ground biomass
  - A consistent hierarchy of biomass across treatments was observed; peak biomass typically in July/August.
  - 2001 biomass estimates increased markedly compared with 2000, likely due to changes in personnel and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass normalized to a standard plot (C1) showed nitrogen and/or lime additions boosting productivity, with the nitrogen+lime treatment most effective.
  - Separate analyses (log-transformed biomass; ANOVA) showed significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots, a significant interaction between treatment and year, and no significant block effects.

- 2.3 Soil pH
  - Lime addition raised surface soil pH; October 2001 means: limed plots ~6.19; nitrogen+lime plots ~6.38; nitrogen-only plots also increased pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots showed no significant change since baseline (Aug 1998).

- 2.4 Botanical composition
  - July 2001 Point Quadrat survey (50% coverage by two surveyors) showed no significant surveyor bias.
  - 2001 surveys recorded 58% more hits than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (possibly from earlier grazing stock removal).
  - Clear treatment differences in dominant species in 2001: Agrostis capillaris declined across most treatments; Festuca species (ovina and rubra) increased, especially in N and/or lime plots; improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) became more common in fertilised plots, particularly with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Species richness: unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) had 24 species; improved plots (especially N&L) had 18 species, indicating a potential early decline in diversity in highest-fertility plots.
  - PCA separated fertilised/improved plots from unimproved plots; high biomass plots aligned with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes with higher fertility.
  - Biomass correlated with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; abundance of several less productive or bare-associated species declined as biomass rose. Increased litter with nitrogen and/or lime indicated faster vegetation turnover in more fertile plots.

## 3. SITE HETEROGENEITY

- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
  - Observed spatial heterogeneity: columns E and F tended to be more acidic; a tendency amplified by a higher proportion of unimproved plots (Control/Biocide) in those columns.
  - Underlying heterogeneity across the site affects pH around treatment columns, with pH disparities linked to treatment distribution.

- 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
  - Some plots were outliers with notably low biomass across treatments; central, more interior plots tended to have higher biomass (e.g., N&L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
  - A strong positive correlation existed between surface soil pH and biomass, though no significant differences between blocks were detected (ANOVA).

## Implications for Monitoring and Data Use

- The monitoring framework provides year-to-year context for interpreting more detailed, treatment-specific studies, enabling cross-dataset linkage and policy-relevant environmental health signals.
- The observed biomass and plant-community responses to nitrogen and lime, coupled with soil pH changes, demonstrate how standardised, repeatable measurements can reveal shifts in productivity and community structure over time.
- Site heterogeneity is a key consideration when interpreting treatment effects; spatial variability in pH and biomass must be accounted for in analyses and reporting.
- Data management practices (consistent protocols, QA, and storage) are essential to ensure that outputs (bio-mass trends, pH changes, species composition) remain comparable across years and research groups.
