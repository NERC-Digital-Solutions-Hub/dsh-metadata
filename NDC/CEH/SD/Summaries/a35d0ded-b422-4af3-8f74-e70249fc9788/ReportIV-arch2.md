# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site - 2002

## Overview
- Four years into the Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
- Focus on above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity in relation to management treatments.
- Treatments involve mowing (site-wide), and plot-level applications of nitrogen, lime, both, and insecticide; grazing excluded since 1998.
- Aims tied to understanding how soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities respond to land-use changes through functional and demographic perspectives.

## Site and Treatments
- Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks along a downslope gradient; each block has 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots with random treatment allocation.
- Site-level management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept).
- Plot-level treatments (applied since 1999): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
- Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied after mowing in designated plots.
- Treatments distinguished by nutrient inputs (N, lime), and disturbance regime.

## Data Collected and Methods
- Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station since 1999.
- Above-ground productivity: regular clipping of vegetation from 0.5 m2 cells, drying and weighing; baseline survey in 1998; annual 0.5 m2 point analyses in July/August (2000–2002).
- Soil sampling: pH measurements since 1998 (5 cm depth); soil moisture via theta probe in 2002.
- Bryophyte and vascular plant surveys: 2000–2002 point analyses; bryophytes identified to species level in 2002.
- Additional small-scale surveys: vegetation cover, biomass per plot, and presence of litter.
- Data analyses: split-plot ANOVA (Genstat) for biomass; PCA for point-analysis species data; treatment-year interactions assessed; diversity indices (Shannon) calculated across surveys.

## Key Results: Biomass and Productivity
- Overall long-term rise in biomass productivity from 1999 to 2002 across most treatments, despite a mid-2002 dip in several plots.
- Nitrogen and Lime (N+L) plots show the strongest biomass increases; Control 2 plots consistently lower in productivity than Control 1.
- 2002: biomass across treatments declined relative to 2001; declines ranged from ~13.7% (N&L) to ~31.2% (Control 2).
- A slope-related pattern: lower on the upslope blocks (Block 5) and higher at the bottom (Block 1) of the slope, indicating spatial variation in productivity.

## Soil Chemistry and Productivity Interactions
- Lime markedly increases soil pH (to ~7.0 in upper soil profile); nitrogen also increases pH but to a lesser extent.
- Positive correlation between higher soil pH and above-ground productivity when considering all treatments; the strength of this relationship varies by treatment.
- Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH observed; fertility treatments (especially lime) influence moisture balance and plant stress.

## Community Composition and Diversity (Point Analysis)
- In 2002, improved plots (lime, nitrogen, N&L) show higher frequencies of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots dominated less by these species.
- Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declines (>40% since 2000) across most treatments, potentially driven by mowing and uniform disturbance rather than a single treatment.
- Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across the site, particularly in unimproved plots; Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus expands notably.
- Diversity (Shannon index) changes: 2002 shows declines in diversity in N&L plots relative to baseline, while several unimproved plots show increases.
- Functional groups (CSR framework: S = stress-tolerators; C-S-R = competitive stress-ruderals; SR/C-S-R) dominate across plots; shifts observed with treatments:
  - N+L plots show expansion of C-S-R and SR/C-S-R groups, indicating greater competitiveness and disturbance-adapted traits under fertilization.
  - Unfertilised plots favor stress-tolerant species.
  - Lime and nitrogen effects influence the balance among functional groups, with lime particularly elevating C-S-R presence.

## Insecticide Effect
- Insecticide-treated plots show higher Shannon diversity in some years, but evidence linking reduced herbivory to increased diversity remains circumstantial.
- Possible mechanism: reduced herbivory may favor more palatable, now-established species, improving diversity while remaining in an overall infertile context.

## Trampling and Disturbance Effects
- 2002: C2 plots (insecticide/ nitrogen-only designations) exhibit unusually low productivity, attributed to trampling during heavy activity around labelled CO2 pulse experiments.
- Trampling likely contributed to observed reductions in productivity in these plots, highlighting disturbance as a key driver of short-term productivity fluctuations.

## Implications for Monitoring and Data Value
- The project demonstrates how standardized, multi-metric monitoring (biomass, species composition, diversity, soil chemistry, and moisture) supports assessment of environmental health and policy-relevant outcomes over time.
- Data integration across treatments and years reveals complex, interacting effects of management on ecosystem structure and function.
- There is emphasis on making underlying data accessible for broader analysis and reuse, aligning with the programme’s objective to increase dataset value and accessibility.

## Summary of Observations and Trends
- Fertilization (N and/or lime) consistently enhances productivity, with the strongest gains when both are applied.
- High lime levels push soil pH toward neutrality/alkaline, influencing plant community shifts toward competitive, less moisture-demanding species but potentially reducing diversity over time.
- Mowing without grazing tends to favor stress-tolerant and bryophytic growth, reduces certain grasses (Agrostis spp.), and promotes moss proliferation.
- Bryophytes increasingly contribute to overall plant hits and biomass in unimproved plots, signaling a shift in ground cover under reduced disturbance and nutrient inputs.
- Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require caution in interpretation; sample-specific responses vary by year and treatment combination.
- Disturbance events (e.g., trampling during CO2 pulse experiments) can cause pronounced short-term reductions in productivity, even within otherwise stable management regimes.
