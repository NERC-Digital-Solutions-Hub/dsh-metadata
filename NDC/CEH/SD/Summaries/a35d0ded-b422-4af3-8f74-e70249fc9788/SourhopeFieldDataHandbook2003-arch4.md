# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope : BLOCK 4

- Provides a detailed description of the soil profile for Block 4, including horizon-by-horizon morphology, chemical properties, and depth intervals.
- Key horizons and depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–4 cm; H 4–8 cm; Ah 8–29 cm; Abg 29–40 cm; B sg 40–61 cm; C gx 61–95 cm.
- Soil description highlights: fibrous, moist surface; black H horizon with amorphous structure; Ah as a sandy silt loam with many fine and medium roots; Abg and B sg show increasing stone content (igneous andesite fragments) and structured horizons; C gx shows reddish-brown to light reddish-brown clay loams with abundant igneous stones.
- Analytical summary (selected values): per horizon measurements of %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2). Notable acidity (lower pH in surface horizons), elevated LOI in surface horizons, and Ca–Mg–K trends with depth. Presence of many igneous stones andesite fragments, especially in Ah through C horizons.

- Data management context: Horizon-specific data (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bs, Cx) support granular analyses of soil chemistry and texture across depth, with standardized unit reporting (meq/100 g for cations, %N, %C, LOI, pH).

- Auger samples (Block 4): Samples 4A–4F show consistent trends across shallow depths:
  - %N ~0.51–0.58; %C ~6.80–8.02; C:N ~12.6–14.3.
  - Ca ~1.11–3.32 meq/100 g; Mg ~0.67–1.59 meq/100 g; K ~0.58–0.81 meq/100 g; Mg often higher in deeper auger samples.
  - %Moisture loss ~4.29–5.15; %LOI ~15–18%; pH(H2O) ~4.45–4.93; pH(CaCl2) ~3.53–4.14.
- Vegetation survey (Block 4): plots 4A–4F capture presence/absence and totals of species; dominant taxa include grasses such as Acp (Agrostis capillaris), Fr (Festuca spp.), Ns (Nardus stricta), Ao (Anthoxanthum odoratum), Pp (Poa pratensis), with various other forbs and moss indicators. Richness varies by plot and microtopography, with some plots showing higher totals and others more sparse.
- Ecotron soil site: specific soil chemistry indicates relatively acidic, organic-rich surface horizons with modest Ca and Mg; pH H2O around 4.79, CaCl2 around 3.82; organic matter indicated by LOI and %C.

- Ecotron vegetation: limited but recorded presence/absence and totals across Ac, Ao, At, Fr, Ns, etc., illustrating community composition within a controlled environment subplot.

- Data governance takeaways (Block 4):
  - Rich, multi-layered data (horizon-level chemistry, presence/absence species, plot-level treatments) enable complex analyses of soil–vegetation interactions.
  - Standardized coding for species and horizon nomenclature supports discoverability and cross-site reuse.
  - Vegetation sampling coverage is partial in some analyses, so results are indicative/baseline rather than fully exhaustive across all subplots.

- Data accessibility and potential uses (Block 4):
  - Comprehensive per-horizon soil chemistry paired with vegetation data enables baselining, monitoring changes under management or perturbations, and cross-site synthesis with ECN/Micronet frameworks.
  - Useful for modelling nutrient cycling, soil acidity, organic matter dynamics, and vegetation responses to soil conditions.

- Key implications for data governance:
  - Ensure complete horizon-level metadata (locations, depths, boundary definitions) and consistent units.
  - Maintain clear linking of vegetation plots to corresponding soil horizons for integrative analyses.
  - Document any deviations or anomalies in data (e.g., unusual values in Block 3–5) and how randomization mitigates them.

- Summary takeaway for data leaders:
  - Block 4 provides a rich, well-structured dataset blending horizon-scale soil chemistry with plot-scale vegetation surveys and controlled-environment data (Ecotron).
  - The data support granular governance practices: metadata completeness, standardization of codes, and clear pathways for longitudinal and cross-site analyses, while also highlighting areas where sampling coverage could be expanded for stronger inference.

# BLOCK 5: SITE DETAILS AND DATA CONTEXT

- Site details (Block 5): Grid reference NT8544019520; altitude 315 m; slope 5 degrees; imperfect drainage; Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; parent material includes undifferentiated intermediate igneous and andesite.
- Soil profile (Block 5): Depths and horizons mapped as LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–5 cm; H 5–7 cm; Ah 7–25 cm; AB 25–35 cm; Bg 35–49 cm; BCg 49–70 cm; Cg 70–100 cm.
  - Horizon descriptions indicate strongly mottled, sandy/clay loams with gleys and abundant igneous stones; color changes from black/dark horizons near the surface to reddish-brown and grey tones with depth.
  - Stones: very abundant very small angular undifferentiated intermediate igneous stones; many small subangular andesite stones; substantial igneous content across deeper horizons.
- Soil analysis (Block 5 profile):
  - Across horizons, %N ranges ~0.65–2.17; %C ~9.36–33.81; C:N ratios ~10.20–16.46.
  - Major cations: Ca up to 11.91 meq/100 g in FH, Mg up to ~5.92 meq/100 g, K up to ~0.83 meq/100 g, Na generally low.
  - %Moisture loss ranges ~2.79–9.43; %LOI ~4.12–67.00 with the FH horizon notably high LOI in some cases.
  - pH(H2O) generally acidic (~4.34–5.20); pH CaCl2 ~3.53–4.14 across horizons.

- Vegetation survey (Block 5):
  - Plots 5A–5F show a mix of Ac, Ao, At, Ns, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rs, and other taxa with varying counts across subplots; overall composition includes grasses, forbs, and moss indicators typical of upland grassland mosaics.
  - Species totals per plot indicate diverse communities, with some plots showing higher totals (e.g., mix of grasses and forbs) and others more conservative in species presence.
- Ecotron context for Block 5:
  - ECOTRON site and associated vegetation data (Ac, Ao, At, Fr, Ns, etc.) captured alongside soil measurements, illustrating how controlled environment conditions can be used to study soil–vegetation–microbial interactions in similar soil types.
- Data governance and quality (Block 5):
  - Block 5 provides deeper horizon data (Bg/BCg) and more pronounced mineral content in deeper horizons, enabling comparisons of maturation and leaching along profiles.
  - As with Block 4, vegetation surveys may be incomplete across subplots; ensure explicit documentation of sampling coverage and any blocking/randomization schemes.
- Potential uses for Block 5 data:
  - Cross-block synthesis of how soil profile development (gleying, mottling, stone content) correlates with plant community structure and function.
  - Longitudinal analyses of nutrient pools, pH shifts, and organic matter dynamics under historical management or natural perturbations.
  - Integration with ECOTRON data to explore microbe–plant–soil feedbacks in acid, stone-rich upland soils.
- Data governance takeaways (Block 5):
  - Maintain horizon-level metadata for each depth interval (LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) and ensure consistent lab methods and units across blocks.
  - Preserve provenance details (grid, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material) to enable robust cross-site comparability and meta-analyses.
  - Continue to document any anomalies and ensure clear alignment of vegetation plots with their corresponding soil horizons for integrative analyses.
