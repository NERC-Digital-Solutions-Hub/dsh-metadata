# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview and Context
- Large-scale field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Aim: provide a broad monitoring context for related studies and enable year-to-year comparisons across multiple data streams (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical composition).
- Baseline and rationale described in the November 1998 Baseline Data Survey; Table 1 lists the types and dates of measurements.
- 2001 site management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions and a change in the officer in charge.

## Monitoring Design and Data Collected
- Measurements and methods:
  - Automatic Weather Station for headline climate data (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, soil moisture).
  - Above-ground biomass: multi-year harvesting across plots with five mowing dates each summer; data normalized to a reference plot (C1) to allow cross-year comparison.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm soil sampled to monitor lime and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001) across plot sub-units to track species abundance; supplementary minirhizotron and disturbance/nutrient surveys on selected sub-plots.
- Experimental setup:
  - Plots subject to treatments including nitrogen, lime, both (N&L), and a Biocide treatment, plus unimproved controls.
  - Data management involved regular transmission of weather data to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager; annual and multi-year datasets collected with attention to metadata and sampling protocols.
- Operational notes:
  - 2001 Field Plan largely adhered to, despite FMD-related access restrictions; four biocide applications completed; one May biocide application missed.
  - Paper documents detailed the sampling schedule (e.g., 40 ml water-mixed soil samples, mowing and clippings, Point Quadrat protocol).

## Key Findings by Measurement Type

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 rainfall near long-term average (839 mm) after an exceptionally wet prior year; 1999 rainfall 845 mm; 2000 rainfall 1209 mm.
- Radiation ~3472–3473 MJm⁻²; average air/soil temperatures slightly cooler in 2001; soil moisture modestly higher than previous years.

### 2.2 Above-ground Biomass
- Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass production maintained across years; peak biomass typically in July/August.
- 2001 biomass values higher than earlier years, likely due to changes in personnel and shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
- Normalizing all treatments to C1 showed persistent positive biomass responses from nitrogen and/or lime (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots.
- Split-plot ANOVA indicated significant treatment effects on biomass, significant year-by-treatment interaction, and no significant block effects.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Liming continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 pH: limed plots 6.19; nitrogen-and-lime plots 6.38.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed little change since baseline (August 1998).

### 2.4 Botanical Composition
- Point Quadrat 2001 survey: 58% more total hits than 2000, suggesting increased sward density (potentially from grazing stock removal in 1998).
- Treatment differences in dominant species became more pronounced:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001.
  - Festuca species (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; especially prominent in N-only and N&L plots.
  - Species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) were more apparent in fertilised plots (notably those with both N and L).
  - Species associated with less fertile pastures (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved controls.
- Diversity: unimproved treatments recorded 24 species; N&L plots contained only 18 species, hinting at potential diversity decline with increased fertility.
- Multivariate analyses (PCA) showed clear separation between improved (N and/or L) vs. unimproved (Control and Biocide) plots; high-frequency association of certain species with improved plots (e.g., Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis).
- Biomass correlations: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes declined as biomass increased; litter frequency higher in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster turnover with higher fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity and Data Interpretation
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: some site columns showed more acidic plots (notably Columns E and F) and are linked to plot treatment distribution.
- Biomass and pH showed spatial patterns, with higher biomass often in centrally located plots; a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass was detected.
- No significant differences in biomass between blocks; site heterogeneity necessitates careful interpretation when attributing effects to treatments.

## Operational Context and Data Management
- Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions temporarily limited site access; protocol-compliant visits resumed mid-2001.
- Change of officer in charge occurred in 2001.
- Weather data were regularly collected and transmitted to the data manager; a consistent monitoring pipeline was maintained despite disruptions.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Multi-metric monitoring is essential: climate, above-ground productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community composition all respond to management interventions (N, lime) and site conditions.
- Data comparability across years can be affected by changes in sampling methods (e.g., shift from manual to mechanical cutting); normalization (to C1) is necessary to sustain cross-year comparisons.
- Metadata quality and documentation are critical for interpreting treatment effects, especially in heterogeneous field sites.
- Site heterogeneity must be accounted for in analysis and reporting; spatial structuring (e.g., column-level differences) can influence observed outcomes.
- Transparent reporting of operational disruptions (FMD-related access, staff changes) helps in understanding potential biases in monitoring results.
- The study demonstrates the value of integrating diverse data streams (climate, soil chemistry, vegetation surveys) to inform land management decisions and future monitoring design.
