# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

- The document reports four years of intensive data collection at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders) as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Focus areas include above-ground productivity (biomass), plant community composition and diversity, soil chemistry (pH), soil moisture, and weather data, across a controlled set of treatments and replicated plots.
- Data are used to understand how mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application influence plant communities and their functional groups, linking above- and below-ground processes.

## Data Collection and Experimental Design

- Site and treatments
  - Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient.
  - Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated at random.
  - Five mowing-related management tasks since 1999; vegetation mowed monthly May–Sept to ~6 cm.
  - Five plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2 (no input), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime; plus Insecticide (Dursban 4) applied to insecticide plots after mowing.
- Data types and collection
  - Above-ground biomass: yearly 0.5 m2 sampling cells within sub-plots; biomass dried and weighed.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline (1998) using 0.5 m2 quadrats; subsequent point-analysis surveys in 2000–2002 with 100-point grid per cell, identifying species at each point; bryophytes identified to species in 2002.
  - Soil: soil pH (5 cm depth, H2O) regularly; soil moisture (theta probe in 2002) across sampling cells; soil sampling totals 11,621 samples from start to 2002.
  - Weather: Automatic Weather Station data since 1999 (rainfall, radiation, temperatures, etc.).
  - Data management: Appendices document site layout, treatments per plot, species lists, and weather/biomass data; references to project-specific data files and analyses.
- Timeline and scope
  - Baseline botanical survey in 1998; regular data collection from 1999–2002 including five summer cuts per year and multiple chemical treatments.
  - 2002 saw extensive fieldwork by Phase II projects, including labelled CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements.

## Data Processing, Analysis, and Quality

- Analytical approaches
  - Biomass analysis: yearly, with log-transformed data and split-plot ANOVA to test treatment, year, and their interaction.
  - Correlations and relationships: soil pH vs moisture; pH vs biomass (across all plots and within treatments); exploration of non-linear (polynomial) relationships.
  - Point-analysis: frequency of species within each treatment; Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to separate improved vs unimproved plots and to identify key species groups.
  - Diversity metrics: Shannon diversity index computed for baseline and subsequent surveys; analysis of changes over time by treatment.
  - Functional groups: classification of species into stress-tolerant (S), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR), and SR/CSR groups; assessment of shifts in functional composition by treatment and year.
- Data gaps and corrections
  - 2002 weather data includes missing periods due to a weather-station malfunction; other data sources (Konza station) used to supplement some periods.
  - Trampling effects noted in C2 plots in 2002 due to 13CO2 pulse experiments.
  - Site access restrictions in 2001 due to foot-and-mouth disease.
- Data outputs
  - Figures and tables (e.g., biomass trends by treatment, treatment-normalised biomass, ANOVA results, PCA plots) and multiple appendices detailing species lists, biomass per plot, and rank analyses.
  - Appendix 5 provides headline weather data; Appendix 6–8 provide biomass, rank analyses, and species abundances by treatment.

## Key Data-Driven Insights

- Productivity and treatments
  - Nitrogen and/or lime consistently increase above-ground biomass; highest productivity in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
  - 2002 biomass generally declined across most treatments relative to 2001, with notable spatial (block) effects: Block 5 showed the largest decline; Block 1 (bottom of slope) showed a large decline in 2002 as well.
- Soil chemistry and productivity
  - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen raises pH modestly.
  - There is a strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; higher pH plots tend to be drier.
  - Overall positive association between higher pH and biomass across all plots; within N+L plots, this relationship weakens or reverses, indicating complex interactions between pH, moisture, and nutrient status.
- Plant community composition and diversity
  - Improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots show more Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Bryophyte presence increases across the site, with Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus becoming more prevalent; bryophyte share is higher in unimproved plots and increases over time.
  - Shannon diversity index declines in nitrogen-and-lime plots (about 15% drop from baseline to 2002), while other treatments show increases.
  - Point-analysis functional-group results indicate three dominant groups (S, CSR, SR/CSR) representing 69–95% of hits; by 2002, N+L plots show expansion of C-S-R species, unimproved plots favor stress-tolerant species, and SR/CSR are reduced in lime and insecticide plots.
- Insecticide and trampling effects
  - Insecticide (Dursban) presence correlates with specific shifts in species groups but a direct causal link to overall diversity remains uncertain.
  - Trampling (C2 plots) likely reduced productivity in 2002, particularly during intensive activity associated with labelled CO2 pulses.

## Outputs, Access, and Reuse

- Data products and availability
  - Detailed site datasets, biomass measurements, species lists, bryophyte identifications, and point-analysis results are documented in appendices and available through project documentation.
  - Outputs are publicly described via the Soil Biodiversity website; additional data can be requested from project PIs and CEH (Centre for Ecology and Hydrology).
- Potential for reuse
  - Longitudinal biomass and diversity data enable analyses of how management regimes influence productivity, community structure, and functional traits over time.
  - Data suitable for dashboards or self-serve exploration by researchers and local stakeholders interested in grassland management, nutrient limitation, and biodiversity responses to disturbance.
  - The dataset supports modeling interactions among pH, moisture, and productivity under varying nutrient regimes.

## Challenges and Recommendations for Data Support

- Data quality and continuity
  - Address and document data gaps due to weather-station issues; implement fall-back data streams and clear gap-filling protocols.
  - Maintain consistent data collection timing across years to support robust longitudinal analyses.
- Data sharing and governance
  - Improve proactive sharing of outputs and datasets to maximise reuse across Phase I and Phase II projects.
  - Maintain comprehensive metadata (treatment definitions, plot layouts, sampling protocols) to facilitate cross-study integration.
- Data products for end users
  - Develop user-friendly dashboards or guided reports enabling non-specialists to explore biomass, diversity, and functional-group shifts by treatment and year.
  - Provide clear documentation linking observed ecological patterns to management actions (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) for policy and practice use.
