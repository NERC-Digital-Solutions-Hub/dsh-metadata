# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Documentation of detailed soil profiles and vegetation surveys at Sourhope, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5 (Rigg Foot), with ancillary data from ECOTRON plots.
- Data collected to support long-term soil-vegetation biodiversity studies, cross-block comparisons, and integration with environmental change programs (ECN, Micronet).
- Includes qualitative soil descriptions, horizon-by-horizon chemistry, horizon morphology, and plot-level vegetation inventories.

## Data Organization and Scope

- Blocks and horizons
  - Block 4: profiles from LF to Cg with horizons such as LF, FH, H, Ah, Abg, Bg, Cgx; detailed boundary descriptions and mineral/organic content.
  - Block 5: profiles from LF to Cg with horizons such as LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; explicit mottling and structure descriptions, and many igneous stones noted.
- Sample types
  - Profile analyses: horizon-by-horizon data including color, texture (e.g., sandy silt loam, clay loam), structure, moisture, roots, and boundary characteristics.
  - Auger samples: multiple sub-samples per plot (e.g., 4A–4F, 5A–5F) with %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - ECOTRON plot: single-profile and a parallel vegetation survey for integrated analysis.
- Vegetation data
  - Species presence/absence and totals across plots and subplots; species totals by plot/subplot; indicator and dominant species identified per block.
  - Data organized to support comparisons by plot, subplot, block, and reach of slope (edges vs interior).

## Data Collected and Methods

- Soil profiling
  - Depths and horizons documented with descriptive color-mottling notes, texture, structure, moisture, roots, and boundary characteristics.
  - Notable horizon features include humic, acidic soils with varying moisture regimes, and horizons showing mottling and gleying in certain blocks.
- Laboratory analyses
  - %N, %C, and C:N ratio measured across horizons.
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g).
  - Moisture-related metrics: %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI).
  - Acidity measurements: pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2) for each horizon or sample.
- Data detail and provenance
  - Data tied to MLURI barcodes for each horizon and sample (e.g., FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; 4A–4F, 5A–5F; ECOTRON 1).
  - Comprehensive tabulations available (horizons, block-level contrasts, and horizon-by-horizon chemistry).

## Vegetation Findings (Blocks 4 and 5)

- Community and species patterns
  - Dominant grasses and indicator species identified (e.g., Festuca, Agrostis, Nardus; differences across moister edge vs interior plots).
  - Species richness observed to vary by plot, with several plots showing higher counts and others more sparse.
- Subplot and block-level variation
  - Clear delineation of vegetation communities by block, with associations to soil chemistry and horizon properties.
  - Edge plots (Block 4–5) often show different compositions vs interior plots, consistent with moisture and nutrient gradients.

## Soil Findings (Blocks 4 and 5)

- General soil characteristics
  - Soils are acidic and humic with pH values typically in the ~4.5–5.0 range (H2O) and slightly different in CaCl2 extracts.
  - LOI (loss on ignition) and %Moisture loss are higher in surface horizons, decreasing with depth.
  - Exchangeable Ca and Mg commonly higher than Na; K and Mg show horizon- and block-specific variations.
- Block and horizon variation
  - Block-level contrasts observed in near-surface Ca, moisture variables, and occasional gleying characteristics (notably Blocks 4 and 5 in some horizons).
  - Horizon descriptions indicate varying textures (sandy silt loam to clay loam) and distinct structural changes across depths.
- Multivariate patterns
  - Correlations among %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, and moisture metrics evident.
  - Block and horizon data contribute to ~70% of observed variation in key soil chemistry/physical variables when combined in multivariate analyses.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Considerations

- Sampling coverage
  - Only about one-third of subplots sampled per main plot; results are indicative rather than exhaustive for blocks.
  Block-specific anomalies noted (e.g., Blocks 4–5) require cautious interpretation of comparisons.
- Temporal and grazing effects
  - Seasonal and grazing histories influence vegetation patterns and may affect soil moisture and organic matter distribution.
- Data integration and accessibility
  - Rich datasets exist at horizon and plot levels, with appendices and data files enabling cross-dataset analyses (e.g., vegetation versus soil chemistry), but require careful alignment of plots, horizons, and treatments.

## Data Outputs and Potential Data Products

- Datasets to leverage
  - Horizon- and plot-level soil properties (N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, LOI, moisture loss, pH) by block and horizon.
  - Vegetation by plot/subplot (species presence/abundance, totals, indicator/dominant species).
  - Contextual agronomic and ecological variables (structure, mottling, roots, and boundary descriptions).
- Practical data product ideas
  - Interactive soil dashboards: horizon-specific chemistry and pH by block, with depth profiles.
  - Horizon-by-horizon soil health heatmaps (Ca/Mg/K/Na, LOI, moisture loss) across Blocks 4 and 5.
  - Vegetation dashboards: community composition by block and plot, linked to corresponding soil profiles.
  - Anomaly and outlier maps highlighting blocks or horizons with unusual soil chemistry or horizon structures.
  - Data provenance views connecting each sample to its MLURI barcode, horizon, and corresponding vegetation data.

## Current Research Context and Outputs

- Integrated data themes
  - Long-term soil and vegetation dynamics linked to indigenous pasture management, grazing regimes, and environmental change studies.
  - Potential for ecosystem-scale dashboards combining vegetation communities with soil chemistry/horizon profiles.
- Data utility
  - The dataset supports cross-block analyses, trend detection across years, and targeted sampling via anomaly maps or horizon-level comparisons.
  - Substantial potential for dashboards and data products to enable self-serve exploration by researchers and collaborators.
