# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Comprehensive documentation of the Sourhope field site within the Soil Biodiversity Programme, focusing on long-term ecological data collection across multiple blocks (notably Blocks 4 and 5 in this chunk) including soil profiles, soil analyses, and vegetation surveys.
- Data support long-term studies of soil biodiversity, plant communities, and soil–plant interactions under a range of conditions and management perturbations.
- Includes detailed metadata, archival practices, and data provenance to enable future reuse and cross-study integration.

## Data Types and Structure
- Soil data
  - Block-based soil profiles with multi-horizon descriptions (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; and ECOTRON related horizons).
  - Depth ranges typically from 0 to 100 cm with boundary descriptions (e.g., smooth, wavy).
  - Horizon-level physical and chemical properties: texture indicators, color, structure, moisture, roots presence, and stones; chemical properties including %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g); pH (H2O and CaCl2); %Moisture loss; %Loss on Ignition; and moisture content.
  - Auger samples with similar chemical/physical analyses across horizons (e.g., 4A–4F; 5A–5F), including wt (mg), %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH measurements.
  - Barcodes and identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) for every horizon and auger sample to enable traceability.
- Vegetation data
  - Vegetation survey results by plot and subplot with species presence/absence and abundance indicators.
  - Species totals per plot/subplot; classifications into community types or indicator species (as used in broader Twinspan/NVC analyses in the full handbook).
- Site metadata and context
  - Block-level site details (e.g., grid location, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series, parent material).
  - ECOTRON PLOT data included as a separate, tightly documented subdataset (soil and vegetation within the Ecotron area).
- Climate context
  - Long-term climate context from Sourhope ECN weather station to support interpretation of soil and vegetation responses.

## Data Collection Methods
- Soil sampling
  - Profile sampling with horizon-level description and horizon-specific analyses (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg, etc.).
  - Auger sampling across plots (multipoint augering) with a consistent W-pattern to obtain representative 0–30 cm data and horizon-based pits beside each block.
  - Archival storage of samples at -80°C where applicable.
- Vegetation sampling
  - Plot-based surveys with detailed subplot data; presence/absence and abundance indicators for key species.
- Data management
  - Systematic use of MLURI barcodes for all samples and horizons to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
  - Data organized by blocks and plots, with explicit plot/subplot identifiers and horizon designations.

## Data Governance, Provenance, and Metadata
- Metadata completeness
  - Explicit documentation of layout (blocks, plots, subplots), horizon designations, treatments, sampling dates, and archive status.
  - Archive details and barcoding schemes included to support traceability and reproducibility.
- Provenance and lineage
  - Data generated and archived by MLURI teams; data linked to associated vegetation and soil analyses (Twinspan, NVC, and related analyses) in the broader handbook.
  - Clear lineage from field collection to laboratory analyses and data entry, enabling future re-use and re-analysis with updated methods.
- Data lifecycle
  - Long-term storage and preservation of both data and physical samples to facilitate re-analysis as methods evolve.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Challenges
- Sampling completeness
  - Vegetation data: in some sections, subplots are not fully sampled; results are indicative rather than exhaustive at the site scale.
  - Temporal variability: seasonal dynamics (especially for herbs) may affect results; grazing pressure changes (grazing exclusion) influence outcomes.
- Variability and anomalies
  - Block- and horizon-specific anomalies observed (e.g., Blocks 4 and 5 showing distinct patterns in certain variables).
  - pH, cation concentrations, and other soil properties exhibit horizon- and block-level variability that must be accounted for in analyses.
- Data interpretation and reuse
  - Dominant species drive groupings in some analyses; presence/absence of less common species can influence classifications.
  - Robust metadata and standardized data dictionaries are essential to support cross-study reuse and meta-analyses.

## Accessibility, Stewardship, and Interoperability
- Data standards and identifiers
  - Emphasis on stable, machine-readable identifiers for blocks, plots, subplots, horizons, and samples.
  - Comprehensive metadata capture to ensure data provenance and reproducibility across platforms.
- Archiving and future use
  - Archived soil samples and long-running datasets enable re-analysis with newer techniques; ongoing access and compatibility with evolving data platforms are critical.
- Data integration
  - The structured multi-level design (blocks, plots, subplots) and horizon-level soil data support integration with other long-term ecological datasets and cross-site comparisons.

## Key Takeaways for Data Stewards
- The Sourhope dataset exemplifies robust, long-term ecological data collection across a multi-block experimental framework, combining detailed soil profiles, comprehensive soil chemistry, augmented by vegetation surveys and climate context.
- For effective data stewardship, prioritize:
  - Maintaining complete, richly described metadata including layout, horizon designations, sampling dates, treatments, and archive status.
  - Preserving stable identifiers and linking horizon data to plot/subplot and block metadata.
  - Ensuring archiving of physical samples and clear traceability through MLURI barcodes.
  - Documenting data quality, completeness, and any known limitations to support accurate reuse and cross-study analyses.
  - Facilitating future interoperability with modern data platforms through standardized vocabularies and data dictionaries.
