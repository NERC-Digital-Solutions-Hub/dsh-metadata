# Background

- The NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme was established in 1999 to understand both the biodiversity of soil biota and the functional roles soil organisms play in key ecological processes.
- It funded 24 research projects focusing on soil structure, soil processes (e.g., carbon and nitrogen cycles), and the roles of micro-, meso-, and macro-fauna and flora (bacteria, nematodes, protozoa, fungi, microarthropods, invertebrate root feeders, enchytraeids, molluscs, beetles, etc.).
- The primary field site was Sourhope Field Experiment (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute / James Hutton Institute) in the Scottish Borders, with detailed soil profiling across multiple blocks.

- Context for monitoring and data use:
  - Data are intended to be used to monitor environmental conditions, support comparisons with standards, and enable policy-relevant insights.
  - Outputs are typically delivered as clear formats (e.g., reports, maps, charts) and stored in appropriate data portals.

- Data collection focus in this document:
  - Baseline soil chemistry and moisture data, particularly soil pH and moisture content, collected before and during the early stages of the programme.
  - Baseline sampling design includes central cores from each experimental plot and sub-plot samples within general sampling sub-plots.

- Data and methods overview:
  - Baseline pH measurements and soil moisture content were taken at multiple sampling dates (Mar/Sep 1999, Mar 2000, Mar/Oct 2001, Mar 2002).
  - Baseline sub-plot pH sampling (S T U V sub-plots) to assess spatial variation across the site.
  - pH measurement method involves soil-water suspensions with deionised water, calibration against pH buffers, and standardized readouts.
  - Moisture content calculated from fresh and oven-dried weights.

- Data structure and accessibility:
  - The dataset comprises two CSV files:
    - P2109_BASELINE_PH.csv: baseline soil pH and related fields.
    - P2109_BASELINE_PHSUB.csv: sub-plot pH measurements with associated metadata.
  - Columns include date sampled, treatment, block, main plot, sub-plot (for sub-samples), cell coordinates, soil pH, and moisture.
  - Quality control included numeric range checks, format conformity, and logic checks.
  - The NERC QA procedures do not guarantee data accuracy or fitness for a particular use; no liability is assumed for data use.
  - Data are referenced to the Sourhope Field Data Handbook (2003) and are available as Supporting Information via the EIDC catalogue.

- Site details (Blocks 1–5):
  - Sourhope site comprises five blocks (Blocks 1–5) with distinct grid references, altitudes, slopes, drainage, and soil series (SH 74711 Sourhope; Brown forest soils with and without gleying; various parent materials and rocks).
  - Each block contains soil profile descriptions at multiple depths, illustrating variations in soil color, structure, root distribution, moisture state, stones, mottling, and boundary types.
  - Profiles cover the full vertical sequence from surface to deeper horizons, with detailed horizon-by-horizon descriptions (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, BCx, C horizons), across different blocks (e.g., Block 1 through Block 5).

- Endnotes and caveats:
  - The document provides detailed methodological and structural data intended for environmental monitoring and analysis.
  - The dataset offers a baseline against which future measurements and environmental health indicators can be compared, while acknowledging limitations in data accuracy guarantees.
