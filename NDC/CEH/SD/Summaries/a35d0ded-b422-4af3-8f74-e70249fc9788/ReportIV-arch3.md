# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders) focusing on above-ground productivity, plant diversity, and their links to soil biota and management.

## Monitoring framework and site setup

- Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks, each containing 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; treatments allocated randomly.
- Treatments (plot-level): Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA). All plots receive a common mowing regime; insecticide applied after mowing where designated.
- Management program: Monthly mowing from May to September to ~6 cm; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as appropriate; site-level mowing and targeted plot treatments maintained annually since 1999.
- Research scope: 16 Phase I projects and 7–8 Phase II projects; field campaigns (including 13CO2 pulses) and on-site fieldwork continued across years.

## Data collection and measures

- Weather and abiotic data: On-site Automatic Weather Station for rainfall, radiation, air/soil temperature; data gaps in 2002 due to station malfunction (some substitutes from Konza station).
- Above-ground productivity: Annual biomass estimates from 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots S/T/U/V before each mow; biomass dried and weighed.
- Botanical surveys: Baseline 1998; ongoing point analysis surveys (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells with 100-hole frame and 25-point pins to record species touching vegetation profile; bryophyte identification improved in 2002.
- Soil chemistry and moisture: Soil pH measured at ~5 cm depth since 1998 (2002 re-measured in plot centers and point-analysis cells); soil moisture measured by theta probe in 2002 in point-analysis cells.
- Additional surveys: Small-scale vegetation cover estimates, biomass sorting by species, and targeted plot surveys; Appendix datasets document extensive supplementary data.
- Data management notes: Large multi-year dataset with multiple projects; some years had incomplete plot-level surveys (e.g., Control 2 not surveyed in 2000–2001); data gaps and cross-year integration necessitated careful metadata logging and cross-referencing across appendices.

## Key findings and interpretation (2002 focus)

- Biomass productivity and treatment effects
  - Overall biomass productivity increased across years since 1999; 2002 biomass slightly lower than 2001 but higher than the 1999 baseline.
  - Highest productivity in plots with both nitrogen and lime; nitrogen or lime alone also productive; control plots (not Fertilised) lag behind.
  - A clear year-by-treatment interaction; 2002 shows significant treatment effects and a notable year effect.
  - Slope position: lower slope blocks showed larger relative declines in biomass, indicating micro-topographic influences on productivity.
- Soil chemistry, moisture, and productivity
  - Lime raises soil pH toward ~7 in upper soil profile; nitrogen has a smaller positive effect on pH.
  - Positive overall link between higher soil pH and biomass, but the relationship weakens or reverses in plots with both nitrogen and lime.
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and soil pH; wetter plots are more acidic and less productive in some treatments.
- Plant community composition and diversity
  - Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declining (>40% since 2000) across most treatments; possible mowing-related homogenization or other site-level factors.
  - Festuca rubra expands in more fertile, lime- and/or nitrogen-treated plots; Festuca ovina remains prevalent in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophytes (mosses and liverworts) increase across the site, especially in unimproved plots, contributing a growing fraction of total hits and biomass.
  - Point analysis shows shifts in species frequency with management: more Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra in improved plots; unimproved plots dominated by Festuca ovina and other species.
  - Diversity (Shannon index): significant treatment effects emerged after 2000; 2002 diversity declined in Nitrogen & Lime plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed increases.
  - Functional group dynamics (CSR framework)
    - Stress-tolerant (S) and competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) groups increase in unimproved plots; N & Lime plots favor competitive species (C-S-R dynamics).
    - SR/CSR groups reduce in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
  - Functional group composition changes align with soil chemistry and disturbance: higher pH and fertility promote competitive types; reduced disturbance (grazing exclusion) favors stress-tolerant taxa.
- Insecticide effects and disturbance
  - Insecticide plots show higher relative diversity in 2002; this aligns with literature suggesting complex plant-herbivore interactions where herbivore suppression can affect diversity, but causality remains cautious.
  - Trampling and disturbance: first-year introduction of trampling in C2 plots (testing 13CO2 pulses) appears linked to lower productivity, highlighting the importance of disturbance regimes on short-term productivity.
- Multivariate patterns
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) of point-analysis data separates treated vs. unimproved plots, with lime-treated plots clustering together; nitrogen-treated plots show varied affinities depending on block.
  - Bryophyte data indicate consistent increases across treatments, yet bryophyte proliferation is most pronounced in unimproved plots, potentially dampening vascular plant dominance in those plots.

## Implications for monitoring and policy decisions

- Management trade-offs
  - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) boosts productivity but may reduce plant diversity and shift communities toward competitive functional types.
  - Regular mowing reduces certain grasses and promotes mosses; disturbance removal can favor stress-tolerant species, potentially reducing overall diversity.
  - Lime-induced pH increases can enhance growth but may also alter plant functional dynamics and moisture relationships.
  - Insecticides may influence diversity via herbivory pressures, though causal links require careful interpretation.
- Monitoring approach recommendations
  - Use a multi-metric framework: productivity (biomass), species composition, bryophyte dynamics, and functional-group (CSR) classification to capture both structure and function.
  - Integrate abiotic context (soil pH, moisture) with biotic responses to interpret productivity and diversity trends.
  - Maintain robust, transparent data management with complete metadata; document data gaps and cross-year comparability (e.g., missing plots or years, weather station gaps).
  - Consider disturbance regimes (grazing exclusion, trampling) as explicit drivers of biodiversity and productivity in monitoring frameworks.
- Policy-relevant takeaways
  - Long-term monitoring across management regimes is essential to understand trade-offs between agricultural productivity and biodiversity.
  - Soil chemistry management (lime) should be balanced with moisture dynamics to avoid potential declines in productivity under very high pH or low moisture.
  - Biodiversity indicators (diversity indices, functional-group composition, bryophyte dynamics) should accompany productivity measures in grassland policy assessments.

## Data quality, gaps, and governance notes

- Data gaps: 2002 weather data gaps due to station malfunction; some plot surveys not conducted every year (e.g., Control 2 in 2000–2001).
- Cross-year integration: Complex multi-project dataset requiring careful metadata management to ensure comparability and interpretation across years and treatments.
- Data governance implications for monitoring frameworks: Emphasizes need for standardized metadata, documentation of missing data, and transparency in cross-study data sharing to support policy analysis and decision-making.
