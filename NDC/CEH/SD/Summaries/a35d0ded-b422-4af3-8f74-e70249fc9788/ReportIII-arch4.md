# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on Sourhope field experiments at MLURI’s Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders).
- Aimed to provide a broad context for researchers by collecting multiple data types (weather, biomass, soil pH, botanical composition) across 1999–2001, with methods aligned to the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998).
- 2001 management affected by Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change in site leadership, influencing sampling logistics and timing.

## Data streams and measurements
- Automatic Weather Station (2001): headline data generally unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average; radiation stable; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.
- Above-ground biomass (1999–2001): consistent treatment hierarchy; peak biomass in July/August; 2001 biomass higher than earlier years, likely due to personnel change and switch from manual to mechanical cutting; biomass normalized to control (C1) to compare treatment effects; ANOVA shows significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs. non-improved plots and a treatment-by-year interaction.
- Soil pH (top 5 cm): liming continues to raise pH; nitrogen addition also raises pH somewhat; control plots show little change since baseline (Aug 1998).
- Botanical composition (July 2001 Point Analysis): greater total hits in 2001 vs 2000 (suggesting higher sward density after grazing removal in 1998); treatment differences in dominant species emerged; improved plots favor Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, and other fertilized-associated species; unimproved plots maintain species linked to poorer pastures (e.g., Agrostis capillaris remains common only in some controls); diversity (number of species) appears to decline in the most improved plots (24 vs 18 in improved plots).
- Data processing and analysis: biomass data transformed (ln) for ANOVAs; Genstat 5 used; PCA applied to Point Quadrat data to assess community shifts; survey reliability checked by comparing two surveyors with no significant difference in results.

## Management context and data collection logistics
- 2001 site activity: FMD restrictions limited site access Feb–May 2001; ongoing activities (liming, N application, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued under controlled protocols; first biocide application in May was missed, others completed; site management officer change occurred in May 2001.
- Data collection schedule and scope documented (e.g., mowing on five occasions per summer, soil sampling counts per year, and detailed survey timelines in the table set).

## Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
- 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community: pronounced spatial heterogeneity observed; right-hand columns laterally facing slope showed more acidic plots, particularly in nitrogen and/or lime treatments.
- 3.2 Variation in biomass: some plots consistently low in biomass are on the site edges; central plots tend to have higher biomass; strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant block differences.

## Key findings relevant to data strategy
- Treatment effects on productivity are robust, with nitrogen and/or lime most clearly boosting above-ground biomass; lime is effective in raising pH, and nitrogen also contributes to pH shifts.
- Biodiversity indicators changed with treatments: density increased in 2001; improved plots show communities associated with fertilized, higher-fertility conditions (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) while unimproved plots retain species linked to lower fertility.
- Biomass correlates with certain species abundances; increases in Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis align with higher biomass, while some grasses and bryophytes decline as productivity rises.
- Spatial heterogeneity and pH-biomass relationships underscore the importance of region-specific metadata and stratified analysis in long-term field experiments.

## Data governance, quality, and accessibility considerations
- Weather and site data: weather data collected on-site and transmitted to the CEH Data Manager; measurements and protocols are well-documented (including sampling depths, dates, and mowing schedules).
- Documentation and metadata: comprehensive tabular and figure-based outputs (Tables 1–6, Figures 1–9, Appendix 1) with species codes and survey methodologies; data normalization and transformation steps clearly described.
- Measurement consistency: cross-surveyor validation showed no significant differences; however, methodological changes (manual to mechanical cutting) impacted biomass figures and required normalization for year-to-year comparisons.
- External disruption: FMD-related access restrictions introduced data collection gaps and required adherence to a strict protocol during restricted periods.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Integrate multi-source field data (environmental, biological, and management) with explicit metadata for depth, timing, and methods; ensure consistent versioning across years.
- Anticipate and plan for disruptions (policy events like FMD) by embedding flexible sampling protocols and clear data governance to maintain comparability.
- Emphasize documentation of treatment regimes, spatial heterogeneity, and methodological changes to support cross-year analyses and networked data use.
- Maintain and share data in a centralized, well-documented repository (as evidenced by data transmission to CEH and reported data management practices) to support broader data-sharing and collaborative research across partner networks.
