## Data management and accessibility

- Each horizon and horizon-aggregate measurement is linked to MLURI barcodes (e.g., FH 603951–603960 family; Ah/AB/Bg/BCg/Cg 603957–603963; Auger samples 603918–603929; ECOTRON 603930).
- Data tables document per-horizon chemistry, horizon descriptions, and subplot-level vegetation counts, designed for long-term analysis and cross-block comparability.
- Outputs include site baseline data, horizon descriptors, archived samples, and vegetation inventories aligned with ECN/Micronet context.

## Key implications for analysis and policy context

- Substantial vertical and lateral variability in soil chemistry and texture within BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5 highlights the importance of local-scale scale effects when modelling soil–vegetation interactions.
- Very high surface horizon carbon and LOI values (FH in BLOCK 4; Ah/AB in BLOCK 5) indicate strong organic matter inputs and decomposition dynamics, influencing C:N ratios and nutrient availability.
- Low pH and low Ca availability in CaCl2-extractable form across horizons suggest acidic, nutrient-poor conditions common to these upland soils, with implications for plant community composition and potential liming or nutrient amendment scenarios.
- Indicator and dominant plant species align with base-poor, damp grassland communities; microhabitat variation (mottling, stones, moisture) appears to drive subcommunity structure and species turnover.
- The ECOTRON integration provides a controlled deep-dive dataset suitable for linking field observations to larger environmental-change narratives and policy-relevant biodiversity questions.
