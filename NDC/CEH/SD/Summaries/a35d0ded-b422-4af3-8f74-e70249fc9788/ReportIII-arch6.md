# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; intensive study at Sourhope farm to provide context for broader studies and enable year-to-year comparisons.
  - A broad monitoring regime described in the Baseline Data Survey (Nov 1998) to help various research groups relate their data and compare across years.
  - 2001 site management and personnel changes affected sampling but core activities (liming, nitrogen application, pH measurements, biomass collections, vegetation cutting, and Point Analysis) largely continued according to the Site Management Plan.

- Data streams and measurements
  - Automatic Weather Station: continuous weather data including rainfall, radiation, temperature, and soil moisture (1999–2001; 2001 headline measures).
  - Above-ground biomass: multi-date summer harvests (May–Sept) across sub-plots; biomass weights used to assess treatment effects and year-to-year changes.
  - Soil pH: upper 5 cm soil pH measurements (baseline 1998; follow-up 2001) to track liming and nitrogen effects.
  - Botanical composition: July 2001 Point Quadrat surveys (and 2000 for comparison) to determine species abundance and community shifts; cross-check of surveyors showed no significant bias (p = 0.18; F = 1.90).
  - Site activity and protocol: detailed scheduling of soil sampling, measurements, mowing, botanical surveys, and other observations (Tables and Figures referenced in Report II/III).

- Key findings
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average after a very wet prior year.
    - Radiation/Browning: total radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Consistent treatment hierarchy across sampling periods; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 shows a notable biomass increase vs. previous years, likely due to a change in personnel and the switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalizing against the control (C1) reveals continued positive effects of nitrogen and, to a lesser extent, lime on productivity.
    - ANOVA on biomass (log-transformed) indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots and a significant Treatment×Year interaction; no significant block effect.
  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime additions continue to raise pH; October 2001 pH: limed plots ~6.19; N&L plots ~6.38.
    - Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent; control plots show no significant change since baseline (1998).
  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - 24 species identified in unimproved treatments (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen, Lime, and Nitrogen&Lime plots, suggesting diversity changes with fertility improvements.
    - 2001 shifts in species abundance: Agrostis capillaris declines across treatments; Festuca spp. increase and are more frequent in fertilized plots; species associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) are more apparent in the fertilized plots.
    - PCA shows clear separation between nitrogen and/or lime plots versus control/biocide plots; unimproved plots tend toward species like Agrostis vinealis, bryophytes, Nardus stricta, Anthoxanthum odoratum.
    - Biomass correlates with species abundance: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively associated with higher biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes decline as biomass increases; increased litter in plots with nitrogen and/or lime indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Additional insights
    - A higher total number of species in 2001 (across most plots) with a corresponding shift toward more abundant grasses in improved plots.
    - The study linked above-ground biomass to species composition, showing functional changes in response to nutrient and liming treatments.

- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F showed more acidic plots than those on the left side; patterns may be influenced by plot type (many Controls/Biocide in those columns) but underlying heterogeneity persists.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass distribution shows outliers with the lowest biomass dispersed across several treatments.
    - Higher biomass generally located in central plots (e.g., specific Nitrogen and Lime plots; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - There is a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant difference in biomass across blocks.
    - Overall, spatial structure observed complements treatment effects and supports the use of block-based experimental design.

- Data quality and interpretation notes
  - Cross-surveyor reliability: no significant surveyor bias detected in 2001 botanical survey, supporting data consistency.
  - Data normalization and analyses: biomass analyses used log transformation; PCA used to explore species–treatment relationships; correlations examined between biomass and major species.
  - External events considered: FMD-related access restrictions (Feb–May 2001) and a change in site leadership affected sampling; management plan maintained, with veterinary protocol for sampling thereafter.
  - The dataset provides year-to-year comparability and links to broader research activities within the Soil Biodiversity Programme.

- Practical implications for data use
  - The multi-year, multi-variable dataset enables cross-cutting analyses of fertilization, liming, and management on biomass, soil chemistry, and plant community composition.
  - Data are structured to support self-service exploration: treatment effects, year effects, and spatial heterogeneity can be explored via ANOVA and PCA outputs; biomass–community relationships offer actionable insights into fertility-driven vegetation changes.
  - Findings underscore the importance of consistent measurement protocols and monitoring cadence for comparative ecology studies, especially in field experiments with management interruptions.

- Appendix and data accessibility
  - Appendix 1 provides annualized above-ground biomass per plot; figures and tables (e.g., Tables 1–6, Figures 1–9) support data interpretation and cross-study comparability.
