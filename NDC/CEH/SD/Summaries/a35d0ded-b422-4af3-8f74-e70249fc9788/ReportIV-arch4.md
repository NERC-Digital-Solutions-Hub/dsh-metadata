# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, focused on an intensive field experiment at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute) to understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, and how soil processes and organisms link to above-ground plant communities.
  - The programme includes multiple projects (Phase I and II) studying soil structure, carbon and nitrogen cycles, micro- and macro-fauna, with attention to feedbacks to vascular and non-vascular plants.

- Experimental design and treatments
  - Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients.
  - Layout: Each block contains 6 main plots, subdivided into 10 sub-plots, using a 0.5 m x 0.5 m cell system to allocate treatments.
  - Management and treatments (since 1999): 
    - Site-wide mowing to ~6 cm (May–Sept; monthly).
    - Plot-level treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide.
    - Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied to designated plots after mowing.
    - Fertility: Nitrogen (NH4NO3) and lime (CaCO3) applied in spring, with defined annual rates.
  - Data collection programs run since 1999 (biomass, soil pH, moisture, point quadrats, bryophyte monitoring).

- Data collected and methods
  - Weather: On-site Automatic Weather Station since Feb 1999; records rainfall, radiation, temperature.
  - Above-ground biomass: 0.5 m2 sampling within sub-plots, dried and weighed; five cuts each summer, 1999–2002.
  - Vegetation surveys: Baseline in 1998; annual 0.5 m2 point analyses in 2000, 2001, 2002 using a 100-hole grid; species touched by a pin recorded.
  - Soil measures: pH (0–5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe, 2002).
  - Bryophytes and species lists: Detailed bryophyte identification added in 2002; full species lists in Appendix 3.
  - Data scope and access: Appendix 1–8 provide site maps, treatment allocations, biomass data, species lists, and survey results; total site soil samples ~11,621 collected to date.

- Key findings on plant productivity and composition
  - Biomass and productivity
    - General long-term increase in above-ground biomass across all treatments from 1999 to 2002.
    - Nitrogen and Lime together (N&L) produce the highest productivity; fertilised plots outperform unfertilised ones.
    - 2002: biomass fell relative to 2001 across many plots (13.7% in N&L to 31.2% in Control 2), with a pronounced slope-position effect (Block 1 bottom to Block 5 upper slope showing larger declines).
  - Mowing effects
    - Consistent decline of Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments, suggesting a site-level response to mowing, not driven by a specific treatment.
    - Festuca rubra expands especially in fertilised plots; mosses (bryophytes) expand across the site, aided by a ~6 cm sward height from regular mowing and reduced grazing.
    - Mowing and loss of grazing disturbance tend to favor stress-tolerant and moss-dominated communities, reducing some ruderal/competitive species.
  - Fertilisation effects
    - Fertilisation (N and/or lime) enhances productivity; lime raises soil pH toward 7.0; high lime rates may limit moisture and lead to chlorosis in some plots.
    - Interaction: C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species become more dominant in N&L plots; stress-tolerant (S) species dominate unimproved plots.
    - Higher pH and lower soil moisture in limed plots influence plant functional composition and biomass-yield relationships.
  - Insecticide effects
    - While direct links between reduced herbivory and higher diversity are not firmly established, results align with literature suggesting insect herbivory can shape diversity; insecticide-treated plots show some shifts in abundance of certain species and functional groups.
  - Trampling and disturbances
    - 2002 C2 plots (insecticide plots) show unusually low productivity likely due to trampling during intense activity for labelled 13CO2 pulses, illustrating how experiment-specific disturbances can impact biomass.
  - Community diversity and functional groups
    - Shannon diversity indices: increases observed in several treatments after 2000, with significant treatment effects emerging in 2001–2002; 2002 index fell by 15% in N&L plots versus increases in other treatments.
    - Point Analysis: improved pastures (Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) dominated in N&L and Lime plots, whereas unimproved plots remained dominated by Agrostis spp. and bryophytes; bryophyte contribution to hits rose over the years, particularly in unimproved plots.
    - Bryophyte abundance: Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and other bryophytes increase across treatments, with the highest bryophyte hits in unimproved plots (Control and Insecticide).
  - Functional group dynamics (CSR framework)
    - CSR classification used to interpret shifts: N&L plots show a shift toward competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) dynamics; unimproved plots favor stress-tolerators (S); SR/CSR groups decline with increasing disturbance and fertilisation.
    - Lime and nitrogen together reduce SR/CSR relative to other treatments.
  - Relationships with soil chemistry and moisture
    - Soil pH rises strongly with lime; nitrogen also raises pH modestly; higher pH correlates with higher productivity in aggregate but shows treatment-dependent patterns when examined per-treatment.
    - A negative relationship between soil moisture and pH is evident; higher pH plots tend to be drier, linking nutrient status to water stress and productivity.

- Data quality, anomalies, and documentation
  - 2002 weather data had gaps due to a multifunction station malfunction (July–November); approximate data substituted from a nearby Konza station for missing periods; Appendix 5 documents data caveats and corrections.
  - Detailed Appendices (1–8) provide comprehensive treatment mapping, species lists, biomass time series, PCA and diversity analyses, and annualised biomass data per plot and block.

- Implications for data leaders (data strategy, governance, and system design)
  - Longitudinal, multi-project data integration
    - The Sourhope site demonstrates a rich, multi-year, multi-treatment dataset linking above-ground production, species composition, and soil variables, suitable for cross-project data sharing and synthesis.
  - Metadata, standardization, and data provenance
    - Comprehensive documentation of treatments, plot layouts, sampling cells, and data collection methods is essential to enable cross-study reuse and accurate cross-treatment comparisons.
  - Data quality and continuity
    - Long-running datasets require robust handling of data gaps (e.g., weather station outages) and transparent logging of data imputations or substitutions.
  - Measurement consistency and comparability
    - Standardized protocols for biomass sampling, point analyses, bryophyte taxonomy, soil pH, and moisture are critical for reliable trend analysis across years and treatments.
  - Data governance and access
    - Need for centralized data management (versioning, access controls, data dictionaries) to support collaboration among multiple research groups and phases.
  - Actionable insights for strategy
    - The study highlights how management practices (grazing exclusion, mowing, fertilisation, and pest control) interact with plant functional groups and ecosystem productivity, reinforcing the value of integrated data to guide land-management decisions and biodiversity outcomes.
