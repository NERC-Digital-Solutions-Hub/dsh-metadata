# SUMMARY

- Context and aims
  - Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope, a large field experiment studies links between soil biodiversity and above-ground plant communities.
  - Focuses on above-ground biomass (productivity), plant species composition, and diversity, in relation to five management steps: mowing, fertilisation (nitrogen and lime), and insecticide application.
  - Experimental backdrop: grazing excluded since 1998; plots arranged in blocks with replicated treatments to explore responses of plant communities to nutrient status, soil pH, and disturbance.

- Experimental design and management
  - Site: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, with 5 replicate blocks, each containing 6 main plots subdivided into sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells used for data collection.
  - Treatments (plot-level): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen + Lime, Insecticide (formerly Biocide; Dursban 4).
  - Site-level management: monthly mowing May–September to ~6 cm; insecticide applied after mowing on relevant plots; spring applications of nitrogen and/or lime as specified.
  - Data collection since 1999: automatic weather data; above-ground biomass by clipping 0.5 m2 cells; baseline vegetation survey in 1998; annual and cross-year point analyses (2000–2002); soil pH (to ~5 cm), soil moisture measurements; bryophyte and vascular plant surveys; and extensive Appendix data (species lists, biomass by plot, etc.).

- Key results by major themes
  - Mowing effect
    - Consistent decline of Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis since 2000, suggesting mowing (homogenous cuts) and/or absence of grazing as site-level factors.
    - Festuca rubra expands, especially in fertilised plots; bryophytes (mosses) increase across the site, partly due to a ~6 cm sward height maintained by mowing and lack of grazing.
    - Stress-tolerant species show strong gains across most plots, while ruderal/species favored by disturbance (SR/C-S-R) diminish overall, consistent with reduced disturbance after grazing removal.
  - Fertilisation effect
    - Clear positive effect of nitrogen and/or lime on above-ground biomass; plots with both nitrogen and lime are the most productive, though signs of a possible plateau or approaching constraints (soil pH near 7.0, lower soil moisture) in some high-nutrient plots.
    - Lime raises soil pH substantially (to ~7.0 in upper soil), with nitrogen also increasing pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Positive pH–biomass relationship at the system level; within some fertilised plots, the pH–biomass link is weaker or even reversed when both nitrogen and lime are applied, suggesting complex interactions with moisture and nutrient availability.
    - Functional shift: nitrogen and lime together favour competitive, stress-sensitive (C-S-R) species; stress-tolerant (S) species dominate in unfertilised/unimproved plots.
  - Insecticide effect
    - Evidence suggests higher plant diversity (Shannon index) in insecticide-treated plots, but causal links to reduced herbivory are not definitively established; potential mechanisms include increased palatable species survival when herbivory pressure declines.
  - Trampling effect
    - In the newly sampled C2 plots (2002), productivity fell relative to C1 plots, likely due to trampling during intense 13CO2 pulse activities, not a direct treatment effect.
  - Community composition and functional groups
    - Point-analysis (2002) shows clear treatment differences in species frequency; improved plots (nitrogen and/or lime) show higher frequencies of grasses like Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra, while unimproved plots retain more Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp.
    - Bryophyte hits increase across treatments, with notable increases in Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus; bryophytes are particularly abundant in unimproved plots and in years 2001–2002.
    - Principal Components Analysis separates improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster distinctly, with nitrogen-treated plots showing mixed positioning relative to lime and control/insecticide plots.
  - Functional-type dynamics (CSR framework)
    - Three dominant functional groups (stress-tolerators S; competitive-stress-ruderal CSR; and SR/CSR) account for the majority of live vascular plant hits.
    - Over time, C-S-R species expand in plots with nitrogen and lime; stress-tolerant species become more prominent in unimproved plots; SR/CSR species are reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots.
    - By 2002, treatment differences among the functional groups were statistically significant, underscoring how management shifts plant functional traits and community structure.

- Enduring patterns and data highlights
  - Biomass trend: long-term increase in productivity across treatments since 1999, but 2002 shows an overall decline relative to 2001 in several treatments and blocks, with the largest declines in certain blocks and in Control/less fertilised plots.
  - Soil chemistry and moisture status: lime strongly raises pH; higher pH correlates with higher biomass across the site, but interactions with moisture and nitrogen can modify this relationship in complex ways.
  - Species dynamics: Festuca rubra gains strongest in fertilised plots; Agrostis spp. declines; bryophyte expansion is notable site-wide; grasses associated with improved pastures account for a large share of total hits in fertilised plots.
  - Data and accessibility: extensive appendices include species lists, biomass by plot, weather data, and point-analysis results, with a move toward making datasets more discoverable and usable.

- Implications and takeaways
  - Disturbance regime and nutrient status jointly shape plant community trajectories: mowing and grazing removal promote stress-tolerant and bryophytic expansion, while fertilisation shifts communities toward competitive, high-nutrient species.
  - Nitrogen and lime together produce the strongest biomass responses but may drive functional shifts toward C-S-R dominance and potentially lower diversity of certain bryophyte and vascular groups.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are plausible but require cautious interpretation due to limited causal evidence; potential link via herbivory suppression affecting palatable species.
  - Trampling and site activity can transiently depress productivity; careful management needed to avoid confounding factors in long-term analyses.
  - Ongoing monitoring, including robust data sharing (Appendices and site portals), will be essential to predict responses to future management and climate variations, and to understand how above- and below-ground diversity co-evolve under altered disturbance and nutrient regimes.
