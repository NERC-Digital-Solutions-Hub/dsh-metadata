# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Context
  - Large field experiment as part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope Farm, Macaulay Institute, Scottish Borders.
  - A baseline data survey from Nov 1998 underpins the monitoring; the report follows the same structure as Report II to aid cross-year comparisons.
  - 2001 site events: government restrictions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (no visitors Feb–May 2001; protocol-based sampling resumed thereafter) and a change in the site officer in May 2001.
  - Monitoring includes Automatic Weather Station data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) composition.

- 2. Results

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 headline weather data generally unremarkable: rainfall near long-term average; total annual radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in earlier years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear treatment hierarchy in biomass across the season; peak biomass in July/August.
    - 2001 biomass markedly higher than in 1999–2000, likely due to a combination of staff change and a shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears starting 2001.
    - Biomass analyses normalised to C1 to compare treatment effects; nitrogen and lime show strongest positive effects on biomass.
    - ANOVA on ln-transformed biomass: significant differences between improved (N and/or L added) vs. unimproved plots; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effects.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition raises surface pH (0–5 cm depth): October 2001 averages 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also raises pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots show no significant change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 point-quadrat survey largely consistent with July 2000; high inter-surveyor consistency (no significant difference between surveyors).
    - Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000 across all treatments, suggesting the sward density increased after grazing stock removal in 1998.
    - Treatment-specific shifts in dominant species:
      - Agrostis capillaris declines across all treatments in 2001 (except Control 1 and Limed plots).
      - Festuca species increase across treatments; Festuca rubra more common in limed plots; Festuca ovina in N and N+L plots.
      - Improved plots show more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis (and other pasture-enhancing species) linked to N and/or Lime.
      - Less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more prevalent in untreated Control plots.
    - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved plots (Control, Biocide) vs 18 in Nitrogen/Lime plots, suggesting potential diversity loss with improvement.
    - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) indicates clear separation of nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; improved plots show greater presence of Festuca rubra and related grasses.
    - Correlations with above-ground biomass (summer 2001): higher biomass associates with increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; declines in abundance of Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes, and Agrostis vinealis as biomass rises.
    - Litter increases in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, implying faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- 3. Site heterogeneity

  - 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
    - Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F (slope-facing right) showed comparatively more acidic plots, a pattern amplified by high proportions of Control or Biocide plots in those columns.
    - Underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site influences observed pH differences, particularly in N- and/or Lime-improved columns.

  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
    - Biomass values show spatial patterns: outlying plots with the lowest biomass are scattered; central plots tend to have higher biomass (e.g., N+L plot 2E; Lime plot 2C; Biocide plot 2D; Control 1 plot 2B).
    - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
    - No significant differences between blocks in biomass (statistical test reported as NS for Block ANOVA).
