# Description of the data

- Study aim and scope
  - Molecular analysis of tsetse flies to detect trypanosome species and tsetse endosymbionts
  - Focused on Hurungwe District, Mashonaland West Province, Zimbabwe (sleeping sickness focus)
  - Samples collected Feb–Nov 2014; part of DDDA C research on disease ecology
- Study organisms and targets
  - Tsetse species: Glossina morsitans morsitans (Gmm) and Glossina pallidipes (Gp)
  - Trypanosome species examined: T. brucei s.l., T. b. rhodesiense, T. vivax, T. congolense, T. simiae, T. simiae (Tsavo), T. godfreyi
  - Endosymbionts examined: Sodalis glossinidius and Wolbachia spp.
- Sampling design
  - 101 Gmm and 108 Gp tsetse analyzed
  - Sampling methods: Epsilon traps and fly rounds
  - Transect: 110 km long, at 10 km intervals; 3 km fly rounds at 12 sites, repeated 11 times over ~7 months
  - Additional traps deployed at selected sites
- Laboratory and molecular methods
  - DNA extraction from tsetse stored in cryotubes (desiccant beads) and kept at -20°C
  - Endosymbiont detection:
    - Sodalis glossinidius: GroEL PCR
    - Wolbachia: FtsZ and wsp PCRs
  - Trypanosome detection:
    - ITS-PCR to discriminate trypanosome species/subspecies by amplicon size
    - SRA gene PCR for T. brucei s.l. positives to identify human-infective strains
  - Quality controls: negative and positive controls included; PCR products visualized on 1.5% agarose gel with GelRed
  - Sample exclusion: samples negative for Wigglesworthia (n=4) discarded due to suspected insufficient DNA
- Data file and structure
  - Dataset: Hurungwe_tsetse_PCR.csv
  - Variables (binary indicators; 1 = positive, 0 = negative)
    - Species (Gmm or Gp)
    - Sex (Male or Female)

    - Trypanosoma_godfreyi
    - Trypanosoma_simiae_(Tsavo)
    - Trypanosoma_simiae
    - Trypanosoma_congolense

- Data generation and reporting
  - 2092 tsetse flies underwent microscopic examination for infections
  - Molecular analyses performed on a subset after initial microscopy
  - Amplicon sizes validated against a 100 bp ladder; results recorded as present/absent
- Potential analyses and data products for data support
  - Correlations between trypanosome presence and endosymbiont infections
  - Association of infections with tsetse species and sex
  - Spatial patterns along the 110 km transect and across the 12 sites
  - Self-serve data products such as dashboards or pivot tables summarizing prevalence by species, endosymbiont status, and parasite
- Context and references
  - Methods and PCR targets aligned with cited works (e.g., ITS-PCR for trypanosomes, SRA gene for human-infective strains, endosymbiont detection assays)
  - Study contributes to understanding trypanosomiasis, well-being, and ecosystem relationships under the DDDA Consortium and supported by NERC/ESPA
- Limitations and caveats (from dataset notes)
  - Some data may be missing or excluded due to DNA quality concerns (e.g., four samples discarded)
  - Data reflect a single 2014 sampling period and locality; broader generalizability may be limited
  - Microscopy and molecular results provide presence/absence indicators; quantitative parasite load not included in the provided variables
