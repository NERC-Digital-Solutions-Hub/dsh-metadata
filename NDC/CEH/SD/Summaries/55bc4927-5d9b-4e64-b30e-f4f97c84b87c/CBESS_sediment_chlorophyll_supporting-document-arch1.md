# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) surface sediment chlorophyll concentrations in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats

- Objective and scope
  - Dataset documenting concentrations of chlorophyll a, b, and c1+c2 in surface sediments (2 mm) of microphytobenthos (MPB) in saltmarsh and mudflat habitats.
  - Measured as micrograms per gram of sediment (µg g−1).
  - Seasonality: winter and summer 2013; five replicates per quadrat; part of the CBESS field campaign.

- Locations and habitat contrasts
  - Essex region
    - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51°47′N, 0°52′E
    - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51°49′N, 0°58′E
    - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51°41′N, 0°56′E
    - Saltmarsh soils: predominantly clay; mudflat sediments: cohesive clays, mud, silt
  - Morecambe Bay region
    - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54°10′N, 3°0′W
    - Warton Sands (WS) – 54°08′N, 2°48′W
    - West Plain (WP) – 54°09′N, 2°58′W
    - Saltmarsh soils: sandy soils; mudflat sediments: coarse, mobile sediments
  - Essex vs. Morecambe Bay saltmarsh regions differ in inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation

- Sampling design and field procedures
  - 22 randomly allocated 1 m × 1 m quadrats per mudflat and per saltmarsh site
  - Sampling across two habitats (mudflat and saltmarsh) at each site
  - Replication: five replicates within each quadrat
  - Spatial scales for sub-sampling (four scales; A–D)
    - A = 1 quadrat
    - B = 1–10 m
    - C = 10–100 m
    - D = 100 m and above
  - Seasonal sampling: winter and summer 2013

- Laboratory methods and data collection
  - Sediment sampling: surface 2 mm layer collected with a contact corer
  - Sample preservation: flash-frozen with liquid nitrogen; stored in darkness below −80°C
  - Extraction and analysis: chlorophyll extracted with acetone; concentrations determined using a Cecil CE3021 spectrophotometer at 630, 647, 664, and 750 nm
  - Calculations: concentrations of chlorophyll a, b, and c1+c2 derived from spectrophotometric readings

- Data treatment, quality control, and formats
  - Calibration and quality checks
    - Scales/calibration performed according to standard laboratory protocols
    - Spectrophotometer accuracy verified with standard chlorophyll solutions
  - Data handling
    - Observations entered into spreadsheets; spectrophotometer software (Cecil Datastream) used for absorption data
    - Data checked for completeness; missing data flagged as NA
  - Data formats and structure
    - File format: comma separated values (.csv)
    - Dataset fields include: Season, Location, Site, Habitat, Quadrat Number, Scale (A–D), Chl a (µg g−1), Chl b (µg g−1), Chl c1+c2 (µg g−1), and StDev (standard deviation)
    - Header and row metadata available to describe each variable (e.g., Season: Winter/W; Location: Morecambe/M; Essex/E)
  - Data provenance and metadata
    - Staff responsible for dataset: Jack Maunder
    - Location coordinates and site descriptions provided to contextualize sampling design and habitat contrasts

- Notes on interpretation and accessibility
  - Sampling represents a snapshot within 2013 field campaigns; no planned repeat sampling noted
  - Data are designed to support analyses of spatial and seasonal patterns in MPB chlorophyll concentrations across contrasting saltmarsh and mudflat habitats and between Essex and Morecambe Bay regions
  - Datasets are structured to enable cross-site comparisons and integration with related CBESS datasets through documented metadata and standardized formats
