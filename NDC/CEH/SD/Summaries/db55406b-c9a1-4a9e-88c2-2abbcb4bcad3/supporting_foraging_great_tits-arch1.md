# Data Collection

- Context and aim
  - Part of a NERC-funded Independent Research Fellowship examining the role of social information in the evolution of prey defences.
  - Model system: great tits; validation of using video playback to study learned associations between prey characteristics and distastefulness.

- Location and housing
  - Conducted at the University of Jyväskylä Research Station, Konnevesi, Finland.
  - Acclimatization and housing details: birds kept in individual wooden cages, with controlled light; water available; ad libitum sunflower seeds and tallow; food deprivation for 2 hours prior to experiments to motivate foraging.

- Subjects
  - 56 birds captured between 17 Oct 2013 and 24 Jan 2014: 12 adult females, 16 adult males, 13 juvenile females, 15 juvenile males.
  - Birds caught in groups of five; one adult male designated as demonstrator.
  - Some individuals (14) used for both validation and main experiment.
  - Birds released back at their capture sites after completion.

- Experimental design overview
  - Two main components:
    - Video playback validation: assess whether birds learn from demonstrations shown via video.
    - Foraging experiment: test foraging choices after observing demonstrator behavior and to compare social versus control conditions.

- Video playback validation setup
  - Test chamber details: birds acclimated for 2 hours, then exposed to a video of an adult male foraging on a bitter mealworm (chloroquine) with characteristic disgust responses (beak wiping, head shaking).
  - Comparison: control videos showing the cup without a demonstrator.
  - Foraging task: birds trained to open paper packets containing almond; aviar y environment with cryptic (cross symbol) and aposematic (square symbol) prey.
  - Procedure: video shown prior to free foraging; observed two-minute intervals (nymphal movements) and one-minute intervals (adult female movements); test ended after 12 prey items; repeat on two consecutive days before release.

- Data collection for video playback validation
  - BirdID: unique identifier.
  - Sex; Age (juvenile or adult).
  - Date.of.test: date of the validation test.
  - Treatment: social (demonstrator video) or control (cup-only video).
  - Cup.colour.chosen: color of cup landed on first (red, white, or brown).

- Data collection for the foraging experiment
  - BirdID; Sex; Age (juvenile or adult).
  - Treatment: social (demonstrator video) or control (cup-only video).
  - DemonstratorID: ID of the demonstrator bird used in the video for the social treatment.
  - Test: number of days the test was repeated (three-day window).
  - Date.of.test: date of the experiment.
  - time.out.box: time (in seconds) for the bird to enter the aviary.
  - first.prey.taken: whether the first prey item taken was aposematic or cryptic.
  - number.apo.prey.taken: count of aposematic prey taken across the test.
  - number.cryptic.prey.taken: count of cryptic prey taken across the test.
  - Incl.in.validation: whether the bird was included in the validation test.
  - Validation.treatment: whether the validation used social or control treatment.
