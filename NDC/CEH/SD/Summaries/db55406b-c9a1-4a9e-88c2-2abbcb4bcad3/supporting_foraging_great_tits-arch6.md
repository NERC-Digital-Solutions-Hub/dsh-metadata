# Data Collection

- Aim and context
  - NERC-funded Independent Research Fellowship exploring the role of social information in the evolution of prey defences.
  - Model system: great tits; objective to test whether birds learn to associate prey characteristics with distastefulness by observing a demonstrator via video playback.

- Study location and population
  - Conducted at the University of Jyväskylä Research Station, Konnevesi, Finland.
  - Coordinates: 62°37.7′ N, 026°17′ E.
  - Population characteristics: abundant local population; established capture protocol and housing facility.

- Experimental design and validation
  - Two linked components: video playback validation (demonstrator-driven cues) and foraging experiment (prey take decisions).
  - Validation involved demonstrating disgust responses (beak wiping, head shaking) when a demonstrator fed a bitter prey item.
  - Controls used video of the feeding cups without a demonstrator.

- Sample and housing
  - Total birds caught: 56 (17 adult females, 16 adult males, 13 juvenile females, 15 juvenile males) between 17 Oct 2013 and 24 Jan 2014.
  - Grouping: birds caught in groups of five; one adult male designated as demonstrator.
  - 14 individuals used for both validation and main experiment.
  - Housing: individually in wooden cages (65 x 50 x 80 cm) with an 11.5 h daily light period; acoustic contact only; ad libitum water, sunflower seeds, and tallow; food deprived for 2 h prior to experiments to ensure motivation.
  - Welfare: licenses obtained (KESELY/1017/07.01/2010; ESAVI-2010-087517Ym-23); no mortality; all birds released at capture site after experiments.

- Video playback validation details
  - Test chamber: 50 cm W x 50 cm D x 67 cm H wooden box with tinted Plexiglass; one perch; fresh water always available.
  - Demonstration setup: adult male lands on a white feeding cup to take a bitter mealworm, showing disgust responses; focal birds observed with choices among cups.
  - Treatments recorded: BirdID, Sex, Age, Date.of.test, Treatment (social vs. control), Cup.colour.chosen (red, white, or brown indicating initial cup choice).

- Foraging experiment procedure
  - Training: birds learned to open and search paper packets containing a small almond; packets marked with symbols (cryptic vs. aposematic) to guide prey-type exposure; cryptic prey on cross symbol floor; aposematic prey on square symbol.
  - Prey and manipulation: almonds soaked in chloroquine to render unpalatable.
  - Pre-test video: demonstrator forage for aposematic prey, showing the disgust response.
  - Test setup: bird released into aviary after video; time interval structure designed for observations; recorded time to enter the aviary, and which prey item was first taken.
  - Repetition: test repeated over 3 days; bird allowed to take up to 12 prey items per session; then birds released back to the wild.

- Data collected (validation)
  - BirdID: unique identifier for each bird.
  - Sex, Age: juveniles (from 2013 breeding season) vs adults (>1 year).
  - Date.of.test: date of experiment.
  - Treatment: social (video of demonstrator) vs control (video of feeding cups only).
  - Cup.colour.chosen: initial cup landed on (red, white, or brown).

- Data collected (foraging experiment)
  - BirdID, Sex, Age.
  - Treatment: social vs control.
  - DemonstratorID: BirdID of demonstrator in videos for social treatment.
  - Test: repetition across 3 days.
  - Date.of.test: date of experiment.
  - time.out.box: time (seconds) to enter aviary.
  - first.prey.taken: whether first prey item was aposematic or cryptic.
  - number.apo.prey.taken: count of aposematic prey taken.
  - number.cryptic.prey.taken: count of cryptic prey taken.
  - Incl.in.validation: whether the bird was used in validation.
  - Validation.treatment: if applicable, whether social or control.

- Overall purpose
  - Generate structured datasets to assess social learning in prey-defence associations, enabling analysis of how demonstrator presence influences prey-type choices and learning dynamics across individuals and days.
