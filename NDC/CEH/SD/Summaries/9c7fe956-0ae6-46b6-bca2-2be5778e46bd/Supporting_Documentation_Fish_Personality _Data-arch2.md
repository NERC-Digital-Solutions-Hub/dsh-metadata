# Sex-differences and temporal consistency in stickleback fish boldness

## Aim
- Examine sex differences and the temporal consistency of exploratory boldness in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) under standardized experimental conditions.
- Provide clear, replicable outputs (e.g., time out of cover) for assessing environmental/biological behavioural health over time.

## Subjects and Ethics
- Subjects: 48 laboratory sticklebacks (30 females, 18 males) originally caught from the River Cam, UK.
- Identification: individuals tagged with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE).
- Ethics: approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare Committee (URN 2011 1084); nonregulatory procedures.

## Housing and Husbandry
- Initial housing: fish kept together in a large aquarium; then moved to individual 2.8 L tanks within a rack system to standardize feeding and minimise inter-individual variation.
- Environmental conditions: 16°C; 8 hours light / 16 hours dark (8L:16D) prior to and during experiments to prevent breeding-related behavioural changes.
- Position control: tank positions rotated weekly to minimise location effects.
- Sexing: performed after experiments by increasing tank temperature to 20°C for 3 days to induce male breeding coloration.

## Catch Number (Longitudinal Identification)
- Net-catch: fish were net-caught sequentially to assign a catch number (catch#1) at initial transfer; a second capture nine months later (catch#2) allowed assessment of long-term consistency in capture order.
- Both catch orders were used to test predictions about timing of capture by sex and temporal stability of order.

## Exploratory Behaviour (Experimental Design)
- Test arena: opaque tanks within a 100×100×200 cm frame, with blinds to reduce disturbances; deep end with a green plant for cover; shallow end with a screen and bloodworms behind it.
- Trial structure: data collected in four consecutive days, 1 hour per day.
  - Days 1–2: two bloodworms placed behind the screen; a fish of known identity introduced to the tank.
  - Days 3–4: no bloodworms provided; fish observed to measure exploration when food is not present.
- Primary measure: proportion of time spent out of cover (out of the deep-end cover) on days 3 and 4.
- Additional consideration: whether fish found food on days 1–2 affected interpretation of exploration; some fish failed to locate food and were excluded from main analyses.

## Data Collection and Output
- Video recording: Panasonic HDC-SD60 cameras mounted above tanks; recordings stored and viewed in real time for feeding verification.
- Datasets collected:
  - PropTimeOut_DAY3 and PropTimeOut_DAY4: proportion of time out of cover on days 3 and 4.
  - Ave_PropTimeOut: mean proportion of time out of cover across the two test days.
  - Catch#1: sequence of initial net-catch order.
  - Catch#2: net-catch order nine months later.
  - Sex-specific datasets: mean exploration measures by sex.
- Sample details: main analyses based on n = 33 (fish that found food on days 1–2); full-sample analyses also reported (n = 48).

## Exclusions and Rationale
- Excluded 15 fish who failed to locate food on days 1–2 to ensure the measure reflected exploration rather than foraging effort; analyses also performed on the full dataset for robustness.

## Data Transparency and Formats
- The study provides multiple data files with clear variable definitions:
  - Proportion of time out of cover for days 3 and 4.
  - Mean proportion out of cover across the two days.
  - Catch order data for initial and long-term captures.
  - Sex-based breakdowns of exploration metrics.
- Data files are described with the number of rows and column definitions to support reproducibility and secondary analyses.
