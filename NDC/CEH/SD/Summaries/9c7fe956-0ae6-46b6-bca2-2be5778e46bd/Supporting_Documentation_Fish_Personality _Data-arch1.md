# Sex-differences and temporal consistency in stickleback fish boldness

## Aim
- Investigate sex differences in boldness (exploratory behavior) and assess temporal consistency of this trait across a 9-month interval.
- Use controlled experiments with a focus on repeatability and potential sex-specific patterns.

## Subjects and housing
- Subjects: 48 three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus); 30 females and 18 males.
- Origin and ethics: Captured from River Cam, UK; approved nonregulatory procedures by Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare Committee.
- Identification and housing: Individually tagged with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE); housed in 2.8 L individual tanks within a rack system; environmental conditions standardized (16°C; 8L:16D). Tank positions rotated weekly to equalize conditions.
- Breeding considerations: Temperature raised to 20°C for 3 days post-experiment to induce male breeding coloration, enabling sex confirmation after the study.
- Catch-number labeling: Fish assigned sequential catch numbers when moved to individual tanks; a second catch occurred 9 months later for longitudinal assessment.

## Experimental design and measures
- Exploratory behavior arena: 100×100×200 cm frame with four lanes, white gravel, and a green plant; a bloodworm feeding tile behind a screen motivates exploration.
- Testing protocol: Each fish tested for four consecutive days, one hour per day. Days 1–2: two bloodworms placed behind the screen; fish observed and tested for food finding. Days 3–4: no bloodworms; measure transitions into/out of cover to compute exploration (PropTimeOut).
- Primary metric: Proportion of time out of cover (PropTimeOut) over 1-hour test windows on days 3 and 4.
- Data collection: Continuous video recording; real-time observation complemented by post-hoc checks.
- Data quality and eligibility: Fish that failed to locate/consume food on days 1–2 were excluded from main analysis of exploration (though some analyses repeated on full sample as sensitivity checks).
- Longitudinal component: Two datasets tied to catch order:
  - Catch#1: order in which fish were net-caught initially.
  - Catch#2: order nine months later, enabling assessment of temporal consistency in capture order (and potential long-term repeatability).

## Data structure and key datasets
- PropTimeOut_DAY3 and PropTimeOut_DAY4: Proportion of time out of cover on each of the first two test days.
- Ave_PropTimeOut with Catch#1: Mean PropTimeOut across the two test days, associated with Catch#1.
- Sex differences datasets: Separate analyses by sex (e.g., averaged PropTimeOut for males vs. females).
- Catch order datasets: Include catch#1 (initial order) and catch#2 (nine months later) to examine temporal consistency in capture sequence.
- Sample sizes by analysis:
  - Full sample: n = 48
  - Exploratory subset (those that found food on days 1–2 and had complete data): n = 33
  - Sex-specific subset for certain analyses: n = 10 males, 23 females
  - Catch-order analyses include smaller subsets corresponding to the available data for each time point

## Controls and standardization
- Feeding intake standardized to minimize motivation differences for foraging.
- Environmental conditions (temperature, light cycle) tightly controlled to reduce physiological variability.
- Handling and tank setup standardized to limit external disturbance.

## Ethical considerations
- All procedures approved as nonregulatory; care and welfare monitored by the institution’s Ethics and Welfare Committee.

## Notes and limitations
- Exclusion of individuals unable to locate food in days 1–2 may bias interpretation of exploration as an independent trait.
- Temporal consistency relies on the assumption that test conditions and internal states (e.g., stress) do not unduly influence results across nearly a year.
- Some analyses are limited by sample size within sex-specific or catch-order subsets.
