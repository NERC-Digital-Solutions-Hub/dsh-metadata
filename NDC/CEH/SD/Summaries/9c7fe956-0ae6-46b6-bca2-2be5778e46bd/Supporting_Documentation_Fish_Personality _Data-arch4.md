# Sex-differences and temporal consistency in stickleback fish boldness

## Study overview
- Investigates sex differences and temporal consistency in boldness (exploratory boldness) in three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus).
- Data include repeated measures of exploratory behavior and long-term consistency via recapture across a 9-month interval.

## Subjects and housing
- Subjects: 48 sticklebacks (30 females, 18 males) sourced from the River Cam, UK.
- Identification: Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags for individual identification.
- Ethics: Approved by the Royal Veterinary College Ethics and Welfare Committee; nonregulatory procedures; no special permissions needed for collection.
- Housing and controls:
  - Individually housed in 2.8 L transparent tanks within a rack system; positions rotated weekly.
  - Environmental controls: 16°C; 8L:16D light cycle to ensure reproductive quiescence in males.
  - Feeding: Defrosted bloodworms daily; feeding intake standardized to minimize motivational differences.
  - Sex differentiation post-experiment achieved by temperature manipulation (20°C for 3 days) to induce breeding coloration in males.

## Experimental design and data collection
- Catch number methodology:
  - Fish assigned a catch number when moved to individual tanks; a second catch occurred 9 months later to assess long-term consistency.
  - Catch#1 used to test whether males are caught sooner than females; Catch#2 used to evaluate temporal consistency in catch order.
- Exploratory behavior assessment setup:
  - Test tanks: opaque tanks within a controlled frame; lanes with white gravel and a cover plant; a vertical white screen behind which bloodworms could be placed.
  - Procedure: data collected in 4-day cycles; one hour per day in the test tank.
  - Food manipulation: days 1–2 included two bloodworms behind the screen; days 3–4 no bloodworms to measure exploration in search of food.
  - Data capture: overhead video cameras recorded movement; real-time observation allowed assessment of finding and consuming bloodworms.
- Sample and data handling:
  - Exclusion criteria: fish that failed to locate food on days 1–2 (n = 15; 8 females, 7 males) excluded from the main exploration analysis but analyzed in full-sample analyses as well.
  - Measurements:
    - Primary: proportion of time out of cover (PropTimeOut) on days 3 and 4.
    - Related: Ave_PropTimeOut (mean proportion across days 3–4) and catch order (Catch#1).
    - Sex-specific analyses and comparisons of exploratory behavior and catch order.

## Exploratory behaviour metrics and data handling
- Primary metric: proportion of time out of cover during the test intervals (PropTimeOut_DAY3, PropTimeOut_DAY4).
- Derived measures:
  - Ave_PropTimeOut: mean proportion out of cover across the two test days.
  - Catch#1: initial catch sequence (early vs. later) in the first capture.
  - Catch#2: catch sequence nine months later to assess temporal consistency.
- Data availability:
  - Multiple data files capturing descriptive statistics, sex differences, and trial results (including full sample and subset analyses).

## Data quality, standardization, and governance
- Rigorous standardization:
  - Consistent housing, feeding, tank setup, and environmental conditions to minimize confounding factors.
  - Blinded-like controls in test setup (opaque tanks, minimal external disturbances).
- Data integrity and limitations:
  - Temporal separation of experiments to control for circadian and baseline behavioral differences.
  - Acknowledgement of non-detection cases (fish that did not find food) and analysis both with and without these cases.
- Governance and ethics:
  - Clear documentation of ethical approvals and animal care procedures.
  - Post-experiment sexing via temperature manipulation ensures accurate sex classification for analyses.

## Key implications for data leadership
- Demonstrates end-to-end data management: from subject tagging and longitudinal reuse of subjects (Catch#1 and Catch#2) to standardized data collection pipelines (PropTimeOut metrics) and transparent handling of incomplete observations.
- Highlights importance of controlling for confounds (environment, feeding motivation, breeding status) to obtain reliable data on user-relevant outcomes (boldness/exploratory behavior) across time and sexes.
- Provides a framework for data discovery and reuse within a broader research network: clearly defined variables (Ave_PropTimeOut, Catch#, Sex) and detailed methodological documentation support replication, meta-analysis, and cross-study data integration.
