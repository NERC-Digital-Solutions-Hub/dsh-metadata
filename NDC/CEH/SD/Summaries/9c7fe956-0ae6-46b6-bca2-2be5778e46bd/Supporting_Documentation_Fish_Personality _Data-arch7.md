# Sex-differences and temporal consistency in stickleback fish boldness

## Overview
- A behavioral study on three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus) examining sex differences and temporal consistency in boldness-related exploration.
- Data collected through controlled housing, tagging, and standardized exploratory tests with video recording and feeding manipulations.
- Aims included testing predictions about sex differences in catch order and consistency over time, and quantifying exploratory behavior as time spent out of cover.

## Subjects and housing
- Ethical approval: Approved as nonregulatory procedures by the Ethics and Welfare Committee of the Royal Veterinary College, London.
- Subjects: 48 individuals (30 females, 18 males) from a laboratory population; originally caught from the River Cam, UK.
- Identification: Individual fish marked with Visible Implant Elastomer (VIE) tags.
- Housing: Group holding aquarium (120 × 40 × 30 cm) with gravel, plants, and filtered aeration; moved to individual 2.8 L tanks within a rack system to standardize feeding and conditions (tank positions rotated weekly).
- Environmental standardization: Temperature 16°C; light cycle 8 hours light:16 hours dark to suppress breeding behavior; sexing performed after experiments by increasing temperature to 20°C for 3 days to induce breeding coloration in males.

## Catch number
- Process: Fish net-caught individually for transfer to their holding tanks; catch order recorded (catch number).
- Timeline: Initial catch order recorded; nine months later, subjects re-net-caught by another experimenter, enabling analysis of long-term consistency in catch order (catch#1 and catch#2).

## Exploratory behaviour setup
- Test arena: Opaque test tanks within a large aluminum frame (100 × 100 × 200 cm), with blinds to minimise disturbances.
- Test tank design: 15 cm wide lanes with white gravel; shallow end (4 cm) with a vertical white screen concealing bloodworms; deep end (15 cm) with a green plastic plant for cover.
- Recording: Two HD video cameras mounted above tanks; video stored on memory cards and monitored in real time.

## Experimental procedure and data collection
- Cycle structure: Data collected in four consecutive days per cycle; one hour per day per fish.
- Food condition: Days 1–2 included two bloodworms behind the screen; days 3–4 had no bloodworms, with feeding occurring later in the day in individual tanks.
- Primary measure: Proportion of time out of cover (days 3–4) used as an index of environmental exploration in search of food.
- Learning/exclusion: Some fish failed to locate and consume bloodworms on days 1–2; these individuals were excluded from the main analysis (but analyses were repeated on the full sample).

## Data measures and datasets
- Key variables:
  - PropTimeOut_DAY3: Proportion of time out of cover on day 3.
  - PropTimeOut_DAY4: Proportion of time out of cover on day 4.
  - Ave_PropTimeOut: Mean proportion out of cover across days 3 and 4.
  - Catch#1: Catch order at the first net-capture.
  - Catch#2: Catch order at the second net-capture nine months later.
  - Sex: Male or Female.
- Datasets:
  - Proportion out of cover across two test days (n = 33 after excluding non-finders).
  - Full sample data (n = 48).
  - Sex-differences subset (n = 10 males, 23 females for the analyzed subset).
- Data collection notes: Data files include measures for daytime testing days, mean values, catch order, and sex comparison, with explicit row counts and column descriptions provided for transparency.

## Sample size and exclusions
- Initial sample: 48 fish (30 females, 18 males).
- Exclusions: 15 fish failed to locate food on days 1–2; these were excluded from the main analysis of exploratory behavior.
- Analyses performed on:
  - Subset with complete learning data (n = 33 for PropTimeOut across two days).
  - Full sample analyses (n = 48) and sex-differences subset (n = 10 males, 23 females).
