# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

- Purpose and scope
  - User guide for UKCEH Land Cover Map 2020 (LCM2020), the eighth UKCEH land cover map.
  - LCM2020 comprises six geospatial datasets (three for GB and three for Northern Ireland) plus 1 km summary rasters for GB and NI (total seven products).
  - Uses 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, with explicit notes on relationships to BAP classifications.
  - Aims to enable informed decision-making and support monitoring of UK countryside state and change; production is annual to improve temporal consistency and change detection.

- Product suite and data structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Classification results: each pixel assigned the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class (first band) and the associated class probability/confidence (second band).
    - Not generalised with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine-scale features (e.g., narrow patches).
  - Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; include parcel-level attributes.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets (GB and NI)
    - Rasterised version of land parcels carrying three attributes per parcel: dominant class (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and mean purity (_purity).
  - 1 km raster summary products (GB and NI)
    - Dominant cover at 1 km for LCM2020 classes (1-band) and for Aggregate classes (1-band).
    - Percentage cover at 1 km for each of the 21 classes (and 10 aggregates) across 1 km pixels (values are integers with rounding, some coastal areas may sum to less than 100%).
  - Seasonal and contextual data used in classification
    - Seasonal Composite Images (Sentinel-2) and 10 Context Rasters used to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Dataset metadata overview
    - GB coordinate system: British National Grid (EPSG 27700); NI: Irish Grid (TM75, EPSG 29903).
    - Appendix 6 lists official dataset names and extents.

- How LCM2020 was produced (methodology)
  - Seasonal data and context
    - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 reflectance (winter, spring, summer, autumn) to capture phenology.
    - Context Rasters (GB: height, aspect, slope, distance to buildings/roads/sea/freshwater, foreshore, tidal water, woodland; NI: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distance to coast/freshwater/road).
  - Classification Scenes
    - GB: 74 overlapping 100 x 100 km Classification Scenes, each yielding a 46-band dataset (Seasonal + 10 Context layers) classified per scene.
    - NI: single 43-band Classification Scene per year (36-band Sentinel-2 + NI context rasters).
  - Bootstrap Training
    - Fully automatic training using historic LCMs (2017–2019). Training samples drawn from parcels with >99% purity across the three years.
    - GB training objects: 941,027; NI: 214,833.
    - Purpose: to sample the current imagery using historic wall-to-wall data without field collections.
  - Random Forest classification
    - 10,000 samples per class, drawn with replacement to balance rarer and common classes.
    - Training data used to derive pixel-level classifications for the 10 m pixel product.
  - Land Parcel Spatial Framework
    - Framework designed to reduce noise and provide stable units for change detection; minimum mapped unit ~0.5 ha.
  - Validation and accuracy
    - Validation against GB countryside survey (2019–2020), National Forest Inventory data, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (34,715 points total).
    - Overall accuracy: 79.2% at full thematic detail (Appendix 5).

- Class definitions and relationships to BAP Broad Habitats
  - UKCEH Land Cover Classes (21 classes) are closely related to BAP Broad Habitats but are not identical; some mappings are explained and italicised when referring to BAP terms.
  - In some cases, BAP categories are split or merged to fit remote-sensing capabilities; Appendix 1 and 2 provide detailed notes on class definitions and relationships.
  - Examples of mappings and notes include distinctions among Broadleaved/Coniferous woodland, Arable, various Grasslands (Improved, Neutral, Calcareous, Acid), Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Freshwater, Saltwater, Urban/Suburban, and coastal/littoral habitats.

- Data use, limitations, and guidance for GIS work
  - 10 m Classified Pixels
    - Provide fine-scale detail (e.g., narrow linear features) not captured in the Land Parcel Spatial Framework.
    - Validation was performed on the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10 m pixel product; treat the 10 m data as suitable for specialist or advanced analyses understanding the associated caveats.
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Provide a cleaned, parcel-based representation of land cover for time-series comparison and change detection.
    - Parcel identifiers (gid) differ from LCM2015; cross-year parcel-based comparison by spatial overlap rather than parcel id is not straightforward.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels
    - Three-band rasters (dominant class, confidence, purity) summarise parcel-level information for general use.
  - 1 km summary rasters
    - Useful for broad-scale analyses and quick visualization, with automated rounding of percentage values.
  - Time series and change detection
    - Annual production aids differentiation of real change from random classification errors (which tend to flicker over time).
    - Gaps between older LCMs (historical lag) are reduced by automation, but users should be aware of changes in training data and methods across years.
  - Display and accessibility
    - Appendix 3 and 4 provide colour recipes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (including color-blind friendly options).
    - QGIS symbology files (lcm_raster.qml and lcm_raster_cb_friendly.qml) are provided.

- Practical considerations for GIS specialists
  - Data preparation and integration
    - Use the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to align and compare across time, with awareness of the ~0.5 ha MMU and potential non-alignment of gid across years.
  - Classification detail and resolution
    - The 10 m pixel product preserves fine landscape features; expect some misclassifications in spectrally similar classes, mitigated by contextual and seasonal data.
  - Validation context
    - While overall accuracy is around 79%, per-class accuracies vary; refer to Appendix 5 confusion matrices for insights on producer’s and user’s accuracy by class.
  - Data provenance and reproducibility
    - The workflow integrates open-source components (WEKA, PostGIS, GDAL) within UKCEH’s bespoke tooling; methodology is documented to support replication and auditing.

- Takeaways for GIS practitioners
  - LCM2020 provides a robust, annually updated set of land cover products at 10 m (pixels) and 25 m (parcels) with accompanying 1 km summaries, designed to support change detection and spatial analysis across GB and NI.
  - The data bundle combines spectral, seasonal, and contextual information within a parcel-based framework to deliver higher-quality maps while acknowledging limitations in certain spectrally similar classes.
  - For routine mapping, use the 1 km rasters and Land Parcel datasets; for detailed habitat analyses and change detection, utilize the 10 m Classified Pixels and 25 m Parcel rasters with awareness of the validation context and gid cross-year considerations.
