# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2020

## Aim and scope
- UKCEH LCM2020 provides annual, standardized land cover maps for Great Britain and Northern Ireland to monitor environmental condition and change over time.
- Product suite supports monitoring outputs, comparability across years, and change detection for environmental objectives.

## What LCM2020 includes
- A total of seven digital holdings:
  - Three data types for GB and NI each: 10 m Classified Pixels, Land Parcel datasets, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels.
  - Plus 1 km raster summary products for GB and NI.
- Land cover is described using 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes derived from Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, with explicit mapping notes to BAP concepts.

## How data were produced
- Core inputs: Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images (four seasons) integrated with 10 Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
- Seasonal Composite Images derived via Google Earth Engine; spectral bands and resolutions are configured to support classification.
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB: 100x100 km tiles; 36-band Sentinel-2 scenes plus 10 context rasters for a 46-band classification scene.
  - NI: single Classification Scene per year (43 bands) using similar inputs.
- Bootstrap Training:
  - Fully automatic training using historic land cover maps (LCM2017–2019) filtered for >99% purity across three years.
  - GB: ~941k training objects; NI: ~214k.
- Classification method: Random Forest with balanced sampling (10,000 samples per class per training bag) to avoid dominance by common classes.
- UKCEH LCM2020 uses a bespoke software pipeline integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL.

## The dataset descriptions and formats
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI):
  - Each pixel has two bands: the most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and the associated probability/confidence.
  - Pixel-level classifications are not generalised to the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve detail (suitable for specialist use and change detection; validation was performed against the Land Parcel dataset, not the 10 m pixels).
- Land Parcel datasets:
  - Generated by intersecting the 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to produce parcel-level attributes.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets:
  - Raster form of Land Parcels with three attributes per parcel: dominant land cover (_mode), mean confidence (_conf), and parcel purity (_purity).
- 1 km raster products:
  - Summary rasters produced by aggregating 25 m rasters to 1 km scale.
  - Products include: dominant cover (class and aggregate), and percentage cover for 21 classes (and 10 aggregates); percentage values are integer-rounded with some edge-case total sums around 100 due to rounding.

## Context, seasons, and classification details
- Context Raster inputs (GB NI differences noted):
  - GB: 10 context rasters (terrain: height, aspect, slope; proximity to buildings, roads, sea, freshwater; foreshore and tidal water masks; woodland mask).
  - NI: 7 context rasters (height, aspect, slope; urban mask; distance to coast, freshwater, road).
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB uses multiple overlapping 100x100 km tiles (74 scenes classified and combined; some regions overlapped with different training realizations; manual precedence chosen visually for final cut).
  - NI uses a single Classification Scene for the year (based on the minimum bounding rectangle of NI landmass).
- The land parcels framework (UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework):
  - Uses a minimum mapping unit of ~0.5 hectares; parcels are designed to represent discrete real-world units (fields, parks, urban areas, water bodies, etc.).
  - Ensures a stable structure for time-series comparisons and change detection, though unique parcel identifiers (gid) do not perfectly align with LCM2015 identifiers due to workflow changes.

## Validation and accuracy
- Validation approach:
  - Compared LCM2020 outputs with GB countryside survey (2019–2020), open National Forest Inventory, IACS data, and bespoke validation points (34715 points total).
- Reported accuracy:
  - Overall accuracy: 79.2% at full thematic detail (Appendix 5).
  - Detailed user/producer accuracies and a confusion matrix are provided in the appendix.

## Land Cover classes and BAP relationship
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are closely related to UK BAP Broad Habitats but are not a one-to-one match.
- BAP Broad Habitats are italicised when referenced; UKCEH class names are capitalised when defined as a class.
- The mapping accounts for differences between satellite-detectable spectrally-based classes and field-based BAP categories; several adjustments are described (e.g., Saltwater vs Freshwater differentiation, Urban vs Suburban distinctions, and specific splits for heather/dwarf shrub habitats).

## Color recipes and display
- Appendix 3 and Appendix 4 provide recommended color ramps for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes, including color-blind friendly options.
- QGIS symbology files are provided to facilitate visualization.

## Practical use, challenges, and future directions
- Purpose-driven design:
  - Annual production supports monitoring and detecting real change vs. random classification noise.
  - Rich time series enables differentiation between persistent changes and flicker effects.
- Key caveats:
  - No manual post-processing corrections are performed to maintain annual production pace; residual classification errors are acknowledged and used to inform future method improvements.
  - Some classes exhibit spectral similarity and confusion (e.g., various grassland types, bog, fen); context layers help mitigate but do not eliminate confusion.
- Continuous improvement:
  - The team aims to maximise temporal consistency, comparability, and potential for change detection; if significant accuracy improvements arise, full catalogue re-application may be considered.

## Key takeaways for monitoring and decision making
- LCM2020 delivers a standardized, annual, high-resolution (10 m) land cover product for GB and NI with parcel-level context and 1 km summaries, enabling robust long-term monitoring and change detection.
- The methodology emphasizes automation (Bootstrap Training with Random Forest) to enable annual production while preserving detailed landscape features for specialized analysis.
- The product offers transparent validation results and clear mapping to land cover classes and BAP broad habitats, supporting consistent interpretation and integration into environmental reporting and policy performance assessment.
