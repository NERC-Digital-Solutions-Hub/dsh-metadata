# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

- This document describes the HEA (Household Economic Analysis) and IHM (Individual Household Method) data collected in Katakwi district (16 communities) and in Anyangabella and Kaikamosing communities, December 2020.
- Data focus: crop calendars and related livelihood information to support vulnerability analysis and policy-m making at household and community levels.
- Collected in local language and translated into English by local partners.

## Methodology

- HEA approach
  - Demarcate rural livelihood zones using land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic data.
  - Identify a recent reference year for each zone with local input.
  - Purposively sample locations to represent variation; conduct village interviews to identify wealth-group characteristics.
  - Conduct focus-group interviews per wealth group (very poor, poor, middle, better-off) to establish typical household incomes and expenditures for the reference year.
  - Build a baseline dataset to simulate impacts of economic shocks on access to food and basic non-food needs.
- IHM approach
  - Identify livelihood zones and survey sites; collect contextual local economy information via focus groups.
  - Interview selected households with a semi-structured format covering income sources, demography, assets, crops, livestock, employment, wild foods, transfers, and other relevant characteristics (e.g., gender of household head, education).
  - Use open-IHM software for data entry, validation, and in-field checks; revisit households if anomalies arise.
  - Rapid analysis in the field to provide up-to-date information for decision makers.

## Data collection and quality assurance

- Data are entered into open-IHM software and checked for internal consistency, biological adequacy, and discrepancies with observed living conditions.
- If anomalies are found, households are revisited and datasets amended as needed.
- Local Ugandan partners conducted the data collection and translation into English.

## Data and structure

- Geographic scope and sample

  - Kaikamosing: 51 households (IHM)
- Timing
  - Data collected in December 2020
- Data purpose
  - Support analysis of vulnerability levels and livelihood impact modelling
  - Facilitate development of targeted policies to enhance resilience at household and community levels
- Data language
  - Collected in local language; translated into English by local partners

## Datasets / files included

- The data consist of quantitative information on crop and fishing production timelines and related livelihood factors across an agricultural year.
- Two village datasets: Anyangabella (fishing community) and Kaikamosing (crop community)
- File set includes, among others:
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_EMP.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_EMP.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_WILD_FOODS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_WILD_FOODS.csv
- Each file provides detail on the source, who collected the data, when, and what it covers (e.g., crops grown, proportions, livestock, employment types, transfers, wild foods) and notes that empty cells indicate no data for that value.

## GIS relevance and how to use

- Delineate and visualize livelihood zones within Katakwi district, integrating climate, market, and land-use data.
- Map reference years and sample sites to support reproducible modeling of shocks and resilience scenarios.
- Combine HEA baseline data with IHM household-level information to create spatially explicit vulnerability and livelihood maps.
- Use crop calendars, livestock, and fishing data to produce seasonal maps of production, assets, and income sources.
- Support policy analysis and targeting by linking spatial patterns to wealth groups and their needs.

## Additional notes

- The dataset compiler cites the EfD (Evidence for Development) resources on HEA and IHM methods (as of 24/03/2021).
- The data collection team comprises local Ugandan partners, ensuring cultural and linguistic alignment with communities.
