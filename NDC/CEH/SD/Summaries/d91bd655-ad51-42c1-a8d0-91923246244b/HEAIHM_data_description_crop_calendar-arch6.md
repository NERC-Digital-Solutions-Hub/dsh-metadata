# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

## Overview
- Product of raw HEA data from 16 communities in Katakwi district and raw IHM data from Anyangabella (42 households) and Kaikamosing (51 households).
- Data collected in December 2020, focusing on crop calendars and livelihoods.

## Data scope and context
- HEA component: demarcates rural livelihood zones using land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information; identifies a reference year; samples sites to represent variation; interviews to establish wealth-group characteristics and typical household incomes/expenditures for the reference year; generates a baseline for simulating shocks and impacts on access to food and basic needs.
- IHM component: uses semi-structured interviews with field software to enable in-field data checking; aims for rapid analysis and up-to-date information for decision-makers.
- Data collection team consisted of local Ugandan partners; conducted in local language and translated into English.

## Methodology
- HEA method
  - Identify livelihood zones and select representative sample sites.
  - Conduct interviews with knowledgeable village representatives to define wealth groups.
  - Interview focus groups from each wealth group to establish incomes and expenditures for a typical household in the reference year.
  - Repeat across zones to build a baseline dataset for vulnerability analysis.
- IHM method
  - Contextual information gathered from focus groups on local economy (women and men in different activities).
  - Semi-structured household interviews covering demography, assets, crop/livestock production, employment, wild foods, transfers, and other relevant characteristics.
  - Data entered into open-IHM software; in-field checks for consistency; anomalies trigger revisits and data amendments if needed.

## Data files and structure
- Quantitative data relate to crop and fishing production timelines across a typical agricultural year.
- Data focus: two village sets (Anyangabella and Kaikamosing) with separate cropping and fishing communities.
- Files include:
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_EMP.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_EMP.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_WILD_FOODS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_WILD_FOODS.csv
- Each file provides details on the origin, data collected, and timing; empty cells indicate no data for that value.

## Data quality and collection process
- Data collected in local language; translations by local data collectors.
- On-site data entry with open-IHM software; automated checks for internal consistency and alignment with observed living conditions.
- If anomalies are detected or additional information is needed, households may be revisited and datasets amended.
- Data aim to support vulnerability analysis and livelihood impact modelling for targeted policy development.

## Purpose and potential applications for data support
- Data designed to support analysis of vulnerability levels and to inform livelihood impact modelling.
- Used to develop targeted policies to support resilience at household and community levels.
- Useful for creating data products (dashboards, summaries) to enable stakeholders to explore and interpret livelihoods, production timelines, and related transfers for the two communities.
