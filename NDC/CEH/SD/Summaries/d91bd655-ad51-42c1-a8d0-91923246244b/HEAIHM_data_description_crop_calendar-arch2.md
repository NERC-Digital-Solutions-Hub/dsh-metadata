# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

## Overview
- Dataset derives from raw HEA data collected in 16 communities in Katakwi district and raw IHM data from 42 households in Anyangabella and 51 households in Kaikamosing, collected December 2020.
- Presents crop calendars for Katakwi district.

## Purpose
- Support analysis of vulnerability levels and livelihood impact modelling.
- Inform development of targeted policies to bolster resilience at household and community levels.

## Methodology

### HEA (Household Economy Approach)
- Demarcate rural livelihood zones using land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and other economic information.
- Identify a reference year (recent year with neither exceptionally bad nor good conditions) in consultation with local informants.
- Purposively sample locations to represent variation across each livelihood zone.
- Conduct initial village interviews to classify wealth groups (e.g., very poor, poor, middle, better-off).
- Perform focus group interviews with each wealth group to establish typical household incomes and expenditures for the reference year.
- Use baseline data to simulate impacts of shocks on access to food and basic non-food needs.

### IHM (Individual Households Method)
- Begin with identifying livelihood zones and selecting survey sites; gather contextual economic information from focus groups (involving men and women in different activities).
- Interview selected households using a semi-structured format to capture all relevant income sources and related details (including demography, assets, crop and livestock production, employment, wild foods, transfers, etc.).
- Record additional characteristics (e.g., gender of household head, education level).
- Enter data into open-IHM software for real-time checks; ensure internal consistency and consistency with observed living conditions.
- Revisit households if anomalies are found or more data is needed; amend datasets as necessary.

### Data collection quality and language
- Data collected in the local language and translated into English by the data collectors.
- Field data entered into open-IHM software with checks for internal consistency and disparities; anomalies trigger revisits and dataset amendments.

## Data files and contents
- The dataset includes quantitative information on crop and fishing production timelines, with empty cells indicating missing data.
- Files cover two village sets: Anyangabella (fishing community) and Kaikamosing (crop/livestock community), detailing various calendar aspects:
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Interview_details.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_Crops.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_LS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_EMP.csv

  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_TRANSFERS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_WILD_FOODS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_WILD_FOODS.csv
- Each file explains data provenance, who collected it, and when, and details what types of crops, livestock, employment, transfers, and wild foods are recorded across the year.

## Data use and implications
- Data are intended to support vulnerability assessment and livelihood impact modelling.
- Aims to inform targeted policies to enhance resilience at household and community levels.

## Team and provenance
- Data collection conducted by local Ugandan partners; collected in local language and translated to English by the collectors.
