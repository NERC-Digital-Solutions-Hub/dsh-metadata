# HEA/IHM data collection guide for NERC upload

## Overview
- This data set combines HEA and IHM data collected in December 2020.
- HEA data: from 16 communities in Katakwi district; crop calendars and livelihoods context.
- IHM data: from 93 households total (42 in Anyangabella fishing community; 51 in Kaikamosing crop community).

## Data collection and scope
- HEA methodology:
  - Delimit rural livelihood zones based on land use, climate, rainfall, markets, and economic information.
  - Identify a reference year with typical conditions via local informants.
  - Purposively sample locations representing variation; conduct village interviews to define wealth-group characteristics.
  - Interview focus groups from each wealth group to establish incomes and expenditures of a 'typical' household for the reference year.
  - Produce a baseline dataset to simulate impacts of shocks on food and basic non-food needs across wealth groups and zones.
- IHM methodology:
  - Semi-structured individual household interviews using specialized software for in-field data checking and analysis.
  - Stage 1: identify livelihood zones and survey sites; collect contextual economic information from focus groups.
  - Stage 2: interview selected households; capture comprehensive income sources, assets, production, employment, wild foods, transfers, and household characteristics (e.g., gender of head, education).
  - Data entered into open-IHM software with in-field consistency checks; revisits or amendments as needed.
- Data collection team: local Ugandan partners; data collected in local language and translated to English.

## Data structure and content
- Focus: quantitative information on crop and fishing production timelines across a typical agricultural year.
- Two communities represented:
  - Anyangabella (fishing community)
  - Kaikamosing (crop community)
- Data are organized across multiple files, each detailing a different aspect of the crop calendar:

  - Crop_Calendar_Fishing_WILD_FOODS.csv
  - Crop_Calendar_Livestock_WILD_FOODS.csv
- Note: Empty cells indicate no data for that value.

## Data quality and processing
- Data entered into open-IHM software; in-field checks for internal consistency and alignment with observed living conditions.
- Anomalies trigger revisits and potential dataset amendments.
- All data collected in local language and then translated to English by the data collection team.

## Purpose, use, and implications
- Designed to support assessment of vulnerability levels and to inform livelihood impact modelling.
- Aims to inform targeted policies to enhance resilience at both household and community levels.
- Enables rapid analysis to provide decision-makers with timely information.

## Data provenance and access
- Source teams: local Ugandan partners.
- Collected in December 2020; crop calendars reflect Katakwi district dynamics.
