# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Overview
  - Dataset measuring net primary productivity (NPP) of salt marsh vegetation during the 2013 growing season as part of the CBESS program.
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
  - Focus: NPP of above-ground vegetation within grazer exclusion cages during summer 2013, with scaling to annual NPP (kg DW m^-2 yr^-1).

- Locations and sites
  - Essex:
    - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51 47'N, 0 52'E
    - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51 49'N, 0 58'E
    - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51 41'N, 0 56'E
  - Morecambe Bay:
    - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54 10'N, 3 0'W
    - Warton Sands (WS) – 54 8'N, 2 48'W
    - West Plain (WP) – 54 9'N, 2 58'W
  - Site descriptions emphasize contrasting soil types and environmental conditions between Essex (clay soils) and Morecambe Bay (sandy soils), with differences in inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.

- Habitat and grazing context
  - Essex sites grazed as follows:
    - Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay sites grazed as follows:
    - Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands heavily grazed by sheep (approx. 4–5 ha^-1) with winter grazing by pink-footed geese.
    - West Plain lightly grazed (<2 sheep ha^-1).

- Monitoring and sampling details
  - Part of the general CBESS field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013.
  - Observations taken at the end of the 2013 growing season during the Summer 2013 campaign.
  - Primary variable observed: Net primary productivity (NPP).

- Methods and variables
  - NPP measurement approach:
    - Above-ground vegetation samples collected inside 50 cm x 25 cm grazer exclusion cages during Summer 2013, after all above-ground vegetation was removed in Winter 2013.
    - NPP calculated by scaling dry vegetation mass to kg m^-2 yr^-1.
    - Vegetation samples dried at 60°C for 72 hours and weighed; results converted to kg DW per core area, then to kg DW m^-2.
  - Calibration: None indicated.
  - Statistical treatment: Scaling up from 50 cm x 25 cm area to per m^2; no additional statistical analysis specified.
  - Data quality checks: Data checking procedures (quality control) indicated, but specific details not provided in the summary.
  - File formats: CSV (comma-separated values).
  - Dataset field descriptions and structure:
    - Dataset Field descriptions (repeated across multiple records).
    - Header: Description and Cell Format information.
    - Row Number: Original input order reference.
    - Season: Winter or Summer (coded or text).
    - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E) or textual.
    - Site: Essex (AH, FW, TM); Morecambe (CS, WS, WP).
    - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
    - Quadrat Number: 1–22 or numeric.
    - Scale: A–D representing 1 m, 1–10 m, 10–100 m, and 100 m to upper limit ranges (with textual equivalents).
    - NPP: Net primary productivity as kg DW m^-2 yr^-1 (primary variable).
  - Special notes:
    - Although measurements occurred in Summer 2013, the data cannot be classified strictly as a "summer" variable since NPP was measured over the whole growing season.
    - In Morecambe Bay, many grazing exclosures were lost, leading to missing data.
    - NA indicates missing data.

- Implications for data governance and reuse
  - Demonstrates handling of multi-site ecological data across contrasting habitats with explicit site metadata, grazing regimes, and ecological context.
  - Highlights importance of provenance, standardized field procedures, and detailed field descriptions to support cross-site comparability and reuse.
  - Illustrates common data quality challenges (incomplete sampling due to lost exclosures, seasonal labeling complexities) relevant to data strategy, metadata completeness, and plan for data updates or gap-filling.
