# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Overview and purpose
  - Dataset measuring net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites as part of the CBESS program to support environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation.
  - Focuses on comparing two contrasting soil types and environmental conditions (clay soils in Essex vs sandy soils in Morecambe Bay) and their influence on NPP.

- Study sites and context
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Site characteristics: saltmarsh environments with differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation; grazing regimes vary (Essex heavily grazed by Brent geese; Morecambe Bay heavily grazed by sheep with winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain lightly grazed).

- Monitoring and sampling design
  - Campaign: CBESS field campaign conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; observations at the end of the 2013 growing season as part of the Summer 2013 campaign.
  - Primary variable observed: Net primary productivity (NPP).

- Measurement procedure
  - NPP measured as above-ground vegetation within grazer exclusion cages (50 cm x 25 cm) during Summer 2013 sampling, using vegetation removed from the area in Winter 2013.
  - Calculation: dry vegetation mass scaled to kg m^-2 per year (kg DW m^-2 yr^-1).
  - Sample processing: vegetation dried at 60°C for 72 hours and weighed.
  - Data conversion: results converted from kg DW per core area to kg DW m^-2.

- Data and metadata details
  - Locations and coordinates for each site provided.
  - Habitat and site descriptors included (e.g., Mudflat, Saltmarsh; site names).
  - Quadrats and scale descriptors included (e.g., Quadrat Number, Scale categories A-D).
  - Data formats: primarily CSV (comma-separated values).
  - Dataset fields include descriptions for header, row numbers, season, location, site, habitat, and NPP value.

- Procedures, calibration, and quality control
  - Calibration procedures: largely not specified (listed as none where applicable).
  - Statistical treatment: basic scaling from 50 cm x 25 cm area to annualized rate; no advanced statistical modeling noted.
  - Data checking / quality control: mentioned as part of data handling; some limitations noted (e.g., missing data where exclosures were lost in Morecambe Bay).
  - Notes on data interpretation: although measurements occurred in the summer 2013 campaign, data cannot be strictly classified as a “summer” variable because they represent NPP over the entire growing season.
  - Metadata challenges: some fields indicate potential metadata gaps or formatting considerations.

- Data governance and accessibility considerations
  - Emphasizes the importance of metadata quality and consistent data formats to facilitate data sharing and reuse.
  - Highlights issues common in monitoring frameworks: data gaps due to exclosure loss, need for clear documentation of measurement protocols, and careful handling of seasonality versus annualized metrics.

- Key takeaways for monitoring framework authors
  - Concrete example of an end-to-end data lifecycle for an environmental health metric (from site selection and grazing context to measurement, processing, and formatting for reuse).
  - Demonstrates the need to document site-level context, measurement protocols, and data limitations to enable transparent governance and replication.
  - Illustrates how data quality constraints (e.g., missing data, metadata gaps) can impact interpretation and sharing, underscoring the importance of robust data governance processes and stakeholder communication.
