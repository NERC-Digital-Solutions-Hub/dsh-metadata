# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Dataset describes NPP (net primary productivity) measurements for salt marsh vegetation in 2013 during the CBESS field campaign.
- Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.

## Locations and site context

- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Site descriptions reflect contrasting soil types: clay soils in Essex and sandy soils in Morecambe Bay.
- Inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation differ between regions.
- Grazing regimes vary:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands heavily grazed by sheep; pink-footed geese graze in winter.
  - West Plain: light grazing.

## Monitoring and sampling details

- Sampling conducted as part of the general CBESS field campaign in Winter and Summer 2013.
- Measurements taken at the end of the 2013 growing season during the Summer 2013 campaign.
- NPP measured from 50 cm x 25 cm above-ground vegetation samples inside grazer exclusion cages.

## Variables and observations

- Primary variable: Net Primary Productivity (NPP) expressed as kg dry weight per m² per year (kg DW m⁻² yr⁻¹).
- Observations performed on vegetation cut at ground level, dried, weighed, and scaled to per m² year units.

## Procedures, calibration, and analysis

- Field/lab procedures used to make observations documented.
- Calibration procedures: none indicated as applicable.
- Statistical treatment: scaling from 50 cm x 25 cm area to per m²; no additional statistical treatment beyond this explicit upscaling.
- Data checking/quality control procedures are noted but specifics are not described.

## Data formats and metadata

- File formats: CSV.
- Dataset field descriptions and metadata include:
  - Header descriptions (Description)
  - Row Number (sorting by input order)
  - Season (Winter/Summer or text)
  - Location (Morecambe or Essex)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP; AH, FW, TM)
  - Habitat (Mudflat, Saltmarsh)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A–D with corresponding meter ranges)
  - NPP definition (kg DW m⁻² yr⁻¹)
- Additional notes in metadata:
  - Although measurements were taken in Summer 2013, data cannot be classified as a true 'summer' variable since NPP represents the entire growing season.
  - In Morecambe Bay, grazing exclosures were frequently lost, leading to missing data.

## Data governance, availability, and stewardship

- Data custodianship implied: ensure data meet standards for sharing, with clear metadata and documentation.
- Emphasis on documenting work performed on datasets and ensuring data availability, with attention to limitations (e.g., missing exclosure data, potential non-interoperability of historical field records).
- Locations, site descriptions, and grazing context are essential for data discovery, reuse, and cross-site comparability.

## Limitations and caveats

- Missing data in Morecambe Bay due to lost grazing exclosures.
- No explicit calibration procedures described beyond noting “none.”
- Descriptions indicate potential variability due to differing grazing regimes, soil types, and inundation patterns, which should be considered in downstream use and comparisons.

## Responsible personnel

- Hilary Ford is listed as the staff member responsible for the dataset.
