# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Purpose: NPP vegetation data from salt marsh sites to quantify above-ground productivity and enable environmental monitoring over time.
- Staff: Hilary Ford.
- Timeframe: CBESS field campaign during Winter and Summer 2013; measurements taken at end of the 2013 growing season (summer 2013 campaign).
- Primary variable: Net primary productivity (NPP) of above-ground vegetation, expressed as kg of dry weight per square meter per year (kg DW m^-2 yr^-1).

## Locations and Sites
- Essex (clay soils, south-eastern Atlantic UK): Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM); coordinates provided.
- Morecambe Bay (sandy soils, west UK): Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); coordinates provided.
- Site descriptions:
  - Essex: hare-grazed sites; AH and FW heavily grazed by over-wintering Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: intensive sheep grazing (~4–5 ha^-1) with pink-footed geese grazing in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.
  - Saltmarsh sites chosen to represent contrasting soil types, inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation.

## Data Collection and Methods
- Monitoring campaign: Part of the general CBESS field program; measurements taken during Summer 2013 as part of the 2013 growing season.
- Procedure for NPP:
  - NPP measured from above-ground vegetation samples (50 cm x 25 cm) inside grazer exclusion cages.
  - Sampling occurred in Summer 2013 after above-ground vegetation had been removed in Winter 2013.
  - Drying: samples dried at 60°C for 72 hours and weighed.
  - Calculation: NPP converted from kg dry weight per core area to kg DW m^-2 yr^-1.
- Data scope note: Measurements reflect the entire growing season rather than a single summer variable.

## Measurements, Calibration, and Analysis
- Variables observed: NPP (kg DW m^-2 yr^-1).
- Calibration: None specified.
- Statistical treatment: Scaling from 50 cm x 25 cm quadrats to broader area; no additional statistical adjustments noted.
- Data quality and checks: Standard data checking/quality control procedures implied.
- Data limitations:
  - In Morecambe Bay, grazing exclosures were often lost, resulting in missing data.
  - Although measurements occurred in Summer 2013, the dataset cannot be strictly classified as a "summer" variable.

## Data Format and Field Descriptions
- Primary file format: Comma separated values (.csv).
- Dataset fields (representative examples):
  - Description / Header: Description of each field.
  - Row Number: Original input order sorter.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S) labels (text possible).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E); site-specific text.
  - Site: Specific site codes (e.g., CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM).
  - Habitat: Saltmarsh (SM) or related habitat type.
  - Quadrat Number: 1 to 22 (or numeric).
  - Scale: A=1m, B=1–10m, C=10–100m, D=100–upper limit (text labels).
  - NPP: Net primary productivity as kg DW m^-2 yr^-1 (numeric).
- Dataset field descriptions are repeated across multiple entries to support formatting in different contexts.

## Access, Provenance, and Curation
- Source: CBESS project datasets; field campaign 2013 data.
- Responsible party for this dataset: Hilary Ford.
- Curation notes: Data include caveats about season classification and missing data due to exclosure loss; essential to consider grazing regime context when using NPP values.
