# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) net primary productivity (NPP) on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex.

## Overview
- Measures net primary productivity (NPP) of salt marsh vegetation as part of CBESS.
- Year/period: 2013 growing season (summer 2013 campaign; end of 2013 measurements).
- Responsible staff: Hilary Ford.
- Purpose: compare NPP across contrasting soil types and grazing regimes in two UK regions.

## Location and Sites
- Essex:
  - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51.7833°N, 0.8667°E
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51.8167°N, 0.9667°E
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51.6833°N, 0.9333°E
- Morecambe Bay:
  - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54.1667°N, 3.0000°W
  - Warton Sands (WS) – 54.1333°N, 2.8000°W
  - West Plain (WP) – 54.1500°N, 2.9667°W
- Site descriptions reflect two contrasting soil types (Essex: clay; Morecambe Bay: sandy) and differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Grazing context:
  - Essex: hare-grazed; Abbotts Hall and Fingringhoe Wick heavily grazed by Brent geese.
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands and Warton Sands heavily grazed by sheep (≈4–5 ha−1) with winter grazing by pink-footed geese; West Plain lightly grazed (<2 sheep ha−1).

## Data Collection and Schedule
- Campaign: CBESS field campaign during Winter and Summer 2013; measurements taken at the end of the 2013 growing season (summer 2013).

## Variables and Measurements
- Observed variable: Net Primary Productivity (NPP).
- NPP measurement method:
  - Above-ground vegetation sample, 50 cm × 25 cm, inside grazer exclusion cages.
  - Sampling in Summer 2013; after vegetation removal in Winter 2013.
  - Drying: 60°C for 72 hours; weigh to obtain dry mass.
  - Calculation: scale dry mass from core area to kg DW per m² per year (kg DW m⁻² yr⁻¹).

## Procedures and Processing
- Calibration: none reported.
- Statistical treatment: simple upscaling from 50 cm × 25 cm area to per m²; no advanced statistical processing described.
- Data checking/quality control: noted as part of data handling.

## Data Format and Access
- File format: Comma Separated Values (.csv).
- Dataset structure includes fields such as:
  - Season (Winter, Summer)
  - Location (Morecambe, Essex)
  - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
  - Habitat (Mudflat, Saltmarsh)
  - Quadrat Number (1–22)
  - Scale (A, B, C, D corresponding to spatial resolution)
  - NPP (kg DW m⁻² yr⁻¹)
- Row/field metadata includes descriptions for each field (Description, Cell Format, etc.).

## Additional Notes and Limitations
- Although measurements were collected during Summer 2013, the data are not classified strictly as a 'summer' variable because NPP covers the whole growing season.
- In Morecambe Bay, grazing exclosures were frequently lost, resulting in missing data (NA entries).
