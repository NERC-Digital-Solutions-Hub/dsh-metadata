# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers are essential contributors.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy questions.
- Coverage and methods:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 5 m wide band, weekly counts from April to September (up to 26 counts/year), ~2000 sites.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year, sampling ~750 squares/year to cover common habitats.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- Scale and durability: monitoring has occurred across the UK since 1976 with over 2500 active sites annually.

- Nature of data collected and trend analysis:
  - Data are used to create abundance indices (relative measures of population size) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices are combined into species-level collated indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with a weighting adjustment for the proportion of each site’s flight period surveyed.
  - All counts from Pollard walks, WCBS, and reduced surveys contribute to seasonal pattern estimates, which are then extrapolated to account for recording gaps. Observed data are weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

- Quality control:
  - Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
  - Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation screens for out-of-range distributions, unusual timing, first-time site records, and atypical abundances.
  - Edits are made to the UKBMS dataset after queries and consultations with coordinators or recorders.

- Details of this data download:
  - Provides annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data from 1976–2019 (some earlier years excluded due to insufficient data).
  - Format: comma-separated values (.csv).
