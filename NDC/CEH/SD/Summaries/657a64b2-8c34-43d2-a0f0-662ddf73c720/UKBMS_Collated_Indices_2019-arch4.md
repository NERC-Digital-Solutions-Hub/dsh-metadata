# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview and purpose
  - A multi-organisational, volunteer-driven program funded by Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - Tracks annual butterfly population status across the UK since 1976, with over 2,500 active sites yearly.
  - Data support understanding of insect population changes and inform biodiversity status and trend policy questions.
  - Data are collected across a range of sites and methods to form a comprehensive picture of abundance over time.

- Data collection framework (sampling methods)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 26 counts per year, recording all butterfly species in a 5 m band; ~2,000 sites sampled annually.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year (minimum two visits in July/August); ~750 squares sampled annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.
  - Data are pooled from all methods for analysis.

- Data processing and trend analysis
  - Abundance indices are relative measures based on counts from transects and sites.
  - Collated indices for each species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with a weighting adjustment that accounts for the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed each year at each site.
  - The approach uses all season counts to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate to fill gaps, prioritizing observed data in the final indices.

- Quality control and data integrity
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-period records).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for distribution range, flight period, first-time site records, and extreme or atypical abundances; corrections made through queries and coordination with recorders.

- Data download details and schema
  - Annual collated indices of abundance for UK species with sufficient data, covering 1976–2019 (earlier years available for some species with insufficient data in certain years).
  - Format: CSV (.csv) with columns:
    - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so the series average equals 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - COLLATED INDEX values are relative indicators of population size over time.
