# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview and purpose
- A long-running, organized and funded program (since 1976) monitoring butterfly population status across the UK.
- Partners include Butterfly Conservation, UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Data from UKBMS informs policy questions on biodiversity status and trends; relies on a large network of volunteers across ~2,500 sites annually.

## Data collection and sampling framework
- Three complementary components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, recorded weekly (up to 26 visits/year) along 5 m band; ~2,000 sites current.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects per square, 2–3 visits/year with emphasis on common habitats; ~750 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: Single-species transects, Timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species.
- Data from all methods are analyzed together to derive population trend indices.

## Data processing and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Collated indices for each species are created with the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), weighted by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year at each site.
- Counts from all methods model the seasonal pattern and fill gaps; observed counts have greater influence due to weighting.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data site or Transect Walker software.
- Automatic checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records); regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Further automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range distributions, atypical dates, first-time site records, and extreme abundances; necessary edits are made to the main dataset.

## Data download details
- Annual collated indices of abundance for species with sufficient data, covering 1976–2019 (some early years lacking data for certain species).
- Delivered as a comma-separated value (.csv) file.
- Columns include:
  - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (Log10), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
- Collated Indices are scaled so the species’ average index across the series equals 2, providing a relative population size over time.
