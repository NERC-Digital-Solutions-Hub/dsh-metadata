# VIRAQUA survey

## Purpose and Context
- Online survey (~15 minutes) designed to monitor environmental health risks and public perceptions.
- Aims to support analysis of environmental health and policy performance over time using standardized data.
- Developed by Bangor University and the University of Manchester for academic research; not for private marketing.
- Findings intended to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts) and datasets stored/uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Target Population and Administration
- Seeks opinions from a wide range of people within the target group and uses demographic questions to ensure representativeness.
- Contains sections on gender, age, household chief income earner, and occupational/class categories.
- Emphasizes data quality through verification, cleaning, transformation, and standardised methods.

## Survey Structure and Topics
- Shellfish exposure and consumption
  - Questions on filter-feeding shellfish (mussels, oysters, cockles, clams, scallops) and varieties of consumption (raw/cooked, ready meals, home preparation).
  - Frequency questions covering the last year with multiple response options.
- Recreational water contact
  - Questions about UK recreational water exposure (e.g., swimming, paddling, sailing, etc.) in the last year.
- Illness and attribution (upset stomach)
  - Questions about episodes of upset stomach tied to eating shellfish or water contact, including symptom definitions (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal cramps).
  - Inquiry into where illness was experienced and whether behavior changed (e.g., avoiding shellfish, cooking practices, or water use) as a result.
- Guidance seeking and information sources
  - Questions on looking for advice about upset stomachs and where advice was sought.
  - Evaluation of UK Government information sources (e.g., FSA/FS Scotland) and usefulness.
- Pathogen awareness
  - Knowledge of specific pathogens (e.g., MRSA, Cryptosporidium, Norovirus, E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter, Rotavirus, Shigella, etc.) with self-assessed familiarity levels.
- Hazards of Life: fear and control
  - Repeated sets of four hazards where respondents indicate which they fear most/least and, later, which they have most/least control over.
  - Hazards include pesticide residues, Norovirus, lung disease from air pollution, antibiotic resistance, fire, diabetes, heart attack, and others.
  - Additional sections probe understanding and self-reported experiences of hazards for self/close others, and how easy or difficult the choice tasks are.
- End-of-survey and personal experience
  - Final questions cover personal or close contacts’ experiences with listed hazards and any risk-reduction actions taken.
  - Optional space for additional thoughts and overall survey experience.

## Data Collected and Key Variables
- Demographics: gender, age, household composition, occupation/class, residence location.
- Behavioral and exposure data: frequency of shellfish consumption (raw/cooked/ready meals/ready meals eaten at home or away), and frequency of contact with UK waters.
- Health-related data: occurrences of upset stomach in the past year, attribution to shellfish or water exposure, locations of illness, and behavioral responses.
- Information behavior: usage and trust in government-provided guidance and online tools.
- Knowledge indicators: self-reported familiarity with multiple gastrointestinal pathogens.
- Perceptions: fear and perceived control over a broad set of hazards, assessed through structured rating tasks.
- Experience indicators: self or close associates’ exposure to listed hazards and risk-reduction actions taken.

## Data Handling, Privacy, and Use
- Emphasizes confidentiality and academic research use only; no marketing use.
- Data handling includes verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation; outputs are designed for clear presentation (reports, maps, charts).
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to support ongoing environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.

## Relevance to Environmental Monitoring and Policy Evaluation
- Aligns with the Analysts Monitoring the Environment archetype by producing standardized, time-series capable data on:
  - Human exposure to environmental health risks (shellfish and recreational waters).
  - Public experience of related illnesses and behavioral responses.
  - Public knowledge and information-seeking behavior regarding environmental hazards.
  - Perceived risk and controllability of a wide range of environmental hazards.
- Supports the production of outputs (maps, charts, reports) for scrutiny of health and policy performance over time and enables data linkage with other environmental datasets.
- Highlights challenges in maximizing dataset value through data fusion and broad accessibility of underlying data.
