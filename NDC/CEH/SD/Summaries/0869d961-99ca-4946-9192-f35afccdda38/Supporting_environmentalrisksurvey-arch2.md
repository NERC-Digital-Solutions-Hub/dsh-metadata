# Social science questionnaire dataset on people's perception on environmental and other risks, UK (2018)

## Aim
- Provide a dataset of public risk perceptions to support monitoring of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Enable analysis of perceived environmental and other risks using a standardised format for consistent outputs.

## Who the dataset describes
- UK residents who consumed bivalve shellfish and engaged in recreational activities involving environmental waters in the previous 12 months.
- Participants were recruited online with quotas to reflect UK demographic distributions.

## Data collection and sampling
- Online survey hosted by Research Now (USA).
- Data collection window: 15–20 February 2018.
- Initial responses: 1006; valid dataset: 806 (excludes responses under 5 minutes and repetitive answers).
- Sampling approach: quota-based to ensure demographic representation.

## Survey content and design
- Best Worst Scaling (BWS) to assess perceptions of 16 risks.
  - Block design: Block 1 – which risk they fear the most/least; Block 2 – which risk they have the most/least control over.
- Demographic questions: age, gender, ethnicity, highest qualification, household income, people in the same household.
- Health and experience questions: recent gastroenteritis (last 12 months), whether illness related to recreational activities or shellfish, knowledge of enteric pathogens, whether they sought or would seek advice about symptoms.
- Attitudes toward risk: whether they have experienced the hazards listed in the BWS and actions taken to reduce risks.
- The dataset includes both environment-related and other everyday risks (see risk list below).

## Risks covered (BWS items)
- 16 risk concepts, each with a general form and an at-home form when applicable. Examples include:
  - Terrorist attack (Being a victim of a terrorist attack)
  - Dementia (Getting dementia in your lifetime)
  - Car accident (Being injured in a car accident)
  - Lung disease (Getting lung disease from air pollution)
  - Antibiotic resistance (Getting ill from bugs not killed by antibiotics)
  - Diabetes (Getting diabetes in your lifetime)
  - Heart attack (Suffering a heart attack in your lifetime)
  - Pesticide residues (Becoming ill from eating substances that control pests in food)
  - Skin cancer (Getting skin cancer in your lifetime)
  - Common cold (Getting the common cold)
  - Dog bite (Being bitten by a dog)
  - Bioaerosols (Breathing difficulties from inhaling mould spores)
  - Salmonella poisoning (Getting food poisoning from Salmonella)
  - Lightning (Being struck by lightning)
  - Norovirus vomiting bug (Catching a bug causing nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea)
  - At-home variants are listed in the dataset as appropriate (e.g., “Fire at home” mappings).

## Data structure and coding
- The dataset is a single CSV file.
- Text responses are available as provided; personal details are removed.
- Blank cells indicate no response.
- Column headings correspond to survey questions; Appendix I contains codes.
- Table 2 provides keys for non-specified responses (e.g., where you live and highest qualification):
  - Location codes map to UK regions (e.g., South East England, London, etc.)
  - Qualification codes map to Secondary school, College, University

## Data use and accessibility
- The dataset is structured to support standardised analysis and integration with other environmental data sources.
- Aim aligns with storing outputs in appropriate data portals; underlying data can be accessed to support reproducible analyses.

## Relevance for Environmental Monitoring Analysts
- Provides insight into public perception of environmental and related health risks, which can inform risk communication and policy evaluation.
- The standardized BWS approach facilitates comparison over time and with other monitoring datasets.
- The data can be combined with environmental surveillance data (e.g., water quality, shellfish safety advisories) to assess alignment between perceived risk and environmental health indicators.

## Limitations and notes
- Cross-sectional design from 2018; perceptions may have changed since.
- Self-reported data subject to recall and social desirability biases.
- No published usage examples at the time of the document (listed as N/A).
