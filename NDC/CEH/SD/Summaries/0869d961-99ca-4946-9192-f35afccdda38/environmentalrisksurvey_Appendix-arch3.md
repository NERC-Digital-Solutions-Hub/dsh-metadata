# VIRAQUA survey

- A 15-minute public health survey designed by Bangor University and the University of Manchester to understand illnesses linked to shellfish and recreational water exposure, public knowledge, guidance seeking, and risk perception.
- Aims aligned with monitoring frameworks: identify measures and indicators to scrutinize policy, inform decisions, and support risk communication.

## Survey scope and content

- Demographics and household context to ensure broad representation.
- Shellfish exposure and consumption
  - Questions on eating filter-feeding shellfish (mussels, oysters, cockles, clams, scallops) in the UK and abroad.
  - Mode of consumption: raw, cooked, ready meals, home consumption, etc., with standardized coded responses.
  - Detailed frequency categories to capture recent behavior (daily, several times per week, month, year, etc.).
- Water-related exposure
  - Frequency and nature of contact with UK recreational waters (seas, rivers, lakes, etc.).
- Illness experience and attribution
  - Incidence of upset stomach in the last 12 months and attribution to shellfish consumption.
  - Location of suspected illness (restaurant, abroad, home, etc.) with multiple options.
- Guidance seeking and information sources
  - History of seeking advice for upset stomach; where guidance was sought (government sites, NHS, etc.).
  - Perceived sufficiency of information from UK agencies (FSA/FS Scotland) on causes and prevention.
  - Willingness to use government-provided online tools in the future.
- Pathogen knowledge
  - Self-reported awareness of specific bugs (e.g., MRSA, Norovirus, E. coli, Campylobacter, Listeria, Shigella, Cryptosporidium, Giardia, Rotavirus, etc.) with graduated familiarity responses.
- Hazards of Life: fear and control
  - Sets of four hazards presented in each block; respondents select most/least feared and most/least control.
  - Repeated across multiple rounds to build a profile of risk perception and perceived control.
  - Additional items assess ease of understanding and ease of making choices (response difficulty scales).
- Experience and impact
  - Whether the respondent or someone close has experienced each hazard (eoh_r items) to capture personal relevance.
- Risk reduction and closing
  - Questions about any actions taken to reduce risk in day-to-day life.
  - Final comments and finish prompt; participation acknowledged with completion status.
- Technical and administration notes
  - Survey uses coded variables and skip logic for data consistency.
  - Some sections include redirects and mode-specific flow (regular vs. non-regular mode) and are powered by Sawtooth Software.

## Data, governance, and using the results

- Data collection emphasizes standardization and metadata to support data sharing, reuse, and transparency.
- Outputs can inform dashboards, reports, and policy evaluations; underlying data intended for academic research with confidentiality maintained.
- Government-sourced guidance and online tools are embedded as reference points, illustrating how public information shapes behavior and perceptions.
- The instrument highlights data governance considerations relevant to monitoring frameworks:
  - Need for data access, timely updates, and reduction of silos between organisations.
  - Importance of clear communication of complex findings to non-expert audiences.
  - Balancing public data sharing with privacy and governance requirements.

## Relevance for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates how to translate environmental health concerns into measurable indicators:
  - Exposure indicators: shellfish consumption patterns and water contact frequency.
  - Outcome/illness indicators: reported upset stomachs and attribution to shellfish or water exposure.
  - Behavior/communication indicators: guidance seeking, information source preferences, and adoption of risk-reducing actions.
  - Perception indicators: fear and control related to a broad set of life hazards.
  - Knowledge indicators: familiarity with relevant pathogens and hazards.
- Provides a structured approach to longitudinal data collection, enabling policy evaluation, risk communication planning, and data governance benchmarking.
- Highlights practical data challenges for monitoring frameworks, including metadata completeness, data sharing barriers, and the need for consistent coding to enable cross-study integration.
