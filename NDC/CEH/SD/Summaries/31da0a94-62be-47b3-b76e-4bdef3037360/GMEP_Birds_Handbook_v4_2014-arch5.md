# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

## Overview
- Wales-wide GMEP bird surveys conducted by BTO as part of a four-year, 1km-square monitoring program to assess land use, biodiversity, and the effects of Glastir management on bird populations.
- Combines intensive breeding-season surveys with planned winter (arable-focused) surveys to detect habitat-management effects on bird abundance and distribution; breeding data complements Countryside Survey methods and national context from BBS data.

## Data Governance and Confidentiality
- Data are treated as STRICT CONFIDENCE: discussed only with landowners or project staff; do not share locations or square details publicly (no blogging or BirdTrack for survey squares).
- Confidentiality is a high priority due to Welsh Government sensitivities; breaches could jeopardize BTO’s participation.
- Data sharing and dissemination are restricted to project-related contexts and require appropriate authorization.

## Data Collection Methods and Standards
- Spring breeding surveys: four visits per square between late March and mid-July to map breeding birds relative to habitat and Glastir management; aim to derive territory maps and use CBC notation with BTO two-letter codes.
- Detailed field procedures:
  - Record all birds seen/heard, note location/behavior, include birds outside the boundary to aid cross-square territory attribution.
  - Start each visit from a different location; keep each survey under five hours; begin near sunrise and avoid poor weather.
  - Document weather, route, and coverage; map exact survey routes and flag areas of poor or no coverage.
  - Use A3 maps per visit; standardize route coverage over exact sequencing.
- Sensitive species: notify BTO immediately for Schedule 1 species; modify routes and implement buffer zones if required.
- Footpath and coastal-path condition: document accessibility using standardized codes (OS, ON, PS, PN, BS, BN, WD) on field maps, noting which paths are walked versus observed.
- Paperwork and materials: provide square lists with coordinates, field instructions, contact details, ID, biosecurity forms, maps (A4/A3), habitat reference materials, and supplementary data sheets (mammal, habitat change).

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Documentation
- Standardization emphasis: CBC notation, BTO codes, and consistent weather/route records to enable reliable aggregation and cross-visit comparisons.
- Route coverage documentation prioritized to ensure comparability across visits and to support territory identification.
- Versioning and governance evidenced by documented version history; procedures are explicit and auditable.

## Permissions, Biosecurity, and Safeguards
- Landowner permissions tracked (green = allowed, red = not allowed); where permission is lacking, survey from public rights of way when feasible and document coverage quality.
- Advance notice to landowners (24 hours) and adherence to ForestCare safety protocols; maintain visible ID during surveying.
- Biosecurity: use supplied disinfectant; clean vehicles and boots before/after farm visits; disinfect at farm boundaries and after dirt removal; follow landowner-specific measures.

## Seasonal Focus and Scope
- Spring breeding surveys aim to reveal associations between breeding bird locations and Glastir management; assess population changes related to management.
- Winter focus occurs only in arable and mixed farms due to limited evidence in other habitats; two visits (December and January) target seed-rich habitats and assess Glastir winter-management effects on farmland birds.
- Winter surveys cover arable areas plus any relevant grass fields within the same farm; access to arable parts is required or the square may be omitted.

## Data Lifecycle and Dissemination
- Data should be uploaded to relevant portals and catalogued within data holdings while maintaining strict confidentiality for sensitive locations and owner details.
- Documentation emphasizes that data handling, updates, and sharing follow structured procedures, with ongoing liaison between field teams, BTO, and CEH.
