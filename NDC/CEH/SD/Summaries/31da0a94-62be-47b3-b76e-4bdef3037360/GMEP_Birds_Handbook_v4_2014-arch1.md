# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

- Purpose and scope
  - Field protocol for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project (GMEP) in Wales.
  - All-Wales, 1 km square bird surveys handled by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).
  - Intensive land-use and biodiversity assessment; each square surveyed once every four years.
  - Data used to assess associations between breeding birds, habitat features, and Glastir management; complements Countryside Survey methods and BBS context.

- Data handling and confidentiality
  - Data collected under STRICT CONFIDENCE: discuss only with landowners about sightings; do not share locations with others.
  - Do not leave datasheets unattended or blog/BirdTrack survey square locations.
  - Confidentiality is essential; breach could affect BTO’s participation.

- Aims
  - Detect associations between breeding bird locations and Glastir management, and track population changes related to management.
  - Improve power to detect temporal changes and habitat associations by intensive four-visit territory mapping.
  - Provide context with BBS data to interpret local changes; support All Wales, Targeted Element, and Woodland Management monitoring.

- Breeding-season methods (4-visit territory mapping)
  - Four visits per square between late March and mid-July; aim to record all birds within the square and their habitat use.
  - Combine visits to produce territory maps or maximum counts for non-territorial species.
  - Use standard territory mapping protocol derived from the BTO Common Birds Census (CBC).
  - Aiming to begin each visit around 6 am; avoid bad weather to improve detectability.
  - Weather data: record precipitation, temperature, cloud cover, and Beaufort wind speed at the start and end of each survey.
  - Survey route: walk along field boundaries or within 50 m of each point; transects no more than 100 m apart; allow for limited access in some areas.
  - Record all birds seen and heard using CBC codes; note whether birds are inside or just outside the square boundary to identify territories; use 1:1 square coverage emphasis.
  - Start survey routes from different starting points each visit to cover all areas; each survey should take under five hours.
  - Record exact survey routes on a map and flag areas of poor coverage; emphasis on actual walked coverage over strict sequencing.
  - Documentation: maintain route coverage records; supply A3 maps for each visit, and accompany with field maps, habitat references, and related sheets.

- Sensitive breeding species
  - If Schedule 1 species breeding is suspected, notify BTO promptly and adjust routes to maintain a 100 m buffer as needed; BTO will coordinate with teams.

- Footpaths and coastal footpath condition
  - Record footpath conditions with codes on a separate map layer during the first April survey visit.
  - Codes:
    - OS: Open and signed (easy to use)
    - ON: Open, not signed (easy to use with map)
    - PS/PN: Poor (signed or unsigned) but usable with effort
    - BS/BN: Blocked (signed or unsigned) or non-existent
    - WD: Water damage or path deterioration (note repairs or alternative routes)
  - Annotate and link each path section to the condition, using color-coded ink to distinguish walked vs observed paths.

- Paperwork for bird surveys (GMEP squares)
  - Required items: list of squares with Easting/Northing; field instructions; project information; ID; biosecurity procedures; disinfectant supplies; per-square materials (maps, aerial photos, OS boundary maps, mammal recording sheet, habitat-change sheet).

- Farmer liaison and access
  - Permissions are categorized: green = permission granted; red = no permission.
  - If no access, survey as much as possible from public rights of way and record coverage effectiveness.
  - Notify BTO at least 24 hours in advance of planned visits; follow ForestCare safety arrangements; carry project contact details and CEH square number.
  - Communicate with landowners about visits; wear ID; maintain confidentiality about locations and other squares.

- Biosecurity
  - Disinfectant kit provided; follow safety sheets; use diluted solution (5 ml per liter of water).
  - Check landowner biosecurity measures; clean vehicles, wheels, and footwear before, during, and after visits, especially at farm boundaries.
  - Apply disinfectant only after cleaning; use only supplied product.
  - Carry and use disinfectant consistently across visits.

- Winter surveys (arable-focused)
  - Winter monitoring aims to reveal effects of Glastir winter management on farmland birds, particularly granivorous species in arable habitats.
  - Priority winter surveys are in arable areas; limited to zones with 20 ha or more arable land, including grass within mixed farms where relevant.
  - Methods: two visits per square in December and January; walk boundary routes and conduct whole-area searches of seed-rich habitats (stubble fields, bird covers, Glastir options).
  - Map bird locations relative to habitat patches; record all birds observed or heard using CBC notation and activity codes.
  - Visit duration typically under three hours; two to three surveys possible per day depending on geography.
  - Record exact routes and highlight poorly covered areas; emphasize accurate route coverage over fixed sequencing.

- General practice and execution
  - Use A3 maps for field recording; maintain detailed habitat and route records for robust data synthesis.
  - Ensure data are compatible with other CS and BTO datasets to enable integrated analyses of habitat-bird relationships and management impacts.
