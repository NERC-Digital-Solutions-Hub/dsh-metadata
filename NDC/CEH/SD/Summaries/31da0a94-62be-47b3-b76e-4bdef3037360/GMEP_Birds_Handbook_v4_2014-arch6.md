# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

- All-Wales Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Project field protocol for bird surveys conducted by BTO, with CEH involvement, to assess associations between Glastir management and breeding/winter bird patterns across 1km squares on a four-year cycle.
- Data are intended to enable robust analysis of bird densities, habitat use, and management effects, complementing Countryside Survey methods and broader CS monitoring.

## Data handling, confidentiality, and sharing

- Data are STRICT CONFIDENCE: discuss sightings only with project staff; do not share square locations or observations publicly or with neighbours or the press.
- Do not blog or BirdTrack survey-square data; you may BirdTrack route sightings, but treat locations with care.
- Breach of confidentiality could result in removal from the project.

## Spring breeding bird surveys: aims and design

- Purpose: reveal associations between breeding bird locations and Glastir management; measure temporal changes and habitat associations with higher precision than short BBS visits.
- All-Wales, 1km squares; four-year cycle; squares in CS framework; data used to monitor All Wales Element, Targeted Element, and Woodland Management components of Glastir.
- BTO conducts detailed, four-visit territory mapping to estimate total bird territories per square.

## Spring breeding surveys: methods in detail

- Four visits per square, late March to mid-July; map breeding birds relative to habitat and landscape features; compile territory maps or maximum counts for non-territorial species.
- Begin each visit around 6 am; avoid poor weather; each square surveyed in under five hours.
- Record weather at start and end (precipitation, temperature, cloud cover, Beaufort wind).
- Walk along field boundaries or within 50 m of each point; transects no more than 100 m apart; where access is limited, adapt routes while avoiding double-counting.
- Record all birds seen/heard using standard CBC notation and BTO two-letter codes; note behaviours, young indicators, and territorial status; include birds just outside the square when encountered to aid cross-visit territory identification.
- Document exact survey route on a map; flag areas with poor coverage or not covered; emphasis on recording and standardizing route coverage over exact order of coverage.
- Use different start locations on each visit to ensure full square coverage; standard output includes territory maps and bird counts.

### Sensitive breeding species (Schedule 1)

- If a Schedule 1 species is suspected to breed in the square, inform BTO (Rachel) promptly.
- If required, alter routes to avoid disturbance with a 100 m buffer; BTO will coordinate buffers with other teams.

### Footpaths and survey accessibility

- Record footpath conditions using coded classifications on mapped routes (OS, ON, PS/PN, BS/BN, WD) and add comments on accessibility.
- Annotate on a separate map copy the path segments walked or observed; use color-coding to distinguish walked vs observed paths.

## Paperwork and field equipment for springs surveys

- For each square: Easting/Northing list; project instructions; project information and contact numbers; ID card; biosecurity instructions; disinfectant and spray bottle with MSDS.
- Square-specific materials: A4 color access permissions map; A3 color aerial photograph; six A3 greyscale OS boundary maps (four visits plus footpath map and spare); mammal recording sheet; habitat change sheet.

## Farmer liaison and access

- Permissions are color-coded: green means permission granted; red means no entry.
- If landowner permissions are denied, survey from public rights of way where possible; document coverage quality.
- Notify BTO at least 24 hours before visits; follow ForestCare safety procedures; record CEH square number in communications.
- Wear ID at all times; maintain confidentiality about landowner observations.

## Biosecurity

- Use provided disinfectant with explicit dilution instructions; carry only diluted solution.
- Respect landowner biosecurity measures; clean vehicles and especially wheel and footwear when entering and leaving farms.
- Disinfect footwear at farm boundaries and after crossing boundaries; apply disinfectant only after cleaning off dirt.
- Use the supplied disinfectant and keep reserves available.

## Winter farmland bird surveys: aims and scope

- Spring breeding surveys test links to Glastir management; winter surveys target habitat effects on granivorous farmland birds in arable and mixed farms.
- Winter monitoring prioritised for arable habitats due to known winter habitat effects, with limited or no winter monitoring in other habitats.

## Winter farmland bird surveys: methods

- Two visits per square (December and January); route along field boundaries within arable areas and across seed-rich habitats (stubble fields, game cover crops) and relevant Glastir option patches; include grass fields on the same farm as arable areas.
- Record all birds seen/heard using standard CBC notation and activity codes; map locations relative to habitat patches; aim to cover the whole arable area, or omit squares without access.
- Each survey: use at least one A3 map per visit; operate within daylight hours across the day; avoid hours around sunrise/sunset; consider weather to minimize detection bias.
- Walk along field boundaries or within 50 m of points; recognize sites within 100 m transects or along boundaries; record outside-square sightings when encountered to support cross-visit interpretation.
- Typical survey duration is under three hours; multiple surveys per day may be possible depending on geography and distances.
- Record exact survey routes on maps and highlight poorly covered areas; emphasize route coverage consistency over strict sequencing.

## Winter surveys: data outputs and integration

- Data collected will map bird locations to habitat patches and Glastir options, enabling analysis of how winter management relates to bird abundance in arable and mixed farmland.
- Winter data complement spring breeding data and background population context from national surveys to support interpretation of local changes.

## Summary of data products and use

- Territory maps, counts, and species presence/absence data derived from four spring visits and two winter visits per square.
- Habitat associations and management effects linked to Glastir options, enabling evaluation of both breeding and wintering bird responses.
- Outputs designed to support data-driven decision-making and facilitate cross-team data use while maintaining strict confidentiality and standardized data collection practices.
