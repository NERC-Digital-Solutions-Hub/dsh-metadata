# Glastir Monitoring & Evaluation Programme (GMEP) – Bird Survey Methods and Data (Wales)

- Purpose and policy relevance
  - Established to monitor the effects of the Glastir agri-environment scheme in Wales since the early 1990s.
  - Aims to measure biodiversity, woodland creation/management, and support obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the Well-Being of Future Generations (Wales) Act 2015 (Area of Healthy Ecosystems in Wales).

- Monitoring design and scope
  - Four-year rolling survey cycle (2013–2016 for the first cycle) to capture spatial variation and temporal trends cost-effectively.
  - Two components: Wider Wales (baseline estimation, national trends) and Targeted Component (Glastir priority areas).
  - Integration across metrics using a common spatial unit (1 km squares).
  - Sample: 300 1-km squares over the cycle; half random within Land Classification strata, half targeted at Glastir priority areas.
  - Exclusions: squares with >75% urban land or >90% sea replaced with alternatives.
  - Sampling framework aligned with the Countryside Survey of Great Britain to enable future integration.

- Data collection methods (bird surveys)
  - Coordinated by British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) with a robust protocol to estimate breeding pairs and habitat associations.
  - Field effort: four visits per square (reduced to three from 2015–16), evenly spaced from mid-March to mid-July.
  - Survey design: routes within 50 m of all accessible parts of the square; start near dawn; up to five hours per visit; conditions avoided when detection is compromised.
  - Data capture: all birds seen/heard recorded using BTO notation and codes; include birds just outside boundaries to track territorial overlap across visits.
  - Habitat and observer data: detailed on-site habitat patches and territory information captured to link bird abundance with Glastir habitat management.
  - Route documentation: exact routes and coverage quality recorded to assess survey completeness and on-site effort.

- Field protocols and data standards
  - Field handbook and standards draw on the Common Birds Census methodologies (O’Connor, 1990) and BTO/BCS practices.
  - Data collection codes: standardized 2-letter species codes, behavior codes, and field notes for miscellaneous information.
  - Recording tools: high-resolution field maps, ARC-based digitization for precise mapping; routes logged to ensure repeatability.
  - Data anonymization: observer IDs anonymized to protect privacy (observer codes).

- Data management, QA, and governance
  - QA processes: experienced ornithological surveyors; pre-survey training; on-site survey coordinators; standardized forms and field maps.
  - Data handling: hand-written maps digitized in ArcMap (up to v10.5); checks for uncertain counts or miscodes with surveyors; subsequent automated checks for anomalies.
  - Standards and ethics: DEFRA Joint Codes of Practice (JCoPR) followed to ensure quality, reproducibility, and auditability.
  - Metadata and data sharing: data prepared with detailed field descriptions; underlying data intended for sharing with appropriate governance and in line with data management standards.

- Data formats and availability
  - Primary data file: GMEP_BIRD_COUNTS_2013_16.csv containing records of bird sightings across 300 squares (fields include visit, date, species code, counts, habitat notes, observer, location coordinates, etc.).
  - Lookup tables: GMEP_BTO_SPECIES_CODES.csv for species codes with English and Latin names and status.
  - Supporting documentation: GMEP Birds field handbook and related field methodologies; field handbooks and data dictionaries referenced for data collection standards.

- Outputs and policy relevance
  - Provides baseline estimates and temporal trends for breeding birds at national and regional scales.
  - Yields information on habitat use and habitat patches associated with Glastir management.
  - Supports broader indicators, such as changes in semi-natural habitat extent, contributing to evidence for biodiversity restoration and Well-Being Act objectives.
  - Outputs designed for integration with other GB surveys to enable cross-country analyses.

- Stakeholders and teams
  - UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH) staff leading project science and data management.
  - British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) staff coordinating field surveys, with field teams across Wales.
  - Field survey team members carrying out visits and data collection; regional co-ordination and QA support from BTO and UKCEH.

- Challenges and considerations for monitoring framework authors
  - Data gaps and access barriers: consistent, timely access to high-quality metadata and datasets.
  - Data silos: coordination across organisations to ensure data integration and interoperability.
  - Data sharing: balancing openness with privacy and governance constraints; ensuring datasets are usable and well-documented.
  - Metadata quality: ensuring complete, accurate metadata to enable verification and reuse.
  - Data transformation: formats and units requiring careful transformation for analysis and integration with other datasets.
  - Communicating complex findings: presenting multi-scale results (square-level, regional, national) clearly to policymakers.
  - Governance and standards: maintaining robust data governance that preserves data quality, storage, sharing, and up-to-date maintenance.

- Notable publications and references
  - Methodological foundations and field design referenced from Bunce et al. (ITE Land Classification), O’Connor (Common Birds Census), Harris et al. (Breeding Bird Survey methodology), and related Glastir monitoring reports and field handbooks.
  - Documentation and field methodologies are supported by field handbooks, annual and final reports, and the GMEP website.
