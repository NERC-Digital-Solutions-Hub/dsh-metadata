# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

## Overview
- Field protocol for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project (GMEP) in Wales.
- Managed by BTO with CEH; all-Wales, 1km squares surveyed once every four years.
- Aims to assess associations between breeding birds and Glastir management within ecosystem monitoring aligned to Countryside Survey methods.
- Data complementing Countryside Survey and BBS to enable interpretation of local changes in the context of national trends.

## Data Governance and Confidentiality
- Data collected under STRICT CONFIDENCE.
- Can discuss observations with landowners only; do not disclose locations of survey squares or discuss with the public.
- Completed datasheets must be treated securely; no blogs or BirdTrack postings from survey squares (BirdTrack sightings from routes are allowed with discretion).
- Confidentiality is essential to remain eligible for project participation.

## Data Collection, Methods, and Standards
- Main approach: four-visit territory mapping per square between late March and mid-July; intent to map breeding birds relative to habitat and Glastir management.
- Recording objectives: locate all birds within the square, note location and behavior, and compile territory maps or maximum counts for non-territorial species.
- Field protocol details:
  - Use A3 maps per visit; start each visit from a different place; aim for visits to all areas before 08:00; each survey typically under five hours.
  - Record weather at start and end (precipitation, temperature, cloud cover, Beaufort wind).
  - Walk along field boundaries or within 50m of points (transects no more than 100m apart) in open habitats; include birds observed just outside the boundary to aid territory overlap identification.
  - Use standard CBC notation with BTO two-letter species codes; document behaviors (singing, calling, etc.) and distinguishing individuals where possible.
  - Document exact survey routes and mark areas of poor coverage to ensure route coverage is standardized by effort, not order.
  - If a Schedule 1 (sensitive) species is breeding, inform BTO promptly and adjust routes with a buffer (≈100m) if required.
- Footpath and accessibility data:
  - Record footpath condition using codes (OS, ON, PS, PN, BS, BN, WD) on a map, noting which paths are walked vs. observed and marking relevant segments with arrows.
  - Include comments on accessibility and path condition beyond the coded categories.
- Paperwork and field materials:
  - Square lists with Easting/Northing; field instructions; contact details; ID and safety materials.
  - For each square: access maps, habitat references, OS boundary maps, mammal and habitat change sheets, and route documentation.

## Data Quality, Metadata, and Documentation
- Route coverage and habitat use are recorded to support accurate territory estimation and habitat associations.
- Weather, time of day, and boundary coverage are systematically documented to support data quality and comparability across visits and squares.
- Detailed notes on route coverage, boundary crossing, and potential double-counting are used to ensure robust data interpretation.

## Data Access, Permissions, and Collaboration
- Landowner permissions obtained prior to surveying; permissions map color-coded (green = permission granted; red = permission denied).
- If permission is denied, surveying should be conducted from public rights of way where possible; coverage should be recorded and reported.
- Researchers must notify BTO at least 24 hours before visits; use ForestCare safety procedures; carry ID; maintain confidentiality regarding landowner information and survey square locations.
- Biosecurity and landowner liaison processes require respect for landowner measures and clear communication about visit timings.

## Biosecurity and Logistics
- Disinfectant kit provided; follow safety sheets for dilution and use; only apply disinfectant after cleaning dirt from boots and surfaces.
- Cleaning and disinfection of vehicles, boots, and equipment when entering/exiting farm premises and at farm boundaries.
- Coordination with landowners on biosecurity measures and route planning to minimize cross-farm contamination.

## Winter Bird Surveys (Arable Focus)
- Winter surveys target arable and mixed farms to evaluate winter habitat effects on granivorous farmland birds and Glastir options.
- Two visits conducted in December and January; routes cover arable boundaries and seed-rich habitats (stubble fields, game covers, Glastir option patches), including associated grass fields on the same farm when relevant.
- Data collection mirrors breeding-season methods: recording all birds seen/heard with standard CBC codes and activity notes; routes documented on maps; emphasis on capturing habitat patches and their relation to management options.
- Visits are timed to avoid dawn and dusk extremes; typical survey duration is 2–3 hours, with potential multiple surveys per day depending on logistics.

## Outputs, Analysis, and Use in Glastir Monitoring
- Data are intended to yield estimates of bird densities and associations with habitat and Glastir management, enabling assessment of management effectiveness.
- Breeding-season data provide insight into residency and density in relation to habitat features; winter surveys help attribute changes to winter management and seed resource provision.
- Combined with Countryside Survey data, these surveys support monitoring of All Wales, Targeted, and Woodland Management elements of Glastir.

## Version History (highlights)
- Document has multiple revision notes (2013–2014) detailing updates to season end reviews, footpath recording, landowner contact guidance, and booklet preparation.
