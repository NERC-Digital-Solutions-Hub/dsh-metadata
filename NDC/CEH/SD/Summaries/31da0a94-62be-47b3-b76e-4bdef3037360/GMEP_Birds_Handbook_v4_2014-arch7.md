# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

- The Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation Project (GMEP) field protocol for conducting all-Wales, 1km-squared bird surveys, with data collection by the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO).
- Surveys are four-year, intensive assessments of land use and biodiversity designed to measure associations between breeding birds, habitat features, and Glastir management.
- Data must be handled with STRICT CONFIDENCE; confidentially and appropriate handling of datasheets and locations are mandatory.

## Aims and scope

- Spring breeding surveys to reveal associations between breeding bird locations and Glastir management, and to track population changes related to management.
- Complement BBS data to provide national context for local changes; enable interpretation within the All Wales Element, Targeted Element, and Woodland Management components of Glastir.
- Each 1km square is surveyed four years apart; different sets of squares are surveyed in intervening years.

## Data collection approach (breeding surveys)

- Main method: four-visit territory mapping between late March and mid-July to locate breeding birds relative to habitat and landscape features.
- Data are combined across visits to estimate total breeding territories per square using standard CBC territory mapping protocols.
- Four-visit approach provides stronger inference about temporal changes and habitat/management associations.

## Detailed survey procedures (breeding)

- Record all birds in the square, noting location and behaviour on each visit; use standard CBC notation and BTO two-letter codes.
- Include birds just outside the square when encountered to identify territory overlap across visits.
- Conduct four visits, evenly spaced, before mid-July; begin each visit near 6am.
- Start times may be earlier than sunrise in early visits; avoid bad weather that reduces detection.
- Record weather on each survey map: precipitation, temperature, cloud cover, Beaufort wind; capture start and end conditions.
- Walk along field boundaries or within 50m of each point (transects no more than 100m apart) in open habitats; access may limit coverage.
- Start each route from a different location on each visit to ensure full area coverage; aim for surveys under five hours (duration varies with area and density).
- Map the exact route used and highlight poorly covered or uncovered areas; assess coverage by local features and visibility rather than enforcing a fixed order of surveying.

## Sensitive breeding species (Schedule 1)

- If a Schedule 1 species appears to be breeding in a square, inform BTO (Rachel) promptly.
- If needed, alter routes to avoid disturbance with a buffer of 100m; BTO will communicate this to other field teams.

## Footpaths and coastal footpath condition

- Record footpath condition and access using codes on a field map (first survey visit in April); annotate paths you use vs. observe.
- Codes include:
  - OS: Open and signed; easy to use (stiles/gates present)
  - ON: Open but unsigned; easy to use with map
  - PS/PN: Poor (signed or unsigned) but passable with effort
  - BS/BN: Blocked (blocked but signed; or blocked and not signed)
  - WD: Water damage or erosion; note repairs or alternate routes
- Draw lines along paths and attach codes with arrows; note any accessibility or condition observations beyond codes.

## Paperwork for bird surveys on GMEP squares

- For each square: Easting/Northing, field instruction sheet, project information and contact numbers, ID, biosecurity procedures, and disinfectant supplies.
- Per square: A4 colour access permissions map, A3 habitat reference aerial photograph, 6 x A3 OS boundary maps (four for bird recording plus one for footpath condition and a spare), mammal recording sheet, and habitat-change sheet for route/differences from OS map.

## Farmer liaison and confidentiality

- Permissions: green indicates permission; red indicates no permission (do not enter those lands).
- Notify project coordinators at least 24 hours prior to visiting squares; follow ForestCare safety procedures.
- Wear ID at all times; maintain confidentiality about land ownership, locations of survey squares, and other farmers’ lands with non-project parties.

## Biosecurity

- Carry and use the provided disinfectant and spray bottle; follow safety data sheets and dilution guidelines.
- Comply with landowner biosecurity measures; clean vehicles and disinfect wheels when entering/leaving farmyards; disinfect footwear on entering and leaving farms and at farm boundaries.
- Use the supplied disinfectant, applying only after cleaning dirt from surfaces; keep dilutions ready for use.

## Winter surveys (arable and mixed farms)

- Winter monitoring is prioritized for arable farmland; surveys focus on winter habitat effects on granivorous birds and Glastir options relevant to arable habitats.
- Target: squares with at least 20 hectares of arable land; surveys may cover arable areas and relevant grass fields within the same farm.
- Two-visit winter surveys (December and January) to assess bird locations relative to seed-rich habitats (stubble, game cover crops, Glastir options).
- Maps and field sheets provided; follow CBC notation and activity codes; include birds just outside square boundaries.
- Each square typically surveyed with two visits, starting times flexible but avoiding extreme dawn/dusk periods; aim for visits under three hours.
- Record route coverage on maps and annotate poorly covered areas; balance thorough coverage with practical constraints; multiple surveys per day may be possible depending on distances.

## Winter methods (arable-focused)

- Route along field boundaries within arable areas; perform whole-area searches in seed-rich habitats and Glastir option patches.
- Include grass fields within the same farm as the target arable fields.
- Use A3 maps for survey visits; document weather, seed-rich habitat presence, and bird detections with CBC codes and relevant activity codes.
- Ensure complete route coverage is recorded and judged by local features; maintain consistency with the breeding-season mapping approach while focusing on winter habitat use.
