# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

## Overview
- Wales GMEP field protocol for breeding bird surveys across all-Wales 1km squares, conducted by BTO with CEH support.
- Intensive ecosystem monitoring to assess associations with Glastir management and to complement Countryside Survey methods; squares surveyed once every four years.
- Data handling emphasizes confidentiality and standardized data collection to support evidence for policy and management decisions.

## Aims and scope
- Detect associations between breeding bird locations/numbers and Glastir management; monitor population changes related to management.
- Provide data close to true bird densities to maximize power for detecting management effects and habitat associations.
- Enable integrated monitoring of All Wales Element, Targeted Element, and Woodland Management within Glastir.

## Survey design and schedule
- Main breeding-season method: four-visit territory mapping between late March and mid-July; four visits per square, every year across the four-year cycle with different squares in each year.
- Complementary BBS data provides national population context (e.g., weather-driven trends).
- Winter component (priority in arable/mixed farms): two visits in December and January to assess winter habitat effects, focusing on arable and mixed farms with at least 20 hectares of arable land.

## Data collection and methods (breeding surveys)
- Primary approach: territory mapping to estimate total number of bird territories; data aggregated across visits.
- Record all birds seen/heard using standard CBC notation and BTO two-letter codes; include birds just outside the square if encountered.
- Start each route at a different place each visit; aim to begin around dawn; total survey time typically under five hours.
- Coverage and habitat linkage: walk field boundaries or within 50m of each point; record weather (precipitation, temperature, cloud, Beaufort wind) at start and end.
- Route documentation: map exact survey route and mark areas of poor coverage or non-coverage; prioritize consistent route coverage over fixed order.
- Special notes:
  - Sensitive species (Schedule 1): notify BTO promptly if breeding is suspected; adjust routes to maintain a 100m buffer if needed.
  - Footpath and coastal-footpath condition: record using coded categories and annotate on separate field maps; distinguish walked vs observed paths with color-coding.

## Paperwork and field materials
- For each square: Easting/Northing, field instructions, contact details, ID, biosecurity procedures, disinfectants, and safety information.
- Maps and habitat references: access permissions map (green/red), A3 aerial habitat maps, six A3 OS boundary maps (for four visits plus footpath condition), mammal recording sheet, habitat change sheet.
- Biosecurity and safety: carry and use provided disinfectants; follow landowner biosecurity measures; maintain cleanliness of vehicles and footwear; disclose square identifiers in emergency communications.

## Farmer liaison, access, and confidentiality
- Permissions: green indicates consent to enter; red means no permission (treat as boundary if entry is possible only from public rights of way).
- Advance notice: notify BTO at least 24 hours prior to visits; follow ForestCare safety procedures.
- Landowner communications: brief landowners about visits; display ID; confidentiality is critical—do not discuss observations on other land or other survey squares with farmers or the public.

## Biosecurity procedures
- Use diluted disinfectant (5 ml per litre) and follow safety sheets.
- Clean and disinfect vehicles, wheels, footwear, and any gear before and after farm visits; apply at farm boundaries as required.
- Use only supplied disinfectant and ensure damage to dirt is removed prior to disinfection.

## Winter surveys (arable-focused)
- Aim: assess winter habitat effects on granivorous farmland birds and attribution to Glastir options; limited to arable and mixed farms.
- Methods: two visits (December and January); walk field boundaries and conduct whole-area searches of seed-rich habitats (stubbles, bird covers, Glastir patches).
- Coverage: include all arable areas within the square; allow access or omit square if inaccessible.
- Data and timing: record birds with CBC codes and activity; routes should avoid near-sunrise/sunset; most surveys under three hours.
- Route documentation: map exact survey routes and highlight poorly covered areas; emphasize consistent route coverage over rigid sequencing.

## Key considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Data quality and accessibility: ensure standardized data collection, clear metadata, and secure handling to avoid duplication and enable verification.
- Data governance: maintain appropriate data sharing norms (confidentiality with landowners; controlled sharing with project partners); balance transparency with privacy and security.
- Practical challenges: address data gaps, silo issues, and interoperability of field maps, weather data, and habitat classifications to support robust analyses.
- Communication of findings: present results clearly through maps, reports, and dashboards, highlighting associations between Glastir management and breeding/winter bird presence.
