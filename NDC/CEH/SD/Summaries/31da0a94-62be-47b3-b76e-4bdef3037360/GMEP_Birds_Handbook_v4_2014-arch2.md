# GMEP Bird Survey Field Handbook

- A Wales-wide, four-year cycle project (Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation, GMEP) led by CEH with bird surveys by the BTO to assess land use, biodiversity, and the effects of Glastir management on breeding birds and broader environmental health.
- All surveys are designed to quantify bird distributions and associations with habitat and management, providing data to support ecosystem monitoring and policy evaluation alongside Countryside Survey (CS) methods.

## Aims and scope
- Conduct intensive, territory-based breeding bird surveys across 1 km squares to measure true bird densities and their links to habitat and Glastir management.
- Complement BBS data by offering local context on population changes, enabling interpretation of site-level changes within national trends.
- Survey all squares on a four-year rolling program; each square is surveyed once every four years.
- Enable monitoring of All Wales Element, Targeted Element, and Woodland Management components of Glastir.

## Data handling and confidentiality
- Data collected under STRICT CONFIDENCE: discuss observations only with landowners and project staff; do not share square locations publicly or discuss with neighbours or on social platforms.
- Completed datasheets must be secured; avoid public discussion or posting about survey squares or locations.

## Survey design and methods
- Main approach: four-visit territory mapping conducted late March to mid-July each year to locate breeding birds relative to habitat and landscape features; registrations inform territory estimates.
- Four visits per square, evenly spaced, with each survey under five hours.
- Route planning aims to cover all areas; start in a different location each visit to ensure coverage of all areas before 08:00.
- Data outputs include territory maps or maximum counts for non-territorial species, using standard CBC notation and BTO two-letter codes.

## Detailed methods
- Record all birds seen/heard, noting location and behaviour; include birds just outside the square if encountered to aid territory overlap identification.
- Use A3 maps for each visit; carry clipboards; walk along field boundaries or within 50 m of points, with transects typically no more than 100 m apart.
- Begin surveys around 6:00 am; avoid poor weather to minimize detection bias.
- Weather data per survey: precipitation, temperature, cloud cover, and Beaufort wind; record at the start and end of each survey.
- Document survey routes and highlight areas of poor coverage or non-coverage; emphasize standardized route coverage over strict sequencing.
- Record habitat use and Glastir management in each square; align data with CBC protocol and ensure consistent coding.

## Sensitive breeding species
- If Schedule 1 species breeding is suspected in a square, inform BTO promptly.
- If needed, adjust routes to avoid disturbance with a 100 m buffer; BTO will coordinate communication to other teams.

## Footpaths and coastal footpath condition
- Record footpath conditions and access on a separate field map during the first April survey visit.
- Codes to use (on-path segments): OS, ON, PS/PN, BS/BN, WD; annotate path condition and accessibility, including notes on repairs or alternative routes.

## Paperwork and field equipment
- Required items include square list with coordinates, the instruction sheet, contact information, ID badge, biosecurity materials, disinfectants, and maps/photographs (A4 access map, A3 habitat reference, multiple A3 OS boundary maps), mammal recording sheets, and habitat-change sheets.

## Farmer liaison and permissions
- Obtain landowner permission; green indicates permission, red indicates no permission to enter.
- Communicate 24 hours in advance of visits for coordination; follow ForestCare safety procedures; wear ID at all times.
- Maintain strict confidentiality about landowner identities and survey locations; avoid discussing observations on other farmers’ land with the public or farmers from other properties.

## Biosecurity
- Carry and use diluted disinfectant (per safety sheets) and follow strict hygiene protocols on entering/leaving farms and at field boundaries.
- Clean vehicles and footwear before/after farm visits; spray footwear at boundaries if crossing farm boundaries.
- Use only supplied disinfectant and follow dilution guidance; disinfect after dirt removal to ensure boot surfaces are wetted.

## Winter surveys (arable focus)
- Winter monitoring prioritizes arable and mixed farms to assess Glastir options affecting farmland birds during winter.
- Two visits per square in winter: December and January, walking field boundaries and surveying seed-rich habitats (stubbles, bird covers, Glastir patches) and any grass fields on the same farm.
- Record all birds with standard CBC notation; map locations relative to habitat patches; note weather conditions; target habitats include stubble, cover crops, and relevant Glastir options.
- Most surveys take 2–3 hours; plan for 2–3 surveys per day depending on distances between squares.
- If areas are inaccessible, squares may be omitted; ensure consistent route coverage and clear recording of coverage quality.

## Data integration and outputs
- Breeding season surveys test associations between breeding birds and Glastir management; winter surveys examine effects of winter habitat provisions and resource availability, particularly in arable land.
- Data from GMEP breeding and winter surveys will be integrated with CS monitoring and BTO data to support broad environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
- Documentation and mapping deliverables (maps, routes, and habitat records) support spatial analyses and longitudinal monitoring of habitat-bird relationships.

## Additional notes on route coverage and recording
- Standardize route coverage across visits to minimize gaps; prioritize accurate recording of habitat use and territory presence over exact sequence of area coverage.
- Maintain careful records of permissions, biosecurity compliance, and confidentiality throughout field activities.
