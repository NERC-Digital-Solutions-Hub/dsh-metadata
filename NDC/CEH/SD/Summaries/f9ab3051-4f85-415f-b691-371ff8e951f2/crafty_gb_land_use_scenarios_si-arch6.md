# Decadal maps of multiple alternative future land use based on UK Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (UKSSPs) and climate projections (UK-RCPs)

## Overview
- Describes future land use projections for Great Britain using the CRAFTY-GB agent-based model at 1 km resolution, with decadal timesteps from 2020 to 2080.
- Uses six combined UK-RCP-SSP scenarios to explore potential land system change under linked climate and socio-economic conditions.
- Data are published with Open Government Licence and require citation of the dataset (Brown et al. 2023, NERC EIDC).

## Data Content and Structure
- Format and scope
  - Gridded land use maps at 1 km resolution for Great Britain, stored as stacked rasters with seven bands representing land use at each decadal timestep (2020–2080).
  - Six SSP-RCP scenario sets: RCP2.6-SSP1, RCP4.5-SSP2, RCP4.5-SSP4, RCP6.0-SSP3, RCP8.5-SSP2, RCP8.5-SSP5.
  - All outputs are GB-wide; the UK is used as a spatial domain because consistent Northern Ireland data were not available.
- Land Use Agents
  - Land uses are coded as indices from -1 to 15, with corresponding agent names (e.g., Unmanaged, Agroforestry, Bioenergy, Intensive arable, Extensive pasture, various productive native/non-native forests, Urban, etc.).
  - Agent types span arable, pastoral, forest, and combined classes (including bioenergy and agroforestry) to capture a continuum of management intensities.
- Data creation framework
  - Based on the UK-RCP climate scenarios and UK-SSP socio-economic scenarios, implemented in the CRAFTY-GB model.
  - Model uses a capitals framework (human, social, manufactured, financial, and natural capitals) and protected areas to drive land use change and ecosystem service provisioning.
  - Urban areas are generated by a separate urban allocation model linked to SSP-driven sprawl and population projections.
- Spatial inputs and initial allocation
  - Initial land use distribution calibrated against the 2015 UK Land Cover Map (LCM2015) and the National Forest Inventory (NFI 2010–2015).
  - Data gaps in coastal areas and Shetland were filled via regression, nearest-neighbor, or interpolation; normalisation applied when 2020 inputs differed from baselines.
- Intensity mapping for visualization
  - Developed a continuous land use intensity mapping for arable and most pastoral classes to aid interpretation and cross-scenario comparability.
  - Intensity values are derived from agricultural inputs, technology, and production levels; scalars are SSP-specific and applied to decadal timesteps.
- Ecosystem services and outputs
  - Each land use type is represented as providing a suite of ecosystem services (e.g., Food crops, Fodder crops, Grass-fed meat/milk, Bioenergy, Timber, Biodiversity, Landscape diversity, Carbon sequestration, Recreation, Flood regulation, Employment).
  - Services and demand levels vary according to UK-RCP-SSP scenarios using inputs from the LandSyMM framework and UK-SSP narratives.
- Additional resources and references
  - Model structure, calibration, and parameterization described in Brown et al. 2022; supporting information S1 for capitals, agents, and services; S2 TRACE evaluation document for model assessment.
  - Urban model details and scenario integration described in Merkle et al. 2022; additional scenario descriptions in Robinson et al. 2022.

## Data Creation and Model Details
- Core modelling approach
  - CRAFTY-GB is an agent-based extension of the CRAFTY framework tailored to Britain, leveraging a 1 km grid with cell-level capitals that determine land management by competing agents.
  - Competition is driven by the value of the bundle of services produced by each agent, influenced by agent behavior and social networks.
- Capitals and inputs
  - Capitals: human, social, manufactured, financial, and natural (with natural capital further divided into yields or suitabilities for arable, pastoral, and forest uses or species).
  - Inputs include eight socio-economic indicators (from UK-SSP projections), forest suitability (ESC yield classes), arable and pastoral suitabilities, protected areas, and city/urban data.
- Land uses and agent types
  - Agent types cover intensive, extensive, and sustainable arable; intensive and extensive pastoral (plus very extensive); forest types (native/conifer, native/non-native, productive/ conservation-focused), and combined classes (bioenergy, agroforestry).
  - Initial allocations are mapped from LCM2015 and NFI data, with random or weighted placement to reflect baseline demand and 2015 geographic distribution.
- Urban areas
  - Modeled separately with an urban allocation algorithm using neighbourhood density, SSP-specific sprawl settings, and protected/flood risk exclusions; population projections downscaled to 1 km grids.
- Data integrity and gaps
  - Coastal/island gaps addressed via regression or nearest-neighbor methods; 2020 data normalization applied when baseline and scenario inputs differed.
- Outputs and interpretation
  - Outputs include seven-band rasters per scenario, with an intensity mapping layer for visualization (not included in the raw data but available in analytics).
  - Users can interpret land-use intensity through SSP-specific scalar values and the continuous intensity representation.

- Documentation and sources
  - Detailed methodology, model structure, and evaluation are described in Brown et al. (2022) and Merkle et al. (2022), with supporting information S1 (capitals, agents, services) and S2 (TRACE evaluation).

## Model Evaluation and Uncertainty
- Evaluation approach
  - TRACE-based (transparent, comprehensive model evaluation) with unit tests, sensitivity and uncertainty analyses, expert stakeholder consultations, and comparisons to relevant literature.
  - Model outputs are cross-validated against independent datasets to assess agent typology representativeness (LCM2015, EUNIS, CEH Land Cover Plus Fertilisers and Pesticides data).
- Limitations
  - No historical UK land-use reproduction due to data constraints and lack of temporally consistent UK land cover data across years.
  - GB-only scope; Northern Ireland data not included due to data consistency issues.
  - Coastal/island data gaps remain a source of uncertainty; interpolation methods were applied, which may affect edge regions.
- Reproducibility
  - The CRAFTY-GB framework is publicly accessible (https://landchange.earth/CRAFTY) with interactive outputs and full model access for replication and exploration.

## Practical Use and Considerations for Data Support
- Intended uses
  - Enables exploration of potential future land-use changes under coupled climate and socio-economic pathways.
  - Useful for policy analysis, planning, impact assessment, and scenario comparison; supports dashboard-like, self-serve data products.
- How to work with the data
  - Read the seven-band decadal rasters per scenario to analyze spatial-temporal land-use dynamics.
  - Use the Land Use Agent indices to map to specific land-use classes; leverage intensity scalars for cross-scenario visualization.
  - Integrate ecosystem services projections with land-use maps to assess trade-offs (e.g., carbon sequestration, biodiversity, recreation, flood regulation, employment).
  - Take into account scenario-specific assumptions and the exogenous nature of demand and agent behavior.
- Data considerations
  - GB-only scope, scenario uncertainties, and coastal/island data gaps require careful interpretation in edge regions and policy extrapolations.
  - The intensity mapping approach improves comparability across SSPs but is an interpretive visualization tool rather than a discrete output variable.
