# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

- Overview
  - Two integrated pest management (IPM) technologies studied:
    - Habitat management to boost natural enemies (e.g., field margins, beetle banks).
    - Semiochemical–based push-pull strategies to modify pest/beneficial insect behavior.
  - Goal: understand technical feasibility and economic viability to promote broad adoption in UK arable farming; inform policy design and agri-environment schemes (AES).
  - Context: policy shifts (e.g., Environmental Stewardship/ELS) influenced landscape-scale experimentation and farmers’ incentives.

- Key Data Sources and Datasets
  - Consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP) for reduced pesticide foods
    - Two Choice Experiments; sample: 3,000 households contacted, 420 usable responses.
    - Analysis: latent class estimators to derive WTP; policy framing via equivalent pesticide tax (£7.07/kg (cereals) and £104/kg (horticulture) active ingredient); address lexicographic/ya-saying bias.
  - Farmer Pest Management Practice Survey
    - Pilot-informed instrument; mailed to 7,500; 645 responses; 571 usable.
    - Data types: area, yield, prices, pesticide use (3-year avg), attitudes to pesticides, AES/Voluntary Initiative membership, trusted advice sources, 17 PM practices.
    - Analyses: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to create PM factor scores; parametric/non-parametric regression to model adoption of PM practices; quantile regression (ongoing).
  - Interdisciplinary Researcher Interviews
    - Semi-structured interviews with 14 researchers; analyzed with NVivo; inform interdisciplinarity and bio-economic modelling approaches.
  - Field-scale CBC Trials (Conservation Biocontrol)
    - Experiments on pest natural enemies, landscape context, and uncropped land.
    - Data: aphid counts, natural enemy abundance, predator movement (traps and GIS), exclusion cage treatments (E, F, A, N), and margins/landscape features up to 1000 m radius.
  - Role of Habitats in Biocontrol
    - Multi-field studies varying grass margins and hedgerows; spatial analyses (ANOVA, GLMs) across radii (100–750 m).
    - Findings: flying predators' control improves with more grass margins; hedgerow area can reduce epigeal predator control.
  - Evaluation of Floral Resources
    - Rubidium tracking to quantify floral-resource usage by hoverflies, ladybirds, and other predators.
    - Results: high rubidium retention in margin flora; spatial distribution of predators linked to margins; implications for margin design.
  - Evaluation of Semiochemicals
    - Formulation release-rate tests (microencapsulated vs gum arabic), foraging bioassays (A. ervi vs A. rhopalosiphi), semi-field arenas, and crop variety trials (Solstice, Hereward, etc.).
    - Field trials in winter wheat and peas with cis-jasmone; assessment of aphid/parasitoid dynamics and crop variety responses.
  - Control Cage Abundance and Complexity (Imperial College)
    - Mesocosm biodiversity experiments manipulating predator/prey assemblages; analysis includes classical and Bayesian methods.
    - Key focus: how richness, identity, abundance, evenness, and interspecific interactions affect pest control; importance of balanced assemblages.
  - Economic and Policy Modelling
    - Bio-economic modelling to connect ecological outcomes with adoption decisions; scale effects and landscape-level implications.
    - Socio-economics: adoption barriers, risk preferences, private costs, potential price premiums for pesticide-reduced foods; design of policy incentives (AES, DEFRA schemes).

- Data Analysis, Modelling and Data Products
  - Consumer and farmer data analyses
    - WTP estimation through latent class models; translation into pesticide taxation scenarios.
    - PCA-derived portfolio scores; regression frameworks to identify determinants of IPM/PM adoption; multiple specifications (parametric, non-parametric, quantile) to capture heterogeneity.
  - Field and landscape analyses
    - ANOVA and GLMs to relate predator abundance and aphid suppression to habitat features (grass margins, hedgerows) and landscape scale.
    - Spatial analyses (GIS, SADIE) to map pest/natural enemy distributions and movement.
    - Rubidium-tracking data to map resource use and trophic interactions across margins and fields.
  - Semiochemicals and crop response
    - Release-rate and field efficacy analyses for cis-jasmone formulations; foraging time and parasitism percentages as response variables.
    - Semi-field experiments measuring aphid suppression and parasitoid performance on treated vs control plants; crop-variety responses to activator treatment.
  - Biodiversity and biocontrol function
    - Controlled biodiversity experiments elucidating how species richness and community balance influence pest suppression; emphasis on functional complementarity and stability of pest control.
  - Economic and policy implications
    - Bio-economic models linking ecological outcomes with adoption costs, scale effects, and potential price premiums; evaluation of AES design to foster habitat and semiochemical adoption.

- Outputs, Dissemination and Impacts
  - Academic outputs
    - Joint publications (e.g., Biological Control, IOBC/WPRS, and related journals) on efficacy, economics, and biodiversity aspects of CBC and IPM.
  - Stakeholder engagement
    - Presentations to policy-makers and practitioners; dissemination to farmers via HGCA/Beneficials on farmland guidelines reaching up to 25,000 readers.
  - Policy and practice impacts
    - Evidence that AES payments for land-use changes can reduce insecticide reliance; identification of habitat designs and semiochemical strategies with measurable effects in some field scales.
  - Public-facing communications
    - Press releases and media coverage (BBC, radio, newspapers) highlighting flying predators and habitat-margin benefits.
  - Capacity-building and collaboration
    - Training in MATLAB, R, GIS; interdisciplinary capacity-building; collaboration with related RELU projects and dissemination to broader research and practitioner communities.

- Data Challenges, Limitations and Learnings
  - Data and scale limitations
    - Low pest infestation levels in some field trials limited conclusive results; need replication and larger-scale landscape studies.
  - Data integration across disciplines
    - Complex, multi-source datasets (economic surveys, ecological field data, GIS) requiring careful harmonisation and cross-domain interpretation.
  - Adoption dynamics
    - Variation by farm type, tenure, AES engagement; scale-up and long-term sustainability of habitat and semiochemical approaches remain dependent on policy design and economic incentives.

- Data Infrastructure, Management and Access
  - Datasets span consumer surveys, farmer surveys, field trials, laboratory and semi-field experiments, and GIS/spatial data.
  - Outputs include data files, field trial plans, and annexed datasets (e.g., field_trial_2008_cis-jasmone_and_peas_pes801.xls, arena_trials.xls), with ongoing data analysis and modelling to support policy-relevant conclusions.

- Future Data Priorities
  - Social science and interdisciplinarity
    - Deeper farmer interviews and matched case studies; integration with precision farming data and spatial econometrics to model AES impact and adoption dynamics.
  - Natural science and scale
    - Expansion to other crops and pests; deeper investigation into biodiversity mechanisms, functional complementarity, and landscape-scale efficacy; evaluation of combining CBC with semiochemicals.
  - Data-driven policy design
    - Refined bio-economic models to inform AES design, landscape-scale deployment, and retailer/governance strategies for pesticide-reduced products.

- Overall Conclusions from a Data Perspective
  - Substantial data exist across consumer, farmer, field, and landscape levels to explore IPM adoption and effectiveness.
  - Some positive signals show habitat manipulation and semiochemical strategies can reduce reliance on pesticides, especially when complemented by appropriate AES incentives and scale-aware deployment.
  - The integration of ecological data with economic modelling is essential to identify pathways for broad, cost-effective adoption and to inform future policy and industry strategies.
