# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Overview
- Examines adoption of two biological pest-control technologies in UK arable farming: habitat management (beetle banks, grass margins) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies.
- Aims to understand technical feasibility, economic viability, and adoption barriers to broad-scale biocontrol, including policy design and potential for pesticide-reduced foods.

## Data, Datasets and Analytical Approaches
- Farmer Pest Management Practice Survey
  - Mail-out to 7,500 farmers; ~645 returns; 571 usable responses.
  - Collected area, yield, prices, insecticide use (3-year average), attitudes to pesticides, AES membership, trusted information sources, and other characteristics.
  - Used to identify determinants of IPM adoption and to assess impact on insecticide use via regression models and count data analyses.
- Consumer Willingness to Pay (WTP) Studies
  - Two Choice Experiments (CEs) with 3,000 households; 420 usable responses.
  - Latent class estimators to identify preference heterogeneity; computed equivalent pesticide taxes (£7.07/kg cereals; £104/kg horticulture) and WTP for 100% pesticide reductions (health vs. environmental quality perspectives).
- IPM Portfolio Analysis
  - Survey identified four IPM portfolios among UK farms; regression analyses linked portfolio choice to farm type, tenure, AES engagement, and other characteristics.
  - Assessed whether practices altering the cropped environment (Portfolio 1) reduce insecticide use; examined Portfolio 3 (CBC-focused) outcomes.
- Field-Scale CBC Trials
  - Field experiments across scales to test habitat manipulation effects on pest control (cereal aphids) by natural enemies.
  - Data included predator/parasitoid presence, aphid counts, landscape features (uncropped land), and spatial analyses within radii of exclusion treatments (100/250/500/750 m; up to 1000 m GIS radius).
  - Analyses employed ANOVA and GLMs to relate uncropped land, margins, and predator groups to aphid suppression.
- Floral Resource Usage
  - Rubidium-tracking technique to quantify usage of floral resources by predators and predation transfer.
  - Marked hoverflies and ladybirds; GIS/spatial analysis to relate foraging to flower margins.
- Semiochemicals and Tritrophic Interactions
  - Formulation development and release-rate testing for cis-jasmone (plant activator) and related semiochemicals.
  - Foraging bioassays comparing parasitoids (Aphidius spp.) on treated vs. control plants; semi-field arena trials assessing aphid suppression and parasitism; crop variety trials assessing aphid colonisation.
  - Field-scale experiments comparing cis-jasmone-treated vs. untreated plots across cereals and peas; ANOVA for treatment effects.
- Biodiversity and Interdisciplinary Experiments
  - Control cage mesocosm experiments at Imperial College to understand diversity-function relationships in pest control.
  - Measured how predator diversity, species identity, and evenness affect predation; evaluated balance vs dominance in assemblages.
- Interdisciplinarity and Capacity-Building
  - Regular team meetings; semi-structured researcher interviews to explore bio-economic model construction and cross-disciplinary approaches.
  - Training and capacity-building activities (MATLAB, R, GIS, econometrics, etc.).
- Outputs and Impacts
  - Publications, presentations, and stakeholder engagement; development of practical guidelines (Beneficials on farmland) and policy-oriented insights.
  - Evidence used to inform environmental stewardship schemes and AES-related habitat practices.

## Key Findings and Data-Driven Insights
- Adoption and Economics
  - Many UK conventional farmers use IPM practices in portfolios rather than relying solely on pesticides; adoption heterogeneity linked to farm type, tenure, and AES engagement.
  - AES-style habitat enhancements (field margins, beetle banks, floral strips) show potential for reducing insecticide use, but effects depend on scale and landscape context; strong evidence for landscape-level benefits at 250–750 m radii.
- Predator Diversity and Pest Control
  - Flying natural enemies (e.g., hoverflies, predatory flies) provide the most effective cereal aphid control; epigeal predators offer limited suppression.
  - Predation effectiveness is higher when natural enemy assemblages are balanced and diverse, supporting complementarity and reducing interspecific interference.
  - Margins and uncropped land increase aphid control via flying predators up to 750 m from field margins; hedgerows can reduce some predator effectiveness within closer radii.
- Semiochemicals and Plant Activation
  - cis-Jasmone formulations can sustain release and enhance parasitoid foraging and parasitism in some contexts; field results show reduced aphid colonisation in peas and some wheat varieties (Solstice); variability across crops and insect complexes.
  - In field wheat, aphid numbers often remained low; peas showed clearer responses, highlighting the importance of crop- and pest-specific context.
  - Plant activators may offer a viable IPM component when combined with appropriate cultivars and landscapes.
- Habitat Management and Scale
  - Habitat manipulation effects depend on adoption scale; benefits may diminish if spread across landscapes without supporting biodiversity and ecological context.
  - The study emphasizes evaluating scale effects to understand adoption dynamics, potential saturation or amplification of benefits at farm, field, and landscape scales.
- Consumer and Market Dimensions
  - WTP analyses indicate meaningful consumer willingness to pay for pesticide-reduced foods, with significant heterogeneity across segments.
  - Economic viability of biocontrol depends on market uptake, retailer governance, and the design of incentives to support adoption (consumer premiums, AES-like payments, and policy support).
- Policy and Operational Implications
  - UK AES-like schemes facilitated adoption by compensating revenue foregone or costs incurred in habitat-based IPM changes, contributing to observed reductions in insecticide use in some combinations.
  - Real progress remains to substitute chemical insecticides with IPM across cereals; replication, landscape design, and integration with semiochemicals are crucial.

## Data Management, Gaps and Opportunities
- Data Integration and Metadata
  - Multiple data streams (farmer surveys, consumer choice data, field experiments, GIS, laboratory assays) require coherent, interoperable data platforms and robust metadata to support cross-study analyses and replication.
- Scale and Replicability
  - Need for replicated field-scale trials across crops and landscapes to validate results and inform deployment strategies at farm and regional scales.
- Spatial and Economic Modelling
  - Bio-economic modelling was central to linking ecological results with adoption dynamics; expanding models to broader crop systems and long-term landscape impacts is a priority.
- Gaps for Data Leaders
  - More granular landscape-scale data (precision farming, GPS-ground cover) to assess AES impacts on productivity and pest dynamics.
  - Matched case studies and farmer interviews to deepen understanding of adoption determinants and off-farm policy incentives.
  - Systematic evaluation of semiochemical deployment at commercial scales and across diverse crop-pest complexes.

## Implications for Data Leaders
- Emphasize holistic data systems that connect farmer practices, ecological outcomes, consumer preferences, and policy incentives.
- Prioritize data governance for multi-source, multi-scale datasets (survey, field, lab, GIS) with clear metadata, provenance, and consent where applicable.
- Support open, reproducible analyses and sharing of datasets to facilitate cross-project learning and comparative evaluations.
- Leverage data to inform policy design, AES program improvements, and retailer-driven market strategies, aligning incentives with measurable ecological and economic outcomes.

## Future Directions and Recommendations
- Social Science and Interdisciplinarity
  - Expand farmer interviews and case studies; integrate precision agriculture data with landscape ecology to model AES impacts more precisely.
  - Investigate the role of researcher engagement and cross-disciplinary methods in advancing adoption.
- Natural Science and Technology Integration
  - Broaden semiochemical research to other crops and pests; develop plant varieties with stronger responses to activators.
  - Extend habitat-management experiments to additional field scales and crop systems to understand context-dependence and synergy with semiochemicals.
- Economic and Policy Development
  - Refine bio-economic models to optimize adoption pathways, scale effects, and incentives; assess Environmental Stewardship schemes as vehicles to reduce revenue volatility during adoption.
  - Explore retailer-led governance and market strategies for pesticide-reduced products, including consumer segmentation and store trials.
- Capacity and Knowledge Transfer
  - Continue capacity-building in quantitative methods, GIS, and econometrics; disseminate practical guidelines for farmers and advisors based on evidence.
  - Translate findings into scalable policy recommendations, field-ready IPM portfolios, and decision-support tools for adoption at different scales.
