# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Overview and Aims
- Investigates adoption of alternative pest management (IPM) technologies in field crops, focusing on habitat management (CBC) and semiochemical push-pull approaches.
- Aims to understand technical efficacy, adoption drivers, landscape-scale effects, and policy/economic barriers to broad deployment in UK cereals.
- Seeks to develop approaches for investigating, communicating, and promoting novel crop protection technologies to commercial farmers.

## Data Sources and Monitoring Indicators
- Farmer-facing data sources:
  - Pest management practice survey (random sample of 7,500; 645 responses; 571 usable).
  - Generated indicators include area/yield/prices by crop and pesticide use over 3 years; attitudes toward pesticides; AES/Voluntary Initiative membership; trusted advice sources.
- Consumer-facing data sources:
  - Choice experiments to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced pesticide foods (3,000 households invited; 420 responses).
  - Analysis yields latent-class segments and equivalent pesticide tax rates for cereals and horticulture.
  - WTP estimates highlight consumer health and environmental preferences (e.g., WTP £6.85/week for 100% pesticide reduction in bread; £0.92 per loaf for environmental quality).
- Experimental and field data:
  - Field-scale CBC trials examining natural enemies, landscape context (uncropped land), and aphid suppression.
  - Floral-resource usage tracking via rubidium-marking to quantify predator foraging and margins’ role.
  - Semiochemical experiments (cis-jasmone) including formulations, release rates, foraging responses, semi-field and field-scale trials, and crop-specific aphid/predator outcomes.
- Biodiversity and ecological monitoring:
  - Control cage experiments (imperial college) assessing diversity-function relationships among natural enemies; emphasis on predator identity, balance, and interference.
  - Spatial analyses (grass margins, hedges, flower margins) and movement patterns of natural enemies using traps and GIS.

## Data Governance, Access, and Sharing
- Data governance considerations highlighted:
  - Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier to using existing datasets; transparency and data management standards are essential.
  - Integration of multiple data streams (survey, field trials, GIS, lab results) requires careful metadata, provenance, and harmonization to enable combined analyses.
  - AES-based habitat changes and landscape-scale data introduce complexities in data access, scale, and attribution.
- Implications for monitoring frameworks:
  - Need for clear data standards, metadata enhancements, and data-sharing policies to support ongoing IPM monitoring and evaluation.
  - Systems should accommodate evolving landscape contexts (e.g., Entry Level Scheme uptake) and maintain data quality across scales (field, farm, landscape).

## Methods and Analytical Approaches
- Economic and social science methods:
  - Choice modelling and latent class analysis to capture heterogeneity in consumer preferences and willingness to pay.
  - Regression analyses (PCA for PM practices; count data models; non-parametric methods) to identify determinants of IPM adoption and portfolio composition.
  - Bio-economic modelling to link ecological outcomes with economic incentives and adoption dynamics.
- Ecological and agronomic methods:
  - Field experiments with exclusion cages to quantify the relative contributions of flying vs ground predators to aphid suppression.
  - Habitat manipulation (grass margins, field margins, beetle banks) and spatial analysis up to 1000 m to assess predator movement and biocontrol effectiveness.
  - Floral resource tracking and CAS (rubidium-marking) to quantify predator foraging in relation to margins.
  - Semiochemical formulations (cis-jasmone) evaluation in lab, semi-field arenas, and field trials; assessments include aphid numbers, parasitism rates, and pest colonisation across crops and varieties.
  - Biodiversity experiments to examine how species richness, evenness, and functional complementarity influence pest control reliability.

## Key Findings for Monitoring and Decision-Making
- Adoption and portfolio patterns:
  - UK arable farmers use IPM portfolios rather than single strategies; portfolios combining habitat manipulation and semiochemicals show potential for reduced pesticide use.
  - Farm type, tenure, and AES engagement influence which IPM practices are adopted.
- Effectiveness of natural enemies:
  - Flying natural enemies (e.g., Syrphidae, Empididae, Dolichopodidae) provide stronger cereal aphid suppression than ground predators; habitat margins up to 750 m can enhance effectiveness.
  - Habitat features (grass margins, margins distance, and width) influence predator diversity and pest control outcomes, with broader margins generally beneficial.
- Semiochemicals and plant activation:
  - cis-jasmone shows promise in enhancing parasitoid activity and reducing aphid colonisation in some crops (notably peas and some wheat varieties like Solstice); field-scale results are variable due to low pest pressure in some trials.
  - Formulation type affects release rate and duration; sustained release formulations (gum acacia-based) show better field persistence.
- Biodiversity and stability:
  - Biodiversity and balanced natural enemy assemblages improve pest control reliability, especially at higher predator densities; single-species augmentation is less reliable when overall predator abundances are low.
- Economic and policy implications:
  - AES uptake (e.g., field margins, hedgerows) contributes to reduced insecticide use in some combinations, but not uniformly across contexts.
  - Consumer willingness to pay and potential price premiums for pesticide-reduced foods depend on retailer engagement and market segmentation; policymakers should consider incentives and market mechanisms to support adoption.
- Scale and adoption:
  - Efficacy of CBC and semiochemicals is scale-dependent; benefits may diminish if landscape-wide adoption leads to redistribution rather than net gains, or may increase via synergy at farm-to-landscape scales.
  - Replication and landscape detail are critical to robust conclusions; the need to consider adoption-scale effects in policy design is evident.

## Policy and Implementation Implications
- IPM technologies require continued technical development, particularly non-species-specific tools and better integration with existing farming systems.
- AES and landscape-scale incentives can catalyze adoption by offsetting adoption costs and revenue foregone; policy design should address scale, risk, and information constraints.
- Combining CBC with semiochemicals may overcome limitations of each approach, but requires careful consideration of deployment scale, crop variety responses, and non-target effects.
- Retailer governance and consumer markets play a pivotal role in uptake; market research and segmentation are essential to design viable pesticide-reduced product lines.

## Capacity Building and Collaboration
- The project built cross-disciplinary capacity in economics, ecology, entomology, and GIS; outcomes include training, joint publications, and stakeholder engagement.
- Partnerships with AES programs and other research initiatives informed experimentation and policy-relevant recommendations.

## Limitations and Challenges
- Low pest infestation levels in several field trials limited definitive conclusions about efficacy in some contexts.
- Landscape and policy shifts (e.g., rapid uptake of AES commitments) necessitated redesign of experiments and data interpretation.
- Data integration across disciplines and scales posed methodological and governance challenges.

## Recommendations for Future Monitoring and Evaluation
- Expand social science and interdisciplinarity work to include matched farm landscape case studies and precision farming data overlays for spatial econometric analysis.
- Extend biodiversity and semiochemical research to a wider set of crops and pests; invest in plant activators and host-plant signalling to enhance broad-spectrum CBC.
- Develop robust scale-aware monitoring frameworks that quantify how adoption at field, farm, and landscape scales interacts to affect pest suppression and pesticide use.
- Strengthen data governance: establish metadata standards, data-sharing agreements, and transparent provenance to enable long-term IPM monitoring.
- Align AES policy designs with monitoring insights to optimize habitat-based biocontrol gains and reduce barriers to adoption.
