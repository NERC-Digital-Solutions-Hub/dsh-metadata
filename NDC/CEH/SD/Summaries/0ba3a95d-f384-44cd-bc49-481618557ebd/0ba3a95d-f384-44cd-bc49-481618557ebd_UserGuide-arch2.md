# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

## Overview
- Context: Growing policy pressure to reduce pesticide use and protect biodiversity, with consumers demanding residue-free or reduced-pesticide produce.
- Aim: Promote adoption of alternative pest management strategies (IPM) in arable field crops, focusing on UK wheat as a model system.
- Key technologies studied: Conservation biological control (CBC) via habitat management, and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies to manipulate pest and natural enemy behavior.
- Broader goal: Understand technical and economic constraints to broad adoption, and inform policy design to support IPM deployment at scale.

## Data and Methods (Monitoring the Environment)
- Economics and consumer demand data
  - Choice Experiments to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for reduced pesticide foods; latent class models used to uncover preference heterogeneity.
  - Policy context work translating WTP into equivalent pesticide taxes for cereals and horticulture.
- Farmer behavior and practices
  - Pest management practice survey: mailed to 7,500 farmers; 645 responses returned; 571 usable; analyzed for adoption determinants and IPM portfolio composition.
  - Regression and non-parametric models to identify drivers of IPM adoption and portfolio selection; analysis of farm type, tenure, AES engagement.
- Interdisciplinary inputs
  - Interviews with 14 researchers to explore approaches to bio-economic modelling and integration of disciplines.
- Field and landscape experiments (CBC and semiochemicals)
  - Field-scale CBC trials in cereal aphids (Sitobion avenae) to assess natural enemy effectiveness and landscape scale effects.
  - Habitat manipulation experiments: grass margins, field margins, hedge width, beetle banks; measurement of natural enemy abundance and aphid control.
  - Floral resource usage studies using a rubidium marking technique to track predator foraging and resource use near flower-rich margins.
  - Semiochemical studies with cis-jasmone:
    - Laboratory, semi-field, and small-plot field trials to assess formulation release rates, predator/parasitoid responses, crop variety interactions, and pest dynamics.
    - Field-scale trials in winter wheat and peas to evaluate colonisation and predator/parasitoid activity.
  - Biodiversity experiments (Imperial College): mesocosm studies manipulating predator/prey diversity to understand functional complementarity and stability of pest control.
  - GIS and spatial analyses to relate pest control to landscape context (uncropped land, margins) and to analyze spatial distribution of natural enemies.
- Outputs and communications
  - Joint publications and conference presentations; consumer and farmer-focused outputs; capacity-building outputs (training and collaborations).

## Key Findings and Implications (What the Environment Data Showed)
- Efficacy of natural enemies and habitat management
  - Flying natural enemies (predatory flies, hoverflies, beetles) provided stronger cereal aphid control than ground-dwelling predators alone.
  - Aphid suppression increased with the area of uncropped land and habitat features (grass margins, margins up to 750 m away); broader landscapes improved pest control through enhanced natural enemy activity.
  - Margin width positively affected predator diversity and abundance; wide margins boosted aphid biocontrol, though effects varied with distance from habitat features.
- Role and limitations of floral resources
  - Floral strips and margins supported key predators, with rubidium-tracking showing hoverflies moved from margins into fields and foraged near resource patches.
  - Evidence suggested hoverflies were the main efficients, though cross-field foraging was not always strong; benefits depend on landscape context and resource placement.
- Semiochemicals and plant activation
  - cis-jasmone treatments enhanced parasitoid foraging (Aphidius ervi) and reduced aphid populations in some contexts, particularly in peas and certain wheat varieties (Solstice showed responsiveness).
  - In wheat, responsiveness to cis-jasmone varied by variety; field wheat trials often faced low aphid pressure, limiting clear conclusions.
  - Semi-field arenas indicated higher parasitism and lower aphid numbers on induced plants, supporting potential tritrophic benefits when pests are present.
  - Overall: semiochemicals show promise but require replication, scale-up, and landscape-aware deployment; limitations at low pest pressure and in certain crops.
- Scale, adoption, and economics
  - IPM portfolios observed among farmers suggest strategic combinations of techniques are common; some portfolios reduced insecticide use, though evidence for all CBC-focused portfolios was less clear.
  - Adoption is driven by farm-level characteristics and AES engagement; regional differences exist (e.g., South East adoption lower than expected, possibly due to policy, networks, and regional pest pressures).
  - Pesticide taxes based on WTP estimates were small, indicating gains from adoption must be large enough to overcome fixed costs and risk.
  - AES (Environmental Stewardship; especially Entry Level Scheme) emerged as a mechanism to compensate for revenue foregone or costs incurred in habitat creation, helping to break dependency on pesticides and enabling some reductions in input use.
- Technical and policy implications
  - CBC and semiochemicals are complementary but face scale-up challenges, cost barriers, and issues of landscape-scale sustainability.
  - Scale of habitat manipulation and ensuring sufficient natural enemy density across large areas remain critical for achieving consistent pest suppression.
  - Integration of CBC with semiochemicals and host plants requires further development and crop-specific tailoring; success in one system (peas) does not guarantee universal applicability.
  - Policy and market design (AES, potential retailer-led governance of pesticide-reduced products) can influence adoption and market acceptance; risk preferences and information diffusion affect farmer decisions.
- Overall conclusions
  - IPM technologies hold promise but require continued technical development, broader crop testing, and robust scale-up studies.
  - There is evidence that biodiversity and habitat manipulation can contribute to pest control, particularly when combined with semiochemical approaches, but adoption hinges on addressing fixed costs, risk, and landscape-scale effectiveness.
  - The research supports refining AES to better incentivize habitat-based CBC and integrating semiochemicals into IPM packages; data indicate pathways to reduce pesticide dependence without sacrificing yield.

## Data Quality, Access, and Monitoring Implications for Analysts
- Data integration across disciplines (economics, sociology, ecology, entomology) provides a rich, multi-layered basis for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Multiple data streams were QA’d and transformed for analysis:
  - Survey data (farmer practices, AES engagement) with documented response rates and filtering for completeness.
  - Consumer data from WTP studies with latent class analyses to capture preference heterogeneity.
  - Field trial data (aphid counts, natural enemy abundance, parasitism rates, margin characteristics) with appropriate statistical analyses (ANOVA, GLMs, SADIE, spatial analyses).
  - Fine-scale habitat and landscape GIS data (uncropped land, field margins, hedgerows) linked to pest control outcomes.
  - Chemical ecology data (semiochemical release rates, formulation performance) with lab and semi-field to field translatability.
- Storage and accessibility: body of datasets includes field trial records, plan sheets, and spreadsheets; outputs include joint publications, reports to stakeholders, and capacity-building materials.
- Policy relevance: data support assessment of AES effectiveness, adoption dynamics, and potential market/policy levers to expand non-cide pest control adoption.

## Endpoints, Impacts, and Future Directions
- Impacts and dissemination
  - Produced publications on CBC efficacy and adoption dynamics; contributed to guidelines for beneficials management on farmland.
  - Stakeholder engagement: presentations to industry and policy audiences; farmer reports with on-farm insect biodiversity data.
- Future research priorities (as identified)
  - Social science and interdisciplinarity: deeper farmer interviews, landscape-scale precision data integration, and evaluation of researcher engagement on interdisciplinary outcomes.
  - Natural science: expand CBC and semiochemical testing to additional pests and crops; refine understanding of biodiversity-function relationships, community balance, and scale effects.
  - Economic and policy: broaden economic modelling of adoption, evaluate retailer governance mechanisms for pesticide-reduced products, and design AES or other policies to maximize uptake and long-term sustainability of IPM practices.
- Capacity-building and collaboration
  - Training in quantitative methods, GIS, and bio-economic modelling; collaboration with related projects and dissemination of methods to build broader capacity in biological control adoption research.
