# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

- Context and aim
  - Need to reduce reliance on pesticides due to resistance, environmental concerns, and consumer demand for safer food.
  - Objective: assess why UK arable farmers use IPM, evaluate two biocontrol technologies (conservation biocontrol CBC via habitat management and semiochemical push-pull), and explore social, economic, and policy factors that affect adoption.

- Technologies and research questions
  - Habitat management for natural enemies (field margins, beetle banks, floral strips) as a broad-scale CBC approach.
  - Semiochemical-based push-pull strategies to manipulate pest and predator behavior and distribution.
  - Key questions: how do these technologies perform technically and economically, how does scale of adoption affect effectiveness, and what policies or market mechanisms promote uptake?

- Methods and data sources
  - Consumer data and willingness-to-pay (WTP) analyses using two Choice Experiments (bread and fruits/vegetables) with 3,000-household sample; latent class modeling to capture heterogeneity.
  - Farmer Pest Management (PM) Practice Survey: 645 returns (571 usable) from 7,500 mailed surveys; analyses include Principal Component Analysis, regression (parametric/non-parametric), and quantile regression to identify determinants and impacts on insecticide use.
  - Interdisciplinary researcher interviews to understand framing of bio-economic models and integration across disciplines.
  - Field-scale CBC trials: experiments on cereal aphids to evaluate natural enemy efficacy, landscape-scale effects (uncropped land), spatial distribution, and the roles of gravity/margins.
  - Habitat usage and floral resource studies: rubidium-tracking to quantify usage of floral resources by pollinators and predators; GIS mapping of habitat types around fields; ANOVA/GLMs to link habitat features to aphid control.
  - Semiochemical work: formulations (microencapsulated vs gum acacia), release-rate assessments, foraging bioassays with parasitoids (Aphidius ervi and A. rhopalosiphi), semi-field arenas, and field trials with cis-jasmone-treated crops; assessment of pest colonization on treated varieties.
  - Control cage biodiversity experiments (Imperial College): mesocosm studies manipulating predator/parasitoid assemblages to study diversity-function relationships and the importance of species identity and balance on pest control.
  - Economic and policy analysis: integration of field results into a bio-economic model; assessment of AES (agri-environment schemes) payments as a driver of adoption; exploration of pesticide-reduced foods markets and retailer governance.

- Key findings and data-driven insights
  - Consumer and market signals
    - WTP estimates indicate substantial consumer value for reduced-pesticide foods: 100% pesticide reduction in bread equates to £0.92 per loaf in environmental quality terms; £6.85 per week for 100% reduction in pesticides in bread (health). Equivalent pesticide tax recommendations: £7.07/kg actives for cereals; £104/kg for horticulture.
  - Farmer adoption patterns and determinants
    - UK arable farmers use IPM portfolios rather than single practices; Portfolio 1 (cropped environment modifications) associated with reduced insecticide use; Portfolio 3 (CBC-focused habitat features) showed less clear evidence of reducing insecticide use.
    - Adoption is driven by farm type, tenure, AES engagement, and other unobserved farm characteristics; Southern regions show different adoption patterns, with SE sometimes showing fewer technologies due to policy implementation and social networks.
    - Nonparametric models suggest full-time, younger farmers on larger farms in southern/eastern England adopt more PM technologies; organic farmers do not necessarily adopt more complex PM portfolios than conventional farms.
  - Effectiveness of natural enemies and habitat features
    - Flying natural enemies (e.g., hoverflies, parasitoids) provide stronger aphid control than ground-based predators alone; under optimal margins, aphid suppression improved with broad grass margins (250–750 m radius from fields); epigeal predators were less effective, and hedgerow area sometimes reduced leaf-ground predator control.
    - Habitat features like wide margins increased predator diversity and abundance; margins improved biocontrol, yet the transfer of predators from margins into adjacent crops varied and sometimes limited.
  - Semiochemical efficacy and formulations
    - Cis-jasmone can enhance parasitoid foraging (Aphidius ervi) and reduce aphid colonization in semi-field and field trials, particularly in peas; wheat results were less clear due to low aphid pressure but indicated plant activators could reduce pest pressure when combined with suitable cultivars.
    - Release rate: gum acacia formulations provided sustained release (~6 days) and were preferred for field trials; microencapsulated formulations lacked sustained release beyond 48 hours.
    - Crop variety responses: some wheat varieties (e.g., Solstice) showed stronger responses to cis-jasmone; combining activators with plant variety traits may optimize suppression.
  - Pest control in practice and scale
    - CBC effectiveness observed in laboratory and small-field settings; field-scale results for CBC depended on landscape context and scale of habitat augmentation; AES payments supported habitat establishment and some reductions in pesticide use, but scale effects and landscape design remain critical.
    - Biodiversity and functional complementarity: balanced natural enemy assemblages yield higher predation than dominant assemblages; diversity can improve pest control, but reliability and consistency vary with community balance and total predator abundance.
  - Economic and policy implications
    - AES has begun to reduce dependence on pesticides by funding habitat enhancements; adoption is sensitive to policy design and compensation structures.
    - Economic viability depends on adoption costs, risk preferences, and the broader policy environment; social value hinges on creating a market for pesticide-reduced foods and retailer governance to encourage uptake.
  - Overall conclusions on adoption and technology readiness
    - Progress is needed on multiple fronts before CBC and semiochemicals can substitute conventional insecticides across cereals; key gaps include understanding scale-up effects, non-species-specific IPM integration, and robust field-scale economic assessments.
    - Semiochemicals show promise but require replication across crops and pest complexes; combining CBC with semiochemical strategies may overcome individual limitations.
    - AES and policy designs can accelerate adoption but must address scale, cost structures, and streamlining implementation for farmers.

- Implications for adoption, policy, and practice
  - Adoption drivers and barriers
    - Private vs public costs: adoption may rely on subsidies or payments to offset fixed costs of implementing habitat changes and semiochemical systems.
    Non-market signals (consumer willingness to pay) can support market-based adoption through premium products.
  - Policy and market design
    - AES and Environment Stewardship schemes can incentivize habitat-based CBC, but program design must account for scale effects, landscape context, and farmer heterogeneity.
    Retailer governance and supply-chain strategies could bolster market uptake for pesticide-reduced foods.
  - Research and development priorities
    - Expand beyond cereal aphids to other pests and crops; investigate species complementarity, intraguild interactions, and long-term landscape-scale effects.
    - Develop more robust field-scale replication and landscape-level studies; test new semiochemicals and plant activators; explore plant breeding for enhanced responsiveness to activators.
    - Integrate socio-economics with ecology via bio-economic models to guide policy and rollout strategies.

- Capacity-building, collaboration, and dissemination
  - Capacity-building across economics, ecology, GIS, and biocontrol disciplines; acknowledge and address interdisciplinary coordination challenges and field-scale replication needs.
  - Outputs include publications, dissemination to farmers and stakeholders, and guidance on beneficials management in farmland.

- Enduring message
  - CBC and semiochemical-based pest management hold promise as components of a broader IPM strategy, potentially reducing pesticide use and supporting biodiversity in UK arable systems.
  - Real-world adoption requires: understanding scale effects, aligning farmer risk preferences, designing effective AES/policy instruments, and building market demand for pesticide-reduced foods.
  - A integrated, data-driven approach—combining economics, ecology, and practical farm-scale testing—remains essential to translating scientific advances into widespread, profitable practice.
