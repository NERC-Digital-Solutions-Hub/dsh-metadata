# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

- Purpose and scope
  - Investigates two biological control technologies for arable crops: habitat management for natural enemies (e.g., field margins, beetle banks) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies.
  - Aims to understand technical feasibility, scale effects, and the economics/policy context to promote broad adoption of biological control in UK cereals.
  - Considers social science aspects (farmer adoption, risk preferences, AES engagement) alongside natural science and economics.

- GIS and spatial analysis in the project
  - Landscape-scale focus: mapping and analyzing cropped and uncropped land within 1000 m radii of fields; assessment of habitat features (grass margins, hedgerows, field margins, flower-rich areas).
  - Spatial analyses to link pest control outcomes to habitat configuration and landscape context; use of GIS to store and analyze field and landscape data.
  - Tracking and movement studies: spatial distribution and movement of natural enemies (predators/parasitoids) and pests across fields; use of window traps and exclusion cages with geographic referencing.
  - Scale and adoption: evaluation across four uptake levels from field to landscape scale, examining how habitat manipulation at different spatial extents affects pest control.
  - Floral resource usage: marking and tracking of pollinators/predators (e.g., rubidium marking on floral margins) and detection of movement patterns with spatial sampling grids and GIS integration.
  - Semiochemical deployment and pest/beneficial distribution: linking treatment plots, crop varieties, and pest/beneficial distributions to spatial data.

- Data types and methodological approaches
  - Field experiments: field margins, beetle banks, grass margins, and flower-rich margins; various exclusion treatments to parse predator/parasitoid effects.
  - Semiochemical work: cis-jasmone formulations, release rates, field and semi-field trials, and crop variety responses.
  - Pest and beneficial monitoring: aphid counts, predator/parasitoid abundances, and spatial clustering analyses (SADIE).
  - Economic and social science components: choice experiments for willingness-to-pay (WTP) and pesticide reduction; farmer pest-management practice surveys; latent class analysis; regression and count-data models to relate adoption to farm characteristics and landscape factors.
  - Interdisciplinary and capacity-building elements: GIS integration across datasets; training in GIS and related analytics; collaboration with other RES projects.

- Key findings relevant to GIS-informed interpretation
  - Habitat enhancement and ISPM: flying natural enemies provided stronger aphid suppression than ground predators; aphid control increased with greater area of grass margins within 250–750 m, while hedgerows could reduce some predator efficacy at certain scales.
  - Habitat complexity and diversity: balanced natural enemy assemblages tended to yield more reliable pest suppression than dominated communities; species richness interacts with predator abundance to influence pest control.
  - Semiochemicals: cis-jasmone showed potential to enhance parasitoid activity and reduce aphids in some crops (notably peas); wheat results were inconclusive due to low pest pressure and require replication.
  - Landscape-scale adoption: effectiveness and economic viability of CBC and semiochemicals depend on scale of habitat deployment; AES support (Field Margins, Beetle Banks, Floral Strips) can facilitate adoption, but design and scale must align with ecological dynamics.
  - IPM portfolios: farmers combine practices into portfolios, with adoption patterns influenced by farm type, tenure, AES engagement; some portfolios reduced insecticide use, though effects varied by context.
  - Economic and policy implications: willingness to pay for pesticide-reduced foods indicates potential market benefits; pesticide tax scenarios provide policy benchmarking; AES-driven landscape changes can alter private costs and benefits of adoption.
  - Data-driven insights for GIS products: results support creating maps of IPM portfolio adoption, habitat configurations, AES uptake, and predicted pest-control performance under different landscape designs.

- Implications for GIS-enabled data products
  - Spatial distribution maps of habitat features (margins, fences, field margins) and their relationships with pest control efficacy.
  - Landscape-scale risk and opportunity maps showing areas where habitat manipulation could yield the greatest pest suppression.
  - IPM portfolio visualization dashboards linking farm-level practices to landscape context and pest outcomes.
  - WTP and economic scenario maps to support policy and retailer engagement analyses.
  - GIS-based decision-support layers for AES planning, highlighting scale-appropriate habitat interventions and their expected biocontrol benefits.

- Policy, stakeholder engagement, and dissemination
  - AES/policy design considered central to enabling adoption; findings inform refinement of Environmental Stewardship schemes and incentive structures.
  - Consumer and retailer research (WTP, market trials) informs positioning of pesticide-reduced products and potential supply-chain governance.
  - Outputs include practitioner-oriented guidelines and collaboration with policymakers to integrate biocontrol strategies into wider IPM frameworks.

- Capacity building and collaboration
  - Training in MATLAB, R, and GIS; cross-disciplinary collaboration among economists, ecologists, entomologists, and sociologists.
  - Outputs include publications, joint presentations, and capacity-building activities to propagate GIS-enabled methods in agri-environment research.

- Future directions and continued GIS relevance
  - Expand analyses to additional pests and crops; test scalability of habitat management and semiochemical approaches across broader landscapes.
  - Develop precision-GIS approaches and integrate GPS-grounded farm data to refine habitat deployment strategies.
  - Further investigation of landscape-scale adoption dynamics, spatial spillovers, and market/policy mechanisms to sustain long-term IPM adoption.
