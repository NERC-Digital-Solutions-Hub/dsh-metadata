# Re-Bugging the System: Promoting Adoption of Alternative Pest Management Strategies in Field Crop Systems.

- End-of-Award Report: RES-224-25-0093-A (2005-2009) from the ESRC project “Re-bugging the System.”

## Project and dataset landscape
- Focus: Understanding and promoting adoption of alternative pest management technologies in arable crops, notably habitat management for natural enemies (CBC) and semiochemical-based push-pull strategies, within IPM.
- Outputs span multiple disciplines (economics, ecology, entomology, sociology, biochemistry) and scales (lab, field, semi-field arenas, and landscape).
- Data infrastructure involves diverse data types collected across several research strands, with integration across single-field to landscape-scale contexts.

## Datasets and data types generated
- Field-scale pest management trials
  - Aphid biology and cereal aphid biocontrol experiments (field cages/exclusion methods; effects of habitat features like grass margins and uncropped land).
  - Measurements of natural enemy abundance and movement (flying vs epigeal predators; predator exclusion studies).
  - Within-field and neighbor-field predator distributions; spatial analyses (SADIE) and GIS inputs for 1000 m radii around fields.
- Habitat manipulation and biodiversity experiments
  - Grass margins, field margins, hedgerows, margins with flowers; data on predator communities (carabids, staphylinids, hoverflies, spiders, tachinids).
  - Diversity-function experiments examining how natural enemy diversity and balance affect pest control reliability and magnitude.
- Semiochemical and plant-activation (cis-jasmone) studies
  - Formulation development and release-rate measurements (microencapsulated vs gum acacia formulations).
  - Foraging, parasitism, and pest suppression metrics in semi-field arenas and field plots.
  - Plant-variety responsiveness to semiochemical activation; crop-plant–parasitoid interactions; aphid colonization and pest counts in cis-jasmone–treated vs untreated plots.
  - Field-scale replication data across cereals and peas; assessment of pest colonization dynamics and predator-prey interactions.
- Data on consumer preferences and adoption economics
  - Choice experiments and latent-class models assessing willingness to pay for reduced-pesticide foods.
  - Farmer pest-management practice surveys capturing IPM portfolio adoption, farm characteristics, AES engagement, and attitudes to pesticides.
  - Count-data analyses linking number of PM technologies adopted to farm characteristics and regional differences.
- Interdisciplinary and process data
  - Qualitative interviews with researchers; content analysis (NVivo) to understand interdisciplinary framing.
  - Collaboration and capacity-building records; training and dissemination materials.
- Economic and policy datasets
  - Pesticide tax estimates and scenarios derived from willingness-to-pay results.
  - AES and policy context data related to the Environmental Stewardship schemes and their influence on adoption.

## Data collection and management methods
- Experimental design
  - Field trials with exclusion cages to isolate predator groups; controls for aphid populations and natural enemy access.
  - Landscape-scale experiments evaluating the effect of uncropped land, margins, and habitat features on biocontrol efficacy.
- Measurements and analyses
  - Aphid counts, predator and parasitoid abundances, and parasitism rates.
  - Spatial distribution analyses using GIS and SADIE; tracking predator movement and habitat use via traps and rubidium-marking.
  - Floral resource usage tracked with rubidium labeling on margins; subsequent detection in plants and insects.
  - Semiochemical deployment assessments, including foraging time, parasitism rates, and pest population dynamics.
- Statistical and modelling approaches
  - ANOVA, GLMs, regressions, and non-parametric and Bayesian methods to assess treatments, margins, and biodiversity effects.
  - Bio-economic modelling to integrate ecological and economic drivers and to explore scale effects on adoption and effectiveness.
- Data integration and interoperability
  - GIS-based habitat and landscape data integrated with field-level pest and predator data.
  - Cross-disciplinary data alignment through common experimental designs and timelines; emphasis on replication and robustness given variable infestation levels.

## Data governance, storage, and sharing (Data Stewardship perspective)
- Ownership and stewardship
  - Multiple institutions involved (e.g., Imperial College London; Rothamsted-related work; collaboration with ESRC-funded projects), necessitating clear data ownership, access rights, and licensing arrangements.
- Documentation and metadata
  - Rich methodological metadata required (experimental design, plot layout, margins, habitat features, crop varieties, formulations, release rates, sampling schedules).
  - Metadata should capture scale (field, farm, landscape), context (AES engagement, farm type), and data quality notes ( infestation levels, replication counts, missing data).
- Data standards and interoperability
  - Datasets span agronomy, ecology, economics, and social science; alignment with a shared metadata scheme and controlled vocabularies (e.g., habitat types, natural enemy guilds, pest species) would facilitate integration and reuse.
- Storage and accessibility
  - Data are generated across lab, semi-field, and field environments; storage should be centralized with versioning, access controls, and long-term preservation plans.
  - Publication data and outputs (joint publications, conference presentations) exist; ensure raw and processed data underpinning these outputs are accessible for replication and secondary analysis.
- Data quality and limitations
  - Field-scale data plagued by low pest pressure in some trials, affecting statistical power and conclusiveness.
  - High ecological and spatial complexity; variability across sites, crops, margins, and adoption scales requires careful QA/QC and documentation.
- Discoverability and reuse
  - Data tied to published papers, theses, and project outputs; consider depositing in appropriate data repositories with proper licensing to enable reuse by AES programs, policymakers, and researchers.
- Data privacy and policy alignment
  - Socio-economic data involve farmer responses and consumer preferences; ensure anonymization and compliance with consent and data-use policies.

## Key insights relevant to data governance
- The project generated highly heterogeneous datasets across disciplines and scales, underscoring the need for standardized metadata, stable data schemas, and clear data provenance.
- Scale and context matter: habitat management and semiochemical approaches show effects that depend on field, farm, and landscape scales, which must be captured in datasets and documented for proper interpretation.
- The integration of ecological and economic data is central to adoption analysis; datasets should support both biological efficacy and cost-benefit assessments, including policy implications (AES, pesticide reductions, consumer demand).
- Data quality is contingent on replication and infestation levels; documentation should explicitly flag limitations and confidence in results, guiding future data reuse and meta-analyses.

## End-of-project outcomes affecting data stewardship
- Numerous publications and conference presentations demonstrate data-driven findings on CBC efficacy, biodiversity-function relationships, semiochemical applications, and IPM adoption patterns.
- Capacity-building activities yielded methodological and technical data (statistical, GIS, modelling, and market research techniques) that should be preserved with appropriate metadata for future reuse.

## Recommendations for data stewardship and future data management
- Establish a formal data management plan that includes: data ownership, access controls, licensing, long-term storage, and an inventory of all data types with associated metadata schemas.
- Develop standardized metadata templates across all strands (ecology, agronomy, economics, social science) to enable cross-study interoperability and re-use.
- Create a centralized repository or data warehouse linking field trial data, GIS habitat data, semiochemical datasets, and economic surveys, with version control and clear provenance.
- Ensure explicit documentation of data quality, limitations (e.g., low infestation levels, site-specific variability), and replication levels to inform future reanalysis and meta-studies.
- Promote data sharing through open-access repositories where appropriate, balancing IP and collaboration needs, and accompany datasets with codebooks, analysis scripts, and data dictionaries.
- Align datasets with potential future AES evaluations and policy analyses by including variables on habitat features, AES engagement, and adoption indicators.
- Plan for landscape-scale, cross-site data integration to support scalable adoption analyses and robust economic modelling.
