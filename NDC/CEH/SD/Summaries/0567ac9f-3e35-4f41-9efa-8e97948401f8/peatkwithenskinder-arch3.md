# Collection methods

- Study sites and sampling design
  - Two peatland sites in the Peak District, northern England: Withens Clough (Withens) and Kinder Scout (Kinder).
  - At each site: three peatland gullies (Withens: W1–W3; Kinder: K1–K3).
  - Sampling conducted next to a gully dam and at a comparison area further down the gully (undisturbed).
  - Sample positions: at the gully edge (0 m), 1 m from the edge, and 5 m from the edge into the peat mass.
  - Depths sampled: mid-point depths of 5 cm (surface), 40 cm, and 80 cm.
  - Sampling period: December 2021 to January 2022.

- Sampling methods
  - At the gully edge: 5 cm depth samples collected using a 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm box corer; 40 cm and 80 cm depth samples collected from the gully face with the same method.
  - At 1 m and 5 m distances: 1 m long, 110 mm diameter tube corer used for 40 cm and 80 cm depths; 10 cm samples taken, centered 5 cm around the mid-point depth.
  - A single sample per depth per location.

- Laboratory analysis and hydraulic conductivity measurement
  - Hydraulic conductivity (K) measured in a split cylinder setup, based on a thawed peat sample encased in an acrylic split cylinder with internal silicone grease to prevent preferential flow.
  - Saturation achieved with site water; a Mariotte regulator provides a hydraulic gradient across the sample.
  - K calculation based on Darcy’s law: K = (Q / A) × (ΔL / ΔH), where Q is flow rate, A is cross-sectional area, ΔL is sample length, and ΔH is the hydraulic head difference.

- Quality control
  - All laboratory work conducted at the University of Leeds, School of Geography.
  - For each sample, three measurements were taken and the mean value reported.

- Data details and units
  - Recorded values: Saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) in centimetres per second (cm s⁻¹).

- Data structure and coding
  - Data are organized with the following columns:
    - Area: Withens or Kinder
    - Gully: W1, W2, W3, K1, K2, K3 (prefix indicating site: W for Withens, K for Kinder)
    - Location: Block (near dam) or Down (near open gully area)
    - Distance from gully edge: 0 (edge), 1 (1 m from edge), 5 (5 m from edge)
    - Depth: 5, 40, 80 (mid-point depths in cm)
    - K: numeric values for saturated hydraulic conductivity

- Data provenance
  - Methodology references include the split-cylinder approach and the adaptation of procedures related to directional hydraulic conductivity assessments in peat.
