# Collection methods

- Purpose and context
  - Collect and measure saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) in peatlands to monitor environmental health and policy-relevant peatland restoration effects.
  - Two monitoring sites in the Peak District: Withens Clough (Withens) and Kinder Scout (Kinder).

- Study sites and sampling design
  - Sites: Two peatland locations (Withens and Kinder).
  - Gullies: Three per site (Withens: W1, W2, W3; Kinder: K1, K2, K3).
  - Sampling positions at each gully:
    - At gully edge (0 m)
    - 1 m from the gully edge into the peat mass (1 m)
    - 5 m from the gully edge into the peat mass (5 m)
  - Depths sampled at each position: 5 cm (surface), 40 cm, 80 cm.
  - 5 cm depth collected with a 10 cm × 10 cm × 10 cm box corer; 40 cm and 80 cm depths collected with a 1 m long, 110 mm diameter tube corer (at edge, 1 m, and 5 m positions as applicable).
  - Sampling window: December 2021 – January 2022.
  - Peat sampling performed next to a gully dam (restoration feature) and in a dam-free area for comparison.

- Laboratory methods
  - Hydraulic conductivity (K) measured using a split cylinder method (faster than paraffin-wax encapsulation), with samples saturated using site water.
  - Apparatus: acrylic split-cylinder with inner silicone grease; Mariotte regulator provides hydraulic head difference.
  - Calculation (Darcy’s law adaptation): K = (Q/A) × (ΔL/ΔH), where Q is flow rate, A is cross-sectional area, ΔL is sample length, ΔH is head difference.
  - Units: K in centimetres per second (cm/s).

- Data quality and processing
  - For each sample, three measurements were taken; the mean of the three flow rates is reported as K.
  - All laboratory work conducted at the School of Geography, University of Leeds.

- Data structure and variables
  - Area: Withens or Kinder.
  - Gully: W1, W2, W3 (Withens) or K1, K2, K3 (Kinder).
  - Location: Block (adjacent to dam feature) or Down (adjacent to open gully area).
  - Distance from gully edge: 0 (edge), 1 (1 m), 5 (5 m).
  - Depth: 5, 40, 80 (mid-point depths in cm).
  - K: Saturated hydraulic conductivity value (cm/s).
