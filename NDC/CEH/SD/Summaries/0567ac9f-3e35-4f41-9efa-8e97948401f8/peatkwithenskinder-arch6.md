# Collection methods

## Overview
- Two peatland sites in the Peak District, northern England: Withens Clough (Withens) and Kinder Scout (Kinder).
- At each site, three peatland gullies: W1, W2, W3 (Withens) and K1, K2, K3 (Kinder).
- Peat sampling conducted at the gully edge, 1 m into the peat mass, and 5 m into the peat mass for comparison.

## Sampling design
- Sampling points located adjacent to a gully dam (Block) and at open gully areas away from the dam (Down).
- Depths sampled: 5 cm (surface), 40 cm, and 80 cm mid-point depths.
- For edge samples, 5 cm depth collected with a box corer; 40 cm and 80 cm depths collected from the gully face.
- For samples at 1 m and 5 m from the edge, 40 cm and 80 cm depths collected with a 1 m long, 110 mm diameter tube corer.
- Sample collection period: December 2021 to January 2022.

## Measurement technique
- Hydraulic conductivity (K) measured in the laboratory using a split cylinder method (adapted from the modified cube method) to allow small samples.
- Process: peat thawed, enclosed in an acrylic split-cylinder with silicone grease; saturated with site water; Mariotte regulator used to establish a hydraulic gradient with drainage tube.
- Calculation: K = (Q / A) × (ΔL / ΔH), where Q is flow rate, A is cross-sectional area, ΔL is sample length, and ΔH is head difference.

## Data structure and units
- Recorded as saturated hydraulic conductivity (K) in centimetres per second (cm/s).
- Data columns:
  - Area: Withens or Kinder
  - Gully: W1, W2, W3, K1, K2, K3 (W indicates Withens; K indicates Kinder)
  - Location: Block or Down
  - Distance from gully edge: 0, 1, or 5 (metres from edge)
  - Depth: 5, 40, or 80 (cm, mid-point depth)
  - K: numeric value of saturated hydraulic conductivity

## Quality control
- Laboratory work conducted at the University of Leeds.
- For each sample, three measurements were taken; the mean of these three flow rates was calculated and reported as the K value.
