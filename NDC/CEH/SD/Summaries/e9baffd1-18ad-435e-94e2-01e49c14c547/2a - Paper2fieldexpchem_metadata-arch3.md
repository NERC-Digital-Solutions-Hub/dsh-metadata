# Soil Core Sample Dataset Metadata

- Overview
  - This dataset captures soil core measurements across field sites, including whether a biochar amendment was applied, sampling depth, timing, and a suite of chemical and physical soil properties. It supports monitoring and evaluation of soil health and treatment effects, with emphasis on data transparency and reuse.

- Key Variables
  - soilcorenumber: Unique identifier for each soil sample/core
  - site: Field site where the sample is located
  - biocharamendment: Whether the sample is unamended or amended with biochar
  - depth: Depth of the soil sample from the soil surface
  - treatmentfullname: Full name of the soil treatment (e.g., biochar and wetted)
  - dayfromstart: Days from the start of measurements
  - date: Date of the soil gas flux analysis
  - pH.water: Soil pH in water (1:2.5 ratio)
  - total.C.percent: Total carbon content as a percentage
  - total.N.percent: Total nitrogen content as a percentage
  - CN ratio: Carbon-to-nitrogen ratio
  - extract.nh4-n.mgkg: Extractable ammonium (NH4-N) in mg/kg
  - extract.no3-n.mgkg: Extractable nitrate (NO3-N) in mg/kg after incubation
  - drysoilweightg: Dry soil weight in grams
  - gravwatercontproportion: Gravimetric water content as a proportion
  - bulkdensitygcm3: Bulk density in g/cm^3
  - bulkdensitygcm3SE: Standard error of the bulk density

- Data Quality and Metadata Considerations
  - Metadata completeness is crucial for verifying dataset suitability and comparability across sites and treatments.
  - Some fields may require standardization (units, measurement methods) and may need transformation for integration with other datasets.
  - Public sharing of underlying data can be a barrier depending on governance and licensing.

- Data Governance and Sharing
  - Ensure data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, and presented clearly (e.g., in reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Promote openness and appropriate sharing of underlying data, while maintaining data governance standards.

- Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
  - Provides a structured set of soil health indicators (pH, C and N content, CN ratio, inorganic N forms, moisture, and density) across treatments.
  - Supports assessment of management practices (biochar amendment) on soil properties and gas flux analyses.
  - Enables trend analysis and policy-relevant insights for environmental health monitoring and decision-making.

- Challenges and Barriers
  - Data gaps or poor metadata can hinder usability.
  - Data silos within or between organizations can impede integration.
  - Public data sharing requirements may limit access to some datasets.
  - Keeping data up to date and ensuring standardised data governance can be resource-intensive.
  - Transforming data formats to a usable form may require effort.
