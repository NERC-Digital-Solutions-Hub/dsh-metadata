# Data Collection

## Context and aims
- NERC-funded PhD project examining interactions between avian colonial social structure and tick-borne pathogen dynamics.
- Site: Isle of May, Firth of Forth, Scotland (56.2° N, 2.6° W) chosen for its large, accessible guillemot population (model species).
- Objective: quantify movements of immature guillemots to understand infection risk to the breeding colony, particularly regarding tick-borne Great Island virus.

## Field site, period, and sampling design
- Data collection at four sites on the Isle of May.
- Timeframe: 25 April–12 May and 21 May–15 June 2013.
- Population under study: immature guillemots; targeted because they are more frequently infected with the virus.
- A grid overlaid on site photographs to record locations; grid cells classified as breeding or pre-breeding based on breeding activity (egg or chick) observed during data collection.
- Some feeding/leading-edge nuances: cells with ledges and surrounding breeding activity may be treated as breeding areas.

## Data collection protocol
- Focal birds: 69 randomly selected, individually marked; followed with a telescope (×20–60) for 10-minute periods.
- Location recorded every 15 seconds; if a focal bird went out of sight, the watch continued; if it flew away, the watch was terminated.
- Each site observed for 2 hours per day; stratified sampling to ensure balanced coverage across sites and times of day.
- Dataset includes some preliminary data.
- Breeder attendance index: calculated by counting birds in a defined breeding area and dividing by the maximum count in that area to yield a proportional breeder attendance measure.

## Data outputs and observations
- Primary outputs: 
  - Time spent by individuals in pre-breeding vs. breeding areas (from grid locations).
  - Proportional breeder attendance per site.
- These outputs support assessment of infection risk related to movement between habitat types.

## Data structure and variables
- Date_norm: Day count from first data collection date.
- Sub_colony: Site where the bird was observed.
- Time_perod: 1 = dawn–10:30, 2 = 10:30–16:00, 3 = 16:00–dusk.
- Wind_strength: 1 = None, 2 = Light breeze, 3 = Fair breeze, 4 = Strong, 5 = Gale force.
- Sea condition: 1 = Still, 2 = Calm, 3 = Fairly choppy, 5 = Very choppy, 6 = High waves.
- Temperature: 1 = Very warm, 2 = Warm, 3 = Comfortable, 4 = Cool, 5 = Very Cool, 6 = Freezing.
- B_att_prop: Number of breeding birds observed in the defined area divided by the maximum count in that area.
- Age: Age of bird (current year minus year of ringing).
- Ring: Unique ID for each bird.
- Sampling period: Length of time that the bird was watched (mostly 10 min; some preliminary observations vary).
- P_recs: Number of intervals in which the bird was seen in a pre-breeding area.
- Time interval: Interval at which location was recorded (mostly 15 seconds; some preliminary observations vary).
- B_recs: Number of intervals in which the bird was seen in a breeding area.
- Other_unknown_recs: Number of intervals in which the bird was not seen in any grid cell (e.g., flew off).
- Other_known_recs: Number of intervals in which the bird was seen in a grid cell of unknown status.

## Data quality, standards, and accessibility
- The dataset is organized with standardized fields and clearly defined categories to enable consistent analysis, quality assurance, cleaning, and potential integration with other data sources and data portals.
- Preliminary data are included, highlighting the evolving nature of the dataset and the need for ongoing QA and harmonization.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Demonstrates how field-collected wildlife movement and habitat-use data can be structured and analyzed to assess infection risk dynamics within an environment.
- Illustrates standardized recording of spatial-temporal behavior and associated environmental covariates (wind, sea state, temperature) to support monitoring over time. 

## Challenges and opportunities
- Challenge: increasing the value of the dataset by integrating with other relevant data (e.g., infection data, broader environmental context) beyond single-use analyses.
- Opportunity: enabling broader access to underlying data to support replication, secondary analyses, and policy-relevant environmental health assessments.
