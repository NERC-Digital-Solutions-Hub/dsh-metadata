# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers contributing data.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status across the UK since 1976, informing biodiversity status and policy questions; data come from a wide-scale, site-based monitoring network (over 3000 active sites in recent years).

- Sampling framework (three main components):
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long, recorded weekly (up to 26 counts/year) in habitats; weather-aware surveys.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (plus encouraged spring visits).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, eggs/larval web counts) focused on specific species.

- Data collected and trend analysis:
  - Abundance indices are calculated as relative measures of population size across sites and years.
  - Collated species indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (since 2016) with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year, integrating data from Pollard walks, reduced surveys, and WCBS.
  - The method uses seasonal patterns to extrapolate counts for gaps, with weighting favoring observed data over extrapolated data.

- Data quality control and management:
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods); regional transect coordinators review and validate data throughout the season.
  - Further automated/manual validation screens for records outside distribution ranges, atypical flight periods, first-time site records, and extreme values; corrections are made through queries and coordinators’ input.

- Details of this data download:
  - Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data, formatted as a CSV.
  - Long-term series run from 1976 to 2022 (start year may vary per species due to data availability).
  - Key columns include: COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS (years in series), F_LIN_B (annual slope), F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL, F_FULL_R, plus 10- and 20-year trend metrics (T10/LIN_B/SE/P and T20/LIN_B/SE/P with corresponding trend details and % changes), among others.
  - Descriptions reference standard butterfly name authorities (Emmet & Heath; Agassiz et al.).
