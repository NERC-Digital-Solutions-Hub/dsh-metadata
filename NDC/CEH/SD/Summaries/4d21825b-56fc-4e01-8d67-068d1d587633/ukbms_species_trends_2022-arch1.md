# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Organisation and purpose
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (UKCEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
  - It relies on volunteer contributions and has monitored butterfly abundance across the UK since 1976, with over 3,000 actively recorded sites annually.
  - Data support understanding changes in insect populations and informing policy questions on biodiversity status and trends.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to ~26 visits per year) across habitat units.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–3 visits per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg and larval web counts) focused on particular species or life stages.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Indices are generated using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with site-level weighting based on the proportion of the species’ flight period surveyed that year.
  - The approach uses counts from all methods to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, giving more weight to observed data than to extrapolated data.
  - All-site indices are combined to produce species-level, collated indices.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS data entry site) or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data and address potential issues; ongoing validation checks for distribution range, flight period, first site records, and outlier abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and discussion with coordinators or recorders.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides long- and short-term trends for all species with sufficient data, in a CSV format.
  - Long-term trends span from 1976 to 2022 (start year may be later for some species due to data sufficiency).
  - Key columns include:
    - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS
    - F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL, F_FULL_R
    - T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R
    - T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R
  - The data describe annual slopes, standard errors, significance (P-values), and narrative trend details for long-term and 10- and 20-year windows, plus percent change measures.
