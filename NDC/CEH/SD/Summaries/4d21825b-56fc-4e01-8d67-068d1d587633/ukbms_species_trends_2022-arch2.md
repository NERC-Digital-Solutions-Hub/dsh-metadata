# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with thanks to volunteers.
- Established in 1976; monitors butterfly population status across the UK using a large-scale, site-based framework with over 3,000 actively recorded sites annually.
- Data from all sampling methods are analyzed together to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Nature of data collected and monitoring framework

- Three main sampling components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year (weekly), 5 m wide band, April–September; sites increased to >2,000 by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, two parallel transects, 2–3 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August), ~800 squares per year.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, egg/larval web counts and other methods focused on specific species.
- Data are transformed into abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Indices are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with a weighting scheme that emphasizes data from the portion of the flight period surveyed each year, improving reliability where data gaps exist.

## Data quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators perform ongoing validation; data are subjected to automated and manual checks for out-of-range records or distribution issues.
- Corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders before finalizing the dataset.

## Details of this data download

- Provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data; delivered as a CSV.
- Time coverage:
  - Long-term trends from 1976 to 2022 (or later start years for some species due to data sufficiency).
- Key columns include:
  - COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME, NYEARS (years of series), F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL, F_FULL_R.
  - Last 20 years: T20_LIN_B, T20_LIN_SE, T20_LIN_P, T20_TRENDDETAIL, T20_20_R.
  - Last 10 years: T10_LIN_B, T10_LIN_SE, T10_LIN_P, T10_TRENDDETAIL, T10_10_R.
- Descriptions explain trend direction and significance (e.g., Rapid decline/increase, Stable).
