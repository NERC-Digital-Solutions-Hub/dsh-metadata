# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Purpose and governance
- Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Acknowledge and thank volunteers contributing data.
- Provides annual site-based monitoring data to understand butterfly population status and inform biodiversity policy questions.

## Data collection and sampling framework
- Sampling components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weekly during favourable weather, across over 2000 sites by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares, 2–3 visits per year, ~800 squares annually.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) for specific species.
- All data from different methods are analyzed together to monitor changes in butterfly populations across the UK since 1976 (over 3000 sites annually).

## Trend analysis and data construction
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Indices reflect a constant proportion of the population but vary by species detectability.
- Collated indices are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting adjustment that prioritizes observed counts and accounts for the proportion of the flight period sampled each year.
- All counts from the season (including reduced surveys and WCBS) are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with greater weight given to observed data.

## Data quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms; entered online via UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight period).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Additional automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, unusual timing, new site records, and extreme values; corrections made through queries and coordination.

## Data download details
- Dataset provides long- and short-term trends in collated indices for species with sufficient data.
- Available as CSV (.csv).
- Time coverage: long-term trends from 1976 to 2022; some species have later start years due to data gaps.
- Key columns include species names (COMMON_NAME, SCI_NAME), years (NYEARS), trend metrics (e.g., F_LIN_B, F_LIN_SE, F_LIN_P, F_TRENDDETAIL; T20/LIN/T20 sectors; T10 sectors), and percentage changes (F_FULL_R, T20_20_R, T10_10_R) with descriptive trend details.
