# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/d8655cc9-b275-4e779e6c-1b16eee5c7d5

## What happened
- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000.

## Why a direct correction could not be provided
- The Met Office cannot supply a corrected version of the monthly grids at this time.
- The dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 data next year in March.

## What CEH did to address the issue
- Derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from the Met Office daily rainfall grids.
- Recalculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the entire period using the corrected dataset.
- Added an extra accumulation period of 9 months, based on feedback on the superseded dataset.

## Implications for monitoring and data governance
- Demonstrates the need for robust data provenance and documentation of corrections.
- Maintains transparency by detailing the workaround and recalculation approach.
- Highlights implications for metadata quality and reproducibility of indicators (e.g., SPI) when source data are corrected or superseded.
