# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/d8655cc9-b275-4e779e6c-1b16eee5c7d5

- Context: An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000. The Met Office cannot provide a corrected version because the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 in March next year.
- Corrective approach: CEH derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from the Met Office daily rainfall grids to produce a corrected dataset.
- Derived analyses: CEH recalculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the entire period using the new corrected dataset.
- Dataset enhancement: An extra 9-month accumulation period was added based on feedback from users of the superseded dataset.
- Implications for users: Expect potentially different rainfall estimates and SPI values for 1960–2000 due to the correction; use the corrected dataset going forward and note the updated accumulation period.
