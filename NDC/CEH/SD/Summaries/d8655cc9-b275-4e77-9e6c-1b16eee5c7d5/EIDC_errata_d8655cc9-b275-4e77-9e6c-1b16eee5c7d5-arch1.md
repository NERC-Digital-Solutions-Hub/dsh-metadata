# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/d8655cc9-b275-4e779e6c-1b16eee5c7d5

## Background
- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for the period 1960–2000.
- The Met Office cannot provide a corrected version of the monthly grids to CEH, as this dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 data in March next year.

## CEH response
- As a fix, CEH derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from the Met Office daily rainfall grids.

## Recalculation of SPI
- CEH recalculated the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) for the entire period using the new corrected dataset.

## Additions based on feedback
- An extra accumulation period of 9 months was added, based on feedback regarding the superseded dataset.

## Implications for users
- Ensures continuity and usability of the dataset and SPI results until UKCP18 becomes available.
- Documentation of changes supports transparency and reproducibility.

## Data provenance and next steps
- The corrected data are derived from daily grids and will be superseded by UKCP18; users should consider transitioning to the updated dataset when released.
