# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/d8655cc9-b275-4e779e6c-1b16eee5c7d5

## What happened
- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000.
- The Met Office cannot provide a corrected monthly grid version to CEH, as the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 in March next year.

## How it was addressed
- CEH derived monthly rainfall grids for the problematic period from Met Office daily rainfall grids.
- SPI (Standardized Precipitation Index) was recalculated for the entire period using the corrected dataset.
- An extra accumulation period of 9 months was added based on user feedback from the superseded dataset.

## Data governance and implications
- This is a temporary workaround due to data availability and impending supersession; ensures continuity of analysis.
- Users should note updated rainfall grids and SPI values, and consider potential changes to prior conclusions.
- Documentation and metadata should capture the correction, versioning, and dataset lineage, including the forthcoming UKCP18 supersession.
