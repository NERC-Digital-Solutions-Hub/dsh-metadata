# Errata for dataset http://doi.org/10.5285/d8655cc9-b275-4e779e6c-1b16eee5c7d5

## Overview
- An error was found in the Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data for 1960–2000.
- The Met Office cannot provide a corrected monthly-grid version; the dataset will be superseded by UKCP18 in March next year.
- CEH derived monthly rainfall grids from the Met Office daily rainfall grids for the problematic period.
- SPI was recalculated for the entire period using the corrected dataset.
- An extra accumulation period of 9 months was added based on user feedback on the superseded dataset.

## What changed
- Correction method: monthly grids created from daily Met Office rainfall data for 1960–2000.
- Recalculation: Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) redone across the full period with the corrected data.
- New parameter: inclusion of a 9-month accumulation period.

## Methods and data stewardship
- Data source: Met Office gridded monthly rainfall data (with identified errors).
- Processing: derive monthly grids from daily rainfall data; recalibrate SPI accordingly.
- Dataset management: updated outputs to reflect corrected data and expanded accumulation period.

## Implications for environmental monitoring
- Increased accuracy of rainfall representation and SPI for 1960–2000.
- Enhanced ability to detect longer-term drought or wetness patterns due to the 9-month accumulation.
- Continuity of monitoring outputs in light of UKCP18 supersession, ensuring usable historical records.

## Access, versioning, and next steps
- Ensure use of the corrected dataset version and note the 9-month accumulation in analyses and dashboards.
- Be aware of the upcoming UKCP18 dataset and plan for integration of its outputs once available.
- Analysts should revalidate historical analyses and maps that relied on the previous, uncorrected data.
