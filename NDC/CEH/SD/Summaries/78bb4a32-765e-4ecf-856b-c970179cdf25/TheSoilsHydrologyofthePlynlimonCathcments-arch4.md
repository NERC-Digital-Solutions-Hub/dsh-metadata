# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments

## Overview
- An observational soil hydrology study (1968/69) at Plynlimon to understand how soils regulate rainfall and runoff; aimed to support field experiments and modelling.
- Two adjacent catchments represent contrasting upland land uses: conifer forestry vs sheep-grazed grassland; designed to be water-tight to isolate soil-water processes.
- Found that soils fall into three hydrologically distinct types, each occupying specific topographic positions and governed by slope aspect and position.
- Introduces the concept of hydrological domains—areas with similar hydrological behaviour defined by slope characteristics, aspect, and soil type distribution.
- Emphasises the need to integrate soil mapping with hydrological processes for improved physically-based models and water quality research.

## Data, Methods, and Structure
- Data collected: field soil profiles, topographic maps, and landform mapping; maps produced from aerial surveys (1:10,000 and 1:5000 scales).
- Mapping was largely subjective and interpolation-based; acknowledges limitations and the potential value of modelling using digitised topography and hydrological-domain criteria.
- Soil types and horizons are described in hydrologically relevant terms (e.g., Podzols, Creep Brown Earths, Peaty Gleys/Podzols) with associated soil-domain concepts.
- Slope is interpreted via an adapted version of the nine-unit land surface model, condensed into seven slope elements, with north- and south-facing classifications.
- Discusses data gaps and the degradation of original maps/photographs, and notes the intent to link soil distributions to hydrological processes.

## Main Findings

### Hydrologically Distinct Soils and Their Topography
- Three main soil types governing hydrology:
  - Podzols: form predominantly on hilltops and upper slopes; strong chemical leaching; intense podzolisation on shallower profiles.
  - Creep Brown Earths: occur on steeper mid-slopes where downslope creep dominates; more mixed horizons and less distinct podzol horizons.
  - Peaty Gleys/Peaty Gley Podzols: develop in valley bottoms with poor drainage; thick peat overlies Boulder Clay or Colluvium; waterlogging creates reduced conditions.
- Soil types align with specific topographic positions and aspects (north-facing vs south-facing) and transition downslope through well-defined sequences.
- Soil parent materials (Head, Boulder Clay, Colluvium) differ in hydraulic properties and respond differently to slope position and aspect, driving the hydrological behaviour of soils.

### Slope Characteristics and Spatial Distribution
- Slope position and aspect strongly influence soil development and hydrological response:
  - South-facing slopes: more rapid erosion and thinner soil profiles; a general progression from Colluvium to Podzols and, downslope, to Creep Brown Earths.
  - North-facing slopes: multiple parent materials (Head, Boulder Clay) with distinct soil sequences; gully erosion more pronounced on certain materials.
- A topographic framework (hilltop, upper/lower convex, upper/lower concave, riparian zones) is used to interpret soil development and hydrological pathways.

### Soil Water Pathways
- Dominance of saturated flow processes; a marked contrast to many lowland settings.
- Main pathways for rainwater to streams:
  - Overland flow on both convex upper slopes and lower concave slopes, with the “thatch” effect and soil hydrophobicity enhancing surface runoff.
  - Subsurface lateral flow within the A/E horizons along impeding layers.
  - Subsurface pipe flow via shallow pipes formed on impeding interfaces (valley-flank and valley-head pipes), a key rapid-transport mechanism.
  - Lateral flow through the base of the weathered rock zone and occasional fissure flow through fresh bedrock.
- Peat and peaty soils store substantial water; impermeable Boulder Clay acts as a barrier, forcing water to move through peat, colluvium, or along bedrock interfaces.
- Groundwater contributions to river flow, if present, are likely not large in quantity but may influence water quality; evidence for significant regolith aquifers is limited and requires further study.

### Groundwater and Hydrological Balance
- Catchments were treated as watertight in early design; lack of strong evidence for sizable groundwater aquifers contributing to river flow.
- Observations suggest limited groundwater storage in bedrock and limited aquifer connectivity across divides; still, shallow joints beneath regolith could provide minor pathways, potentially more on south-facing slopes.
- Acknowledge the need for further experimental work to quantify any hillslope regolith aquifer size, behaviour, and water quality implications.

### Modelling the Soil Map and Hydrological Domains
- Field soil mapping is inherently subjective; boundaries between soil types can be gradual or abrupt.
- Proposes modelling approaches to refine soil maps using digitised topography and hydrological-domain criteria:
  - Divide area by aspect (north vs south), then by slope convexity/concavity and slope angle.
  - Define hydrological domains within these divisions to reflect areas with similar hydrological behaviour.
  - Use soil-domain mapping to improve physically-based models linking hydrographs to rainfall.
- Outlines a potential validation framework: score soil-map accuracy by predicting soil-pit profiles at randomly sited locations; acknowledges subjectivity in pit-map agreement.
- Suggests extensive opportunities for cross-disciplinary research beyond Plynlimon, leveraging hydrological-domain concepts to improve modelling and land-water interaction understanding.

## Data Assets, Quality, and Accessibility
- Primary data are field observations, topographic maps, and soil maps from 1968/69; maps and photos have since aged and some original field maps are indecipherable, with limited direct re-use.
- Digitisation efforts have partially restored maps and images, but color balance and precision in digitisation affect representation of soil profiles.
- Glossary provided to support interpretation of hydrological and pedological terms.
- Emphasises that the dataset provides a valuable, though imperfect, foundation for developing hydrologically meaningful soil maps and models.

## Implications for Data Leaders

- Data strategy and governance:
  - Recognise the value of hydrologically meaningful data structures (soil types, slope elements, hydrological domains) for models and water quality analysis.
  - Prioritise digitisation and metadata enrichment of legacy field maps to improve discoverability and reuse.
  - Develop standardized hydrological-domain definitions that align soil characteristics with topography (aspect, slope position, slope angle).
- Data systems and accessibility:
  - Build a data model that captures soil parent materials, soil types, horizons, and their hydrological behaviours, with clear lineage to topography.
  - Integrate topographic data (aspect, convex/concave slope, inflection points) to automate soil-domain assignment.
  - Create data workflows that support model-informed soil mapping and iterative refinement via field validation.
- Collaboration and reuse:
  - Share hydrological-domain concepts with wider networks to support cross-catchment modelling, water resource planning, and water quality studies.
  - Coordinate data collection with colleagues in hydrology, geomorphology, and pedology to enhance model realism and transferability.

## Modelling and Future Work (Key Ideas)
- Develop hydrological-domain maps by combining digitised topography with slope-position/aspect data to refine soil maps.
- Validate soil maps through systematic pit sampling across randomly chosen locations to quantify accuracy.
- Explore the existence and role of shallow regolith aquifers and fissure networks in influencing river flows and water quality, particularly on south-facing slopes.
- Use refined soil maps to improve physically-based hydrological models that relate rainfall to runoff and inform management decisions in upland catchments.
- Extend the approach to broader networks to enhance understanding of soil-water interactions and to support collaborative data sharing and standard-setting in the data-community.
