# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments Report No. 8

## Overview
- A comprehensive soil hydrology study (1968/69, revised 2005) in the Plynlimon upland catchments to understand how soils regulate rainfall-runoff and inform hydrological modelling.
- Finds three hydrologically distinct soil types connected to topography and aspect: Podzols, Creep Brown Earths, and Peaty Gley/Peaty Gley Podzols.
- Emphasises the potential to improve hydrological mapping by linking soil types to slope position/aspect and to develop hydrological domains for modelling.
- Notes limitations of early field mapping and the value of digitised topography to refine soils maps and models; discusses groundwater contributions and data gaps.

## Abstract
- Observational study establishing how soils regulate rainfall-to-runoff in two watertight catchments (forestry vs grassland) and the role of the regolith and weathered bedrock.
- Key finding: three main soil types with distinct hydrological processes occur in specific topographic positions.
- Indicates possible water storage in deeper weathered rock and pathways (pipes) in the soil/rock system; calls for further study.
- Proposes modelling approaches to refine soil maps using topography and defining hydrological domains.

## 1. Introduction
- Context: Welsh uplands as major water source; interest in land use effects on runoff and floods.
- The Plynlimon experiments compare conifer forestry with sheep-grazed grassland, using highly instrumented catchments.
- Objective of the soil study: map soil types, relate them to topography, and elucidate soil-water pathways to support physically-based hydrological models and water-quality research.
- Introduces the concept that soils can be grouped into hydrological domains based on slope/position and aspect.

## 2. Slope characteristics
- Describes landscape evolution (glacial and periglacial processes) shaping slope forms and soil development.
- Adopts a slope-element framework (influenced by Dalrymple) to classify slopes into up to seven practical elements (hilltop, upper/lower convex, upper/lower concave, inflection, etc.).
- Boundaries between elements depend on slope angle and position; these elements help explain soil formation and hydrological behaviour.

## 3. Soil parent materials
- Identifies three principal parent materials: Head, Boulder Clay (till), and Colluvium, all derived from uniform Lower Palaeozoic slaty mudstones and mudstones.
- Explains how post-glacial exposure and microclimate (south vs north facing) drive differential weathering and soil formation.
- Highlights that, despite similar mineralogy, parent materials differ in hydraulic conductivity and porosity, leading to different soils and hydrological processes.
- Uses a field-map-based distribution (Figure 3.01) to show spatial relationships with slope position and aspect.
- Proposes the hydrological-domain concept as a way to classify areas with similar hydrological behaviour.

## 4. The soils
- Podzols: form under high rainfall and acid vegetation; characteristic layered profile with E horizon and iron pan; strong podzolisation on hilltops; zones of intense leaching and peat development nearby.
- Creep Brown Earths: on steeper slopes; non-layered with no Ea horizon or iron pan; mixture of weathered mudstone fragments in a silty-clay matrix; typically thinner on steeper slopes, often over rock.
- Peaty Gleys and Peaty Gley Podzols: found in valley bottoms with poor drainage; thick peat over Boulder Clay or Colluvium; extensive gleying indicating anaerobic conditions; significant groundwater-like storage in peat influence on hydrology.
- Notes that soils differ in thickness and structure along slope positions (hilltop to riparian zones) and that shallow subsurface features (pipes) can form within certain materials.

## 5. Relationships between slope characteristics, soil parent materials and soils
- North-facing slopes: two main parent materials (Head and Boulder Clay) driving distinct soil sequences; steepening down-slope leads from hilltop Head to Soliflucted Head to Bedded Soliflucted Head, with Podzol development present in various forms; erosion and gully formation influence soil continuity.
- South-facing slopes: dominated by Colluvium as the main parent material; soils largely shift from Podzols on hilltops and upper slopes to Creep Brown Earths downslope, with peat and Peaty Gleys near the valley floor; erosion patterns and outwash processes shape soil layers.
- Distinct hydrological domains emerge from the combination of slope position and aspect, guiding where Podzol, Creep Brown Earth, or Peat-based hydrology dominates.
- Tables (5.01, 5.02) summarize soil parent materials, soil types, and topographic criteria by slope aspect and position.

## 6. Soil water pathways
- Main pathways for water to reach streams: overland flow, subsurface lateral laminar flow, subsurface pipe flow, lateral flow at the base of the weathered rock, and fissure flow through fresh bedrock.
- South-facing slopes: simpler flow system; hilltop peat and podzol zones generate overland and pipe flows; large pipes beneath hilltop peat (up to 50 cm) drain peat basins into ephemeral channels; lower slopes show laminar and pipe flow feeding surface runoff.
- North-facing slopes: more complex with multiple antecedent pathways; various pipe systems (valley-flank and valley-head) transport water quickly from hilltops to lower slopes; bedded soliflucted head forms layered, periodically saturated flow; carbonate-like seepage and peat contribute to surface channels and rivers.
- Emphasizes the interaction of pathways where flow can switch among surface runoff, laminar flow, pipe flow, and movement through peat and weathered bedrock.
- First-order and ephemeral channels are more abundant on south-facing slopes and feed the main river system.

## 7. Groundwater
- Initially assumed catchments were watertight with no significant groundwater inputs; evidence suggests no large conventional aquifer contributing to river flow.
- Arguments include impermeable rock texture, limited groundwater storage in joints, and lack of significant aquifer pathways near faults.
- Acknowledges possible shallow regolith aquifers or fissure networks that could contribute to water quality or minor flow, potentially more likely on south-facing slopes.
- If present, such groundwater would likely be small in quantity but could influence chemistry; further study needed to quantify size and behaviour.

## 8. Some ideas on modelling the soil map
- Field mapping is subjective; soils grade into one another, boundaries are often ambiguous.
- Proposes using digitised topography and the strong link between soil types, slope position, and aspect to refine or model the soil map.
- Suggested modelling approach:
  - Divide area by aspect (north vs south) and subsequently by convex/concave slope positions using inflection points.
  - Subdivide by slope angle to define hydrological domains corresponding to hilltop/upper convex, lower convex, upper concave, and lower concave/riparian zones.
  - Calibrate with field experience and map-pit data; assess accuracy by predicting pit profiles within randomly sited pits.
  - Use the modelled soil map to define hydrologically similar domains (hydrological domains) for better physics-based hydrological modelling and water quality studies.
- Emphasises potential value and needs for further research to validate and optimise such modelling.

## Implications for GIS Specialists
- Soil types correlate strongly with slope aspect and position, enabling hydrologically meaningful mapping when combined with digital elevation models (DEMs) and aspect data.
- Concept of hydrological domains provides a practical GIS construct for compartmentalising a catchment by expected hydrological behaviour, aiding model input and validation.
- Pipe networks (soil pipes) and peat-related pathways represent crucial subsurface features that should be represented in GIS as networks or raster layers to improve flow-path modelling.
- Groundwater contributions are likely limited but should be considered in water quality analyses; groundwater indicators can be incorporated as secondary GIS layers or model parameters.
- The study highlights limitations of historical field maps and supports using GIS-enabled topographic derivatives to refine and validate soil maps and to develop more physically-based hydrological models.
