# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments

- Purpose and scope
  - An observational soil hydrology study (1968/69) to assess how soils regulate rainfall–runoff in two upland catchments (Wye and Severn) and to inform field experiments, modelling, and water balance understanding.
  - Aims to map soil types, relate them to slope/topography, and elucidate main water pathways from rain to streams.

- Data, datasets, and structure
  - Catchments and land use: one with traditional hill sheep pasture, the other Hafren Forest (coniferous forestry).
  - Topography and maps: high-resolution topographic maps (1:10,000 and 1:5,000); slope elements to relate soils to landscape position.
  - Soils and parent materials: primary soil types (Podzols, Creep Brown Earths, Peaty Gleys/Podzols); main parent materials (Head, Boulder Clay, Colluvium).
  - Field data: qualitative and interpretive soil mapping, descriptions of profiles, thicknesses, and horizons; several photos and field notes (some maps and photographs degraded over time).
  - Hydrological observations: soil-water processes, water storage in regolith/peat, and flow pathways; discussion of potential hydrological domains from slope/aspect.

- Key soil types and their hydrological associations
  - Podzols: form on hilltops/upper slopes; intense podzolisation with E horizon and iron pan; influence localized infiltration barriers and lateral downslope flow.
  - Creep Brown Earths: on steeper mid-slopes; mixed weathered rock fragments in a silty-clay matrix; variable drainage and podzolisation.
  - Peaty Gleys and Peaty Gley Podzols: valley-bottom, poorly drained zones with thick peat; aqueously reduced conditions and surface/peat-water storage.
  - Boulder Clay (glacial till): impermeable valley floors and north-facing slopes; forms peat storage and influences perched water/peat hydrology.
  - Colluvium: weathered material on south-facing slopes; forms progressive soil profiles and potential subsurface pipes.

- Slope, aspect, and soil distribution (hydrological domains)
  - North-facing slopes: two main parent materials (Head and Boulder Clay) with distinct soil progressions and deeper solifluction/depositional sequences; complex gully erosion in upper slopes.
  - South-facing slopes: mainly Colluvium with a catenary soil sequence (podzols to creep soils) and a more extensive first-order/ephemeral channel network.
  - Aspect and position drive soil development, thickness, and predominant hydrological processes; a hydrological-domain framework is proposed to capture related behaviours.

- Soil water pathways and hydrology
  - Saturated flow-dominant system, with multiple pathways:
    - Overland flow on convex upper slopes and lower concave slopes (especially after dry periods when soils become hydrophobic).
    - Subsurface lateral laminar flow at A/E horizon interfaces.
    - Subsurface pipe flow (valley-flank and valley-head systems) within colluvial and peat-rich zones.
    - Lateral flow at the base of the weathered rock zone and possible fissure flow through bedrock in places.
  - Peat and peat-rich zones as major water storages; surface peat water content largely controlled by peat structure rather than density changes.
  - South-facing slopes show a simpler flow pattern than north-facing slopes, with more pronounced pipe networks beneath peat and podzol surfaces.
  - First-order and ephemeral channels are common on south-facing slopes; gully networks on north-facing slopes can be extensive and transport water downslope rapidly.

- Groundwater and aquifer considerations
  - Initial assumption of watertight catchments with minimal groundwater contribution to river flow.
  - Indirect evidence suggests little groundwater storage in bedrock aquifers or significant subsurface transfers, though shallow regolith joints could exist and affect water quality and localized flows.
  - Acknowledges the need for further experimental work to determine the size and behavior of any hilltop regolith aquifer and its hydrological impacts.

- Modelling implications and ideas
  - Concept of hydrological domains: areas with similar slope characteristics likely share hydrological behaviour, aiding model parameterization.
  - Prospective modelling advances:
    - Use digitized topography and slope/aspect classifications to refine hydrologically relevant soils maps.
    - Validate modelled hydrological domains with field observations (random soil pits to assess map accuracy).
    - Develop domain-based hydrological models to improve hydrograph and water-quality simulations.

- Data quality, limitations, and preservation
  - Original field maps and colour photographs have degraded; some maps are indecipherable; digitization was a necessity but introduces colour/balance issues.
  - Mapping is inherently subjective; soil boundaries are difficult to delineate precisely due to gradual transitions and anomalies.
  - Emphasizes the value of digitizing and archiving data, along with metadata to document methods, scale, dates, and subjectivity.

- Data governance and stewardship considerations
  - Ensure discoverability and accessibility of diverse data: field notes, historical maps, photographs, soil profiles, and topographic data.
  - Preservation strategies: digital backups, versioning, and linkage between old maps and any new hydrological-domain maps.
  - Metadata standards: capture scale, dating, geographic coverage, soil classifications (Podzols, Peaty Gleys, etc.), slope-element definitions, aspect, and notes on mapping subjectivity.
  - Interoperability: align soil-domain concepts with modern GIS formats to enable reuse in contemporary hydrological modelling and data sharing.
  - Documentation of limitations: clearly annotate uncertainties, degraded materials, and reliance on observational interpretation to guide reuse.

- Practical takeaways for data management
  - Consider converting the hydrological-domain framework into a GIS-ready dataset linked to slope elements, aspect, and soil types.
  - Create a metadata-rich repository for all components (maps, pit notes, photos, profiles) with provenance and usage constraints.
  - Plan for ongoing validation and potential updates with modern remotely-sensed or digitized data to maintain relevance for current hydrological modelling and water-resource assessments.
