# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments

## Overview
- Observational study conducted in 1968/69 within the Plynlimon catchment experiment to understand how soils regulate the rainfall-runoff relationship.
- Two adjacent catchments represent contrasting upland land uses: traditional hill sheep pasture vs. mixed conifer forest.
- Objectives included mapping soil distributions, relating soils to topography, and elucidating the main soil-water pathways to inform hydrological modelling.
- The revised 2005 edition restores and updates the original findings, notes data limitations (e.g., deteriorated maps and photographs), and discusses potential modelling enhancements.

## Key Findings: Soil Types, Parent Materials, and Topography
- Three hydrologically distinct soil types:
  - Podzols
  - Creep Brown Earths
  - Peaty Gleys / Peaty Gley Podzols
- Each soil type is associated with specific slope positions and aspects (north-facing vs south-facing) and linked to particular soil water processes.
- Main soil parent materials driving soil development:
  - Head (hilltop head and related deposits)
  - Boulder Clay (glacial till)
  - Colluvium (slope-derived material)
- Landscape and soil relationships:
  - South-facing slopes are generally warmer, with podzolisation on Colluvium creating thinner profiles downslope, forming a Hilltop to Riparian sequence.
  - North-facing slopes feature Head-derived materials (Hilltop Head, Soliflucted Head, Bedded Soliflucted Head) and Boulder Clay, producing Podzols or Creep Brown Earths with pronounced gully development in resolvable zones.
- Concept of hydrological domains introduced:
  - Areas with the same slope characteristics (aspect, position, angle) expected to show similar hydrological behaviour.
  - Aims to enhance hydrologically meaningful mapping beyond conventional soil classification.

## Slope Characteristics and Terrain Zonation
- Slopes conceptualized using a nine-element model (in practice simplified to seven elements) to relate topography to soil formation:
  - Hilltop zone, Upper Convex, Lower Convex, Inflection, Upper Concave, Lower Concave, Riparian Zone.
- South-facing slopes (Colluvium-dominated) show a gradual, downslope progression from Podzols to Peaty Gleys, with peat storage in valley bottoms and extensive first-order/ephemeral channels.
- North-facing slopes (Head and Boulder Clay-dominated) exhibit more pronounced heterogeneity:
  - Hilltop Head and Soliflucted Head with podzolisation where stable.
  - Bedded Soliflucted Head forming layered, thin to thick sequences with annual slopewash beds.
  - Boulder Clay terraces with peat storage and hydrologically distinctive gleying and podzolisation patterns.

## Soil Water Pathways: How Rain Regulates Runoff
- Dominant theme: saturated flow processes govern water movement, contrasting with typical lowland unsaturated infiltration.
- Main pathways for water to reach streams:
  1) Overland flow on the soil surface (notably on convex upper slopes and lower concave slopes; hydrophobic topsoil after dry spells increases runoff).
  2) Subsurface laminar flow along impeding interfaces within the soil profile (A/E horizons).
  3) Subsurface pipe flow along impeding interfaces (valley-flank and valley-head pipes).
  4) Lateral flow through the base of the weathered rock zone (deeper regolith storage contributing downslope flow).
  5) Fissure flow through the fresh bedrock (uncertain but discussed as a potential rapid pathway).
- Hilltop and peat dynamics:
  - Hilltop and upper slopes often feature ponding at the E horizon beneath a shallow peaty A horizon, driving lateral flow or pipe flow downslope.
  - Large-diameter pipes (up to tens of cm) can drain peat basins into ephemeral channels, extending as peat collapses.
- South-facing vs north-facing pathways differ:
  - South-facing slopes rely more on colluvial-driven Podzols and a simpler flow network with limited deep piping in some zones.
  - North-facing slopes show complex networks of Head-derived materials, extensive pipe systems under peat and within Podzols, and substantial first-order/ephemeral channels.

## Groundwater and Hydrological Balance
- Early assumption: catchments are watertight with negligible groundwater gains or losses across boundaries.
- Evidence suggests:
  - The rocks are largely impermeable when fresh; limited evidence of significant groundwater storage.
  - Faults and deeper joints are unlikely major groundwater conduits; hillslope fissures beneath regolith could exist but their contribution to river discharge is likely small.
  - Even if minor, hillslope groundwater could influence water quality, necessitating further study on regolith aquifers and their links to river systems.

## Modelling, Mapping, and Data Implications
- Modelling potential for the soil map:
  - Move from qualitative field mapping to hydrologically informed maps by integrating topographic data with soil-hydrology relationships.
  - Define hydrological domains to improve physically-based rainfall-runoff models.
- Proposed methodology:
  - Segment the landscape by aspect (north vs south), then by slope convexity/concavity, and finally by slope angle to delineate hydrological domains.
  - Validate domain boundaries with soil pit sampling and map-pit agreement to assess accuracy.
- Challenges and considerations:
  - Soil boundaries are inherently subjective; soils grade into one another, and small-scale anomalies exist.
  - The approach seeks to quantify accuracy and reduce subjectivity, enabling more robust hydrological modelling across similar catchments.

## Conclusions and Relevance
- The soil system in Plynlimon acts as a regulator of rainfall–runoff via distinct hydrological domains shaped by slope, aspect, and soil parent materials.
- The prominence of saturated flow pathways, peat storage, and subsurface pipe networks underscores the need for hydrologically informed soil maps in modelling rainfall-runoff and water quality.
- The 2005 revision preserves the core findings while acknowledging data limitations and highlighting opportunities to advance modelling through digitised, hydrology-driven soil mapping.
