# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments Report No. 8

- A retrospective study (1968/69) of how soils regulate rainfall-runoff in the Plynlimon upland catchments (Wye grassland vs Severn conifer forest) to inform hydrological modelling and water quality understanding.
- Observational, interpretive work that laid groundwork for later field experiments and physically-based models; aims to preserve early soils knowledge and relate soil properties to hydrological processes.

## Scope and context

- Two catchments with similar topography, climate, soils and geology but different land use (grassland vs forestry) to assess water yields and hydrological responses.
- Primary objective: map soil types, relate them to slope/topography, and elucidate rainfall pathways to streams.
- Assumed water-tight catchments with impermeable bedrock to focus on soil-regolith processes; groundwater contribution considered minimal but not entirely excluded.

## Major soil types and their hydrological role

- Podzols: formation under high rainfall and acid leaching; often Podzolised Colluvium on hilltops; characterized by an A/O horizon over an E horizon, an iron pan (BFe) and a deeper horizon (Bh/Bs) with varying drainage. Hydrologically, the E horizon can impede infiltration, promoting lateral downslope flow; common on flatter hilltops and upper slopes.
- Creep Brown Earths: less structured than Podzols, on steeper slopes where creep and better drainage occur; thick B horizon and mixed weathered mudstone fragments; generally well-drained and support grasses/bracken; can shift to other soil types downslope with instability.
- Peaty Gleys and Peaty Gley Podzols: found on lower concave slopes and riparian zones with poor drainage; thick peat over Boulder Clay or Colluvium; highly saturated, many areas gleyed or reduced; major water storages in peat; pathways include surface flow across peat and subsurface flow within peat or into underlying layers.
- Soil parent materials: Head (Hilltop/Soliflucted/Bedded Soliflucted Heads), Boulder Clay (glacial till), and Colluvium; distribution strongly tied to slope position and aspect, producing hydrological domains with distinct processes.

## Slope characteristics and hydrological domains

- Slope aspect as north-facing (cooler, often more impermeable conditions) vs south-facing (warmer, more rapid erosion and different soil development).
- South-facing slopes: dominant parent material is Colluvium; Podzols and Creep Brown Earths form in a chain downslope; hilltop to riparian zones show a progression of soils with depth and thickness varying by position.
- North-facing slopes: multiple parent materials (Head, Boulder Clay) with more complex vertical/horizontal zoning; pronounced differences along hilltop, convex, concave, and riparian zones.
- A concept of hydrological domains proposed: areas with the same slope characteristics would share similar hydrological behaviour, enabling more physics-based modelling and domain-specific outputs.

## Soil water pathways and hydrological processes

- Dominance of saturated flow processes due to impeding layers within the soil profile and at the base of the regolith; a variety of pathways feed the stream:
  - Overland flow on convex upper slopes (thatch effect on grasses; hydrophobic topsoil after dry periods).
  - Overland flow on lower concave slopes fed by upslope storage or subsurface processes.
  - Subsurface lateral (laminar) flow along A/E horizons over impeded layers.
  - Subsurface pipe flow through impeding horizons (valley-flank pipes and valley-head pipes); pipes can be large, draining hilltop peat and feeding ephemeral/first-order channels.
  - Lateral flow through the base of the weathered rock zone (deep weathered bedrock storage suspected).
  - Fissure flow through fresh bedrock (unclear significance; possible but not proven as major pathway).
- South-facing slopes show a simpler system, with defined pipe networks beneath peat and in A/E horizons; north-facing slopes exhibit more complex flow via Soliflucted Head, Bedded Soliflucted Head, and Boulder Clay interactions.
- Peat and peaty soils constitute major water storage; peat moisture content is extremely high and changes are largely due to peat swelling/shrinking rather than bulk water content change.

## Groundwater and aquifer considerations

- Initial assumption of no significant groundwater aquifers contributing to river flow; supported by:
  - Impermeable bedrock and low rock porosity.
  - Limited evidence of persistent groundwater flow from faults or joints in the region.
- Indirect indications exist for shallow regolith aquifers and potential hilltop storage that could influence water quality and to a lesser extent quantity; further data needed to quantify size and role.

## Modelling implications and data opportunities

- The study emphasizes the need to incorporate soil hydrological processes into models to relate rainfall to hydrographs and water quality.
- Hydrological domains offer a data-driven way to partition landscapes for modelling, reducing subjectivity in soil mapping by linking soils to measurable topographic features.
- Potential data products:
  - Hydrologically informed soil maps or hydrological domains derived from topography (aspect, slope angle, inflection points).
  - Process-based pathways linking soil types to dominant flow mechanisms (e.g., pipe vs laminar flow vs overland flow).
  - Groundwater contribution assessments and their impacts on water chemistry, with clear caveats about uncertainties.
- Modelling considerations:
  - Use digitised topographic data to refine soil maps and reduce field-mapping subjectivity.
  - Validate model outputs with pit-based soil profile predictions and randomly sited pits to assess accuracy.
  - Distinguish hydrological responses by slope position and aspect to improve hydrograph predictions and water-quality interpretation.

## Endnotes and future directions

- Acknowledges the limitations of early field mapping (subjectivity, interpolation between exposures) and the potential of modelling to improve hydrological domain delineation.
- Highlights the ongoing value of process-based understanding from soils research for future catchment hydrology and water quality studies.
- Suggests further work to quantify hilltop regolith aquifers, test their influence on river flows and water quality, and refine hydrological domain definitions with updated data and modelling techniques.
