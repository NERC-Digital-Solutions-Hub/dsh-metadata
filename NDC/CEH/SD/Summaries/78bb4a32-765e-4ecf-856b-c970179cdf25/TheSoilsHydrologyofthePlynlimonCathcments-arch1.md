# The Soil Hydrology of the Plynlimon Catchments

- An extensively revised synthesis of the original 1968/69 soil hydrology study at the Plynlimon catchments, intended to prevent loss of early hydrological data and inform current modelling work.
- Key aim: understand how soils regulate rainfall-to-runoff relationships and identify hydrological processes active in different soil types and topographic positions.
- Two adjacent catchments were chosen to represent upland Wales land uses (conifer forestry vs. sheep grazing) and to create a watertight water balance for studying soil-water pathways and modelling needs.
- Main legacy: concept of hydrological domains—areas with the same slope characteristics expected to exhibit similar hydrological behaviour, with potential for improved physically-based modelling.

1. Introduction and approach
- The soils study was observational and qualitative, serving as a precursor to field experiments and modelling.
- Focused on three soil types linked to topography and aspect, and on how rainwater moves from the surface to streams.
- Found that slope aspect (north vs south) and slope position (hilltop, upper/mid/lower slope, riparian) strongly influence soil formation and hydrological processes.
- Emphasised the potential of combining digitised topography with hydrologically defined soil areas to improve soil maps and hydrological modelling.

2. Slope characteristics
- Landscape shaped by Late Pleistocene glacial processes; current soils reflect post-glacial weathering and periglacial conditions.
- Slopes divided into seven hydrologically relevant elements (excluding riverbank and riverbed): hilltop, upper convex, lower convex, upper concave, lower concave, and riparian zones.
- Dalrymple-type framework adapted to local slopes, with slope-element boundaries tuned to best match field observations.
- Slope aspect (north-facing vs south-facing) strongly governs soil development and hydrological pathways.

3. Soil parent materials
- Principal parent materials derived from Lower Palaeozoic slaty mudstones and massive mudstones: Head, Boulder Clay (till), and Colluvium.
- Head variants (Hilltop Head, Soliflucted Head, Bedded Soliflucted Head) reflect periglacial and post-glacial processes.
- Boulder Clay is impermeable, forms valley floors and north-facing terraces, and hosts thick peat stores.
- Colluvium forms on warmer, south-facing slopes; more conductive, enabling different drainage and podzolisation patterns.
- Despite shared mineralogy, these materials differ in hydraulic conductivity and porosity, driving distinct soil formation and hydrological behaviours.

4. The soils
- Podzols: formed under high rainfall and acidic conditions; well developed on higher, flatter hilltop to upper slopes; notable E horizon with eluviation and an iron pan (BFe) beneath; podzolisation can drive lateral downslope water movement.
- Creep Brown Earths: occur on steeper slopes; lack a strong E horizon and iron pan; matrix of weathered mudstone fragments in silty-clay weathering products; commonly overlain by a thin Ahorizon; drainage is better than Podzols, influencing hydrological responses.
- Peaty Gleys and Peaty Gley Podzols: valley bottoms and riparian zones with thick peat overlays; very poor drainage, gleying and reducing conditions; significant water storage and nuanced hydrological responses.
- Typical soil sequences reflect topographic position: hilltop to upper slopes dominated by Podzols; mid-slopes show transitions to Creep Brown Earths; lower slopes and riparian zones transition to Peat-dominated and gleyed soils.
- Spatial distribution is strongly controlled by slope position and aspect, creating a regional pattern of hydrological domains.

5. Relationships between slope characteristics, soil parent materials and soils
- North-facing slopes: a mix of Head-derived soils and Boulder Clay; Podzolisation is intense on hilltop Head, solifluction-related heads, and bedded solifluction heads downslope; lower slopes show progression to Creep Brown Earth or to podzolised Boulder Clay with peat in the valley bottom.
- South-facing slopes: Colluvium-dominated, with Podzol on upper/tend to mid-slopes and Creep Brown Earth on steeper areas; valley bottoms often host Peat and Peaty Gleys with extensive peat storage.
- Distinct hydrological domains emerge from the combination of slope position and aspect, linking soil type distributions to water storage, infiltration, and flow pathways.
- Boulder Clay terraces commonly host peat and gleyed conditions; their impermeability shapes subsurface and surface-water dynamics differently from south-facing Colluvium soils.

6. Soil water pathways
- Main aim: identify rainwater pathways from rainfall to streams to inform hydrological modelling.
- Dominant feature: saturated flow processes in this high-rainfall, hard-rock landscape; multiple flow pathways operate, depending on soil, rainfall intensity, and slope position.
- Pathways include:
  - Overland flow on soil surfaces (notably on convex upper slopes and lower concave slopes during intense rainfall).
  - Subsurface laminar flow along impeding horizons within the soil profile (A/E interfaces).
  - Subsurface pipe flow on impeding interfaces (valley-flank pipes in Podzol zones and valley-head pipes in peat-rich areas).
  - Lateral flow through the base of the weathered rock zone (possible perched aquifer interactions).
  - Fissure flow through fresh unweathered bedrock (unclear significance but possible in some areas).
- Hilltop and upper convex slopes on both aspects often generate ponding at E horizons or clay pans, feeding lateral or pipe flows downslope.
- On south-facing slopes, extensive pipe networks develop under peat and along E horizon clays; on north-facing slopes, deeper solifluction-derived Head materials influence gully formation and later hydrological pathways.
- Valley bottom peat stores dominate water storage, with peat water content highly dependent on volume rather than density changes.

7. Groundwater
- Catchments initially presumed watertight with no significant groundwater exchanges; evidence suggests limited groundwater aquifers of meaningful size, though not entirely ruled out.
- Arguments against substantial regolith aquifer storage include impermeable bedrock, few significant joints/fissures delivering groundwater, and lack of observed groundwater emergence in nearby tunnels.
- Possible hillslope regolith aquifers and fissure networks could exist locally (especially on south-facing slopes) and may influence water quality more than quantity.
- Further experimental work is needed to quantify any hilltop aquifer and its relation to river flow and water quality.

8. Some ideas on modelling the soil map
- The original soil map is subjective; modern digitised topography enables objective, hydrologically meaningful mapping.
- Proposed modelling approach:
  - Separate the area by aspect into north- and south-facing zones.
  - Subdivide by convex/concave slope inflection to represent slope position.
  - Further subdivide by slope angle to define hydrological domains (examples given for hilltop, upper/lower convex, upper/lower concave, riparian zones).
- Validation concept: score the model by predicting actual soil pits (profiles) and compare predicted vs. observed profiles; acknowledge subjectivity in pit-map agreement.
- Goal: produce hydrologically meaningful soils maps that define hydrological domains, enabling better domain-based modelling of hydrographs and water chemistry.
- Significance: lays groundwork for applying hydrological-physics-based models and for broader research into catchment hydrology and land-use impacts.
