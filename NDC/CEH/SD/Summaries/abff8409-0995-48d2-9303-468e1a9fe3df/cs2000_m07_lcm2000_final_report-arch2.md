# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents how Broad Habitats map onto LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, and Variants, with Suclasses color-coded for map displays.
  - Part of a larger effort to align land-cover data (LCM2000) with field survey classifications (CS2000) and to enable consistent environmental monitoring over time.

- Data sources and structure
  - LCM2000: Land Cover Map 2000, using 25 m grid statistics for cover by broad habitat types.
  - FS: Field survey data (Haines-Young et al. 2000) used for comparison and validation.
  - CS2000: Field survey classifications used for crosswalk analyses with LCM2000.
  - Tables link LCM2000 Target Classes, Subclasses, Variants to corresponding habitat labels (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Montane habitats, etc.).

- Tables and what they show (overview)
  - Table 5: Coverage (km2) of Subclasses from LCM2000 and of Aggregate classes from LCM2000 and Field Survey (FS) across the UK and constituent countries.
    - Provides detailed area estimates by broad habitats and by target class/subclass/variant combinations.
    - Includes separate tallies for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and UK totals.
    - Indicates FS values where available; notes systematic differences between LCM2000 and FS, with explanations in text.
    - Highlights coastal coverage variability due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion of offshore inter-tidal areas.
  - Table 6: LCM2000 cover (km2) for Broad Habitats (BHs) in England, Wales, Scotland, NI, and GB, compared with Field Survey (FS) estimates at 95% confidence (i.e., +/- 2 standard errors).
    - Presents uncalibrated LCM2000 values alongside lower/upper FS confidence ranges.
    - Stratified by major habitat types (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed and yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane, Inland rock, Built up areas, Supralittoral/Littoral categories, etc.).
  - Tables 8–10: Summary correspondence matrices comparing LCM2000 with CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain and in England & Wales.
    - Results expressed per 1000 (and per 1000s) for Broad Habitats, Target Class, and Aggregate class levels.
    - Use stratification based on 40 Land Classes; bootstrapped to calculate confidence intervals.
    - Show how often a CS2000 class corresponds to an LCM2000 class, highlighting calibration/fit between datasets.
    - Include cross-classifications for boundary/linear features, arable/horticulture, improved grassland, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Rivers/streams, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas, Supralittoral rock, Supralittoral sediment, Littoral rock, Littoral sediment, and Oceanic seas.
  - Table 9: England and Wales crosswalk (similar structure to Table 8) with correspondences weighted by field survey generalisation.
  - Table 10: Scotland crosswalk (structure mirroring Tables 8–9) showing crosswalks for Scotland-specific comparisons.

- Data quality, calibration, and interpretation
  - LCM2000 statistics are based on a full count of cover using a 25 m grid; FS statistics come from field surveys.
  - Differences between LCM2000 and FS are acknowledged and explained in the text; results are presented with confidence intervals to reflect uncertainty (95% in Tables 6, 8–10).
  - Coastal coverage varies due to tidal states and inclusion/exclusion criteria for offshore areas, affecting total totals and proportions.
  - Calibration status: Tables 6–10 illustrate how well LCM2000 aligns with CS2000 field classifications across regions; some habitat classes show good correspondence, others reveal discrepancies requiring careful interpretation.

- Implications for environmental monitoring and the analyst role
  - Demonstrates how standardized data (LCM2000) can be linked to field-validated classifications (CS2000) to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Highlights the importance of crosswalks and calibration between datasets to ensure outputs are comparable and decision-relevant.
  - Supports consistent outputs in reports, maps, and charts; emphasizes the need to store and share the underlying datasets via appropriate data portals.
  - Underlines challenges in maximizing data value by integrating LCM2000 with FS/CS2000 data and enabling broad access to underlying data for downstream users.

- Particular challenges highlighted
  - Increasing the value of datasets by combining them with other relevant data (avoiding single-use applications).
  - Enabling access to the underlying data used to create final outputs (transparency and reuse).

- Takeaways for practice
  - Use the LCM2000–CS2000 crosswalks to interpret habitat changes over time and to assess consistency between remote-sensed land cover and ground-truth classifications.
  - Consider coastal variability and calibration limitations when interpreting totals and habitat proportions.
  - Leverage standardized outputs (tables, maps, charts) to communicate environmental health and policy performance, while providing access to underlying data for scrutiny and reuse.
