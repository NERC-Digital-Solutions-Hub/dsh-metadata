# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours).

- Provides a mapping schema between LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants for broad habitat categories across UK regions (England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, GB).
- Lists numerous habitat types (e.g., inshore sublittoral, standing water, littoral/ supra-littoral habitats, woodlands, arable land, improved grassland, moorland, urban/semi-urban, coastal/bog/montane types) and their corresponding LCM2000 classifications.
- Includes target class groupings (e.g., Sea/Estuary, Water inland, Littoral rock/sediment, Supralittoral rock/sediment, Inland bare ground, Built-up areas, etc.) and associates them with specific subclasses and variants (e.g., rock, mud, algae, dune, saltmarsh, urban, etc.).
- Illustrates cross-walks that support translation between broad habitat concepts and LCM2000’s structured taxonomy for reporting, analysis, and map displays.

# Table 5. The coverage (km2) of Subclasses from Land Cover Map 2000 (LCM2000) and of Aggregate classes (bold) from LCM2000 and field survey (FS) in the UK and constituent countries.

- Presents comprehensive area coverage by Subclasses across the UK (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and combined UK, using LCM2000 and FS (field survey) estimates.
- Breaks down major land-cover groups (e.g., Broad-leaved/mixed woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable cereals, Arable horticulture, Non-rotational horticulture, Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing open water, Urban/built-up areas, Suburban/rural developed, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, etc.).
- Provides regional totals and UK totals (e.g., UK totals for broad classes like Arable & Horticultural, Improved grassland, Neutral grassland, Calcareous grassland, Acid grassland, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, Urban areas, and more).
- Indicates FS vs LCM2000 differences as part of the dataset comparison, with notes on coastal coverage variability and definitions of FS population (1 km squares).
- Includes footnotes clarifying that LCM2000 uses a full 25 m grid count, FS statistics come from Haines-Young et al. 2000, and other methodological caveats (e.g., coastal/offshore area treatment, not available data, and how totals are defined).

# Table 6. LCM2000 cover (km2) for BHs (uncalibrated) for England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and GB, compared with field survey estimates at 95% confidence (i.e. +/- 2 standard errors).

- Provides side-by-side comparison of LCM2000 cover versus field survey (FS) estimates for key broad habitats across the UK and its countries.
- For each habitat group (e.g., Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable and horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Standing water, Montane habitats, Inland rock, Built up areas and gardens, Supralittoral/Littoral categories, Oceanic, etc.), lists:
  - LCM2000 values
  - FS low and FS high estimates (where available)
  - UK-wide totals for each habitat class
- Highlights ranges to reflect confidence intervals around FS estimates, revealing where LCM2000 aligns or diverges from field observations.
- Notes that the data are uncalibrated for BH level and include country-level breakdowns (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and GB/UK aggregates.
- Emphasizes bootstrapped confidence interval approach used in CS2000/FS comparisons.

# Table 8. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in Great Britain: results are weighted estimates, using strata based on 40 Land Classes, bootstrapped to calculate confidence intervals (see text).

- Presents a per-1000 correspondence assessment between CS2000 (field survey) and LCM2000 classifications across broad habitats.
- Shows correspondence at multiple aggregation levels: Broad Habitats, Target Class, and Aggregate Class, with regional framing (GB England, Wales, Scotland, NI, etc.).
- Indicates general alignment patterns (e.g., cross-walks between Broadleaved/mixed/yew woodland, Coniferous woodland, Arable & Horticulture, Improved grassland, Neutral/Calcareous/Acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Urban categories, Supralittoral/Littoral categories, Oceanic, etc.).
- Includes per-habitat-level matches and gaps, with confidence intervals derived from bootstrapping.
- Notes that some cells lack data and that results are presented as weighted estimates per 1000.

# Table 9. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in England and Wales.

- Similar to Table 8 but restricted to England and Wales.
- Provides per-1000 correspondences between CS2000 and LCM2000 for key habitat classes, using bootstrapped confidence intervals.
- Highlights alignment and misalignment patterns within England and Wales, and how they compare to GB-wide results.

# Table 10. Summary correspondence matrix (results expressed per 1000) from comparing LCM2000 with the CS2000 field survey squares in Scotland.

- Mirrors Tables 8 and 9 but focused on Scotland.
- Documents the correspondences between CS2000 field survey data and LCM2000 classifications for Scottish habitats, with bootstrapped confidence intervals.
- Indicates habitat-level alignment, potential discrepancies, and region-specific trends in mapping accuracy.

# Footnotes (common across tables)

- Clarify methodology: LCM2000 statistics based on a full count of cover on a 25 m grid; FS statistics from Haines-Young et al. 2000; some data marked as not available (n/a).
- Explain differences between LCM2000 and FS statistics and the coastal coverage variability due to tidal states and offshore areas.
- Note the definition of FS population (1 km squares) and how totals may differ by country and region.
- Indicate that Tables 8–10 use bootstrapping and weighting by land-class strata to derive confidence intervals for correspondences.
- Provide context on cross-walking between LCM2000 and CS2000, including considerations for urban/generalisation of urban areas and classification nuances.

Summary and implications for data leaders

- Purpose: Document LCM2000 classifications, their correspondence with field survey data (CS2000), and region-specific coverages across the UK.
- Data assets and governance:
  - Demonstrates the importance of cross-walks between classification systems (LCM2000, CS2000) to enable consistent data use, reporting, and interoperability.
  - Highlights the need for detailed metadata on resolution (25 m), methodologies (full grid counts, bootstrapping), and the treatment of coastal/offshore areas.
  - Shows the value of confidence intervals and statistical framing (e.g., per-1000 correspondences, 95% CIs) to communicate uncertainty in map-to-field mappings.
- Data quality and gaps:
  - Reveals areas where LCM2000 and FS diverge, underscoring the necessity for ongoing validation with field data and transparent documentation of differences.
  - Emphasizes the complexity of aligning habitat classifications across countries and regional datasets (England, Wales, Scotland, NI) and the need for harmonised standards.
- Actionable steps for data leaders:
  - Maintain robust crosswalks between classification schemes and ensure they are versioned and well-documented.
  - Provide accessible metadata describing resolution, methodology, and uncertainties for all habitat classes.
  - Establish processes to continuously validate remote-sensing classifications against field surveys, with explicit handling of coastal and urban generalisation issues.
  - Develop governance for data sharing across sectors and regions to support consistent use, updates, and integration into broader data ecosystems.
