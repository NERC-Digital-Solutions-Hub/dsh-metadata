# Table 1. Broad Habitats and their relation to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses and Variants (the Suclasses are shown in their map display colours)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes how Broad Habitats (BHs) relate to LCM2000 Target classes, Subclasses, and Variants (and their map display colours for Suclasses).
  - Provides mapping across multiple habitat categories (e.g., inshore sublittoral, standing water, littoral/ supra-littoral zones, woodlands, arable systems, grasslands, wetlands, urban/built environments, etc.) to the LCM2000 taxonomy.
- Structure and examples of mappings
  - Each BH is aligned to a specific LCM Target class and to corresponding Subclasses and Variants.
  - Examples include:
    - Inshore sublittoral: LCM Target class = Sea/Estuary; Subclasses = Sea/Estuary; Variants = sea.
    - Standing water/canals: LCM Target class = Water (inland); Subclasses = Water (inland); Variants = water (inland).
    - Littoral rock and sediment, Supra-littoral rock/sediment, and related coastal BHs with their respective target classes, subclasses, and variants.
    - Terrestrial habitats (broad-leaved woodlands, coniferous woodlands, arable/horticultural lands, improved grasslands, neutral/calcareous/acid grasslands, Bracken, Dwarf shrub heath, Fen/marsh/swamp, Bog, Montane, Inland bare ground, Mountain habitats, Built-up areas and gardens, urban/suburban categories, etc.) with their BH-to-LCM mappings.
- Implication for monitoring frameworks
  - Establishes the vocabulary and cross-walk needed for monitoring frameworks to translate habitat observations into the LCM2000 monitoring schema.
  - Highlights the complexity of comparing field data with map-based classifications across diverse habitat types and coastal vs. inland contexts.
