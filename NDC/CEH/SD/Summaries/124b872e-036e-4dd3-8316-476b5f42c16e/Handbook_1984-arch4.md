# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Defines guidelines for field data collection across Great Britain for a structured ecological survey (Land Classes via 1 km squares, with 1x1 sq sampling).
  - Builds a quality baseline for differences in habitats and land use through ground surveys and aerial photography (ITE 899).
  - Aims for consistent, repeatable data items across squares, compatible with previous surveys, while allowing room for practical adaptations.
  - Data items are selected to meet landscape objectives and support both practical recording and future analytical use.

- Planning and team organization
  - 1976–78 framework used Land Classes; 384 squares (12 per class, 32 classes) selected for comprehensive GB coverage.
  - Teams from six ITE research stations coordinate surveys; liaison teams from Merlewood assist roving surveys.
  - Each square is allocated to survey teams, with planned daily travel efficiency in mind to avoid double visits.
  - Scheduling considers travel patterns: single-square daily travel, short overnight stays for multiple squares, or longer block itineraries.

- Equipment and logistics
  - Minimal field equipment focused on mapping and recording rather than measurement.
  - Key items: FAB data recording books, 1:10,000 maps, film, color pens, maps for site locations, navigation gear, ITE identity card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, camera.

- Field procedures and permissions
  - On-site workflow: quick area scan, determine access permissions, plan a route to cover the square, then post-survey checks for omissions.
  - Securing permissions is essential to access all parts of the square and maintain goodwill with landowners; prior contact may be used but can cause delays.
  - Identity and ownership information are recorded; contact with farmers is encouraged to gather background data.

- Data recording and coding framework
  - Data are recorded by annotating 6" (1:10,000) maps with predefined data codes to enable machine- or human-readable aggregation.
  - Field decisions should be made in the field; if complexity arises, codes may be combined, or color-coding used to manage detail without clutter.
  - Boundaries must be clearly indicated on maps; minimum mappable unit is 0.5 hectares in length and 0.2 km, with edge corners fully surveyed.
  - Data recording forms (FABs) consolidate per-square data, including series numbers, ownership, and categorical coding.

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) structure and guidance
  - FAB pages organize ownership, farmer information, physiography/inland water/coastal features, land cover, woodland, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, and photography data.
  - Ownership and landowner responsiveness are coded to indicate level of cooperation and willingness to assist future surveys.
  - Farmer information sheets prompt conversation to capture qualitative context (owner history, land use narratives) without overbearing documentation.
  - Specific guidance on map annotations, mosaic recording, and combining multiple minor units into a representative larger unit when appropriate.

- Thematic data sections and coding guidance
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: codes for cliff types, rock outcrops, peat, soils, erosional features, inland water bodies, watercourse types, ditches, and coastal features.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: comprehensive cover-type categories (pasture, grassland, heath, moor, wetlands, crops, and fallow land), with subcodes for species, livestock, crop status, and agronomic uses.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: woodland units, tree and shrub categories, age classes, proportions, regeneration, plantations, and structure (coppice, belts, hedges).
  - Boundaries: detailed boundary-type coding (walls, fences, hedges, stockproofed boundaries) and descriptive notes to capture boundary management and changes.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreation designations within land parcels.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, usage codes, descriptions, and road/track/footpath categorizations; color conventions recommended to aid visual coding.
  - Photography: five standardized photographs per square with explicit location and direction notes to accompany map data.

- Data quality, standards, and usability
  - Emphasis on consistent coding to support cross-square comparability and longitudinal analyses.
  - Encourages documenting uncertainties, qualifiers, and recent changes to enhance data interpretability.
  - Encourages collaboration and data sharing within the field network to improve system-wide data quality and coverage.

- Post-survey procedures and data handling
  - Review of completed FABs and maps to ensure no features are omitted; avoid transposing data to new maps unless necessary.
  - Batch submission protocol: notify Merlewood when a batch is complete and arrange prompt transfer of FABs and associated maps.
  - The approach favors working with original maps and records to preserve data fidelity and traceability.

- Relevance for data leadership and governance
  - Provides a comprehensive, codified data collection framework suitable for scalable data strategy and governance in environmental surveys.
  - Highlights the importance of metadata, standardized coding, structured data capture, and cross-team collaboration to support an effective data ecosystem.
  - Demonstrates careful planning for data discoverability, quality control, and long-term usability across networks and partner organizations.
