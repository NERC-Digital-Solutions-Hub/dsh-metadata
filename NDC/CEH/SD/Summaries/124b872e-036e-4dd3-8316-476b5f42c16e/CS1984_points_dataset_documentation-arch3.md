  - Ownership and copyright: Countryside Survey data owned by NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; Countryside Survey ©; Database Right/Copyright reserved.
  - Acknowledgement requirements: All uses of Countryside Survey data must include the specified acknowledgement text.
  - Data quality considerations:
    - Metadata may be incomplete, presenting challenges for assessment of data suitability.
    - Some data may require transformation or additional context to be usable.
  - Data governance and sharing:
    - The need to publicly share underlying data can be a barrier for some datasets.
    - Data quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, and clear presentation are important for policy-relevant outputs.

- Use in monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a structured, spatially explicit baseline of landscape features and species attributes at 1km resolution from 1984.
  - Enables measures related to land classification, habitat attributes, species presence/cover, land use, and age structure for environmental health assessments.
  - Can inform trend analysis when comparable data from other years exist, and support reporting through reports, charts, or dashboards.
