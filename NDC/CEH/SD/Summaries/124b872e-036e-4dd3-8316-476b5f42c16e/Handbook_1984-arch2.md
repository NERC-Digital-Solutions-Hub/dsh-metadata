# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and context
  - A field method for a nationwide survey (Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain) to establish a quality baseline for land cover, land use, and habitat change across Great Britain.
  - Builds on past land-class sampling (1 km grid, then 1 x 1 squares) to compare ground survey with aerial photography and to monitor changes over time.
  - Aims to create standardized, auditable data outputs (maps, charts, reports) with consistent data quality and storage.

- Sampling design and scope
  - 384 squares (12 per each of 32 land classes) across GB to be surveyed in 1984.
  - Squares are chosen to cover land cover, land use, and habitat features; exceptions occur where original squares are inaccessible.
  - Each square mapped at 1:10,000 scale with standardized data items to support cross-survey comparability and statistical confidence.

- Planning and field logistics
  - Teams from six ITE research stations, with liaison coverage from Merlewood; roughly 56 squares per team.
  - Planning options to minimize travel (prefer single-visit per square, avoid revisiting squares) and to optimize scheduling (various travel/overnight patterns).
  - Emphasis on efficient travel logistics due to cost constraints; plan may include daily travel, overnight stays, or multi-square groupings.

- Equipment and data tools
  - Minimal field equipment: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 6" maps, film, pens, navigation tools, ITE ID card, camera, weather gear, and manuals.
  - Data capture relies on structured coding on maps and FAB pages to enable rapid transcription and later processing.

- Field procedures and data capture
  - On-site tasks include assessing access, obtaining permissions, selecting a route for full square coverage, and ensuring complete data capture before leaving.
  - Permissions are critical to avoid wasted work; prior contact with landowners/farmers is encouraged, with identity and project explanation provided.
  - Field decisions should be made in the field; post-survey reviews happen to check for omissions but data should ideally remain on the original maps.

- Permissions and stakeholder interaction
  - Multiple access reasons: legal access, goodwill of landowners, and potential background information.
  - Prior contact can reduce delays; surveyors carry identity and a farmer/landowner information sheet to guide conversations.

- Data recording system (FAB and coding)
  - Survey data are annotated on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a structured set of numeric and alphanumeric codes; some fields support combinations of codes to represent complex features.
  - Boundaries are mapped and coded; units have a minimum mappable size and are linked to specific codes; the smallest unit is a defined mapable area.
  - The FAB collects all square-specific data, including series number, ownership, farmer information, physiography, land cover, vegetation, boundaries, recreation, buildings, and photographs.
  - Field codings are designed to be machine-processable later; codes are organized to allow building mosaics and to capture changes (e.g., recent changes or likely changes).

- Field assessment book (FAB) structure
  - Covers include ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography/inland water/coastal features, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography, and post-survey procedures.
  - Each page supports specific coding and descriptive fields; color-coding and descriptive notes are used to manage complexity where necessary.
  - Instructions emphasize consistency (e.g., how to document mosaic vegetation, how to indicate proportions, how to denote recent changes).

- Key data categories and coding themes
  - Ownership and landowner cooperation
  - Physiography: cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion indicators, land leveling, springs, ditches, rivers, lakes, and coastal features
  - Agriculture/Natural vegetation: cover types (amendable to crops), grassland types, moorland, heaths, aquatic vegetation, and detailed species notes
  - Forestry/Woodland/trees: cover types, tree/stand classifications (scattered, coppice, hedge trees, belts), age classes, regeneration, and management status
  - Boundaries: walling, hedges, fences, gaps, and stockproof status
  - Recreation: formal/informal recreational use and facilities
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, land-use-related structures, roads/tracks/footpaths, pipelines, signage, and colors for coding
  - Photography: guidelines for taking five slides per square to capture representative views and surrounding context

- Data quality, consistency, and compatibility
  - Emphasis on using established categories and stable definitions to ensure comparability with prior surveys and other inventories.
  - Field decisions are prioritized; if unclear, notes or qualifiers should accompany codes rather than deferring decisions to processing.
  - Instructions for data storage and submission to Merlewood, with prompt reporting of completed FABs and batches.

- Outputs and analytic relevance
  - Outputs include maps, charts, and reports that describe environmental health, habitat composition, and land-use changes over time.
  - Data standards support spatial analyses, temporal comparisons, and integration with other data sources to increase dataset value beyond single-use applications.

- Post-survey procedures and data management
  - After surveying, recommended to review sheets for omissions but avoid unnecessary transposition onto new maps unless absolutely needed.
  - Batch data are communicated to Merlewood for processing and archival; timely transport of FABs is encouraged.

- Alignment with Analytic aims
  - Provides standardized, audit-ready data suitable for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Encourages data interoperability and accessibility to enable other researchers and organizations to reuse the underlying data (addressing the challenges of data value and data access).
