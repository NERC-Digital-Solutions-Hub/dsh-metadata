# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Objective: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity; applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Location confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future surveys to maintain scientific integrity, environmental protection, and landowner permission.
- Public interest considered; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Approximate release: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid) under licence for users to determine if squares fall within predetermined areas.
- Precise release: six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, locations may be released externally under licence if the requester demonstrates legal guarantees of equal or higher confidentiality for linked data.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality and may be released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific release conditions and use
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and restricted to named individuals with legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational duties.
- At licence end, organizations must confirm destruction of location data.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; users should not try to deduce precise square locations.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms with lower IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; six-digit releases carry stricter confidentiality constraints.

## Licences, governance, and oversight
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences reflecting policy terms.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorized representative from the licensee organization.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under FOI/EIR procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are considered case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use data under this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or via coordination of appropriate scientific leads, with arrangements negotiable by case.
