# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data remain publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling strategy and future permission to survey land.
- Aims to safeguard the capacity to inform environmental policy in the future.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Access can indicate whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (country, county, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each square.
- Six-digit (precise) locations: only via pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; exceptionally, externally released under licence if justified by IP confidentiality equal/higher than CS data and CEH cannot process alongside CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) can indirectly identify square locations and is subject to the same exceptional-circumstances policy as six-digit data.

## Conditions of release
- Licencees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other purposes.
- End-of-licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and have been destroyed.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to assess landowner compliance within squares.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equal to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- Licences to release four-digit data forbid attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Licensing, governance and responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; decisions signed by a senior authorised signatory.
- If an approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH will support internal pre-processing analyses within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be direct or via defined requirements, with arrangements negotiated case-by-case.
