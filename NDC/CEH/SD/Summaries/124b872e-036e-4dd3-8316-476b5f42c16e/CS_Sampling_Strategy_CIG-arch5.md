# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Purpose and Scope
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- The framework is built on the ITE Land Classification, developed over 30 years to stratify Great Britain's land into meaningful ecological classes.
- Aims to support robust national and subnational habitat and land-use estimates and to enable detection of change over time.

## Key Concepts
- Stratified random sampling to capture variability across land types and reduce bias.
- ITE Land Classification: starting with 32 classes (1978), later expanded to about 40–45 classes with country-unit subdivisions (e.g., Wales-specific sub-classes) to support country-level reporting.
- Sampling units: 1 km squares; initial classification used center squares, with surrounding squares classified to expand context.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) used to describe and group land classes.
- National estimates are derived by combining per-square habitat areas with the land-class area proportions.

## Evolution Timeline and Land Classification
- 1978 (First GB survey): 32 Land Classes; 8 squares sampled per class (256 total); classification based on 1 km squares and ISA-derived groupings.
- 1984 (Second GB survey): 12 squares per class (384 total); sampling framed by the 1978 classification; results published later.
- 1990 (All Squares / CS1990): Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed; integration with Land Cover Map; national estimates recalculated using the updated classification.
- 1998–2000 (CS2000): Land Classification expanded to enable Scotland reporting; separate country estimates introduced; 40 strata; additional squares added to correct representation; development of country-unit subdivisions (England with Wales, Scotland); upland habitat considerations discussed.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further sub-division into country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata; additional Welsh squares to ensure six squares per Welsh class; adjustments to England due to Welsh additions; introduction of a Welsh upland sampling emphasis; uplands module incorporated to improve upland habitat estimates.

## Sampling Design Details
- Core unit: 1 km square; stratified random sampling within Land Classes to ensure coverage of both common and rare classes.
- Sample allocations evolved: 8 squares per class (1978) → 12 per class (1984) → expanded to 30–59 per class in later phases depending on country and class representation.
- National estimates are calculated as: mean habitat area per square in each Land Class × area of that class; with separate approaches for GB-wide and country-unit reporting.
- Key tables and figures (referenced in the document) document class descriptions, sampling distributions, and changes across surveys.

## Subnational Reporting and Wales/England/Scotland Adjustments
- CS1990 onward: recognition that country-specific estimates were needed; adjustments made to enable reporting for England with Wales and Scotland separately.
- Wales-specific enhancements for CS2007 include five new Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and a larger Wales sampling base to improve precision.
- England adjustments accompany Welsh additions; some English classes end up with fewer samples but are judged to retain adequate precision per scoping studies.
- Scotland reporting remained a consideration, with separate country estimates reflecting its distinct data needs.

## Upland Module
- Introduced in CS2000 as an additional sampling module to improve statistical accuracy for upland and marginal upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Involves targeted surveying of additional squares within relevant Land Classes.

## Data Governance, Provenance, and Consistency
- Changing Land Class definitions directly affect the comparability of national estimates over time.
- Two approaches to reporting: use the latest Land Classification for internal consistency within a survey, or map estimates to the original 1990 classification for cross-survey comparability.
- Documentation emphasizes the importance of recording the classification version used for each estimate and the explicit country-unit framework applied (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales-only, etc.).

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- Metadata should capture Land Classification version, country-unit framework, and any upland module inclusion to ensure reproducibility and proper interpretation of trends.
- Maintain clear mappings between old and new Land Classes, including the Welsh and English country-unit subdivisions.
- Ensure datasets support subnational reporting (England with Wales, Scotland, Wales-only) and document sampling design, class distributions, and sampling rates.
- Plan for data interoperability across time-series datasets where classifications have evolved; accompany data with comprehensive methodological notes and references.
