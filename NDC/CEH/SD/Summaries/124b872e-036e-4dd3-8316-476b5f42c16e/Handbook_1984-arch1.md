# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Aims and scope
  - Establish a quality baseline for rural habitats and land use in Great Britain through ground surveys and aerial photography comparison.
  - Build a consistent, grid-based dataset (land classes) to support landscape-level analysis and future change detection.
  - Combine map-based recording with ground observations across 32 land classes, using 1 km by 1 km sample squares.
  - 1984 plan: survey 384 squares (12 per each of 32 land classes) across GB; some exceptions where original samples could not be surveyed.
  - Data items chosen to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant to grid-based landscape analysis.

- Sampling design and logistics
  - From Project 424 origins, land classes derived from multivariate classifications; grid of 1x1 km squares used for sampling.
  - Each square surveyed by teams from six ITE research stations; liaison support from Merlewood.
  - Planning emphasizes minimizing travel and avoiding revisits; proposed scheduling options include daily travel, overnight stays, or short blocks away from base.
  - Planning notes address permissions, access, and cost considerations (travel-based survey costs, no overnight subsistence assumed).

- Planning, permissions, and access
  - Prior permissions for full-square access are essential to avoid wasted work.
  - Surveyors should obtain farmer/landowner permission and carry ITE identity; update ownership lists from prior survey cycles.
  - If possible, initiate prior contact, but be aware this can cause delays; a background information sheet and identity ID help.

- Equipment and field setup
  - Minimal equipment: mainly mapping and recording tools rather than measurements.
  - Involves recording booklets (FABs), 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, camera, pens, clipboard, weather gear, and reference materials.
  - Maps are annotated with numeric/alpha codes to encode multiple observations efficiently.

- Field procedures and data collection
  - On arrival: surveyors assess access and potential problems; seek permission for the entire square.
  - Establish a route to cover the square fully; once completed, review records for omissions and clarity.
  - Field decisions about recording are made in real time; documentation should note any uncertainties with qualifiers.
  - The minimum mappable unit is 0.5 hectare (approx.) with a mapped length around 0.5 km.

- Data recording and the FAB (Field Assessment Booklet)
  - Data are annotated on 6" maps using a standardized set of codes; combinations of numeric codes encode complex features and relations.
  - FAB structure includes: cover, ownership, farmer/landowner information, physiography/inland water/coastal, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, and photography.
  - Each square has a unique series number; where complex, coloured pens and codes help reduce map clutter.
  - The field survey emphasizes consistent interpretation and documentation of edge cases; if a feature is ambiguous, note it with a qualifying remark.

- Data items and coding by sheet (highlights)
  - Ownership, Farmer/Landowner Information
    - Record ownership of land units within the square; mark tenants (T) and owners (C) where ownership has changed since 1977/78.
    - Provide a numeric scale of owner/cooperation for potential follow-up.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal
    - Record cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat status, erosion, ground leveling, springs, ditches, levees, lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, and coastal features.
    - Use combinations of codes to describe lake shores, river banks, substrate types, and drainage evidence.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation
    - Cover types cover the major GB ground covers (excluding urban and woodland); includes curtilage-specific rules.
    - Examples include amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland heath, various aquatic/peatland classifications, crops, vacant/abandoned land, fallow land, burnt moorland, and specific crop and livestock uses.
    - For vegetation and crops, provide species-level notes when cover thresholds are met; use age, height, and proportion codes for detailed woodland and coppice descriptions.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
    - Record woodland units with tree cover, species composition, regeneration, age, proportions, and management status (unmanaged, underplanting, plantation, etc.).
    - Distinguish trees, coppice, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and lines of trees; use detailed species coding and description fields.
  - Boundaries
    - Record boundary types (mortared walls, hedges, stockproof boundaries, fences, gates) and boundary descriptions where needed.
    - Note gaps, gaps fillings, and stockproof status; record boundary length and edge details.
  - Recreation
    - Map formal and informal recreation areas and uses; encode signs of public access and recreational facilities.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications
    - Capture built covers, residential and non-residential buildings, public facilities, institutions, and infrastructure (roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers, pipelines, signs).
    - Use color conventions to differentiate curtilages and building types; explicitly map new developments and derelict sites.
  - Photography
    - Take five photographs per square from specified viewpoints; record exact photo locations and directions on the FAB.

- Post-survey processing and data handling
  - After surveying, review sheets for omissions; avoid transposing data to new forms unless necessary.
  - Report batches to Merlewood and arrange transport of completed FAB squares; data intended to be discoverable with metadata.

- Data quality, interoperability, and challenges (Analyst-oriented perspective)
  - The handbook stresses standardized coding, cross-referencing with prior surveys, and compatibility with grid-based landscape objectives.
  - Anticipates issues with scale, accessibility, and the need to unify data from multiple sheets and categories.
  - Emphasizes documentation of decisions in the field and clear, interpretable metadata to enable future reuse and comparisons.
  - Designed to support statistically robust inferences about land use and habitat change when aggregated across many squares and years.
