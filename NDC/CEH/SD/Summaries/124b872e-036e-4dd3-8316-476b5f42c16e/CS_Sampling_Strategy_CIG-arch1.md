# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- A historical and methodological account of how Countryside Survey field sampling has evolved, tightly linked to the ITE Land Classification and its use as a stratification framework for GB-wide ecological surveying.
- Emphasises the need for representative, stratified sampling and the rationale for developing and refining classification schemes over time.
- Describes how national estimates are constructed from class-level data and how country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) has driven changes to sampling design.

## Core concepts and aims

- Use of a stratified, random sampling approach to avoid bias and ensure samples cover the range of land types and ecological conditions.
- Development of the ITE Land Classification to define strata (land classes) that reflect environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) and ecological processes.
- Linking field surveys to a consistent sampling framework across survey years, enabling time-series analyses of habitat and land-use change.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to group vegetation-based quadrats into 32 land classes from environmental attributes.
  - For GB, centre squares (1 km) of a 15 x 15 km grid were classified; 6039 km^2 were classified across surrounding squares.
  - Sampling: 8 squares per land class, totaling 256 squares; national habitat estimates calculated from mean habitat area per square times land class area.

- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Used the 1978 Land Classification; focus shifted toward land-use and habitat mapping.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated measurements of earlier vegetation data; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - National estimates based on the revised (1990) classification.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Classification updated to support separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.

- 2000 (CS2000; 5th Field Survey)
  - Addressed policy needs for separate Scotland, England, and Wales reporting.
  - Introduced country-unit versions of land classes, class subdivisions (expanding strata to 40), and additional sampling to ensure adequate representation across new classes.
  - Included upland habitat sampling as a dedicated module to improve upland estimates and country-level precision.

- 2007 (CS2007; Welsh-only Reporting and further refinements)
  - Wales required more robust Wales-only reporting; Wales became most intensively sampled.
  - Implemented country-unit subdivisions for England and Wales (creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded to 45 strata.
  - Added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; some English classes (5e, 15e) ended with as few as 4 squares.
  - Revised class maps for England-Wales and Scotland; maintained Wales-focused sampling alongside broader UK framework.
  - Included upland sampling module enhancements consistent with CS2000 approach.

## Sampling framework and country-specific reporting

- Core framework uses GB-wide stratification by Land Classes to derive national estimates.
- Country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) required adapting the framework:
  - Sub-dividing Land Classes into country-specific variants (e.g., 5w, 6w, etc.).
  - Aggregating underrepresented sub-classes within a country to maintain robust strata (creating 40–45 strata overall).
  - Adding squares to ensure each new class is represented in each country unit; replacing Isle of Man squares with England squares when appropriate.
- Wales-specific adaptations increased sample density to support Wales-only analyses; adjustments affected how estimates are reported and compared across years.

## Upland module and statistical precision

- CS2000 introduced an upland module (30 additional squares) funded separately to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- This module addressed potential under-sampling of upland habitats when producing country-based estimates.

## National estimates and methodological notes

- National estimates can be computed using the latest Land Classification or the original 1990 classification; however, changing the underlying classification can affect cross-survey consistency.
- For internal consistency within a single survey, the latest classification version is preferred; for cross-survey comparability, the 1990 classification is often used.
- Acknowledges the trade-off between updating the classification (to reflect new understanding) and maintaining consistency across surveys.

## Outputs and supporting information

- Detailed tables (CS2000 and CS2007) document the numbers of squares by class and country unit, sampling rates, and stratum distributions.
- Figures accompany maps of land-class frameworks and sample locations across GB and its constituent countries.
- Notes include the rationale for national estimates, class definitions, and cross-survey considerations.
