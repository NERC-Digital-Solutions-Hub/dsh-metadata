# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey, the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification.
- Emphasizes continuity with earlier surveys (1978–1990) and the link between stratification, sampling, and national estimates.
- Describes how sampling, classification, and country-specific reporting have evolved to meet policy and monitoring needs.

## Core concepts and approach
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure samples are representative of Britain’s varied landscapes.
- Stratification (ITE Land Classification) groups land into discrete classes to minimize bias and improve precision.
- National estimates are derived by combining the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the total area of that class.
- Data and classifications have been progressively updated to support regional and country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and policy needs.

## Development history of the ITE Land Classification
- 1978 (Initial Survey): 1228 centre 1 km squares classified; 32 Land Classes; eight samples per class (total 256 squares) for national estimates.
- 1984 (Second survey): Framework retained; 12 squares per class (384 total); broader focus on land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification): Expanded to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed; Land Cover Map linked; results published for Countryside Survey 1990.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification): Classification extended to allow Scotland-only reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40; greater regional applicability.
- 2000 (CS2000): Adjusted framework to produce separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); added sampling to ensure adequate representation of new classes; introduced subdivision and aggregation of classes to form 40 strata; uplands module added for better upland habitat estimates.

## Country-specific reporting and structure
- England, Scotland, and Wales reporting requirements led to:
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales-related reporting).
  - Creation of 45 strata (from 40) with additional Squares to ensure representation of new classes in each country.
  - Isle of Man sampling squares removed and replaced to maintain country-focused estimates.
- Wales-specific refinements:
  - Wales received increased sampling (minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class) and targeted sub-division to improve Wales-only estimates.
  England adjustments were made to retain adequate precision where Welsh samples were removed.
- uplands module (CS2000):
  - Added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas to boost accuracy for England and Wales upland habitat estimates.

## Developments for Countryside Survey 2007
- Wales-only reporting required further Welsh class subdivisions (five new Welsh country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
- Increased Wales strata to 45; added 43 additional Welsh squares to ensure at least 6 squares per Welsh class.
- England classes 5e and 15e reduced to 4 squares per class due to overall representation considerations; scoping suggested precision loss was acceptable for reporting purposes.
- Revised Land Class maps produced for England with Wales and Scotland (Figure 4) and updated sample maps (Figures 6–7).
- Table 3 summarizes the CS2007 sampling: breakdown of squares by class and country, with England and Wales totals and sampling rates.

## Data handling and estimation notes
- National estimates rely on two linked elements:
  - The area of each Land Class across GB (or subregions) as defined by the Land Classification.
  - The mean habitat area per square within each Land Class.
- The 2006 scoping study highlighted that changing the underlying Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates; a balance is struck between using the latest classification for current surveys and maintaining cross-survey consistency.
- The CS datasets and classifications have evolved to support country-specific reporting while preserving comparability across survey years.
