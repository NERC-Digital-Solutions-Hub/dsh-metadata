# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- The 1984 Field Survey Handbook outlines a standardized, large-scale ecological survey of Great Britain (Project 424) to establish a baseline for land cover, land use, habitats, and landscape features. It builds on prior surveys (1977/78) and uses a systematic 1x1 km square sampling across 32 land classes, with 12 squares selected from each class (384 squares total, GB-wide, with some exceptions). The goal is to assess changes by ground survey and aerial photography, enabling future partial re-sampling and increasing statistical confidence.

- The handbook defines planning, equipment, field procedures, data recording, and post-survey processes to ensure consistent data collection and compatibility with previous surveys and grid-based analyses.

- Data are intended to be self-serve through mapped outputs (e.g., FABs and maps) and are designed to be combined across categories to support broad landscape interpretation and policy-relevant insights.

- The document provides a comprehensive coding framework for recording observations on 6" (1:10,000) maps via the Field Assessment Booklet (FAB), enabling efficient data capture, integration, and later analysis.

- A key emphasis is on obtaining permissions, engaging landowners, and planning efficient travel and survey routes to optimize time and costs, since surveys are travel-intensive and often single-visit per square.

- The handbook also prescribes a detailed set of color conventions for map outputs to facilitate rapid interpretation of outputs by varying audiences.

## Scope, design and aims

- Establish a quality baseline for rural environments, to compare ground survey results with aerial photography and prior surveys.

- Use 384 squares across GB, with 32 land classes, to enable robust statistical inference and future partial replacement sampling.

- Produce data products (maps, FABs, reports) that support wide reuse and interpretation across topics, including policy, planning, and public communication.

## Planning and logistics

- Six ITE research stations coordinate field teams; each square is allocated to survey teams with a typical per-square field time of about one day, prioritizing one-visit completion when possible.

- Travel-first planning is encouraged to minimize multiple visits to a site; travel-based costing underpins the project budget.

- Three planning approaches for logistics:
  - Travel from stations for one square daily
  - One night away for two squares (outbound and return)
  - A group of squares over a week with extended travel

## Equipment

- Minimal field equipment focused on mapping and recording:
  - FABs, 6" maps, film, handouts, colored pens, maps for site locations, navigation tools, ITE ID card, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books if needed, camera.

## Field procedure

- Upon arrival, assess access and potential problems, then secure permissions for the full square before surveying.

- Choose a route that allows full coverage of the square and ensure a final check of all records after surveying.

## Permissions and ownership

- Secure permissions to access all parts of the square to ensure legal access and maintain goodwill with landowners/farmers.

- Collect and update ownership information for all land units within each square; mark tenants (T) and owners (C for changed ownership since 1977/78).

- Record owner cooperation on a coded scale (0–3) indicating level of interest/helpfulness for potential future surveys.

## Data recording and FAB

- The survey is essentially a mapping exercise using 6" maps annotated with a standardized set of data codes.

- Data codes are combined in boxes on the FAB to form a concise, parseable record of land cover, use, boundaries, and features.

- Decisions in the field should be made wherever possible; the laboratory or processor should not force a late or ill-considered choice.

- The smallest mappable unit is half a hectare and a length of 0.5 km; ensure edge corners of the square are fully recorded.

- The FAB data sheets (pages) are organized to capture a wide range of information, with columns and coded boxes designed to minimize transcription effort and maximize consistency.

## FAB structure and content (highlights)

- Cover: identify square, location, series number, and other meta-data.

- Ownership: document owners, tenants, and cooperative indicators to aid future engagement.

- Farmer/Landowner Information: confidential-oriented notes to capture background dialogue and background data for the farmer.

- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: capture physical and hydrological context (cliffs, rocks, peat, ditches, springs, rivers, lakes, ponds, coastlines, etc.) with defined codes and mapping conventions.

- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: recording of ground cover types, crops, pasture, heath, moorland, wetlands, and related botanical observations; includes species codes for major grasses and perennials; notes on crop growth, land use, and garden/curtilage applicability.

- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: categorize cover types (woodland, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, individual trees), note species where possible, age classes, proportions, and management details (unmanaged, regeneration, underplanting, plantations, etc.).

- Boundaries: map and code boundary types (e.g., walls, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries) and associated descriptions; record gaps and boundary conditions.

- Recreation: identify formal and informal recreational uses and facilities.

- Buildings/Structures/Communications: map and code built features (residential, commercial, industrial, public services, education/cultural, religious, institutional; new developments; derelict sites) and associated infrastructure (pipelines, signs, roads, tracks, footpaths, enclosures, etc.); use color conventions to differentiate curtilages and features.

- Photography: five photographs per square to reflect features and context; document exact locations and directions for each photo.

- Colour conventions: recommended color schemes to simplify field-to-map interpretation and reduce confusion when decoding FAB outputs.

## Data categories and representative codes (conceptual)

- Cover types and land uses span agricultural and natural features (e.g., permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, marsh, crops, fallow, abandoned land, etc.) and are often linked with species and habitat indicators.

- Species lists (for key forage and native flora and fauna) support habitat classification.

- Tree and woodland classifications cover various forms of woodland, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, coppice, regeneration, underplanting, age classes, and management.

- Boundary types include walls, hedges (trimmed/untrimmed), fences, banks, and gaps, with descriptors to indicate stockproof status and modifications.

- Recreation and buildings/communications categories capture both formal infrastructures (roads, tracks, footpaths, pipelines) and non-road features (informal barriers, signs, gates).

- Provisions exist for noting new developments, derelict or vacant sites, and special landscape features or local codes.

## Photography and post-survey procedures

- Photographs are to be taken methodically to represent each square while avoiding excessive sky or uninformative views.

- After surveying, data should be checked for omissions; transcription to alternate maps is discouraged unless necessary to prevent data loss.

- Completed FABs should be communicated to Merlewood and batches organized for transport and processing, with timely notification of completion.

## End goals and data use

- The handbook creates a reproducible, scalable framework for documenting rural environmental changes, enabling longitudinal analyses and comparisons with prior surveys and aerial data.

- Outputs are designed to be accessible for end users and adaptable to broader data-use objectives, including landscape planning, conservation, and policy development.
