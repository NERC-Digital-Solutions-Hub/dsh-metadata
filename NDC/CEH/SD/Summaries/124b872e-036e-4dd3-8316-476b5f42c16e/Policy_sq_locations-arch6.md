# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH/NERC, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing landowner permission.
- Requests handled by CEH (on behalf of NERC and CS partners) under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how precise location can be released
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for identifying if squares fall within preset areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references (more precise) require CEH pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing precise locations; in VERY EXCEPTIONAL cases, location information may be released externally under licence if IP/confidentiality criteria are met.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) could enable square identification and are released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.

## Licence terms and usage restrictions
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals for the defined purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- After licensing ends, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; cannot be used to plan landowner visits or monitor compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- For four-digit releases, license terms are similar but do not require the same IP confidentiality level as six-digit releases, and licensees must not attempt to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, authorizes exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- Decisions and grounds for approvals/denials are documented and, if approved, reflected in licences signed by an authorised representative.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising licence applications and decision rationales.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid as negotiated.

## Implications for data support practice
- Emphasizes safeguarding confidentiality while enabling legitimate data use through controlled licensing and pre-processing.
- Encourages collaboration with CEH to design data usage that avoids precise location disclosure.
- Highlights the need for clear licensing, secure handling, and destruction post-project.
