# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and scientific integrity.
- Protects the environment and maintains permission to survey land.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Location data can be used to identify whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing a square.
- For precise six-digit locations, CEH should perform pre-processing analysis to avoid releasing coordinates; in very exceptional cases, external release may be approved under licence if the requester can show IP data has equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data from within squares could reveal square locations and is treated with the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  
## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of licensing period requires written destruction confirmation.
- Third-party release that could compromise square confidentiality is prohibited; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowners; not used to identify square locations or verify landowner compliance.
- Licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards equivalent to JCOP; four-digit releases have slightly lower IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.
- Licences for four-digit grid references prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional release and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approved, CEH issues licences; if denied, decisions are supported under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- CEH commits to moderate pre-processing support for internal CS partner use; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using any data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be part of collaboration or paid work, negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for GIS practice
- Use four-digit grid references where possible to balance utility with confidentiality.
- Avoid deriving or using data to pinpoint exact square locations; rely on licensed, non-precise references when needed.
- Plan data workflows with licensing constraints and potential need for CEH pre-processing support.
- Engage CEH early to determine what level of data access is appropriate for a project.

## How to proceed and contact
- Requests for location data are managed by CEH on behalf of NERC; licensing is required and governed by privacy and confidentiality terms.
- Consult CEH before committing to work with CS location data to align requirements and use of data.
- Data access decisions will consider IP confidentiality, licensing terms, and project-specific safeguards.
