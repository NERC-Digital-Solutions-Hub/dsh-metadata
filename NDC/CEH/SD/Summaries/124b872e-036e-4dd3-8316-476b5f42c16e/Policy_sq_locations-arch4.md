# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aim: maximise the public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
- Scope: Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Rationale for confidentiality
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Public interest stance: requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 or Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Access, release levels, and conditions
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess to avoid release; exceptional access requires legal demonstration that the licensee’s data/IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, features): could identify square location; released only under the same exceptional circumstances as six-digit references.
- Four-digit release terms differ from six-digit terms in confidentiality criteria, but both are restricted by licensing.

- License conditions:
  - Protect confidentiality; data stored securely; access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite-term for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmed at licence end.
  - Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality or be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
  - If required, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP (Joint Code of Practice for Research) for certain releases.
  - Users must not attempt to infer precise locations or claim to have derived them.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signatories must have authority.
- If a release is denied, CEH supports the decision under Act/Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support for internal CS partners; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy (benefits may include scientific lead support; involvement may be collaborative or paid).
