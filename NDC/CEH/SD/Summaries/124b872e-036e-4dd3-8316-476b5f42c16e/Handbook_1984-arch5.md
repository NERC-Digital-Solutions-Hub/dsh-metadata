# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview: purpose and scope
- 1984 field survey handbook documenting standardized methods for recording rural environment data across Great Britain.
- Built on prior work (Project 424, 1976) to create a quality baseline for comparing ground surveys with aerial photography and for monitoring habitat and land-use changes.
- Uses a grid-based approach (32 land classes; 1 x 1 km squares; 384 squares nationally) and a consistent 6" map annotation system to enable cross-survey comparability.
- Data are collected to meet practical field needs while remaining compatible with earlier surveys and grid data, and with a strong emphasis on consistency, metadata, and the ability to update.

## Data model and coding standards
- Data are recorded on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a structured set of numeric and alpha codes, often combined into single entries to describe multiple attributes.
- Minimum mapable unit and unit length defined (1/2 hectare; 1/5 km) to standardize recording.
- The Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) serves as the primary data container for each square, alongside the maps and photographs.
- Data categories and representative code ranges include:
  - Cover types (e.g., 100, 101–109, 110, 112–129, 131–137, 138, 140–146, 149–157, 158–169; crops and non-agricultural cover noted).
  - Species lists (e.g., 151–169 for dominant grasses and associated flora; additional species codes follow).
  - Land use and livestock categories (e.g., 171–179 for livestock types; 180–184 for farm outputs like silage and produce for sale).
  - Physiography, inland water, and coastal features (Section 4) with dedicated codes (e.g., cliffs, peat types, water bodies, rivers, ditches, springs, levees).
  - Forestry/woodland/trees (Section 6) with detailed tree/woodland classification (cover types, age, regeneration, plantations, belts, hedges, coppice, etc.).
  - Boundaries (Section 7) covering boundary types (e.g., walls, hedges, stockproof, filled gaps) and descriptive qualifiers.
  - Buildings/structures/communications and recreation (Section 9 and 8) with codes for roads, tracks, footpaths, buildings by function, and recreational features.
- Color conventions are recommended to support legibility when coding complex or dense data.
- Surveyors may add new categories or qualifiers when necessary, but should provide explicit notes or comments to preserve interpretability and interoperability.

## Data collection workflow: planning, equipment, procedures, and permissions
- Planning
  - Squares are grouped into teams; each square requires efficient coverage planning to minimize travel and avoid duplicative work.
  - There is an emphasis on timely data collection and avoiding repeated site visits where possible.
- Equipment
  - Minimal equipment is required; primary tools are FABs, maps, film, color pens, navigation tools, and recording materials.
- Field procedure
  - On arrival: assess access, potential problems, and secure permissions; plan a route for complete coverage.
  - Seek permissions before surveying each square; gaining access fosters goodwill and facilitates background information exchange.
  - Document access permissions and ownership information; update ownership data as needed.
- Permissions and ownership
  - Permissions are essential to access all parts of a square; prior contact is encouraged, but formal permission reduces risk of wasted work.
  - An ownership sheet records which land units belong to which owner (tenant vs owner) and tracks changes since 1977/78.
  - A rating system (0–3) indicates the level of cooperativeness or helpfulness of owners, guiding future engagement.

## Data capture: FAB structure and field recording guidelines
- FABs are the primary data recording sheets, accompanied by the 6" maps.
- Each square’s data are consolidated on the FAB, including:
  - Square series number, location, and ownership/tenant details.
  - Farmer/Landowner information: background conversations guided by a standard sheet; aim to interview at least one primary landholder.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: a structured set of features recorded with appropriate codes.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: cover types, habitat types, and plant/species information; notes on crop and land-use within curtilages.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: tree cover types, species, age, regeneration, and management descriptors.
  - Boundaries: descriptive and coded boundary types; distance and proportion details where applicable.
  - Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas and uses.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built features, their function, and associated infrastructure (roads, tracks, signage, etc.).
  - Photography: field photographs (slides) taken from predefined viewpoints to document square characteristics.
- Coding and documentation
  - Data encoding uses combinations of numeric codes and limited free text; when complex mosaics occur, colored pens can visualize the components.
  - If a feature is too complex to encode with codes, use color overlays and annotate clearly.
  - Unique notes or qualifiers should accompany code entries to preserve interpretability.

## Data governance, provenance, access, and lifecycle
- Provenance and attribution
  - Field team composition, sites visited, and survey dates are embedded in the FAB and accompanying maps; this supports auditability and reproducibility.
- Access and permissions
  - Permission handling is formalized to ensure all parts of a square can be surveyed and to maintain good relationships with landowners.
  - Ownership changes are tracked since the prior survey (1977/78) to support ongoing data accuracy and planning for follow-up surveys.
- Output and archival
  - After field work, batch submission to Merlewood is coordinated; there is guidance on not transposing data onto new maps unless absolutely necessary to protect the original data.
  - Completed FABs, 6" maps, and photographs constitute the primary archival dataset; future reuse requires preserving data structure and metadata.
- Update and reuse considerations
  - The handbook acknowledges that future changes in data collection or classification schemes may arise; the emphasis is on consistency, clear documentation, and compatibility with earlier work.

## Practical considerations and challenges for data stewardship
- Challenges highlighted in the text align with typical stewardship concerns:
  - Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities, and ensuring datasets meet those needs.
  - Timeliness and completeness of data delivery from data creators/sharers.
  - Coordinating across multiple systems, formats, and potentially non-interoperable methods.
  - Handling large datasets and updating legacy databases or classifications.
  - Ensuring ongoing data quality, standardization, and governance across repeated surveys.

## Takeaways for data stewardship and governance
- Establish a clear data dictionary and version control for all codes and categories used (cover types, species, land-use, boundaries, etc.).
- Maintain robust provenance records: who collected data, when, where, and under what permissions; track ownership changes and survey team composition.
- Enforce standardized data capture procedures to ensure consistency across squares and over time; document exceptions with explicit notes.
- Ensure data storage formats align with the FAB structure (maps, FAB pages, and photographs) to support discoverability and reuse.
- Manage access and permissions sensitively, including owner cooperation ratings, and document engagement outcomes to inform future surveys.
- Plan for data delivery and archiving with clear responsibilities (e.g., notification and handoff to Merlewood) to preserve dataset integrity.
- Recognize and plan for interoperability needs by preserving original codes and maintaining alignment with prior surveys to support longitudinal analyses.
