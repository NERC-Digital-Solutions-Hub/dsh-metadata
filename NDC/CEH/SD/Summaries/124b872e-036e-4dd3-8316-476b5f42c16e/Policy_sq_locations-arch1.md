# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public usefulness of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and the anonymity of survey site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and future permission to survey land.
- Public interest rationale; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 through CEH.

## What can be released and at what precision
- Access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence when approximate locations are valuable.
- Six-digit grid references: only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH-preprocessing preferred to avoid release; if released externally, must show the data to be used carries equal/higher confidentiality protection.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify square and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licensing terms and usage restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm destruction of location data.
- No third-party release that could compromise square locations; consult CEH if in doubt.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have licensing terms similar to six-digit releases but do not require the highest IP confidentiality level.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, signed by authorised representatives of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to enable reasonable internal pre-processing analyses within moderate demand; case-by-case for external requests.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH support may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
