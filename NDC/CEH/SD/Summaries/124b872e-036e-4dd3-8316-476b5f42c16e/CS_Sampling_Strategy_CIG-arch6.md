# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose: Describe the sampling framework and land classification system (ITE Land Classification) used to stratify and sample field survey squares for Countryside Survey up to 2007, highlighting how data were collected, classified, and used to produce national and country-specific habitat estimates.

## Key concepts and approach

- Stratifed, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s varied landscapes.
- Use of the ITE Land Classification to define strata (land classes) based on environmental attributes, enabling extrapolation of square-level data to national estimates.
- Emphasis on avoiding bias from pure randomness by structuring samples within homogeneous strata.
- Data products include habitat area estimates, land cover mapping, and later country-specific reporting requirements.

## The ITE Land Classification: origins and purpose

- Evolved from work in Cumbria and the Lake District to classify land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than only species.
- Early approach grouped 1 km squares into 32 Land Classes using ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) on environmental variables.
- Classification provided the framework for stratifying GB into discrete, homogeneous units for sampling and estimation.

## Chronology of sampling frameworks and major developments

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - ISA used on 1228 central 1 km squares; 32 classes identified.
  - Sampled 8 squares per Land Class (total 256) for national estimates.
  - Field focus: vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat areas estimated by class means.

- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Expanded sampling to 12 km squares per Land Class (total 384).
  - Still used 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - Aimed to improve representation and change statistics across Britain.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification & Third Field Survey
  - Revised to classify all GB 1 km squares (not just a subset).
  - 508 squares surveyed; added land-use data and repeated 1978 quadrats.
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map (via satellite imagery) and updated national estimates.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1990 to CS1998) for broader reporting
  - Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to improve regional/local estimations.
  - Aimed to support Scotland-only reporting and align data with policy needs.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Implemented separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) using country-specific squares.
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions; some classes aggregated where representation was sparse.
  - 19 additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes.
  - Upland habitat module introduced to improve accuracy of upland estimates in England and Wales.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven devolution; increased Welsh sampling.
  - Sub-division into five new Wales/England country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), expanding total strata to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares; England samples adjusted due to Welsh additions (some English classes reduced to balance representation).
  - Welsh upland and marginal upland coverage enhanced; overall aim to improve Wales-specific estimates.

## Country-specific reporting and uplands emphasis

- Separate country estimates introduced to reflect England with Wales, and Scotland reporting, post-devolution.
- Adjustments included class subdivisions and aggregations to ensure adequate representation of each country’s classes.
- Upland habitat module added in CS2000 to improve statistical precision for uplands in England and Wales.

## Data outputs, usage, and representation

- National habitat area estimates derived from class-specific square data and land-class areas.
- Land Cover Map of GB linked to CS1990/CS2000 developments; integration of environmental and land-use data across surveys.
- Outputs support policy needs and environmental reporting at national and country levels (England, Wales, Scotland).

## Data quality, comparability, and caveats

- Changing the underlying Land Classification affects consistency of national estimates across surveys.
- Preference for using the latest country-specific classification for country estimates; historical consistency may require using earlier classifications for cross-survey comparability.
- Some classes were under-represented in certain countries, necessitating targeted sampling and occasional re-organization of strata to maintain statistical reliability.
