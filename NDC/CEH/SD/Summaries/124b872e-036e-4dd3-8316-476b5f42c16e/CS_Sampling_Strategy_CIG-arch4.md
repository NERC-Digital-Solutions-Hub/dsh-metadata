# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview and purpose
  - Long-running program detailing how the field survey component of Countryside Survey (CS) has evolved since 1978.
  - Demonstrates how the ITE Land Classification has been developed and applied to stratify samples and generate national, regional, and country-specific habitat estimates.
  - Emphasises the link between sampling design, data collection, classification, and the ability to report England, Scotland, and Wales (and Isle of Man in earlier stages) separately.

- Core methodology
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain's varied landscapes.
  - Sample unit: 1 km squares; initial approach used a center square plus surrounding squares to form classified blocks.
  - Land Classification as sampling framework: environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) define 32–45 land classes across surveys.
  - Early procedures used a fixed grid and centre squares; subsequent work expanded to classify all squares and adjust sampling accordingly.
  - Aim to minimize bias and capture ecological and land-use variation across Britain.

- Timeline of Land Classification development and CS surveys
  - 1978 (Initial survey)
    - ITE Land Classification established with 32 classes derived from 1 km squares centered on a 15 x 15 km grid.
    - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class).
    - National habitat estimates calculated from class proportions and square-level means.
  - 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); eight squares from 1978 retained.
    - National estimates still based on the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (CS1990; third survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Added Land Cover Map linkage; retained legacy data for comparability.
    - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.
  - Post-1990 developments (toward CS1990-style full coverage)
    - Full GB classification for all squares remained computationally challenging; surrogate factors used to extend classification.
    - New classifications tested; 62% correspondence with original classes; non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes.
  - 2000 (CS2000; fourth survey)
    - Recognition of the need for country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat estimates.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; distribution adjusted to 40 strata.
    - Additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; 19 extra squares for country-unit balance; upland module added for better upland accuracy.
    - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced in England.
    - Introduction of a dedicated uplands sampling module (30 squares) for England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007; fifth survey)
    - Wales-specific reporting needs led to Wales-focused sampling adjustments.
    - Creation of five Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares added; England retained most existing squares; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with 4 squares each due to precision considerations.
    - Updated land-class maps for England with Wales and Scotland; revised sampling framework shown in figures.

- Country reporting and upland focus
  - Separate country-unit estimates introduced (England with Wales; Scotland) with country-specific sampling and classifications.
  - Wales required dedicated Welsh-class subdivisions and additional Welsh squares to improve Wales-only estimates.
  - An uplands module (CS2000) and dedicated upland sampling in CS2000 enhanced habitat estimates in upland areas.

- Outputs, estimates, and methodological notes
  - National estimates are built from class-level characteristics and land-class areas; consistency across changing classifications is a key concern.
  - In CS1990 onward, there was an emphasis on aligning country estimates with the latest classification for within-survey consistency, while noting cross-survey comparability challenges.
  - Table 4 and accompanying figures document the growth in sample sizes and the evolving distribution of squares across Land Classes and countries.
  - The reporting levels progressed from a single GB framework to separate England & Wales and Scotland outputs, with Wales gaining more robust, Wales-specific results by 2007.

- Practical implications for data leadership
  - Historic data are tied to evolving Land Class definitions; maintaining clear metadata on which classification version was used for specific estimates is essential.
  - For robust data governance, ensure documentation of classification changes, sampling adjustments, and country-specific reporting rules.
  - Coordinate cross-country data strategies to balance representation, maintain comparability, and support policy-relevant Wales-only and Scotland-only outputs.
  - Plan for future integration of upland modules and potential further diversification of land classes as reporting needs evolve.

- Key figures and progression (selected highlights)
  - CS1978: 256 squares across 32 land classes (8 per class).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class); continuing use of 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - CS1990: 508 squares; all GB squares classified; introduction of Land Cover Map linkage.
  - CS2000: 40 strata with country-unit subdivisions; 19 additional squares; upland module added.
  - CS2007: 45 strata; five Welsh sub-classes; 43 additional Welsh squares; Wales-focused adjustments; updated cross-country maps.
