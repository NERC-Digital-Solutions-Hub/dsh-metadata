Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why confidentiality matters
- Locations are confidential to protect representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Confidentiality preserves scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permissions for surveys.
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and partners under the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and levels of release
- Approximate locations (Country/County/ITe Land Class/Environmental Zone) may be provided; four-digit grid references (10x10 km) can be released under licence.
- Precise six-digit grid references require pre-processing by CEH to avoid release; very exceptional external release may be considered if IP data carries equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) could enable locating a square and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit locations.
- The license for release is project-specific and finite; data must not be retained for other organizational use.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licenses are finite and tied to specific projects; licensees must destroy data at the end and confirm destruction in writing.
- Data must not be used to identify or visit CS squares, check landowner compliance, or be released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have a less stringent IP confidentiality hurdle than six-digit releases, but still prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Licensing and governance responsibilities
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licenses with appropriate clauses; licenses must be signed by an authorised senior official of the licensee organization.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports reasons under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- To enable practical use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing analyses within a reasonable timeframe; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are encouraged to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may support collaboration or provide advice, with involvement or payment negotiated case-by-case.
