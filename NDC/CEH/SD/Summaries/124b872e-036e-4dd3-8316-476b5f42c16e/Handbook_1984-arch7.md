# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and purpose
- 1984 field handbook for a rural environment field survey as part of a program to establish a quality baseline for future comparisons between ground survey and aerial photography (Land Classes from a multivariate classification of 1x1 km squares across Great Britain).
- 384 squares (12 from each of 32 classes) surveyed in 1984; aims to include land cover, land use, habitat, and landscape features, with data designed to be compatible with previous surveys and useful for GIS-based map products.
- The handbook defines guidelines to ensure consistent field recording, while allowing for exceptional circumstances and offering mechanisms to annotate doubt or atypical observations.

## Sampling and planning
- Sampling splits: seven groups of squares surveyed by six ITE research stations, with roving liaison teams; each square planned for about one day of survey.
- Each square roughly 0.5 hectares minimum mapping unit; typically mapped on 1:10,000 scale sheets (6" maps).
- Practical planning notes emphasize minimizing round-trips, avoiding double travel, and understanding travel-based cost constraints (overnight stays, daily travel basis).

## Equipment
- Minimal, mapping-focused equipment: FAB recording booklets, 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, handouts, coloured pens, navigation gear, ITE ID, clipboard, pencils, weather gear, reference books, and a camera.

## Field procedures
- On arrival: surveyors assess access, identify potential problems, and seek permissions for the entire square.
- Route planning for full coverage; prioritize efficient sequencing and ensure coverage completeness before leaving.
- Emphasis on practical, on-site decisions in the field to avoid data gaps or ambiguities later.

## Permissions
- Securing access permissions is essential for legal access and to preserve goodwill with farmers/owners.
- Prior contact can help, but may cause delays; a local knowledge base (owner names/addresses) is maintained and updated.
- Surveyors carry identity (ITE card) and use a standard information sheet to explain the project.

## Data recording and FABs
- The survey is primarily a mapping exercise; data are annotated on 6" maps using structured data codes, allowing combinations of codes to describe features in each mapped unit.
- FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) group data per square; each item is recorded with codes and, where necessary, qualitative notes.
- Map coding emphasizes compact data representation: numeric codes may be combined into single alphabetic characters, enabling concise yet detailed records.
- Boundary and feature representation: clearly mark boundaries (fences, walls, hedgerows, etc.), ensure edge-of-square corners are recorded, and use perpendicular markings to distinguish boundary types.
- A minimum mapable unit is defined (0.5 ha, or about 1/5 km long); ensure that all parts of a boundary are captured, including edge areas.

## Ownership and farmer/landowner information
- Ownership of all land units within a square is recorded; tenants and recent ownership changes are flagged.
- An owner coop/interest rating is recorded to gauge willingness to participate in future surveys.

## Physiography, Inland Water, and Coastal (Chapter 4)
- Detailed classification of physiographic and inland/coastal features (cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat, ground leveling, erosion, dunes, shorelines, lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, ditches, springs, levees, etc.).
- A structured coding scheme for physical features and shorelines, with guidance on appearance and interpretation (e.g., distinguishing rivers from streams by width, peat types, and signs of drainage).

## Agriculture/Natural Vegetation (Chapter 5)
- Ground cover categories (non-urban) including various grasslands, moorlands, heath, aquatic vegetation, rushes, bogs, fens, marshes, flushes, crops, and fallow/abandoned land.
- Specific plant and habitat codes for major species when cover exceeds certain thresholds; guidance on recognizing crops (e.g., barley, wheat) and noting management practices (e.g., silage, fields for sale).
- Instructions for recording proportions, species presence, and management/use (stock types, dual-purpose cattle, etc.).
- Special attention to curtilage recording (urban-adjacent areas) and exclusion of non-target areas (e.g., residential gardens) from certain sheets.

## Forestry / Woodland / Trees (Chapter 6)
- Recording woodland units with tree cover, species, density, age class, and management status.
- Distinction between scattered trees, individual trees, coppice, hedgerows, belts, and broader woodland types; rules for subdividing units with variation in species composition.
- Codes for canopy cover, regeneration, age, plantation vs. unmanaged status, underplanting, natural regeneration, and re-growth from cut stumps.
- Special categories for shelter belts, amenity plantings, and recreational or conservation uses of trees.

## Boundaries (Chapter 7)
- Practical boundary recording with numerous types (mortared walls, stone walls, hedges, fences, banks, earthworks, etc.).
- Boundary quality and stockproof status codes; notes on boundary description to supplement type codes; use of “filled gaps” and signs of boundary replacement.

## Recreation (Chapter 8)
- Recording formal and informal recreation areas and signs of human use or access (e.g., golf courses, playgrounds, horse jumps, parks, touring caravans).

## Buildings / Structures / Communications (Chapter 9)
- Built cover types and descriptions for rural and urban infrastructure, including roads, tracks, footpaths, barriers, and communications infrastructure (pylons, bridges, tunnels, etc.).
- Distinguishing residential, commercial, institutional, public services, and educational/cultural buildings; color coding for quick visual interpretation.
- Guidelines for recording new developments, derelict land, vacant buildings, and associated gardens/grounds.

## Photography (Chapter 10)
- Five photographs per square (slides) to reflect the square’s features and surroundings; precise mark-ups on FAB to indicate exact photo locations and directions.

## Procedure subsequent to survey (Chapter 11)
- Post-survey checks to ensure no features were omitted; avoid transposing data onto fresh maps unless necessary.
- Procedures for batching and delivering FABs and maps to Merlewood; coordinating transport and reporting of completed squares.

## Data standards and GIS relevance
- The handbook provides a comprehensive, codified framework for creating GIS-ready map products through standardized field data collection.
- Uses 1:10,000 mapping with 6" sheets, structured FAB data, and multi-layered coding schemes to represent land cover, land use, vegetation, physiography, water features, boundaries, and built environments.
- Emphasizes data quality, consistency across teams, and the ability to combine and compare data across time for landscape monitoring and policy-relevant analyses.
