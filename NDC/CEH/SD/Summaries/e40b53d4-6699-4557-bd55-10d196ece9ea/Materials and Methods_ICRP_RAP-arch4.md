# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Study site: managed coniferous forestry plantation in northwest England (~25 km2 total; main study site ~0.4 km2) with an understory of grasses and sedges; wetter areas dominated by Molinia caerulea; roe deer collected within forest ~2 km from main site. Previously used to estimate absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn and daughters.
- Scope: adult life-stage RAP (reference animal/plant) species sampled across several families; exceptions include Reference Frog and Duck.
- Sampling area context: sampling locations and habitats spanned Sitka spruce stands, Purple moor grass areas, earthworm zones, bee foraging habitats, and roe deer/Northwest forest areas; topsoil and other matrices tied to RAPs.

## 1.2 Sample collection and preparation

- General approach: locations recorded with handheld GPS; reporting includes average dimensions and fresh weight (FW) for animal samples.

### 1.2.1 Bees (Bombus spp.)
- Timing: August–September 2010; 30 pan traps (colours: white, fluorescent yellow/blue) placed near similar-colour flowers.
- Method: traps on ground or elevated on hummocks/stumps; filled with water + a drop of detergent; emptied every 2–4 days; sieved and freeze-dried.
- Measurements: fresh weights of 20 individuals; body dimensions (length 0.8–1.8 cm, width 0.5–0.8 cm, depth 0.4–0.8 cm).
- Species identified: Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis.

### 1.2.2 Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
- Sampling: three composite samples (11–15 worms each) Aug–Sep 2010 by digging.
- Preparation: gut evacuation; aerated containers with damp tissue.
- Measurements: fresh weight 0.13–1.90 g; worm dimensions (length 6.9–15.2 cm, width 0.1–0.4 cm, depth 0.1–0.5 cm); 15 individuals measured.

### 1.2.3 Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
- Sampling: three ~15-year-old self-seeded trees; samples from trunk, branches (≤1 cm), needles; one immature cone per tree.
- Processing: air-dried to ~20°C; moisture content: needles/branches ~45% dry weight (DW), cones ~40% DW, trunk ~59% DW; heartwood heartwood for trunk to avoid contamination.

### 1.2.4 Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
- Trapping: 10 males and 10 females within 0.25 km2 area; 100 Longworth traps along six transects; lines to optimize capture along features.
- Baiting: oats, carrot, insect pupae; bedding with grass hay; familiarization period; traps checked daily, baited/re-set.
- Dissection: 20 mice weighed FW (12.9–27.5 g); dimensions recorded; carcasses skinned; GI tract removed; tissues weighed (carcass 7.4–15.3 g FW); gonads, liver, hind-leg muscle/bone; composite kidney+liver+spleen removed.
- Preservation: samples frozen; three carcasses used in Dermestes beetle colony to estimate total muscle and bone (approx. 41–59% of live weight muscle; bone 2–5%).

### 1.2.5 Purple moor grass (Molina caerulea)
- Sampling: three samples Aug 2010; air-dried ~20°C for analysis.

### 1.2.6 Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
- Sampling: three female deer (two pregnant adults, one juvenile) shot Feb 2011 within ~2 km of main site for forest wildlife control.
- Processing: live-weight recorded (13–22 kg); carcass skinned with GI tract and internal organs weighed; total muscle ~36–38% of live weight; bone ~7–8%; liver 2–3% of live weight; ovaries 0.004–0.006%.

### 1.2.7 Soils
- Sampling: 41 soil samples from top 10 cm at RAP locations; February 2011 additional 3 samples near Roe deer activity; 3 soil samples along wood mouse transects; co-located sampling for bees with grass and Sitka spruce areas.
- Sub-sampling: soils split into two sub-samples for ICP-MS (drying at 20°C) and gamma analysis (drying at 60°C); 25 fresh samples used for pH; bulked ICP-MS samples; 41 gamma-analyzed samples individually.
- Timeline: large portion of soil sampling Aug–Sept 2010; additional near February 2011.

## 2 Sample analyses

- All RAP samples and soils submitted to stable element analysis by ICP-MS; subset analyzed for C and N; larger mass samples analyzed for gamma-emitting radionuclides.

### 2.1 ICP-MS analysis
- Laboratory and QA: analysis by ICP-MS at FERA; accreditation details referenced.
- Sample preparation: careful minimization of metal contamination; homogenization with ceramic tools; aliquots digested in nitric + hydrochloric acid using closed-vessel microwave digestion.
- Analytes: quantification of 60 elements; use of CRM references and blanks for recovery estimation; quality control with replicate analyses.
- Sample handling: three bees from different dates analyzed whole; three sub-samples for purple moor grass, Sitka spruce tissues, etc.; three tissues per Wood mouse and Roe deer; earthworms and soils also analyzed.
- Data handling: results categorized by data quality:
  - Q±20: within ±20% of CRM
  - Q±40: within ±40%
  - QL: within a factor of two
  - U: outside a factor of two
  - No CRM: uncategorised or qualitative

### 2.2 Gamma analysis
- Preparation: sub-samples ground; Sitka spruce trunk ashed; Roe deer and Wood mouse samples prepared where possible.
- Instrumentation: high-purity germanium detectors; efficiency calibration with mixed radionuclide standard; spectra analyzed with specialized software; activity concentrations decay-corrected to sampling day.
- Quality: replicates and process blanks used for QA; method accredited by UKAS.

### 2.3 Loss on ignition and pH
- LOI: measured at 450°C for 4 h (soil samples) following Allen (1989).
- pH: measured in distilled water for 25 fresh soil samples.
