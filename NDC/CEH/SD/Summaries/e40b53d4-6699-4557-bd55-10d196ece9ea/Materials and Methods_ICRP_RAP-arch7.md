# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Location and habitat
  - Managed coniferous forestry plantation (~25 km²) in northwest England; main study site ~0.4 km².
  - Landscape features: established conifer, understory grasses; wetter areas with Molinia caerulea (Purple moor grass); some shrubs and small broadleaf trees.
  - Roe deer sampled within the forest 0–2 km north/east of the main site; site previously used to estimate absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn (Beresford et al. 2012).

- Sampling scope and audience
  - Targeted terrestrial RAPs (per ICRP definitions) across multiple taxa; all RAP families represented except Reference Frog and Duck.
  - Data intended for integration into map-based data products and GIS visualizations to support interpretation and decision-making.

- Spatial data and logistics
  - All sampling locations recorded with hand-held GPS.
  - Sampling occurred within a defined grid/area around the main site, including co-located sampling areas for bees and Purple moor grass.
  - Roe deer sampling covered sites within ~500 m of deer activity and a 2 km radius around the main site to capture potential spatial variation.

- Taxa and sampling overview
  - Bees (Bombus spp.)
  - Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
  - Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
  - Purple moor grass (Molnia caerulea)
  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
  - Soils (top 10 cm; multiple sampling campaigns and locations)

- Data collected per sampling event (examples)
  - Bees: GPS-located trap sites; August–September 2010; 30 pan traps; species identified (Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis); fresh weight of individuals; body dimensions.
  - Earthworms: composite samples (11–15 worms per sample), August–September 2010; gut evacuation; weights and dimensions of 15 individuals.
  - Sitka spruce: three trees; samples from trunk, branches, needles, immature cones; air-dried to targets; heartwood trunk sampling to avoid contamination.
  - Wood mice: 10 males + 10 females; Live-trap grid; mid-Sep 2010; tissues dissected (muscle, bone, liver, gonads, spleen/kidney/liver composite); fresh weights and dimensions recorded; beetle cleaning used to estimate muscle/bone mass.
  - Purple moor grass: three samples; August 2010; air-dried.
  - Roe deer: three females; Feb 2011; live weight recorded; carcass dissection for muscle, bone, liver, ovaries; beetle cleaning for bone; mass estimates.
  - Soils: 41 samples (top 10 cm) in 2010; additional 25 fresh samples in Feb 2011 for pH; subset of samples for ICP-MS and gamma analyses.

- Data types and variables
  - Physical measurements: weights, lengths, widths, depths; sample masses as fresh weight (FW) or dry weight (DW) where appropriate.
  - Tissue and organ specificity for vertebrates (e.g., liver, gonads, muscle, bone).
  - Soil properties: pH, loss on ignition (LOI) at 450°C.
  - Analytical identifiers: sample IDs linked to taxa, tissue type, date, and GPS location.

- Data integration and preparation
  - Samples prepared to minimize contamination (use of ceramic blades, avoidance of metallic instruments).
  - Composite samples created for ICP-MS analysis where mass constraints required; some samples undergo separate analyses (cones/seeds, bark vs. heartwood, etc.).
  - Samples dried/prepared to meet analytical requirements (air drying, LOI, ashing for certain tissues).

- References and grounding
  - Methods and prior work cited to support sampling design, species selection, and interpretation (e.g., ICRP Environmental Protection parameters, previous Roe deer guidance, bee diversity references).

- Analysis and QA overview
  - Analytical focus: ICP-MS for 60 elements; selected samples for C and N; gamma spectroscopy for radionuclides.
  - Quality assurance: use of blanks, certified reference materials (CRMs), replication; categorization of element data quality (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U, No CRM).
  - Gamma analysis: thorough preparation, calibration with standards, decay-corrected activity concentrations, replicates, process blanks.

- Data quality and context considerations for GIS
  - Spatially explicit sampling design with multiple nearby co-located areas enabling spatial analyses across taxa and substrates.
  - Documentation of sampling dates, methods, and tissue types supports provenance tracking and data lineage in GIS workflows.
  - Data items suitable for map-based visualization include species distributions, tissue-specific concentration data, soil properties, and radiological measurements.
