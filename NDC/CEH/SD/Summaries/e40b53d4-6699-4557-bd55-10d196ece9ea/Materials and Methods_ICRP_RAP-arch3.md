2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Overview of the study site
  - Location: a managed coniferous forestry plantation (~25 km²) in northwest England; main study site ~0.4 km².
  - Habitat: mix of established conifers, grass/sedge understory; wetter patches with Molinia caerulea; roe deer sampled within 2 km to north/east.
  - Prior context: previously used to estimate absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn and daughters.

- Objectives and sampling scope
  - Aim: collect terrestrial Reference Animals and Plants (RAPs) data to inform environmental health monitoring, including potential radiological exposure pathways.
  - taxa and materials sampled: bees, earthworms, Sitka spruce, wood mice, purple moor grass, roe deer, and soils; adult life-stages sampled for most RAPs except reference frog and duck.
  - Temporal frame: sampling conducted mainly in 2010–2011.

- Sampling and site documentation
  - Locations recorded with handheld GPS; detailed sample collection methods and preparation described for each taxon.
  - Across taxa, measurements included average fresh weight and body dimensions prior to processing.

- Taxon-specific sampling details
  - Bees (Bombus spp.)
    - Method: 30 pan traps (white, fluorescent yellow/blue) Aug–Sept 2010; traps near flowers; water with a drop of detergent; emptied 2–4 days; samples bulked by collection day and freeze-dried.
    - Measurements: fresh weights (n=20) 0.07–0.28 g; body dimensions recorded.
    - Species identified: Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis.

  - Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
    - Method: three composite samples (11–15 worms each) Aug–Sept 2010; gut evacuation before processing.
    - Measurements: fresh weight and dimensions of 15 individuals recorded.

  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
    - Method: three self-seeded trees (~15 years old) felled Aug 2010; samples from trunk, branches, needles, and immature cones.
    - Drying: air-dried to ~40–59% DW depending on tissue type.
    - Contamination avoidance: trunk samples from heartwood to minimize external contamination.

  - Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
    - Method: 0.25 km² area; 100 Longworth traps, baits and bedding described; trapping across six sessions in Sep 2010.
    - Sampled individuals: 20 mice (10 male, 10 female); measurements and dissection.
    - Tissues collected: carcass weighed, gonads (male/female), liver, hind-leg muscle and bone; composite sample of spleen/kidney/liver; some carcasses cleaned to estimate total muscle and bone.

  - Purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea)
    - Method: three samples Aug 2010; air-dried for analysis.

  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
    - Method: three female deer shot Feb 2011 as part of forest wildlife control; recorded live weight; full flesh removal and organ weighing; carcass halved to estimate total muscle and bone; bones cleaned via Dermestes beetle colony.
    - Tissue masses: muscle ~36–38% live-weight; bone 7–8%; liver 2–3%; ovaries 0.004–0.006%.

  - Soils
    - Sampling: 41 topsoil samples (0–10 cm) Aug/Sept 2010 from RAP locations; additional 3 samples Feb 2011 near deer activity; 3 soil samples for each wood mouse line; 25 fresh soils Feb 2011 for pH.
    - Sub-sampling: split into two sub-samples for ICP-MS (air-dried) and gamma analysis (oven-dried); some samples bulked for ICP-MS.

- Sample handling and preparation
  - All samples were weighed and frozen prior to analysis where appropriate; some bones and muscles were prepared or cleaned (e.g., Dermestes beetle) to obtain total tissue fractions.
  - Minimization of contamination and careful preparation were emphasized across sample types.

- Analytical methods (overview)
  - ICP-MS (stable elements)
    - Conducted by the Food and Environment Research Agency; 60 elements quantified using digestion with nitric and hydrochloric acids in quartz vessels with microwave heating.
    - QA: use certified reference materials (CRMs); blanks and CRM spikes used for recovery; data quality categorized (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U).

  - Gamma analysis (radioactive isotopes)
    - Sub-samples prepared (drying, ashing where relevant); analyzed with high-purity germanium detectors; spectra decay-corrected to sampling day.
    - QA: replicates and process blanks; method accredited by UKAS.

  - Loss on ignition (LOI) and pH
    - LOI: 450°C for 4 h on soils.
    - pH: measurement in distilled water for 25 fresh soil samples.

- Data quality and reporting
  - Elements reported with data quality indicators (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U) based on CRM comparisons.
  - Gamma results expressed as activity concentrations with 2σ counting errors and decay-corrected values.
  - Transparent documentation of sampling, preparation, and analysis procedures to support data usability and comparability.
