# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Study setting
  - Located in a managed coniferous forestry plantation (~25 km2) in northwest England; main study area ~0.4 km2.
  - Vegetation: established conifers with grasses and sedges; wetter areas dominated by Molinia caerulea; some shrubs and small broadleaf trees.
  - Roe deer samples collected within ~2 km north/east of main site; previous use for estimating absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals.

- Sampling scope
  - All terrestrial RAP species sampled except Reference Frog and Duck.
  - Species selected to align with ICRP terrestrial RAP definitions; sampling covered adult life-stages where possible.

- Data collected and geolocation
  - GPS-recorded sampling locations for all sites.
  - For each specimen or sample, recorded fresh weight, dimensions and other relevant measurements prior to analysis.

- 1.2 Sample collection and preparation (by organism/type)
  - Bees (Bombus spp.)
    - August–September 2010; 30 pan traps at ground level or elevated on hummocks/stumps.
    - Traps filled with water + a drop of washing-up liquid; emptied every 2–4 days.
    - After sieving, bees pooled by collection day, then freeze-dried. Fresh weights and body dimensions measured for 20 individuals.
    - Species identified: Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis.
  - Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
    - August–September 2010; three composite samples (11–15 worms each) collected by digging.
    - Gut evacuation via distilled water; gut-evacuated worms weighed and measured (15 individuals).
  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
    - Three ~15-year-old self-seeded trees felled August 2010; samples from trunk heartwood, branches, needles, and immature cones.
    - Air-dried to ~40–59% dry weight by component; seeds retained.
  - Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
    - 10 males and 10 females trapped in September 2010 within 0.25 km2 area; Longworth traps along transects.
    - Baiting and handling protocol described; 3 trapping bouts over 8 days.
    - 20 mice weighed and measured; carcasses skinned with GI tracts removed; organs sampled (gonads, liver, hind-leg muscle/bone, spleen/kidney/liver composite).
    - Some carcasses used in Dermestes beetle colony to estimate total muscle and bone mass.
  - Purple moor grass (Molina caerulea)
    - Three samples collected August 2010; air-dried for analysis.
  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
    - Three females shot February 2011; ages varied (pregnant adults and a juvenile).
    - Live-weight recorded; carcasses processed to separate muscle, fat, bone; GI tract and internal organs weighed.
    - Muscle, bone, liver, ovaries weighed; beetle colony used to clean bone samples.
  - Soils
    - 41 topsoil samples (0–10 cm) collected from RAP sampling locations in Aug/Sep 2010.
    - Additional 3 soil samples near Roe deer shooting sites in Feb 2011; samples chosen where deer activity evident.
    - For Wood mice, soils sampled along trapping lines; all soils split for ICP-MS and gamma analysis.
    - Feb 2011: 25 fresh soil samples for pH measurement.
  - General note
    - Additional co-located sampling areas avoided duplicate sampling (bee area overlapped with grass area).

- 2 Sample analyses (analytical workflow)
  - All RAP samples and associated soils sent for stable element analysis by ICP-MS; subset also analyzed for carbon and nitrogen; larger mass samples analyzed for gamma-emitting radionuclides.
  - ICP-MS specifics
    - Conducted by Fera (UKAS-accredited).
    - Samples analyzed: three bees per collection date (whole), three sub-samples for purple moor grass, Sitka spruce (needles, branches, trunk heartwood), Sitka spruce cone and seeds; three samples for each tissue type in Wood mice and Roe deer; three freeze-dried earthworms; 12 soil samples (composites by RAP line).
    - Preparation minimised metal contamination; homogenization done with ceramic blades or manual crushing.
    - Digestion with nitric and hydrochloric acids in quartz high-pressure vessels; quantified 60 elements with Agilent ICP-MS (with collision cell).
    - QA: reagent blanks and CRM-spiked blanks for recovery; replicates for QA.
    - Data quality categories (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U, No CRM) based on CRM agreement.
  - Gamma analysis
    - Sub-samples homogenized; Sitka spruce trunk ashed; Roe deer muscle/liver diced; Wood mouse tissues insufficient in mass for gamma.
    - Measurements using hyper-pure germanium detectors; spectra analyzed with Canberra Apex-Gamma; activity concentrations decay-corrected to sampling day.
    - Replicates and blanks used for QA; UKAS-accredited methods SOP4504 and SOP4505.
  - Loss on ignition (LOI) and pH
    - LOI at 450°C for 4 h on all 41 soil samples.
    - pH measured in distilled water for 25 fresh soil samples.
  - Data outputs and records
    - For each sample: element concentrations (60 elements), potential C and N data, gamma activity concentrations, LOI, pH.
    - Documentation includes sample IDs, tissue type, sampling date/location, weights/dimensions, processing steps, QA results, and method references.

- Data governance and quality considerations for stewardship
  - Detailed metadata accompany samples (locations, dates, sample type, tissue, weights, and dimensions).
  - Use of standardized QA metrics (CRM-based QC categories) and documented replication strategies.
  - Clear delineation between composite vs. individual samples; explicit notes on exclusions (e.g., Reference Frog and Duck not sampled; any shrews released; Bank voles retained for possible analysis).
  - Methods and accreditation cited (UKAS-accredited ICP-MS and gamma analysis; specific SOPs and references) to support data trustworthiness.
  - Data handling implications
    - Enables reproducibility and re-use for exposure/dose assessments and cross-species comparisons.
    - Provides a framework for data archiving, discovery, and potential future analyses (e.g., updates to databases with new sample analyses or re-analyses).
