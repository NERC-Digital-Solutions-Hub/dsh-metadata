# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Site location and context
  - Managed coniferous forestry plantation in northwest England (~25 km^2; main study site ~0.4 km^2).
  - Habitat: established conifer plantation with grass/sedge understory; wetter areas dominated by Molinia caerulea (Purple moor grass); some shrubs and small broadleaf trees.
  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) sampled within forest at distances <2 km to the north and east of the main site.
  - Site previously used to estimate absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn and daughters (Beresford et al. 2012).

- Terrestrial RAPs and sampling scope
  - Adult life-stages sampled for most terrestrial Reference Animals and Plants (RAPs) defined by ICRP; exceptions: Reference Frog and Duck.
  - Bees, earthworms, Sitka spruce, wood mice, Purple moor grass, Roe deer, and soils were sampled to reflect RAPs’ transfer parameters.

- Sampling sites and timing
  - GPS-recorded sampling locations; August–September 2010 for most samples; February 2011 for some Roe deer and soil sampling near deer activity sites; mid-September 2010 for wood mice.

- Sample collection and preparation overview
  - All sample types collected from the main area (except roe deer, sampled slightly broader area).

- Bees (Bombus spp.)
  - 30 pan traps (21 cm diameter, white/fluorescent colors) deployed; placed near matching flower colors when possible.
  - Traps on ground or elevated on Molinia hummocks/dead stumps; emptied every 2–4 days.
  - Post-collection, bees were separated, bulked per collection day, and freeze-dried.
  - Fresh weights measured on 20 individuals (0.07–0.28 g); body dimensions recorded prior to freeze-drying.
  - Species identified: Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis.

- Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
  - Three composite samples (11–15 worms each) collected by digging Aug–Sept 2010.
  - Gut evacuation in distilled water; gutless worms weighed and measured (15 individuals per composite).
  - Fresh weight range: 0.13–1.90 g; dimensions recorded.

- Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
  - Three similar-aged (~15-year-old) self-seeded trees felled Aug 2010.
  - Samples taken from trunk, branches (up to 1 cm), needles, and immature cones from one tree.
  - Air-dried at ~20°C; moisture contents: needles/branches ~45% dry weight (DW), cones 40% DW, trunk 59% DW.
  - Heartwood sampled to avoid external contamination; immature seeds retained.

- Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
  - 10 males and 10 females trapped within 0.25 km^2 area; 100 Longworth traps along six transects.
  - Baiting, acclimation period, then trapping over 8 days across six sessions.
  - Mice weighed (live weight 12.9–27.5 g); measurements taken (body length 7–10 cm; width 1.8–2.9 cm; depth 1.5–2.5 cm); carcasses skinned and GI tracts removed.
  - Organs collected: liver, hind-leg muscle/bone, gonads (males/females), and a composite spleen/kidney/liver sample; frozen for analysis.
  - For total muscle and bone mass estimates, carcasses from three individuals were cleaned in a Dermestes beetle colony (muscle ~41–59% of live weight; bone 2–5%).

- Purple moor grass (Molina caerulea)
  - Three samples collected Aug 2010; air-dried at ~20°C for analysis.

- Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
  - Three females shot Feb 2011 within ~2 km of main site (two pregnant adults, one juvenile).
  - Recorded live weight (13–22 kg); skinning and removal of GI tract and internal organs; carcass halved to estimate total muscle (36–38% of live weight) and bone (7–8%).
  - Internal organs: liver 2–3% of live weight; ovaries 0.004–0.006%.
  - Bones cleaned with Dermestes beetle colony.

- Soils
  - 41 top-10 cm soil samples collected from RAP sampling locations (Aug–Sep 2010).
  - 3 additional samples near Roe deer sites (Feb 2011) near evidence of deer activity.
  - For analyses: soils split into sub-samples; LOI analysis on oven-dried samples; gamma analysis on 41 samples; some samples also dried at 20°C for ICP-MS.
  - Soil sampling also aligned with trapping lines for wood mice.

- Sub-sampling and general handling
  - Sub-samples prepared to minimize metal contamination (ceramic blades; crushing in bags or by hand).
  - Aliquots and certified reference materials used for ICP-MS QA; blanks and spikes included for recovery estimates.
  - Samples weighed and stored frozen prior to analyses where applicable.
