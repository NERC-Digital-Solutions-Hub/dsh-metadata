# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Study location and scope
  - Managed coniferous forestry plantation in northwest England (~25 km2 total; main study site ~0.4 km2).
  - Vegetation: established coniferous plantation with grass/sedge understory; wetter areas dominated by Purple moor grass (Molinia caerulea); some shrubs and small broadleaf trees.
  - Previous work estimated absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn and daughters at the site (Beresford et al. 2012).

- Sampling design and timeline
  - Adult life-stages sampled for terrestrial RAPs (Reference Frog and Duck excluded).
  - Sampling dates: bees, earthworms, Sitka spruce, wood mice in Aug–Sept 2010; Roe deer in Feb 2011; soil sampling Feb 2011 around deer activity; wood mice samples collected Sept 2010; Purple moor grass and Sitka spruce samples collected Aug 2010.
  - Roe deer shot within ~2 km north/east of the main site as part of forest wildlife control; three females sampled (pregnant adults and a juvenile).

- Sample collection and preparation (by organism)

  - Bees (Bombus spp.)
    - 30 pan traps (21 cm, white/yellow/blue) deployed near flowering plants.
    - Traps on ground surface or elevated on hummocks/stumps; emptied every 2–4 days.
    - Bees frozen; 20 individuals weighed (0.07–0.28 g) and measured; species: Bombus lucorum, B. terrestris, B. (Psithyrus) vestalis.

  - Earthworms (Lumbricidae)
    - Three composite samples (11–15 worms each) collected Aug–Sept 2010 by digging.
    - Gut evacuation prior to weighing/dimensions; 15 individuals weighed and measured (0.13–1.90 g; length 6.9–15.2 cm; width 0.1–0.4 cm; depth 0.1–0.5 cm).

  - Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis)
    - Three self-seeded trees (~15 years) felled Aug 2010.
    - Samples: trunk, branches (up to 1 cm), needles, immature cones from one tree.
    - Drying: needles/branches ~45% dry weight; cones ~40%; trunk ~59%.
    - Heartwood sampled to avoid external contamination.

  - Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus)
    - 10 male and 10 female mice trapped in 0.25 km2 area; 100 Longworth traps along six transects.
    - Baited with oats, carrot, insect pupae; bedding with grass hay.
    - Trapping over six sessions within 8 days; specimens weighed fresh (12.9–27.5 g), measured; carcasses skinned and GI tract removed.

    - Tissue processing
      - Carcass weighed (7.4–15.3 g FW); samples taken: liver (0.31–1.9 g FW), hind-leg muscle, hind-leg bone; spleen/kidney/liver composite.
      - To estimate total muscle/bone, three carcasses cleaned via Dermestes beetle colony.
      - Muscle mass ~41–59% of live weight; bone ~2–5% of live weight.

  - Purple moor grass (Molina caerulea)
    - Three samples collected Aug 2010; air-dried ~20°C for analysis.

  - Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus)
    - Three females shot Feb 2011 within ~2 km of main site.
    - Recording live weight (13–22 kg); skinning and removal of GI tract and internal organs.
    - Carcass halved; muscle, fat, and bone removed from one half to estimate total mass.
    - Bone cleaned with Dermestes beetle; total fresh muscle ~36–38% of live weight; bone 7–8%; liver 2–3%; ovaries 0.004–0.006%.

- Soils
  - 41 soil samples from top 10 cm (collected Aug–Sept 2010 at RAP replicate sites; also sampling from deer vicinity and trapping lines in Feb 2011/Sept 2010).
  - Additional 25 fresh soils collected Feb 2011 around deer activity.
  - Sub-sampling: one part dried at 20°C for ICP-MS; another dried at 60°C for gamma analysis; soils bulked for ICP-MS; all 41 samples analyzed individually for gamma-emitting radionuclides.
  - Soil sampling locations informed by RAPs and relative to bee/grass sampling areas; transect-based lines for wood mice.

- Analytical plan and methods

  - ICP-MS (stable elements)
    - Subsamples submitted for ICP-MS by Food and Environment Research Agency (UKAS-accredited).
    - Three bees analyzed whole; three air-dried sub-samples (Purple moor grass, Sitka spruce needles/branches/trunk; Sitka spruce cone and seeds analyzed separately); three samples each of male wood mouse hind-leg bone, hind-leg muscle, liver, and gonad; three roe deer tissues (hind-leg bone/muscle/liver) and ovaries.
    - Three freeze-dried earthworm samples; 12 air-dried soil samples.
    - Digestion: nitric/hydrochloric acid in quartz vessels with microwave heating.
    - Instrumentation: Agilent 7500ce ICP-MS with collision cell; blanks and CRM-based QA; replicate analyses for QA.
    - Data: 60 elements quantified; quality categories assigned (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U) based on CRM comparisons; CRM used for QA where available; elements without CRM categorized as qualitative.

  - Gamma analysis
    - Subsamples homogenized and prepared (Sitka spruce needles/branches; purple moor grass; oven-dried soils; roe deer muscle/liver; wood mouse tissues too small for analysis).
    - Samples weighed into appropriate containers and gamma analyzed using high-purity germanium detectors; spectra analyzed with Canberra Apex-Gamma software.
    - Activity concentrations decay-corrected to sampling day; replicates and process blanks included for QA.
    - UKAS-accredited method (SOP4504, SOP4505).

  - Loss on ignition (LOI) and pH
    - LOI at 450°C for 4 h (41 soil samples).
    - pH measured in distilled water for 25 fresh soil samples.

- Quality assurance and accreditation
  - Use of certified reference materials (CRMs) and blanks; replication for QA.
  - Methods accredited by UK Accreditation Service (UKAS) for gamma analysis (and ICP-MS QA via CRM comparisons).

- Data handling and purpose
  - Data collected using standardized, traceable methods across multiple taxonomic groups to support environmental monitoring of elemental and radionuclide transfer in an upland forest ecosystem.
  - Focus on comparability across samples and tissues, with clear documentation of sampling contexts and QA procedures to enable scrutiny and potential data sharing through appropriate portals.
