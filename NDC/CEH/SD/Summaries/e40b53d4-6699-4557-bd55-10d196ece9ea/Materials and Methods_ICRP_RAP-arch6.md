# 2.1 Site description and species sampled

- Study site: managed coniferous forestry plantation in northwest England (~25 km2); main study area ~0.4 km2; previous use for estimating absorbed dose rates to burrowing mammals from 222Rn and daughters.
- Sampling scope: adult life-stages of terrestrial RAP species sampled (except Reference Frog and Duck); includes representatives from ICRP-defined terrestrial RAP families; three Roe deer samples collected near the main site.
- Sampling locations and data captured: exact GPS coordinates recorded for all sites; samples collected August 2010–February 2011 with fresh weights, dimensions, and tissue-specific data recorded prior to analysis.
- Beeces (Bombus spp.): 30 pan traps (August–September 2010) near-flower colors; species identified as Bombus lucorum, Bombus terrestris, Bombus (Psithyrus) vestalis; traps emptied every 2–4 days; 20 individuals measured for fresh weight and body dimensions; samples freeze-dried.
- Earthworms (Lumbricidae): three composite samples (11–15 worms each) collected Aug–Sept 2010; gut evacuation prior to measurements; 15 individuals weighed and measured before freeze-drying.
- Sitka spruce (Picea sitchensis): three ~15-year-old trees felled Aug 2010; sampled trunk, branches, needles, and immature cones; air-dried to ~40–59% dry weight depending on tissue; heartwood sampled from trunk to avoid contamination.
- Wood mice (Apodemus sylvaticus): 20 individuals (10M, 10F) trapped mid-Sep 2010 in ~0.25 km2 area; Longworth traps along six transects; 3-day acclimation; biological data collected (live weight 12.9–27.5 g; body measurements); dissection included carcass, gonads, liver, hind-leg muscle/bone, and a composite spleen/kidney/liver sample; beetle cleaning used to estimate total muscle and bone.
- Purple moor grass (Molina caerulea): three samples Aug 2010; air-dried for analysis.
- Roe deer (Capreolus capreolus): three females shot Feb 2011 within ~2 km; live weight 13–22 kg; full carcass dissection with muscle, fat, bone, liver, and ovaries weighed; bone cleaned via beetle colony; muscle ~36–38% of live weight; bone 7–8%; liver 2–3%; ovaries 0.004–0.006%.
- Soils: 41 top-10 cm soil samples collected from RAP locations; February 2011 additional samples near deer and along wood mouse transects; samples split for ICP-MS (air-dried) and gamma analysis (oven-dried); pH measured from 25 fresh soils; multiple sampling contexts to support cross-species analyses.
- Data scope: samples included a range of tissue types and life-stages; multiple sampling dates and sites to support integrated exposure assessments.

# 2.2 Sample analyses

- ICP-MS (stable element analysis): conducted by FERA; 60 elements quantified after nitric/ hydrochloric acid digestion; additional C and N analyses on selected RAP samples; some large-mass samples analyzed for gamma-emitting radionuclides; careful contamination controls (ceramic blades, sealed bags, microwaving in closed vessels).
- Sample handling and QA: use of certified reference materials (CRMs) with blanks and spike recoveries; data quality categorized as Q±20, Q±40, QL, U, or No CRM when comparison not possible.
- Gamma analysis: sub-samples ground and homogenized; Sitka spruce needles/branches ashed; Roe deer muscle/liver diced; Wood mouse tissues insufficient for gamma analysis; measurement via hyper-pure germanium detectors with efficiency calibration; spectra analyzed to yield activity concentrations decayed to sampling day; replicates and blanks used for QA; method UKAS-accredited.
- LOI and pH: Loss on ignition measured at 450°C for soil samples; pH measured in distilled water for 25 fresh soil samples.

# 2.3 Data quality and provenance notes

- Quality assurance: cross-validation with CRM materials; replication of analyses; blanks and spike recoveries included in ICP-MS workflows; UKAS-accredited gamma methodology.
- Data categorization: explicit quality categories (Q±20, Q±40, QL, U, No CRM) to indicate reliability and comparability across elements.
- Data traceability: detailed sampling metadata (locations, dates, tissue types, weights, dimensions); methods described to enable reproducibility and data integration across RAP species and soil matrices.
- Data integration potential: structured outputs (element concentrations, tissue-specific data, gamma activity, LOI, pH) across multiple species and sampling contexts support cross-species exposure assessments and spatial analyses.

# Data products and use-cases for a Data Support perspective

- Potential data products:
  - Element concentration tables by species, tissue, and sampling date (ICP-MS results with QA flags).
  - Gamma activity concentration tables by tissue and sample type (with decay-corrected values).
  - LOI and pH datasets for soils to support soil chemistry and bioavailability interpretations.
  - Metadata repository capturing sampling locations (GPS), dates, tissue types, weights, and preparation steps.
- Analytical pipelines:
  - Data-cleaning workflows to apply QA categories (e.g., flag unreliable elements) and unit harmonization across datasets.
  - Cross-tabulated dashboards linking organism, tissue, and element or radionuclide concentration to support risk assessment and data exploration.
- Challenges and data-management considerations:
  - Heterogeneous data formats and multi-taxa sampling require clear metadata standards and consistent labeling.
  - Small sample sizes for some tissue types necessitate careful interpretation and potential aggregation.
  - Integration of field, preparation, and analytical metadata is essential for reproducibility and end-user self-service dashboards.
