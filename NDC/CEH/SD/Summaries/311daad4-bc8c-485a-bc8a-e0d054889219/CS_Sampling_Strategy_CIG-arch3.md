# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) 2007, building on 30 years of development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Emphasizes linking sampling design to detecting change in environmental habitats across Great Britain to inform policy and decision-making.

- Core concepts: ITE Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Land Classification: a stratified system grouping land into discrete classes by environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to ensure representative sampling.
  - Stratified sampling: combines random sampling with stratification to avoid bias and improve precision across heterogeneous land types.
  - Evolution of classification: started with 32 classes (1978), expanded and refined across surveys to 40–45+ classes to enable country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and Wales-only/Scotland-only outputs.
  - Survey units: field samples collected as 1 km squares; initial strategy used centre squares of a 15 × 15 km grid; additional surrounding squares classified to extend context.

- Timeline of sampling frameworks and key changes
  - 1978 (CS1978): First GB ecological survey using 32 ITE Land Classes; centre squares (1228) classified; eight samples per class selected from classified squares (256 total); aims to estimate national habitat areas by class proportions.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Land use survey; sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All Squares Land Classification; extends classification to cover every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed; addition of Land Cover Map linked to the programme; comprehensive data collection across both ecological and land-use features.
  - 1998/CS2000 planning: Recognition that regional and local estimates require finer representation; exploration of a new classification to better support regional estimates; separate country estimates contemplated.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Major revisions to support separate country units (England with Wales; Scotland); land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; total strata expanded to 40; added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation; introduced an upland habitat module; Wales and other country-specific adjustments to sampling planned (including replacing Isle of Man samples for country-unit reporting).
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting needs drive further Welsh-specific adjustments; five new Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure adequate representation; some English classes operate with lower per-class sampling (e.g., 4 squares in two classes) with acceptable precision noted; overall England-Wales-Scotland sampling map updated accordingly.
  - Wales and uplands focus: CS2000 upland module added 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands of England and Wales to improve country-based upland habitat estimates.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling distribution
  - England, Scotland, Wales: sampling framework adjusted to support country-level estimates; class subdivisions and aggregations implemented to ensure adequate representation within each country unit.
  - Wales-focused adjustments: Welsh-specific classes and increased Welsh sampling to meet reporting needs; 64 Welsh squares existed in CS2000; Welsh allocation expanded in CS2007 to 107 squares.
  - England adjustments: in CS2007, some English classes retained with 4 squares due to Wales absorbing more representation, with overall precision deemed acceptable.

- Outputs and estimation approach
  - National estimates derived by combining mean habitat area per square within each Land Class with the geographic area of that class.
  - Changes in classification across surveys can affect cross-survey comparability; the 2006 scoping study notes potential inconsistencies, recommending preference for the latest country-specific classification for recent estimates while acknowledging the impact on cross-survey consistency.
  - Tables and figures document the number of squares per class and per country unit, as well as sampling rates, to facilitate transparency and reproducibility.

- Upland module and additional enhancements
  - CS2000 upland habitat module improves statistical accuracy for upland estimates in England and Wales.
  - Wales-only revelations and Wales-specific sub-classes in CS2007 reflect policy and regulatory requirements following devolution.

- Summary of sample scale and coverage
  - CS1978: 256 sample squares (8 per class across 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 samples (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares classified; introduced all-squares Land Classification.
  - CS2000: substantial expansion to enable country-unit estimates; 569 total GB sample squares across periods; upland module added; broader country-unit stratification.
  - CS2007: 591 total GB sample squares; 45 strata; Wales sub-classifications and expanded Welsh sampling; emphasis on Wales-only outputs and improved representation for Welsh habitat status information.
