# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Longitudinal land-use study to update land-use databases and support modelling of ecological systems.
  - builds on earlier GB surveys (1977/8 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System.
  - 1990 resurvey aims to capture land cover, landscape changes, and vegetation data with enhanced detail and collaboration.
  - Incorporates a two-tier approach linking bottom-up field data with satellite imagery for land-cover mapping and projection.

- Data strategy and management
  - Emphasis on standardised, high-quality field recording to ensure comparability across observers and years.
  - Use of a Field Handbook and accompanying definitions to guide data capture and ensure consistency.
  - Data captured on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) aligned with 1:10,000 mapping; includes codes, metadata, and notes.
  - Clear emphasis on data discoverability, metadata, format, quality, and update cycles; priority on repeatable procedures and documentation.
  - Ownership and contact information collected for permissions and stakeholder engagement; farmer/landowner sheets accompany the data collection.

- Planning and sampling design
  - Sample squares divided into six groups; six ITE Research Stations coordinate across about 85 squares each.
  - Each square expected to take around three survey days; flexible scheduling to optimise travel and work patterns.
  - Costing based on day travel (no overnight subsistence initially); travel optimization to minimise revisits.
  - Total of 512 squares targeted for 1990, with a stratified approach to ensure coverage of different land-cover types.
  - Relocation and adaptations allowed if land use changes; guidelines specify when to replace or adjust sampling.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood and local ITE stations includes FABs, aerial photos, 1:10,000 maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear, and field ID.
  - Surveyors provide personal gear; stations supply locational aids and reference materials.
  - Emphasis on durable marking and documentation to enable future relocation and repeat sampling.

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions needed to access all parts of the square; engagement with farmers/landowners is key to success and data quality.
  - Introduction letters and farmowner information sheets provided; coordinators may contact landowners directly.
  - Clear procedures for handling denied permissions, including abandoning a square or relocating partially accessible areas.
  - Documentation of ownership and contact information to facilitate cooperation and future visits.

- Data recording: FAB framework and coding
  - Countryside Survey 1990 comprises mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling; final element covers sampling.
  - FABs combine data recording forms with 6" maps; codes are primary (bold) and secondary; alpha codes compress complex information.
  - Codes are used in a logical order (e.g., dominant cover codes precede others) to maintain consistency.
  - Boundary and ownership information are codified; “no longer present” boundaries coded with 999.
  - Field decisions are to be made on-site; field notes may accompany qualifying comments.
  - Entire square surveyed; even small corners must be coded.

- Mapping, API, and data entry
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) supports feature identification not on OS maps; used as guidance but ground truth prevails.
  - FABs and 1:10,000 maps compiled into a Field Assessment Booklet; neatness and interpretability are essential for later analysis.
  - Standard LOC (location) entries, ownership pages, and farmer information sheets accompany the FABs.
  - Distinct color/section coding for curtilages, boundaries, and built features to support urban-rural delineation and data discoverability.

- Vegetation sampling and taxonomy
  - Ground vegetation sampled using two sizes of plots: large 200 m2 quadrats and smaller 4 m2 quadrats; nested sampling to capture mosaic composition.
  - Five large quadrats per square plus five small quadrats in natural/semi-natural land covers; linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) also sampled.
  - Field recording of up to 200 common plant species (plus bryophytes/lichens) with a focus on dominant species and 5% cover thresholds.
  - Standardized species lists with accepted combinations when species-level ID is difficult; unlisted species recorded separately.
  - Color-coded and coded data entry to manage mosaics, dominance, cover, height (where relevant), and age of woodland.

- Plot types, layout, and relocation rules
  - Large quadrats (200 m2) with nested 4 m2 quadrats; five small quadrats placed in diverse land-cover types; placement aims to minimize bias toward any microhabitat.
  - Permanent marking with metal plates; relocation protocols when sites change due to land-use transformation.
  - Linear plots (boundary plots, hedgerow plots, streamside plots, roadside plots) placed near quadrats with clear distance and orientation rules; 1 m width sampling bands specified.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots retained to ensure consistency with prior surveys; documentation on when to relocate or replace plots.

- Species identification guidelines and sample handling
  - Detailed species identification guidelines emphasizing consistency with earlier surveys; acceptable species-combinations defined for difficult taxa.
  - Bryophyte and lichen recording with a restricted list; pressed specimens collected for uncertain IDs.
  - All vascular plants recorded; 5% cover category estimates provided; unlisted species captured in a separate table.

- Freshwater sampling and photography
  - Two freshwater biota sampling streams per square: IFE (freshwater biota) and NELUP (Newcastle University-led); emphasis on water beetle sampling for NELUP.
  - Freshwater samples collected from standing and flowing waters representing square-level habitat diversity (lakes/lochs, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.); precise labeling and secure transport to Merlewood.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and key landmarks; plot numbers clearly displayed on a board at the plot edge.
  - End-of-day data review recommended; data should be transcribed to fresh maps only if necessary due to damage; FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.

- Endnotes and contacts
  - Documentation includes references to Merlewood research station and contact details for continued access to background information and plan updates.
  - Colin Barr is noted as the author/editor for the revised 1991 version, with emphasis on standardisation and quality control across surveys.
