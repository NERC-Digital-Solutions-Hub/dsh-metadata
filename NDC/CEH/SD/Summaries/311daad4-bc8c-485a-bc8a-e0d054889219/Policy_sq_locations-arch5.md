# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope
  - Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
  - All other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH (as part of NERC), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, and SNH.

- Rationale for confidentiality
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Preserve scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ability to secure future landowner permissions.
  - Confidentiality is deemed in the public interest; requests are handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Access and release levels
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square containing each CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references: released only in very exceptional circumstances; external requests must show that accompanying IP/data require equal or higher confidentiality; CEH can perform pre-processing to avoid direct release where possible.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps): released under the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases when necessary.
  - Any release must respect confidentiality and prevent identification of precise square locations.

- License conditions and terms
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate, project-specific needs.
  - Licences are finite in duration and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational purposes after the licence ends.
  - End of licence: organisations must confirm destruction of data and that confidentiality was maintained.
  - No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could reveal square locations; never use data to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria.
  - Licences include clauses preventing attempts to deduce precise locations from the data.

- Roles and responsibilities
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and CS partners, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data; licences must be signed by a senior authorised official of the licensee.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows the relevant Act and Regulations to support the decision.
  - CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications for access and the decision grounds.
  - For internal CS partnership use, CEH aims to provide preprocessing support within a reasonable timeframe; requests from other organisations are handled case by case.
  - Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific guidance and support, potentially as a collaboration or paid service, negotiated case by case.

- Practical guidance for Data Stewards
  - Align data governance practices with confidentiality and licensing requirements.
  - Maintain records of all access requests, licensing terms, and destruction confirmations.
  - Coordinate with CEH early in any proposal involving CS location data to determine feasibility and required safeguards.
  - Ensure that outputs do not enable location identification beyond what is legally released (e.g., aggregate or licenced four-digit references only).
  - Prepare and preserve documentation demonstrating compliance with JCOP or equivalent project management standards when needed.
