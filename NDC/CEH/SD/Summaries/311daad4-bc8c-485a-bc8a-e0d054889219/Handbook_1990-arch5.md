COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Large-scale rural environment monitoring project to update land cover, vegetation, and landscape data.
- Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/8 and 1984) using the ITE Land Classification System.
- Aims to provide current, comparable datasets for scientific evaluation, change detection, and model development.
- Emphasizes standardized field recording, quality control, and clear data provenance for reuse.

## Project Organization and Scope
- Teams: Six ITE Research Station teams, surveying a total of 512 squares; each team ~85 squares.
- Survey design: Combination of mapping, quadrat-based vegetation recording, and sampling; includes both old and new plots to enable change detection.
- Timeframe and outputs: Planning and execution with data going to Merlewood and ITE stations; accompanying handbooks and definitions to support consistency.

## Data Governance and Access
- Permissions: Formal landowner access required for all parts of each square; prior contact or letters used to smooth permissions; refusals trigger predefined procedures (replacement squares or partial sampling).
- Ownership and contact data: Ownership information collected and coded; ongoing update process for landowner details.
- Data quality and consistency: Emphasis on standardizing field recording across observers; quality control implemented during the 1990 survey; permanent markers and documentation to enable future resurvey and comparability.

## Data Collection Protocols
- Equipment: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 aerial photographs, large-format maps, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, measuring tapes, field identity cards, and sampling kits.
- Data streams: FABs and maps form the core data capture; vegetation plots and sampling results are later consolidated and transported to ITE Merlewood for processing.
- Documentation: A Field Handbook defines procedures; accompanying definitions aid interpretation of data items; field qualifications and comments encouraged where categories are doubtful.

## Data Recording Standards and Coding System
- FAB structure: Central for mapping, quadrat recording, and sampling; supports two-tier coding (primary and secondary codes) to describe land cover, vegetation, and features.
- Coding conventions:
  - Use alpha codes to condense multiple numeric codes (e.g., boundary types, hedge details).
  - All features must have at least one primary code; when multiple primary codes are needed, dominant use code is recorded first.
  - Codes arranged to reflect logical data relationships (e.g., cover codes linked to species codes).
  - Uppercase alpha codes; avoid ambiguous characters (X, 0, I/1 confusion).
- Data items covered:
  - Ownership and farmer information (landowner/tenant status, contact details, cooperation rating).
  - Physiography, inland water, and coastal features.
  - Ground cover and vegetation types, including 200+ species lists with codified occurrences; emphasis on dominant and coding of mosaics.
  - Trees/woodland, hedgerows, boundaries, fences, walls, verges, roads and tracks, buildings and curtilages.
  - Management-related uses, age, canopy, and condition indicators for woodland.
  - Universal codes for non-vegetated features and designations.
- 6.2.1 General and 6.2.2 Method of recording vegetation:
  - Standardized vegetation plots and nested quadrats; a single, standardized recording sheet (with an embedded nested quadrat approach) to capture species, cover, and structural data.
  - Temporary and permanent plot markers; permanent metal plates used to facilitate relocation in future surveys.
  - Detailed protocols for locating and re-locating plots, including boundary and hedgerow relocation rules.
- Plot types and data capture:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m2 with nested 4 m2 and smaller quadrats for detailed recording.
  - Small quadrats: 2 m x 2 m in natural/semi-natural habitats.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 per square for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; strict rules prevent overlap and mandate spacing.
  - Boundary, stream, and verge plots: laid out along dominant vertical features; permanent markers placed at defined ends.
- Species and bryophyte/lichen data:
  - Extensive, predefined species lists with preferred combinations when exact identifications are difficult; supports consistent cross-site comparison.
  - Bryophytes and lichens recorded from specified lists only.
- Data handling of complex vegetation:
  - When area mosaics prevent clear single-code assignment, dominant cover codes guide the primary coding; secondary codes capture additional components.
  - Datasets include proportionate cover (5% intervals) and height categories for bracken and heather when applicable.

## Plot Design, Location, and Relocation
- Quadrat layout:
  - Large quadrats: 200 m2, with positions set at random; relocation guided by land use changes and map-based boundaries.
  - Small quadrats: five per square in distinct land-cover types; selection based on land-cover mapping results and randomization if types exceed five.
- Permanent marking:
  - Metal plates placed near quadrat corners for relocation; alternative marking via field boundaries or local features when necessary.
  - Sketches on FAB backs show plot positions and distances; photographs captured for reference.
- Linear plots (hedges, streams, roadsides):
  - 1 m wide sampling strips, positioned relative to the dominant feature; plots marked with plates at ends; coordination with boundary plots to minimize overlap.
  - 1978 rules for locating linear plots summarized and updated for 1990; documentation on relocating to alternate hedge/ditch positions if necessary.
- Relocation and replacement:
  - 1978 squares: original plot positions relocated as closely as possible; if hedgerow is gone, map updates indicate replacement locations.
  - New or changed land use: relocation guided by closest boundary type and nearest suitable habitat; if not possible, alternative sampling locations are documented.

## Freshwater Sampling and Photography
- Freshwater biota sampling:
  - Two freshwater samples per square: flowing waters (IFE) and standing waters (NELUP); procedures for flowing waters documented in a separate handbook.
  - Standing water sampling prioritizes vegetated features; time-limited sampling with formalin-preserved biota in labeled bottles.
- Photography:
  - All vegetation plots photographed to capture general appearance and landmark references; plot numbers displayed on a board at plot edges for clarity.

## Data Management, QA, and Post-Survey Procedures
- Data integrity:
  - End-of-day reviews of FABs and maps recommended; data should not be transposed later unless critical (e.g., map damage).
  - Permanent markers and detailed sketches enable precise future relocalization; all data and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.
- Post-survey procedures:
  - Procedures for equipment return, sample handling, and data transcription to ensure traceability and reproducibility.
