# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Aim and context
  - Large-scale land-use monitoring to update databases, support land management and ecological modelling.
  - Builds on ITE’s 1977/8 and 1984 GB surveys; 1990 resurvey with enhanced ground-truthing and integration of satellite imagery and bottom-up field data.
  - Emphasizes standardised, comparable data through a Field Handbook to minimise observer variation and improve statistical quality; data intended to be discoverable with metadata.

- Study design and data goals
  - National sampling across 512 squares (with 128 new sites; 128 previously unrecorded); six ITE Research Stations organize teams to cover grouped sample squares.
  - Two-tier approach linking aerial/remote sensing with ground surveys to produce a Britain-wide land-cover map and ground-truth data.
  - Longitudinal objective: detect changes in land cover, landscape features, and vegetation composition; support trend analysis and ecological modelling.

- Data collection framework and components
  - Core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (plus freshwater biota sampling via IFE/NELUP programs).
  - Field data captured in Field Assessment Books (FABs), with associated aerial photographs and maps; all field data linked to persistent markers and provenance metadata.
  - Permanent markers and relocation procedures to ensure repeatability across survey years.

- Equipment and field tools
  - FABs, 1:10,000 aerial photographs, large and small-scale vegetation maps, field handouts, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, markers, measuring tapes, camera, first-aid, and personal gear.
  - Local station support with additional maps, reference books, and field supplies; standardized gear to ensure consistent data collection.

- Planning, logistics, and permissions
  - Surveys organised by six regional stations; flexible daily/weekly planning to minimise travel and avoid overtime; travel time treated as a cost-efficiency factor.
  - Systematic permission processes to gain access to all land parts; interaction with landowners/farmers to obtain cooperation and background context; predefined procedures if permission is refused (replacement squares or partial surveying).

- Data recording and coding (FAB and maps)
  - 6.1 Mapping: annotate enlarged 6" maps (1:10,000) with data using primary and secondary codes; combinations of data codes used to describe features; emphasis on logical coding order (e.g., a boundary followed by its attributes).
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API): restricted interpretation to aid feature identification and boundary delineation; lines and crosses indicate boundaries and isolated features; conflicts with ground truth resolved on-site.
  - 6.1.2 Filling in the FAB: standardized field booklet per square; ensure consistent series numbering, neat handwriting, and clear delineation of homogeneous units; use 5% cover categories for species; include sketches, measurements, and photos; collect and record unidentified species for later lab work.
  - 6.2 Vegetation sampling: standard vegetative plot protocol with nested quadrats and a catalog of up to ~200 common species; detailed field to lab workflow for species codes, dominance, cover, and height; includes bryophytes and lichens lists.
  - Plot types (6.2.3): two sizes of quadrats (large 200 m2 with nested 4 m2 units; five 2 m x 2 m small quadrats in natural/semi-natural land); multiple linear plots (boundary, hedgerow, streamsides, roadsides) to capture linear features; specific relocation rules for 1978-era plots; permanent marking with metal plates for relocatability.
  - 6.2.4 Rules for locating linear plots (hedgerows, streams, roadsides) with emphasis on non-overlap, appropriate spacing (typically 10 m from related features), and clear documentation of plot edges.
  - 6.2.5 Species identification guidelines: standardized approach allowing certain species combinations when close identification is challenging; extensive lists for crops, grasses, forbs, and bryophytes/lichens; emphasis on repeatable identifications and documentation of unlisted species.

- Sampling and biota
  - 7 Sampling: two freshwater biota samples per square (IFE flowing-water biota and NELUP standing water biota), using standardized sieving and preservation methods; field labeling and prompt transport to Merlewood for analysis; description of potential freshwater habitat types to target (lakes, ponds, streams, flushes, bogs, etc.).

- Photography and data integrity
  - 8 Photography: take photos of each vegetation plot to document appearance and key landmarks; plot number clearly displayed in photos for traceability.

- Data quality, governance, and outputs
  - Quality assurance embedded through standardised field handbook, observer training, and multiple QA checks in the field; emphasis on consistent data recording and error minimisation.
  - Outputs include coded FAB records, mapped data, aerial interpretation cues, and standardized vegetation and boundary datasets; data intended for sharing via portals with metadata for discoverability and reuse.

- Subsequent survey operations and data handling
  - End-of-day data review to avoid omissions; avoidance of post-hoc transposition unless data or maps are damaged; rapid return of FABs and samples to ITE stations for processing and integration.

- Challenges and considerations for analysts
  - Scale and accessibility issues: data gaps at local levels; historical data dispersed across journals, reports, and local datasets; standardisation across observers and datasets is critical.
  - Data integration: linking field-derived codes with aerial/API data and satellite-derived land cover to build a coherent, queryable dataset with clear provenance.
  - IT and workflow barriers: linking large field datasets, plots, and biota data; ensuring robust metadata and data discoverability for reuse in analyses and modelling.
