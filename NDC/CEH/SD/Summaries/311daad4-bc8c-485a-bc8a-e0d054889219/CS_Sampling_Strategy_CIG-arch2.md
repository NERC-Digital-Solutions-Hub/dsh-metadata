# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Document the sampling strategy used for Countryside Survey field surveys (up to 2007) and explain how the ITE Land Classification evolved to support consistent, time-series environmental monitoring across Great Britain.
- Core idea: Use a stratified, random sampling framework based on an environmental land classification to ensure representative coverage and enable national and country-level estimates of habitat and land-use features.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification (ITE-LC)

- Origin: 32 ITE Land Classes created in the mid-1970s from environmental attributes to stratify GB land for ecological surveys.
- 1978 (CS1978): Basis for the first national survey; classification fed a 1 km square sampling framework.
- 1984 (CS1984): Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); focus shifted toward land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 (CS1990): All GB 1 km squares classified; introduced Land Cover mapping via satellite data; urban/sea corrections included; 508 squares surveyed; partial revision of the LC to accommodate full GB coverage.
- 1998 (CS1990 → CS1998 update): LC expanded to 40 classes to improve regional estimates; groundwork for Scotland-only reporting.
- 2000 (CS2000): LC refined to permit separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); 40 strata retained but subdivided; additional squares allocated to rebalance representation; upland habitats targeted with an extra module.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting formalized; LC subdivided into country-unit versions (five new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; Wales received additional squares to ensure six observations per new Welsh class; England adjustments made to maintain overall balance.

## Sampling Framework and Methodology

- Stratified sampling rationale: Stratification reduces bias and improves precision by ensuring all parts of the landscape variety are represented (analogous to demographic stratification in surveys).
- Core sampling unit: 1 km square; centres used for initial classification in early surveys, with surrounding squares later assigned to classes as appropriate.
- Field survey approach: Field data collected within a single field season; harmonized across surveys to enable time-series analysis.
- National estimates: Calculated by combining mean habitat area per class with the total area of each land class; changes in LC affect comparability and require careful handling for national estimates.

## Key Surveys and Changes (Schematic)

- CS1978: 256 squares sampled (eight per Land Class); 6039 classified squares used to estimate class areas.
- CS1984: 384 squares surveyed (12 per class); continued use of 1978 LC for national estimates.
- CS1990: All-squares LC (updated to cover all GB squares); 508 squares surveyed; integration of Land Cover Map data.
- CS2000: Expanded to support Scotland and England/Wales separate reporting; LC expanded to 40 classes; 19 additional squares allocated to new classes; new upland habitat sampling module introduced.
- CS2007: Scotland/Wales/England country reporting refined; Wales-specific LC sub-divisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 43 Welsh additional squares; overall GB total squares around the mid-500s; five new Welsh country-unit classes increased the stratification to 45.

## Country Reporting and Wales/Uplands

- Separate country estimates: Introduced to better align with devolved policymaking; England with Wales and Scotland reported separately.
- Wales emphasis: Welsh-only reporting prompted by devolution; Welsh sampling increased and Welsh LC sub-divided to improve Wales-specific estimates.
- Isle of Man: Two prior squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with two English squares to maintain country-unit integrity.

## Uplands Module

- Additional module for CS2000: 30 squares placed in upland and marginal upland LC areas in England and Wales.
- Goal: Improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates within country-based reporting.

## Outputs, Data and Monitoring Implications

- Outputs: The framework enables generation of time-series datasets, maps, and charts that track environmental health and policy performance.
- Data handling: Emphasizes consistent data collection, classification, and storage to support long-term monitoring and comparability across survey waves.
- Policy relevance: Country-specific reporting supports national and regional environmental policy and legislation, while the standardized LC framework underpins monitoring of habitat change over time.

## Data Management and Access

- Dataset integrity: Ongoing refinement of classification and sampling requires documentation to preserve comparability across survey years.
- Access considerations: Wales and England/Wales, and Scotland require distinct reporting outputs, with careful treatment of class definitions and aligned sampling efforts.
