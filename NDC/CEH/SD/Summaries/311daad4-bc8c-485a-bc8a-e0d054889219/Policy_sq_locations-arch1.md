# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy aims to maximize public-interest use of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. It applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential

- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for long-term survey integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.
- Disclosure could compromise future surveys and the CS’s ability to inform environmental policy.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision)

- Approval can reveal approximate locations to show whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10x10 km grid squares) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are allowed only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations, and external release requires evidence that the external data carries equal/higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data from within squares (e.g., habitat maps) are treated as capable of revealing square locations and follow the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release

- Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and accessible only to approved individuals for the project.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must be destroyed at licence end, with written confirmation.
- No data may be shared with third parties that could expose square locations; data must not be used to plan visits or to monitor individual landowners.
- If requested, licensees must show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; both prohibit attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and process

- CEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases using the policy principles.
- CEH issues hard-copy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with clauses reflecting policy terms, signed by authorized representatives.
- If an application is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners on licence applications and decisions.
- CEH aims to support internal processing needs within CS partnership in a timely manner; requests from other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential users consult CEH before committing to use CS location data, which may involve collaborative or paid support to define requirements and ensure appropriate use.
