# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview
- QA study of the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify accuracy and sources of error in field recording, compare with earlier and later efforts, and propose methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Two QA phases: Autumn 1990 (21 survey squares; sketch-map relocation) and Summer 1991 (28 squares; use of photographs; similar plot types).
- Covered six plot types (X plots, Y plots, roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries) across landclasses; included plate relocation and repeat surveys at predetermined points.

## Aims and scope
- Quantify accuracy of field recording and change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording due to observer error, season, plot location, information type, and regional factors.
- Relate conclusions to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics in future surveys.

## Methods
- Autumn 1990 QA: two independent assessors evaluated 21 squares using original sketch maps for plot relocation; one quarter of each square resurveyed; six plot types defined; included plate relocation exercise.
- Summer 1991 QA: assessors used photographs; expanded to 28 squares; each 1 km square visited within 14 days of original survey date; included self-assessment subset of squares.
- Plot relocation: assessed ability to relocate buried plates and plots using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors; three relocation outcomes: plate located (i), plate located but plot not satisfactorily relocated (ii), plate not found with insufficient information (iii).
- Data comparisons: multiple concordance measures for species lists (percentage agreement, agreement, and % accuracy), and timing/drought/season effects; DECORANA used to analyze shifts in vegetation gradients; land-use and boundary coding compared across time.

## Key findings: accuracy and observer error
- Species recording reliability:
  - Overall concordance (across plots and years): about 60.9% (Table 4); earlier autumn-phase analysis suggested around 45–47% depending on method.
  - Initial recording efficiency for 1990 survey averaged about 74% (seasonal and plot-location corrections considered).
  - In 1991 QA, there was a significant increase in mean species per plot (1990: 20.7; 1991: 23.4); this increase largely reflects real changes in species rather than recording efficiency (estimated ~73% of the difference due to real change, ~27% due to improved recording efficiency).
- Seasonal and annual effects:
  - The 1990 drought appears to have depressed recording efficiency and biased species presence in the autumn QA; 1991 had a more normal growing season, revealing differences in species frequency and richness.
  - Annual variation is notable, especially for annuals and ephemeral species; caution advised when comparing across landuses or across years.
- Plot relocation and plot types:
  - X plots (grid-based plots) were easier to relocate; roadverges and hedges relatively straightforward; Y plots (small 4 m2) were the most challenging to relocate accurately.
  - Use of photographs markedly improved relocation accuracy; metal plates aided relocation in enclosed land but were time-consuming in unenclosed uplands (about 30 minutes per plot).
- Vegetation cover estimates:
  - Comparisons of cover values for dominant species between the two survey times show few strong differences, but some species exhibited significant changes (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica, Trifolium repens, Poa trivialis, etc.).
  - Broadly, many cover differences are attributable to seasonal/annual change or mis-location rather than true ecological change.
- Species-group performance:
  - Across plot types, few species groups showed significant changes in cumulative frequency between 1990 and 1991.
  - Some apparent species-frequency changes likely reflect climatic differences (e.g., drought-year effects) rather than recording error.
- Mapping land use and boundaries:
  - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable (roughly 88–95% concordance); boundary coding also robust but slightly lower due to re-survey consistency and assessor interpretation.
  - Problems mostly with certain less-common codes (e.g., upland grassland, moorland, marsh) and with the interpretation of boundary and forb-cover codes.
  - A three-level coding structure (primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and qualifiers) performed well in practice, but recommendations targeted simplification and clearer definitions.
- Mapping of species cover at nine-point grid:
  - Concordance for dominant species around 81%; co-dominants dropped to about 34%; exact matches of three co-dominants are rare (≈5%).
  - Recommendation: map only the two most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.

## Data quality metrics and interpretation
- Percentage agreement (for species lists) around 60.9% overall; higher when considering dominant/common species across years.
- Change in axis scores (DECORANA) showed general consistency with long-term vegetation gradients, though some plot types showed substantial shifts in axis scores due to crop changes, plot relocation issues, or differences in cover assignments.
- Landclass analysis indicated significant differences in axis scores between uplands and lowlands, reflecting distinct vegetation and management regimes.

## Conclusions and implications for future surveys
- Photographs are a highly valuable relocation aid, particularly in unenclosed land; sketches and photos together improve plot relocation.
- Seasonal alignment is critical; QA should be conducted in the same year as the original survey and within similar seasons to minimize climatic and phenological differences.
- Y plots are particularly challenging; improvements in ground positioning techniques (and possibly additional manpower) are recommended.
- Bryophyte and lichen indicators require targeted training and expansion of species lists, especially for vegetation classifications that rely on bryophytes in wetland communities.
- Land-use mapping should move toward fewer primary categories with clearer dichotomous options to improve reproducibility; increase use of simple, unambiguous codes for major land-use types; reduce reliance on detailed cover coding where not essential for analysis.
- Recommendation 12 (land-use mapping): Record only the two most prevalent species when mapping land-use parcels to improve reproducibility.
- Additional recommendations include: subdivide upland grassland codes for improved differentiation; recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type; refine boundary code usage to minimize confusion; improve forb-cover coding definitions; and encourage clearer annotation and documentation of plot location features for future QA.

## Recommendations (summary)
- Record lichens and provide training/development materials.
- Conduct QA as close in time as practical to the original survey; align seasonality.
- Require annotating photographs with plot-relating features and distances to landmarks.
- Use metal marker plates for X plots where feasible; allocate extra manpower in challenging areas.
- Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with survey tape; orient sides (N-S) and place at SE corner.
- Emphasize the value of photographs and sketches to re-establish precise locations.
- Expand bryophyte-related training and consider additional allowable bryophyte species in classifications.
- Expand and clarify land-use coding; increase primary codes and provide simple dichotomous keys; reduce emphasis on cover-only codes.
- Treat marsh/wetland as a distinct category; refine upland classifications (e.g., upland grassland subdivisions).
- Limit primary boundary codes and use qualifying codes to describe composition; improve handling of hedge details and forb-cover codes.
- Record only the two most prevalent species for land-use mapping to enhance reproducibility.
- Improve mapping of species cover with a focus on dominant species at each point; acknowledge limitations when multiple co-dominants occur.
