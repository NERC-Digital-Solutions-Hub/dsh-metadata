COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and context
  - Develop environmental health measures to scrutinise policies, monitor changes in the countryside, and inform future decision-making.
  - ITE’s Countryside Survey lineage: 1977/78 and 1984 national surveys, followed by 1988 data collection; aims to provide current datasets for ecological evaluation and trend analysis.
  - 1990 resurvey designed to be two-tier: ground-truth field data linked to satellite imagery and a land cover map of Britain, enabling bottom-up and top-down integration; emphasis on data quality, openness, and clear presentation.

- Survey design and planning
  - Sample frame: 512 squares globally distributed, grouped into six teams/stations; about 85 squares per group.
  - Time and logistics: each square planned for roughly three survey days; flexible scheduling; prioritises travel efficiency and avoids unnecessary return visits; cost-conscious travel arrangements (no mandatory overtime; time off in lieu if needed).
  - Sampling approach: updated land cover and vegetation data across years; additional habitat types and land cover categories considered to capture variation and change.

- Equipment and field materials
  - Field Assessment Books (FABs) and associated field tools provided by Merlewood; maps, aerial photographs, project explanations, weatherproof recording gear; local ITE stations provide location maps and basic supplies; surveyors supply personal gear and optional equipment.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) used to identify features not on OS maps (e.g., isolated trees) and to mark boundaries; API is advisory and field judgment remains primary.

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions to access land are essential for full-square coverage; early contact with farmers/landowners; background information gathered via owner interviews and ownership records.
  - Procedures for refusals: abandonment of the square or partial surveying depending on scope; emphasis on minimizing wasted work and maintaining good relations.

- Data recording, coding, and mapping (FAB)
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; data from all elements combined to form a comprehensive dataset; outputs include reports, charts, and maps.
  - Coding system: combination of primary (bold on code lists) and secondary codes; alpha-numeric coding enables compact, rich field records; codes should be applied in a logical order (e.g., a habitat code followed by related descriptors).
  - Boundaries and features: explicit instructions for marking boundaries (actual vs. interpreted), edge delineation, and “no longer present” boundaries; use of 999 for no longer present features.
  - Data handling and presentation: complete FABs with neat, legible entries; ensure square number on every page; use pencils where possible for durability; include qualitative notes where categories are ambiguous.
  - Metadata and openness: underlying data should be shared publicly where appropriate; governance and data management standards emphasized at the source.

- Vegetation measurement and plot design (6.2)
  - General vegetation sampling: long-standing standardized protocol aimed at reducing observer variation; permanent markers and ground-truthing markers used for future relocations.
  - Plot types and layout:
    - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots with nested sub-quadrats to capture fine-scale variation; orientation and marking standardized (north-south/east-west axes); permanent metal plates for relocation.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots placed in natural/semi-natural land cover types per square.
    - Linear and boundary plots: up to five linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) to capture vegetation along linear features; precise positioning relative to the dominant feature; permanent markers used.
  - Relocation and relocation rules: documented methodologies for relocating plots from 1978 survey squares; if a feature no longer exists or land use changes, relocate to the nearest appropriate habitat boundary and record changes.
  - Documentation and sketching: FAB pages include site position sketches, distances, and boundary lines; photographs taken for context and verification.
  - Data entry specifics: nested quadrats recorded in a prescribed order; presence/absence and cover estimates entered in 5% bands; species lists include a restricted core list with a provision for unlisted species; use of cross marks for point information (e.g., individual features like a hedge tree).

- Vegetation data and species identification
  - Standardized species list (approx. 200 common species) with guidance for recording when identification is uncertain; acceptable species combinations allowed to reflect identification challenges (e.g., grass or sedge groups).
  - Bryophytes and lichens: a restricted list recorded with defined codes; priority given to vascular plants; specimens collected for uncertain identifications.
  - Cover and age: cover percentages assigned in five-percent categories; age classes provided to support interpretation of canopy and regeneration dynamics.
  - Vegetation types and land cover codes: explicit descriptions and examples for grasslands, moorlands, heaths, wetlands, cropped lands, orchards, and various woodland types; management impacts (mown, grazed, cut) and land uses coded accordingly.
  - Special notes: bracken treated distinctly; emphasis on combining codes to reflect mosaic habitat structure; avoid over-cluttering by preferring direct code notation.

- Woodland, boundaries, buildings, and man-made features (6.1, 6.1.x)
  - Woodland coding: use woodland/forest codes to describe canopy and structure; management status, regeneration, and age classes recorded; double-coding for mixed features; non-woodland elements outside curtilages not recorded in woodland sheets.
  - Boundaries and features: dry-stone walls, fences, hedges, barriers, verges, tracks, roads, and other boundaries mapped and coded; distance and orientation documented; edge and boundary descriptions such as stockproofing, laying, trimming, and signs of regeneration.
  - Buildings and urban edges: built features (residential, commercial, industrial, public facilities, educational, religious, etc.) mapped with associated curtilages; color-coding options provided for rapid field recording; building-related land uses recorded with descriptive notes.
  - Roadside and verge sampling: five verge plots categorized by road type and verge characteristics; additional plots capture variation across verge types to reflect management and plant assemblages.

- Freshwater biota and sampling (7)
  - Freshwater biota sampling: two streams per square (further freshwater sampling under IFE and NELUP programs); points chosen to reflect two characteristic water habitats within the square (lakes, ponds, pools, flushes, sphagnum pools, etc.); clear labeling and sample transport procedures.
  - Sample handling: use sieve and bottles with formalin; strict labeling (square number, date, surveyor); timely transport to Merlewood for processing.

- Photography (8)
  - Standard practice to photograph every vegetation plot; include plot number and edge marker in the shot for context.

- Procedures after fieldwork (9)
  - End-of-day checks to ensure all features are recorded; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless damage or loss necessitates it; arrange prompt transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations.

- Administrative notes and revisions
  - Document leadership: Colin Barr; revised February 1991; reflects ongoing refinement of methods and procedures for consistency and comparability with prior surveys.

- Key takeaways for monitoring framework authors
  - Establishes a robust, standardized monitoring framework combining ground-truth field data with remote sensing (satellite imagery) for consistent, scalable environmental assessment.
  - Emphasizes data quality, standardization, metadata, and open sharing as core governance principles.
  - Provides explicit protocols for sampling design, plot layout, coding schemes, relocation rules, and stakeholder engagement to ensure reproducibility and long-term comparability.
  - Demonstrates integration of ecological data (vegetation, land cover, boundaries, and hydrology) with human-use information (ownership, permissions, curtilage) to support policy-relevant environmental monitoring.
