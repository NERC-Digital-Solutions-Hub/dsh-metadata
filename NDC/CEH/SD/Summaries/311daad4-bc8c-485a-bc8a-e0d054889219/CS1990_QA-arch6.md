# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A comprehensive assessment of the quality assurance (QA) process for the 1990 Countryside Survey, detailing the scope, results, and recommendations to improve accuracy and confidence in survey statistics.

## Aims and scope
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey and assess the reliability of observed change statistics.
- Explain differences in recording due to observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate conclusions to previous comparative work and recommend methodological modifications for future surveys.
- Address broader data-support goals: improving data quality, enabling reliable change detection, and guiding future data collection methods.

## Methods and design
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990 (Oct–Nov): 21 original survey squares reassessed using original sketch maps; two independent assessors tested relocation and recording.
  - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of plots and inclusion of a self-assessment component; included one 1 km square from each of the original terrain classes; 28 of 32 squares were revisited by a single assessor.
- Plot types assessed (representative of Countryside Survey 1990): Quadrats (200 m² X-plots and 4 m² Y-plots), linear plots including road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundary plots; relocation used sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates where possible.
- Measures of concordance and accuracy:
  - Species-level: several indices (percentage agreement, agreement, and % accuracy) comparing Time 1 (T1, original 1990) vs Time 2 (T2, 1991 QA); adjusted analyses accounting for seasonal and management changes.
  - Cover estimates: Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests for key species.
  - Land-use and boundary mapping: primary codes, level agreement, and boundary codes; analysis of code usage and agreement across time periods.
  - Mapping of land use and vegetation: evaluation of primary codes, land-use qualifiers, and boundary features across lowland and upland classes.

## Key findings

### General data quality and change statistics
- Overall species agreement between the 1990 survey and the 1991 QA: around 47.1% initially; after accounting for seasonal differences (e.g., species not present in QA due to autumn vs. summer), the apparent discrepancy reduces.
- Percent agreement across the full dataset (including adjustments): approximately 60.9% when mis-matches are considered; initial efficiency of recording (accuracy after removing T2 variations) averaged about 74%.
- Mean number of species per plot increased from 20.7 (1990) to 23.4 (1991 QA), a statistically significant rise when all plots are pooled (p ≈ 0.009). Some upland vs. lowland differences observed; drought year effects noted.
- A substantial portion of the observed increase in species per plot between years attributed to real ecological change (growth season differences) rather than assessor experience; estimates suggest roughly 70% of the observed change may reflect genuine ecological variation, with ~30% due to under-recording in the original survey.

### Plot relocation and data types
- Plate/plot relocation success improved in 1991 QA with the use of photographs and a more systematic approach; plate relocation had a ~65–71% recovery rate across tests, and overall plot relocation success improved with photographic aids.
- X plots (relocation-based quadrats) were relatively easier to relocate; Y plots (small 4 m² quadrats) were the most challenging; plate-based relocation helped but was time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
- The presence of crop changes, seasonal effects, and plot mis-location were major sources of variation in species records (categories A–J in the report). Misidentifications and overlooked species were common contributors to initial discrepancies.

### Species and cover data
- Individual species showed substantial mis-matches between T1 and T2 on a per-plot basis, but group-level analyses indicated that overall patterns could be robust when aggregated across many plots.
- Cover estimates for common species showed limited but notable differences between times for a few species; most significant differences were linked to seasonal/land-use changes rather than measurement error alone.
- Two dominant findings in cover analysis:
  - Some species (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica, Dactylis glomerata) displayed significant but variable cover changes between years in certain landclasses.
  - A general recommendation to focus on identifying and mapping only the most prevalent species to improve reproducibility.

### Land-use mapping and boundary features
- Primary land-use code allocation was generally reliable (about 88.7% overall agreement), with some difficulties in marginal or high-altitude land and in distinguishing certain upland categories.
- Boundaries and descriptive qualifiers showed good concordance but were more variable due to interpretation differences; overall boundary primary codes achieved about 80.3% agreement.
- Mapping consistency between time periods was stronger when the same assessors revisited squares; inter-assessor agreement remained reasonable but more variable for boundary and descriptive codes.
- Recommendations to simplify the mapping scheme to enhance reproducibility and to increase the number of primary land-use codes for finer differentiation while limiting ambiguity.

### Mapping of species cover within vegetation units
- Point- and plot-level species cover showed moderate to high concordance for the most dominant species but low concordance for co-dominants (e.g., two co-dominant species matched only about 34% of the time).
- Two most prevalent species per vegetation unit captured a large portion of the common signals, suggesting a focus on primary species for mapping to improve reproducibility.

### Overall ecological gradient and DECORANA analysis
- DECORANA first-axis analyses across plot types indicated an ecological gradient from shade-tolerant to shade-intolerant species, with upland moor and heath types showing distinctive, relatively stable patterns less influenced by recent agricultural changes.
- Cross-time comparisons suggest that the principal ecological gradient trends observed earlier (1978–1988) remain broadly consistent, though single-year variations (likely drought effects) can perturb marginal areas.

## Recommendations (key points)

- QA timing and seasonality
  - Conduct QA in the same year as the original survey to minimize seasonal and annual variation effects.
- Relocation and use of photographs
  - Use photographs to re-establish plot locations and annotate photos with plot references; ensure photographs relate clearly to the sketch maps.
  - Annotate plots with distance to nearby features and include compass bearings to improve relocation accuracy.
- Plot positioning and markers
  - Use metal plates to mark X plots where feasible; in upland unenclosed areas, allocate additional personnel for relocation due to time demands.
- Y plots and plotting protocol
  - Define 4 m² Y plots with a tape, orientate the side rather than the diagonal to be N-S, and place the plot at the SE corner; consider using ground-based markers to improve accuracy.
- Lichen and bryophyte emphasis
  - Retain lichens in general surveys with focused training samples; expand bryophyte coverage especially in wetland/mire contexts and consider additional species in habitat-specific surveys.
- Vegetation identification and training
  - Provide more detailed training for grasses and similar taxa; emphasize vegetative characteristics for rapid and accurate identification.
- Land-use mapping and coding
  - Increase primary land-use codes and consider simple, dichotomous decision aids to reduce ambiguity.
  - Focus mapping on the two most prevalent species for each vegetation unit to improve reproducibility.
  - Recognize wet heath as a distinct primary code; subdivide upland grassland categories (102) into more precise subtypes (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland) to reduce misclassification.
- Boundary and figure coding
  - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence and use qualifying codes for species composition; address common mismatches in forb cover and hedge condition codes.
- Mapping of species cover
  - Report only the most dominant species (two at most) for mapping to improve consistency; acknowledge that a single point can rarely capture full species richness.
- Data quality and workflow
  - Maintain consistent year alignment for QA and field data; avoid cross-year comparisons unless strictly controlled for seasonal effects.
- Documentation and training
  - Improve field handbooks with explicit guidance for tree/shrub cover, bryophyte handling, and boundary codes to minimize interpretation differences.
  - Include specimen-based references and habitat-specific notes in training to enhance species recognition.

## Conclusions for data support and future surveys
- Photographic and plate-based relocation significantly improves plot-relocation efficiency and data reliability, particularly in unenclosed areas; however, such methods require additional resources and planning.
- Seasonality and year-to-year ecological variation play substantial roles in observed species composition and cover, underscoring the importance of aligning QA with the survey year and standardizing timing where possible.
- Land-use mapping and boundary coding are generally robust but benefit from code simplification and clearer definitions; focusing on dominant species for mapping enhances reproducibility.
- The QA demonstrates that while some discrepancies are inevitable, a well-structured QA program with careful documentation, standardized methods, and targeted training can substantially improve the reliability and interpretability of long-term ecological survey data.
