# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: to maximise the public usefulness of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Who the CS partners are
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for future survey integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports reliable informing of environmental policy.

## How requests are handled
- Requests for information are handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners, under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and what level of location accuracy can be released
- General access allows identification of whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence to identify the grid square containing each CS square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require pre-processing by CEH; exceptionally, external release may be allowed under licence if justified legally that the external data/processes are equally or more confidential than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and will be released only under the same exceptional circumstances and terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must not be retained beyond the project.
- End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or images should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases, but do not require the same high IP confidentiality criteria.
- A clause prohibits licensees from using the data to derive or claim precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences containing confidentiality clauses.
- Licences must be signed by a senior authorised representative of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH will follow Act and Regulations processes to support the decision.
- CEH must provide CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- CEH should provide reasonable pre-processing analysis support to CS partners; broader requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid and negotiated case-by-case.
