# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification has evolved over 30 years to underpin representative, stratified ecological sampling of Great Britain.
  - Emphasizes linkage between classification, sampling, and national estimates of habitat features.

- Core concept: stratified random sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification divides land into discrete strata (land classes) to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - Samples are drawn randomly within each class to minimize bias and improve precision of national estimates.
  - The Land Classification is built from environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and adapted over time to reflect policy needs and data availability.

- ITE Land Classification: evolution and purpose
  - Origin: 32 land classes created from environmental data for 1 km squares (center of 15 × 15 km grid) in late 1970s.
  - Classification used to allocate sample squares and to estimate area and habitat types across GB.
  - Revisions over time expanded to accommodate Scotland-only and Wales-only reporting and to improve regional estimates.
  - By 2007, the framework included country-unit subdivisions (England with Wales, Scotland) and Welsh-specific classes to support country-specific reporting.

- Survey history and sampling framework by period
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
    - 1 km square stratification across GB; 32 classes defined.
    - 8 samples per class; total 256 squares surveyed.
  - 1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Sampling increased by 50%: 12 squares per class; total 384 squares.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Included new Land Cover mapping and integration with ECOLUC data.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
    - Separate Scottish reporting introduced; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - 569 squares surveyed; methods adjusted to support policy-relevant outputs.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000)
    - Framework updated to enable England & Wales and Scotland country estimates.
    - Land Classes subdivided by country unit; 40 strata expanded to 40 with country-specific representations.
    - Additional samples added to improve representation in newly defined classes.
    - Uplands module introduced to better estimate upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting needs led to further Welsh class subdivisions (5 new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 additional squares surveyed in Wales; English sampling adjusted accordingly.
    - Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit; England and Scotland maintained substantial samples.

- Data handling, national estimates, and documentation
  - National estimates methodology
    - Estimates of habitat areas derived from the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that Land Class.
    - National estimates are presented for England & Wales jointly and for Scotland separately, using country-specific samples and classes.
    - Note on consistency: changing the Land Classification can affect comparability of national estimates across surveys; CS1990/CS2000/CS2007 approaches prioritize consistency within an individual survey while aligning with newer classifications for cross-survey comparability.
  - Documentation and reporting
    - Results published in a series of main reports and project-specific publications (CS1990, CS1998, CS2000, CS2007, and Wales-focused extensions).
    - Acknowledges the need to document changes in classification, sampling, and country-specific aggregation to support data governance and reuse.

- Welsh, upland, and country-specific adjustments
  - Wales-specific needs driven expansion of Welsh land classes and increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only environmental reporting.
  - Upland habitat estimates enhanced by an additional 30 squares placed in upland/marginal upland Land Classes (CS2000), improving statistical accuracy for upland outputs.
  - England–Wales and Scotland country units established with corresponding class subdivisions and sample allocations to ensure robust country-level estimates.

- Data governance and stewarding implications
  - Provenance and lineage: clear traceability from ITE Land Classification to sample allocation, field surveys, and national estimates across successive survey years.
  - Metadata and standardization: evolving Land Classification requires careful metadata to document class definitions, subdivisions, and mapping to samples for reproducibility.
  - Interoperability and updates: changes in classification and country-unit delineations impact data integration with earlier surveys; governance should track versioning and provide guidance on cross-version comparability.
  - Data quality and limitations: notes on representation of certain classes, sampling rate changes, and potential impacts on precision; upland extensions and country-specific sampling mitigate under-representation in some strata.

- Endnotes and further reading
  - The document provides detailed historical progression, class descriptions, sampling counts, and country-specific adjustments across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, as well as references to foundational methodological work and subsequent country-specific reporting developments.
