# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies solely to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH; CEH acts on behalf of NERC for decisions and licensing.

## Why locations are confidential
- Preserves representativeness of sampling sites.
- Protects goodwill and permission from landowners, essential for future surveys and scientific integrity.
- Public interest justification for confidentiality; requests handled under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and level of release
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate which grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) may be released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data within survey squares could indirectly reveal square locations and is therefore subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- Release is restricted and governed by licence terms; approval processes determine whether and how data can be shared.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
- After licence expiry, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derived outputs should be used to locate or identify CS squares, plan visits, or check landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; spatial data releases include prohibitions on attempts to deduce precise locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases according to the policy and issues licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data.
- CEH will provide annual reporting to CS partners summarising access applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal partner use (pre-processing and timing) within reasonable demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific oversight or collaboration as negotiated.
