# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and aim of QA:
  - Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
  - Explain differences in recording due to observer error, time of year, plot location, and information type.
  - Relate conclusions to previous comparative work and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

- QA design and methods:
  - Two QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed by two independent assessors using original sketch maps for plot relocation.
    - 1991: Expanded QA with photographs of individual plots; included 1 km squares from the 32 terrain classes; added self-assessment among a subset of squares.
  - Plot types covered (in a quarter of each square): X-quadrats (200 m²), Y-quads (4 m²), roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries; relocation relied on sketch maps, photographs, and metal plates.
  - Key metrics and analyses:
    - Plot relocation success (plates and plots recovered within time limits).
    - Species concordance across time (several indices for agreement and accuracy).
    - Cover estimates comparison and their implications for change statistics.
    - DECORANA ordination to examine ecological gradient shifts and their relation to observed changes.
  - Additional self-assessments and Annex analyses for cross-checks.

- Key findings on data quality:
  - Overall species-list concordance and accuracy:
    - Autumn 1990 QA showed relatively low initial agreement (mean about 47–60% depending on metric).
    - Full 1991 QA indicated a significant increase in mean species per plot in 1991 (from ~20.7 to ~23.4), with statistical evidence that much of the difference was real ecological change rather than recording error.
  - Seasonal and annual effects:
    - A drought year (1990) markedly affected detectability and reporting; 1991, with more normal conditions, showed higher species counts.
    - Many apparent changes between years were attributed to seasonal/annual variation rather than recorder error alone.
  - Observer error sources:
    - Major error types included mis-identifications, overlooked species, and plot relocation errors (especially for smaller plots like Y), with seasonal changes and management changes also contributing.
  - Plot relocation and use of photographs/plates:
    - Plate/plot relocation improved in 1991 when photographs were used; initial autumn 1990 recovery was 71% for plates within five minutes; 1991 results showed 65% plate recovery and 87% plot recovery.
    - Photographs were particularly valuable for relocation, especially in unenclosed land; distance, compass bearings, and feature documentation significantly affected relocation efficiency.
  - Mapping and land-use coding:
    - High concordance for primary land-use codes (about 88% overall), but boundary codes and some descriptive/qualifying codes were less consistent (around 80–83% depending on code type and assessor pairing).
    - Specific codes (e.g., marsh, upland grassland, bog classifications) exhibited ambiguities; recommendation to refine and subdivide certain upland and lowland codes.
  - Vegetation cover estimates:
    - Comparisons show limited but notable differences in cover values for common species; single-dominant species tended to be more reproducible than co-dominant pairings.
    - Overall, cover data were less robust than presence/absence measures; recommendations to document only the most prevalent species or simplify cover coding.
  - Land-class and plot-type effects:
    - Lower accuracy in lowland arable (LC) class; upland plots (UP) more consistent.
    - X plots generally easier to relocate than small Y plots; plate-based localization useful but time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
  - Long-term ecological gradient interpretation:
    - DECORANA first-axis scores indicated general shifts consistent with known land-use trends from 1978–1988; 1990–1991 showed mixed signals, likely reflecting year-to-year climatic and land-management variation.
  - Species-group frequency analyses:
    - No significant difference in cumulative frequency for conservative species groups between 1990 and 1991; some individual species showed shifts likely tied to climate and management (e.g., Taraxacum, Galium, Ranunculus).

- Practical implications for environmental monitoring:
  - Real change versus recording bias:
    - When comparing surveys across years, be cautious of drought-year effects and seasonal timing; ensure as much as possible that QA and primary surveying occur in similar seasons/years.
  - Importance of relocation aids:
    - Photographs and metal plates substantially improve plot relocation efficiency; annotate photos and relate them clearly to plots to reduce relocation errors.
  - Coding systems:
    - A streamlined, well-defined code set improves reproducibility; consider subdividing complex upland/lowland categories and reducing reliance on extensive cover codes.
  - Training focus:
    - Emphasize bryophyte and grass identification; increase homogeneity in cover assessment and registration of dominant species to improve data consistency.

- Recommendations (summarised):
  - Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in surveys with enhanced training and habitat context; provide species samples and habitat notes for training.
  - Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the original survey timing.
  - Recommendation 3: Require annotating photographs and link to plot locations; use metal markers for X plots where feasible.
  - Recommendation 4–5: Improve small-quadrat (Y) positioning with standardized methods; ensure plate-based relocation is supported with adequate resources.
  - Recommendation 6–7: Expand use of photographs for localization; limit seasonal and annual variation by aligning QA with survey timing.
  - Recommendation 8–10: Refine land-use codes (e.g., subdivide upland grassland categories, recognize wet heath as a distinct type, clarify marsh definitions); simplify and standardize boundary coding.
  - Recommendation 11–12: Reduce emphasis on fine-grained cover codes; map only the most prevalent species; adopt simple, reproducible coding rules; focus on three variables (presence/absence of key species, dominant species, and useful boundary features).
  - Recommendation 12: Provide simple, dichotomous mapping codes to improve reproducibility; limit cover only to major species to ease cross-survey comparisons.

- Overall conclusions for environmental monitoring:
  - The 1990 QA exercise demonstrated that observer and seasonal effects can substantially influence ecological statistics, and that incorporating photographs and standardized relocation aids substantially improves data quality.
  - For robust monitoring over time, QA should be integrated into the surveying workflow, with consistent timing, standardized coding, and targeted training to minimize known error sources.
  - Future surveys should adopt streamlined coding, enhanced relocation practices, and year-matched QA to reduce confounding effects and improve the reliability of detected environmental change.
