# Notes on the downloadable data

- Location privacy: CEH keeps the precise locations of Countryside Survey (CS) squares confidential; external users cannot identify squares to better than 100 square km, so you cannot determine if squares fall within defined areas below that threshold.
- Data scope and structure: CS field survey data come from a sample of 1 km squares in GB, with measurements at two levels—whole square and within-square (e.g., quadrats for vegetation, soils, etc.); measurements include binary and continuous variables.
- Sampling design: not a random subset; the sample is stratified by the ITE Land Classification. Country-specific classifications are used (England: 21 classes, Wales: 8, Scotland: 16). The classification has evolved (32 → 42 → 45 classes) to accommodate separate country reporting.
- Representativeness and exclusions: not all GB squares are surveyed; squares that are >90% sea or >75% urban were excluded. Official GB estimates assume excluded squares have similar vegetative land composition to sampled squares; bias is likely small except in regions with substantial sea/urban areas.
- Estimation method: estimates by land class use ratio estimation, weighted by the vegetative land area in each class. Land-class estimates are then combined using these vegetative-area weights.
- Uncertainty and inference: since 1998, standard errors and confidence intervals are estimated using bootstrap methods due to skewness in some features.
- Data interpretation notes: measurements span various data types and scales; results are contingent on accounting for stratification and the sampling design to avoid biased estimates of variation.
- Practical guidance for data use: apply the stratified design and weights when analyzing CS data; be mindful of limited geographic precision and the potential differences between included and excluded squares; leverage bootstrap-based uncertainty measures for robust inferences.
