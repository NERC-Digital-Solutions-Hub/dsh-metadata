# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, environmental protection, and ongoing ability to survey land.
- Public-interest position; requests handled under UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Countryside Survey partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Access levels and release conditions
- Approximate location access: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Precise location access: six-digit grid references released only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external pre-processing by CEH preferred to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) treated with equivalent confidentiality to location data and released under same exceptional terms.
- Prohibition on attempts to derive exact locations from related spatial data.

## Licensing terms and responsibilities
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorized individuals for specified project purposes.
- Licences are finite in duration; data must be destroyed and written confirmation provided at project end.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square locations; not to guide visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards (at least equivalent to JCOP) may be required for licensing.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but are not bound by the highest IP-confidentiality criteria required for six-digit releases.
- If approved, CEH (on behalf of NERC) issues hardcopy licences with agreed terms.
- If access is denied, CEH will follow statutory procedures; annual reporting on applications and decisions is provided to CS partners.

## Process and governance for data leaders
- CEH acts as the decision-maker for exceptional releases and licensing on behalf of NERC.
- CEH may provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes to CS partners; case-by-case consideration for other organizations.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy to help define requirements and ensure appropriate use.
- Support for collaboration or paid arrangements may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical implications for data leadership and strategy
- Balances public-interest data utility with protection of sensitive locations.
- Encourages controlled data sharing through defined licenses and processing support.
- Requires clear governance, risk assessment, and coordination with CEH to determine appropriate access levels.
- Emphasizes importance of maintaining data provenance, security, and compliance with legal/regulatory frameworks.
