# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Purpose and context
- Aim: use standardized, time-series data to demonstrate environmental condition and policy performance over time, enabling scrutiny of ecological health.
- Background: ITE conducted major GB surveys in 1977/78, 1984, and 1988 to map land cover and vegetation; 1990 marks a resurvey to monitor ongoing changes and to build datasets linking ground truth with satellite imagery.
- Outputs: current, comparable datasets for scientific evaluation; foundational work for modelling rural environments; data intended for storage in appropriate portals and for broad, standardized interpretation.

## Survey design and scope
- Sampling framework: 512 squares planned in 1990, grouped into six teams across six ITE Research Stations; 128 new squares plus continuation of prior sites to enable trend analysis.
- Square components (field data collection): 
  - Five large 200 m2 quadrats (semi-natural vegetation) per square.
  - Five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats in additional land cover types.
  - Up to five linear plots (boundary, hedgerow, streamside, roadside) to capture linear features within enclosed land.
  - 128 squares newly surveyed; relocation and matching of plots guided by established rules.
- Two-tier sampling emphasis: ground-truth vegetation data to anchor satellite-derived land cover maps and improve bottom-up/top-down integration.
- Standardization focus: experiments with observer consistency; field handbook and definitions to reduce recording variation; emphasis on high-quality, mappable units.

## Permissions and field access
- Landowner permissions: required for legal access and to avoid conflicts; two types of landowners (old vs new to the survey cohort).
- Process: letters sent to known landowners; field teams to obtain access in person; if access refused, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon or relocate squares/plots.
- Documentation: maintain owner contact details, familiarity with cooperative owners, and notes on any access issues for future sampling.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Core equipment (provided by Merlewood): FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), aerial photographs, large-scale maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking tools, sampling gear, navigation aids, identity cards.
- Local station provisions: locating maps, basic tools, cameras, field guides, first-aid, and personal gear.
- Field planning: flexible scheduling, minimizing travel, avoiding excessive site revisits, and fair compensation via time-off-in-lieu where overtime would occur.

## Data recording and mapping (FAB)
- Structure: three main elements—mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; supplemented by a dedicated sampling section (7).
- Mapping approach: annotate enlarged 1:10,000 maps with data codes; use alpha-numeric codes to compress complex records; ensure entire square is mapped, including edge corners.
- Coding system: primary and secondary codes; codes linked logically (e.g., boundaries, vegetation types, ownership). Use of Code 999 for no longer present boundaries; avoidance of ambiguous codes; emphasis on field judgment with optional qualifying notes.
- Aerial photo interpretation (API): guidance for identifying features not on OS maps; boundaries marked as dashed lines; isolated features as crosses; API as guidance only and subordinate to ground truth.
- FAB completion: front cover and ownership pages filled; farmer information and physiography sections gathered; detailed vegetation, land use, and boundary coding entered; diagrams and sketches required for clarity; permanent markers placed to aid relocation.
- Permanent marking and relocation: metal plates or markers placed at quadrat corners or field boundaries to enable precise relocation in future surveys.

## Vegetation sampling and plot methodology
- Plot types and sizes:
  - Large quadrats: five 200 m2 plots per square (with nested 4 m2 subplots for detailed recording).
  - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in additional land cover types.
  - Linear plots: up to 5 plots each for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides (enclosed land); relocation guidelines provided for both old and new squares.
- Plot layout and relocation:
  - Quadrats placed to sample the “centre of gravity” of habitat; if unrepresentative, relocate with documentation.
  - When land use changes, relocation rules specify how to re-allocate plots to comparable habitat categories or to new suitable sites.
  - Permanent markers placed to ensure repeatability; distance and bearing recorded; sketches and photos (Photography section) accompany FABs.
- Data collection within plots:
  - Species list captured from nested quadrats, with presence/absence and 5% cover category estimates for each species.
  - Use of a standard recording sheet with nested quadrat recording (Q codes) and percent cover; unlisted species added as needed.
  - Bryophytes and lichens included in a restricted list; some species combinations accepted when accurate identification is difficult.
  - Colour coding and arrows minimized to avoid clutter; field notes used for ambiguous cases.
- Vegetation coding and interpretation:
  - Comprehensive code lists for ground cover types, grasses, herbs, rushes, ferns, and woody vegetation; dominant canopy and age class information recorded where relevant.
  - For trees and woodland: use woodland codes with at least one primary code; record age, canopy, and management status where applicable.
  - Boundary and buildings/structures: extensive codes for walls, fences, hedges, verges, tracks, buildings, and non-agricultural features; careful differentiation between curtilage and countryside features.

## Freshwater and sampling components
- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE/NELUP):
  - Two standing water habitats per square for freshwater biota collection; one flowing-water biota sample via IFE protocol (documented separately) and one standing-water sample via NELUP at Newcastle University.
  - Focus on aquatic macroinvertebrates (notably water beetles) across habitat types (lakes, ponds, streams, ditches, calcareous/acid flushes, bogs).
  - Clear marking of sampling sites on the map (Neli/NELUP) with descriptive notes; samples preserved and transported to Merlewood for analysis.
- 7. Sampling and photography:
  - Photography: document vegetation plots to capture appearance and landmarks; plot numbers clearly visible on a plate at plot edge.
  - Sampling integrity: two types of samples per square where possible; time-limited, standardized searching times; proper labeling and chain-of-custody for samples.

## Data management, quality, and outputs
- Data quality and comparability: focus on standardised field procedures, observer training, and QA controls to improve statistical accuracy of change data across years.
- Data outputs: field reports, maps, charts, and data for sharing through portals; integration with satellite-derived land cover to enhance pattern detection.
- Temporal scope: designed for resurvey in 1990 with enhanced data capture and collaboration; results intended to support long-term ecological and land-use modelling.

## End-of-survey procedures
- Daily review: verify completeness of FABs and maps; resolve omissions when feasible.
- Logistics: transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly; avoid post-survey data corruption or loss.
- Documentation: consolidate procedures, notes, and maps to facilitate future resampling and data reuse.
