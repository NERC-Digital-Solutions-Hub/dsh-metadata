# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: Maximise public usefulness of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity. Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Current CS partners: Natural Environment Research Council (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential:
  - Preserve representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Essential for survey integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land in the future.
  - Public interest supports confidentiality; requests handled by CEH on behalf of NERC and CS partners under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- When locations may be released and precision levels:
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) can be released under licence to indicate general area.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may process analyses to avoid release.
  - If exceptional release is required, applicants must demonstrate that their data/IP confidentiality is equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit releases.
  - Releasing four-digit references carries IP/confidentiality terms appropriate to four-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences granted for finite periods and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other duties.
  - Upon licence expiry, organisations must confirm data destruction in writing.
  - No data or derived information should enable third parties to identify CS square locations.
  - Data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need to show JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but with lower confidentiality requirements; users must not attempt to derive precise locations or claim to have done so.

- Responsibilities and implementation:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - Licence approvals or denials follow the FOI Act and Environmental Regulations; CEH reports decisions and grounds annually to CS partners.
  - CEH aims to provide timely pre-processing support for internal CS partnership needs; external requests are case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH involvement may be advisory or collaborative and may involve payment negotiations.

- Practical guidance for prospective users:
  - Engage CEH early to define requirements and appropriate data handling.
  - Consider whether pre-processed analyses can meet needs without releasing precise locations.
  - Be prepared to demonstrate data-handling, security, and project-management standards.
