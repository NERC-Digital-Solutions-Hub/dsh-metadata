# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Scope: Applies to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports future surveys and continued ability to inform environmental policy.

## Circumstances for release and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate approximate square locations within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references (more precise) are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data from within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.
- External requests must be justified legally, showing the requester’s data/IP protection is equal or greater than CS data’s confidentiality requirements.

## Licence conditions and usage restrictions
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data not retained for other organizational purposes.
- At the end of the licence period, licensees must confirm destruction of location data in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to audit landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms to six-digit releases but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level; users must not attempt to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Roles, governance, and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; signed by an authorized representative of the licensee.
- If a release is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal pre-processing within reasonable timeframes; demand-dependent.
- Requests from external organisations are handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before committing to use CS location data; CEH may provide scientific input or collaboration as part of the arrangement.
