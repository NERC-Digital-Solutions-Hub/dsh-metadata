# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Overview
  - A comprehensive quality assurance (QA) exercise on the 1990 Countryside Survey vegetation and land-use data.
  - Two QA phases: Autumn 1990 (21 squares) and 1991 (expanded with photographs and additional self-assessments across selected squares).
  - Aimed to quantify recording accuracy, understand error sources, compare with previous surveys, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

## Aims

- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and assess change statistics.
- Explain recording differences in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate conclusions to previous ITE survey work.
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve future accuracy and confidence in statistics.

## Methods

- QA series
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; used original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Additional phase with photographs of plots; self-assessment group included; tested relocation using photos and a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes.
- Plot types and data collection
  - Six plot types within squares: 200 m2 X-plots, 4 m2 Y-plots, roadverges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries.
  - For each quarter of a square, nine predetermined landcover/boundary points were recorded.
  - Buried metal plates marking quadrats relocated where possible; photographs and sketches used to aid relocation.
- Evaluation metrics
  - Plate/plot relocation outcomes: found, partially found, not found; recovery rates and time.
  - Species concordance across time (three to four indices: percent agreement, agreement, and % accuracy).
  - Initial efficiency of recording (% accuracy) and how season, location, and plot type affected results.
  - Land-use and vegetation mapping codes: primary land-use codes, boundary codes, level vs. qualifying codes, and mapping accuracy.
- Analytical approaches
  - Comparisons of species lists between 1990 and 1991 QA, including tests for changes in species frequency.
  - DECORANA (ordination) analyses to examine ecological gradients and axis shifts over time.
  - Analysis of variance across plot types and land-class aggregates (LC, LG, MA, UP).

## Key Findings

- Plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Autumn 1990: Plates found and plots relocated in 66 cases; not found in 27 cases; recovery rate ~71% with a 5-minute search window.
  - 1991: More detailed relocation by plot type (plates and plots); overall recovery improved with photographs aiding relocation.
  - Small X-plots and larger roadverges/ boundaries generally yielded better relocation success; small Y-plots were the most challenging.
- Species recording and change statistics
  - Initial combined 1990 QA showed about 60% concordance across places; broader analysis across all squares yielded around 60–62% concordance initially, improving with methods.
  - The 1991 reassessment showed a significant increase in mean species per plot (1990 mean ~20.7; 1991 mean ~23.4), largely due to real seasonal/annual differences and improved recording efficiency rather than solely assessor skill.
  - Seasonal and drought effects were substantial: drought in 1990 reduced detectability of certain species; 1991 (more normal growing season) showed higher species counts.
  - Annual climate and land-use changes contributed to apparent shifts in species composition per plot; caution advised when comparing change statistics across different land uses or across years with differing rainfall.
- Plot-type and land-class differences
  - X plots (quadrats) were easier to relocate than Y plots; roadverges and boundaries were relatively easier than some interior plots.
  - Lower accuracy observed in lowland arable and lowland agricultural grassland land-classes (LC, LG) compared with upland classes; uplands showed less seasonal variation.
- Mapping codes and data standards
  - Primary land-use code mapping showed high concordance (roughly 88–95% across evaluated squares); boundary codes were somewhat less concordant (around 80–83% overall, influenced by repeat surveys by same/different assessors).
  - Ambiguities arose from misinterpretation of qualifying codes and certain primary codes (e.g., marsh, moorland vs blanket bog).
  - Recommendations to simplify and better define land-use codes; subdivide certain upland codes (e.g., 102 upland grassland) and recognize specific habitat types (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) more distinctly.
- Field observations and cover estimation
  - Visual cover estimates for species >5% were generally reliable for dominant species but showed notable differences for some species, especially grasses and bryophytes.
  - Bryophytes and certain grasses were less consistently recorded; recommendation to intensify bryophyte coverage in training and QA; consider expanding allowable bryophyte lists for habitat-specific surveys.
- Data consistency and quality controls
  - A substantial portion of mismatches arose from seasonal/annual changes and relocation issues rather than pure observer error.
  - Approximately 40% of species mismatches could be attributed to relocation or complex cover/identification errors; much of the remaining mismatches were due to seasonal/annual variation.
- DECORANA and long-term trends
  - First-axis scores indicated a gradient between upland and lowland vegetation; 1990–1991 axis shifts were not statistically significant given sample size but aligned with trends observed in earlier ECOLUC work.
  - Across 1978–1991, overall directional changes were broadly consistent with known land-use changes, with a caveat for year-to-year variation in marginal areas due to drought.
- Conclusions on mapping and survey design
  - Photographs are valuable for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; metal plates were effective but slow in upland unenclosed areas.
  - Recommendation to annotate photographs with distances to nearby features and to ensure plots are tied to identifiable ground features.
  - Emphasize capturing only dominant species for mapping to improve reproducibility; reduce dependence on fine-grained cover estimates for every species.

## Recommendations (Key Points)

- Data collection and QA timing
  - Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey to separate genuine changes from recording biases.
  - Ensure QA occurs within the same year or growing season as the original survey when possible.
- Plot relocation and ground-truthing
  - Use photographic evidence to re-establish plot positions; annotate photographs with distances to features.
  - Employ metal marker plates for X plots wherever feasible, recognizing slower relocation in unenclosed upland areas.
  - Improve quadrat positioning for Y plots; ensure photos and sketches clearly show the plot context.
- Mapping codes and data standards
  - Simplify land-use mapping codes; emphasize primary codes and reduce reliance on complex qualifying codes.
  - Introduce habitat-specific primary codes (e.g., lowland rush pasture, wet heath) and subdivide upland 102 grassland.
  - Restrict boundary coding to hedges and ensure hedge composition is captured with qualifying codes.
- Vegetation mapping and cover
  - Record only the two most prevalent species per mapping unit to improve reproducibility.
  - Focus on dominant species rather than attempting exhaustive coverage for all taxa; provide guidance on when to record bryophytes and other groups.
  - Develop explicit rules for tree and shrub cover coding to minimize interpretive variation.
- Training and data quality
  - Enhance training on species identification in grasses and bryophytes; emphasize vegetative characteristics and seasonality.
  - Include sample species and habitat information in training to improve consistency across observers.
- Data products and GIS implications
  - Ensure robust metadata: survey year, season, weather conditions, and QA context, plus relocation accuracy indicators.
  - Maintain both land-use codes and boundary codes with documented confidence levels to inform spatial analyses.
  - Integrate photographs as georeferenced data to support plot relocation and validation workflows.
  - Use DECORANA/ordination insights to understand long-term ecological gradients and to curate plots by land-class aggregates (LC, LG, MA, UP) for comparative GIS analyses.

## Implications for GIS Specialists

- Data quality and interoperability
  - Standardized land-use codes and clearer boundary coding improve cross-square comparability and GIS analyses.
  - Document relocation accuracy and QA metadata to assess spatial reliability in GIS layers.
- Mapping workflow
  - Favor dominant-species mapping and simplified land-use coding to enhance reproducibility and reduce ambiguity in spatial databases.
  - Use ground-truthing aids (plates, photographs) to constrain spatial alignment of field data with GIS layers.
- Temporal analyses
  - Exercise caution when comparing year-to-year vegetation data due to seasonal and drought effects; align comparisons by land-use type and season where possible.
  - Consider long-term trend analyses (as with DECORANA findings) to contextualize short-term QA results within broader ecological gradients.

## Conclusion

- The QA exercises demonstrate that, with careful methodology, photographs, and ground-truthing aids, plot relocation and land-use mapping can achieve high reliability for GIS-based analyses.
- Major challenges remain in species-level recording due to seasonal variation, plot relocation complexity, and nuanced coding decisions.
- The recommended standardizations, coding simplifications, and ground-truthing practices aim to improve the consistency and usefulness of GIS-ready data from the Countryside Survey for policy, planning, and public-facing mapping.
