# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- A historical overview of how the ITE Land Classification was developed and used to stratify field sampling for Countryside Survey GB from 1978 to 2007, with updates published in 2011.
- Emphasizes that the current sampling framework is tied to its predecessors and is essential for producing representative, change-detecting time-series data.

## Core concepts and rationale

- Stratified, random sampling to avoid bias and ensure all parts of the landscape are represented.
- ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) define land classes used as the stratification framework.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used historically to group quadrats into land classes, enabling scalable classification from local to national scales.
- Sampling design aims to balance statistical reliability with practical constraints, enabling national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

## Chronology of surveys and classification development

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA-based classification produced 32 land classes from 1 km squares; sampling used eight squares per class (256 total).
  - Field work focused on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB 1 km square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Repeated measurements from CS1984; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification; CS2000)
  - Land Classification extended to support separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland).
  - Sub-division of classes created more strata (40 total); additional squares added to ensure adequate representation; uplands/marginal uplands module added to improve upland habitat estimates.
  - Wales and Scotland received revised, country-specific sampling maps; Isle of Man samples replaced when needed.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; CS2007)
  - Responded to devolution by providing Wales-only reporting needs and ensuring adequate Wales representation.
  - Wales-specific class sub-divisions created (five new Welsh classes); total strata increased to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) added; English squares adjusted to maintain overall precision.

## Sampling framework and country-specific adjustments

- CS2000 adjustments
  - Separate country-unit estimates introduced: England with Wales and Scotland.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; some aggregations used where country representation was sparse.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure representation of new/modified classes; upland-focused sampling module added.
- CS2007 adjustments
  - Wales-focused sampling expanded to support Wales-only reporting; England allocations adjusted accordingly.
  - Five new Welsh sub-classes created; total strata expanded to 45.
- Isle of Man
  - Previous sample squares not contributing to country-unit estimates; replaced with squares in England for country-unit reporting.

## Survey scale, outputs, and reporting

- CS1978 to CS2007 progressively increased the number of sample squares and the complexity of land-class stratification to improve local, regional, and national estimates.
- Outputs include habitat-area estimates and change statistics based on land-class proportions and square-level data.
- The document emphasizes consistency of national estimates despite changing classifications, noting trade-offs between using latest country-specific classifications and cross-survey comparability.

## Uplands and additional modules

- CS2000 introduced an upland habitat module to improve statistical accuracy for upland England and Wales habitats, addressing under-sampling in highland areas when producing country-based estimates.

## Data interpretation and references

- The sampling strategy is designed to support robust ecological monitoring, policy relevance, and historical time-series analysis.
- Notes on methodological choices for national estimates versus cross-survey consistency are provided, with guidance on utilizing different land-class schemes for reporting.
