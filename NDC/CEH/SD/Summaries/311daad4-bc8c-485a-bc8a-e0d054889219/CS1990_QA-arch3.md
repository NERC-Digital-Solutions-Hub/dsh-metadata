# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose and aims
  - Quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
  - Explain observed differences in recording by observer error, time of year, plot location, type of information, and regional factors.
  - Relate findings to previous comparative work and inform methodological improvements for future surveys.
  - Recommend modifications to survey methodology to improve accuracy and confidence in statistics.

- Study design and methods
  - Two separate QA series:
    - Autumn 1990 (October–November): 21 original survey squares; relied on original surveyors’ sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
    - 1991 (June–September): added photographs of individual plots; one 1 km square from each terrain class; each square visited within 14 days of the corresponding original survey date; 28 of 32 squares visited by a single assessor.
  - Plot types examined (six types, with sub-divisions):
    - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X plots) and 4 m2 (Y plots)
    - Linear plots: 1–10 m components
    - Road verges (adjacent to carriageway)
    - Hedges (along boundaries)
    - Streamsides
    - Boundaries (various types)
  - Relocation and recording procedures
    - Attempts to relocate buried metal plates marking quadrat corners using sketch maps, photographs, and metal detectors.
    - Within-square resurvey included predefined landcover and boundary points (nine points per quarter).
  - Data collection and governance
    - Adherence to standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedures; Annexes detail forms, classes, and plot grids.
    - Additional self-assessment squares to gauge consistency of methods.

- Measurements and indicators of accuracy
  - Species concordance indicators (four indices)
    - Percentage agreement: common species divided by combined total
    - Agreement: common species divided by total in first survey
    - Agreement (modified): common species divided by total after excluding species not recorded in QA
    - % accuracy: common species divided by total after removing QA-related errors
  - Initial efficiency of recording
    - Based on a breakdown of error sources (mis-identifications, overlooked species, plot mis-location, seasonal/management changes, etc.)
  - Plate and plot relocation success
    - Rates of locating original plates and plots, with time constraints
  - Cover estimates
    - Visual estimates of percent cover for species exceeding 5% in plots; comparisons across surveys
  - Land-use and mapping codes
    - Primary land-use codes, boundary codes, and qualifiers; consistency across time and different assessors
  - Statistical approaches
    - Wilcoxon matched-pairs tests for cover comparisons
    - DECORANA ordination (first axis scores) to examine ecological gradients and shifts
    - ANOVA to test differences across plot types and land-class aggregates

- Key findings and interpretations
  - Overall agreement and differences
    - Initial, full QA dataset showed about 47–60% concordance between original and QA observations depending on metric and year.
    - Removing seasonally unavailable species from the comparison increased apparent agreement and indicated that some differences were due to seasonal availability rather than observer error alone.
    - A real increase in species numbers from 1990 to 1991 was observed, largely due to actual ecological changes (e.g., more normal growing season in 1991 after a drought year in 1990) but a portion (est. roughly 27%) was attributed to improved recording efficiency in QA.
  - Effect of photographs and relocation
    - Use of photographs in 1991 significantly improved plot relocation accuracy relative to sketch-map-only relocation.
    - Photographs plus sketches substantially reduced mis-location errors; distance/compass bearing data and clear feature references further improved relocations.
  - Plot-type and land-class effects
    - Differences in accuracy varied by land-class; lowland arable (LC) areas showed notably lower recording accuracy, while upland and other classes were more consistent.
    - X plots (and roadside/edge-type plots) were easier to relocate than the very small Y plots; plate-based relocation was successful overall but time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
  - Species-level findings and biases
    - Some common grasses and bryophytes were poorly distinguished; bryophyte recording needed targeted improvement.
    - Increases in the frequency of certain less common species (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana spp.) likely reflect real population changes or seasonal effects; others appear due to under-recording in the original survey.
  - Vegetation cover and mapping concordance
    - Cover estimates showed limited concordance for many species when comparing two time points; stronger concordance for more dominant or widespread species.
    - Mapping codes for primary land-use were generally reliable; boundaries and qualifiers showed more variation due to interpretive differences and code ambiguities.
  - Multiyear/ecology-related insights
    - DECORANA analyses indicate shifts along ecological gradients consistent with long-term trends observed in prior datasets; upland moorland vegetation remained relatively stable, while lowland changes aligned with agricultural practice shifts.
    - Seasonal timing and land-use changes significantly affect interpretation of change statistics and should be controlled in QA/monitoring designs.

- Data management, metadata, and governance implications
  - Metadata and data-sharing: the QA process highlighted barriers to sharing raw data and metadata publicly; future monitoring should embed robust data governance, clear metadata, and openness from the outset.
  - Data quality controls: QA emphasized necessity of clearly defined protocols for data collection, relocation, plot definitions, and handling of seasonal effects.
  - Standardization and transparency: reproducibility hinges on well-documented field methods, consistent use of codes, and explicit definitions for qualifiers and cover categories.

- Recommendations for future surveys and QA (summarized)
  - R1: Retain lichens in general surveys with training materials and habitat context to improve identification.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey time to minimize seasonal/annual variation confounding results.
  - R3: Ensure surveyors annotate photographs and relate them to the corresponding plots; include distance to nearby features in sketches.
  - R4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots wherever feasible; anticipate greater relocation time in unenclosed upland areas and allocate accordingly.
  - R5: Define 4 m2 Y plots with explicit orientation using a survey tape; place plots at the SE corner to standardize positioning.
  - R6: Provide targeted training on bryophyte and grass species identification; emphasize vegetative characteristics and habitat context.
  - R7: Recognize and address inter-seasonal effects by coordinating QA within the same year and season as the original survey where possible.
  - R8–R12: Land-use coding improvements and mapping simplifications
    - Sub-divide complex upland and lowland land-use classes (e.g., upland grassland categories).
    - Introduce codes to better distinguish lowland rush pasture and wet heath as distinct vegetation types.
    - Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence; use qualifiers for species composition.
    - Reduce reliance on numerous fragile cover codes; focus on dominant species to improve reproducibility.
    - Improve guidance around marsh/wetland classifications and moorland vs. blanket vegetation boundaries.
    - Increase emphasis on recording the most prevalent species for land-use parcels to enhance mapping consistency.

- Endnotes and annexes (descriptive context)
  - Annexes detail specific square-level data, plotting grids, and the Annex D species cover differences by land class.
  - The report includes a detailed breakdown of sources of variation (A–J) and their contributions to discrepancies between original and QA observations.

- Overall takeaway for monitoring framework authors
  - Rigorous QA of field data collection is essential to separate true ecological change from observer error, seasonal variation, and methodological drift.
  - Incorporating photographs, standardized plot relocation procedures, and explicit metadata improves data quality and reproducibility.
  - Clear, simplified, and well-documented coding schemes for land use, boundaries, and species cover reduce ambiguity and enhance comparability across time.
  - Training should target common misidentifications (especially grasses and bryophytes) and emphasize habitat-specific nuances.
  - Align QA timing with the original survey and ensure robust data governance to enable transparent data sharing and long-term monitoring fidelity.
