# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the quality assurance (QA) exercised in the 1990 Countryside Survey.
  - Aims to quantify accuracy of field recording, explain differences, relate to prior work, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.

- Context and background
  - Acknowledges inherent variation from large teams of recorders despite training and supervisor checks.
  - Builds on earlier QA exercises (1988/1989) to assess consistency, reliability, and potential biases across major field components.
  - Highlights prior observations about difficulties in plot relocation, cover estimates, species recognition, and lack of standard data handling.

- Methods and study design
  - Two QA series:
    - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares assessed using sketch maps; two independent assessors; relocation relied on sketch maps.
    - 1991: Expanded QA using photographs of individual plots and a single 1 km square from each of 32 terrain classes; included self-assessment via a subset of squares.
  - Plot types and data collection
    - Six plot types: Quadrats (200 m2 X-plots; 4 m2 Y-plots), linear plots (roadverges), hedges, streamsides, boundaries.
    - Buried metal plates marking quadrat corners relocated if possible; recording of landcover and boundaries at nine predetermined points per quarter-square.
  - Evaluation metrics
    - Species concordance and several agreement/accuracy indices to compare T1 (original survey) and T2 (QA) data.
    - Photographs used to enhance relocation; plates used to mark X plots; assessment of data quality by plot type and landclass.
  - Additional analyses
    - DECORANA ordination (first axis) to study ecological gradient shifts between survey years and plot types.
    - Separate analysis by landclass aggregates (lowland LC, lowland grassland LG, marginal MA, upland UP).

- Key findings (data quality and variation)
  - Overall recording agreement
    - Moderate to substantial agreement between original and QA data; significant improvements observed when photographs were used for relocation.
    - Seasonal and annual variation (e.g., drought year 1990 vs wetter 1991) substantially influenced species lists; upland plots showed less seasonal effect.
  - Plot relocation and plate findings
    - Plate/plot relocation success improved with time and methods (e.g., 1991 improvements due to photographs): still challenging for small plots (Y-plots) and unenclosed upland areas.
    - Relocation efficiency varied by plot type; X plots easiest to relocate; Y plots most difficult; road verges and hedges relatively easier than small quadrats.
  - Species recording and changes
    - 1991 QA showed an increase in mean species per plot, partly due to real seasonal/annual changes and partly due to improved recording efficiency.
    - Some apparent changes are attributable to seasonal effects or management changes; others reflect genuine population shifts in certain species.
  - Land-use and boundary mapping
    - Primary land-use codes mapped with high reliability; minor codes (e.g., marsh, upland distinctions) showed more ambiguity.
    - Boundary codes varied, with misclassifications often due to ambiguous hedge boundaries or hedge condition coding.
    - Mapping of species cover at nine-point grid showed reasonable concordance for dominant species (about 81% at single points for dominant species), but co-dominant or multiple species at a point had low exact concordance (around 5% for exact matches).
  - Data consistency and errors
    - Approximately 60–75% agreement across plots for species data; about 60.9% overall agreement across comparisons when variations were included (Table 4).
    - Major sources of variation included: misidentifications, overlooked species, relocation errors, seasonality, and mis-location or mis-orientation of plots.
  - Implications of changes across years
    - DECORANA analysis suggested shifts along an ecological gradient consistent with long-term land-use and climate trends, but year-to-year variation complicates interpretation at the plot level.
    - The 1990–1991 comparisons supported the need to consider land-use type, season, and plot-type differences when interpreting change statistics.

- Recommendations for QA and data management (key actions for data leaders)
  - R1: Retain lichens in general surveys, with habitat context and training to improve familiarity; update training materials accordingly.
  - R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey to separate real ecological change from recording issues.
  - R3: Require surveyors to annotate photographs and link them to plot locations; use photographs to aid relocation.
  - R4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots wherever possible; allocate additional resources for relocation in challenging unenclosed uplands.
  - R5: Define 4 m2 Y plots with a survey tape; orient Y plots with the side oriented N–S and place at the SE corner; improve ground positioning techniques.
  - R6: Ensure surveyors annotate the location of plots, and relate photographs to nearby features; provide distance to features and bearings on sketches.
  - R7: In unenclosed areas, photographs and sketches must clearly show the location; pair with an improved ground-plot positioning method.
  - R8: Subdivide upland land classes (e.g., 102 upland grassland) into refined categories (upland improved vs. upland grassland) to reduce ambiguity.
  - R9: Introduce a dedicated code for lowland rush pasture to improve land-use specificity.
  - R10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct primary vegetation type and ensure it has a defined primary code.
  - R11: Boundaries: restrict primary boundary coding to hedge presence; use qualifying codes for species composition to reduce mismatches.
  - R12: Simplify and focus mapping on the most prevalent species; reduce emphasis on detailed cover of less dominant species to improve reproducibility; provide guidance on which species to record for land-use mapping.

- Mapping and data standards implications
  - Primary land-use codes provide robust population-level consistency; boundary and qualitative codes require clearer definitions and training.
  - Expand the coding framework to accommodate more precise upland and wetland vegetation types; improve differentiation between categories like upland grassland vs. upland meadow and wet heath.
  - Limit and standardize cover data to top species per parcel to improve repeatability; only record multiple dominant species with clear rules.
  - Record and utilize only the most critical qualifiers to reduce coding ambiguity and inter-operator variation.

- Conclusions for data leaders and future surveys
  - Photographic documentation and plate-based plot marking substantially improve relocation accuracy and data reliability.
  - Seasonal and annual climatic variation strongly influence species lists; QA should ideally occur in the same season and year as the original survey.
  - The mapping framework for land use and vegetation should emphasize clearly defined primary codes, with reduced emphasis on exhaustive species-level cover to enhance reproducibility.
  - Ongoing QA should target key taxonomic groups prone to misidentification (grasses and bryophytes) and integrate year-specific training to handle seasonal variability.
  - The study demonstrates the value of cross-year QA to understand data-system performance, informing better data governance, metadata practices, and future data products.

- Overall impact for data governance
  - Highlights the importance of standardized field protocols, robust metadata, and transparent coding schemes to enable data reuse and comparability across time.
  - Underlines the need for dedicated QA cycles aligned with the data collection timeline and for documenting sources of error to inform uncertainty in data products.
