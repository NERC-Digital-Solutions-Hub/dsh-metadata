# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Overview
- A comprehensive field survey program to map land cover, vegetation, physiography, boundaries, buildings, and associated features across England and Wales, supporting GIS-ready map products and long-term change monitoring.
- Combines ground truthing (field plots) with aerial photography interpretation and standardized data recording to enable consistent, repeatable mapping and analysis.

## Sampling design and fieldwork planning
- Six groups of sample squares were created and allocated to six ITE Research Stations; about 85 squares per group.
- Total of 512 squares planned for 1990; 128 new squares and 128 previously unsurveyed in 1984/77-78 sessions.
- Each square requires roughly three survey days on average; flexible scheduling with travel-time considerations and no overtime (time off in lieu for large overtime).
- Clear procedures for permission and access to land; protocol for refusals to minimize wasted effort and determine replacements.

## Equipment and field logistics
- Equipment provided by Merlewood (FAB field assessment booklets, aerial photos, maps, weather gear, marker plates) and by local ITE stations (maps, basic field gear, camera, etc.).
- Personal gear and owner/landowner information collected; ownership data recorded for each land parcel within the square.

## General field survey procedure
- Arrival assessment: gauge access, likely problems, and plan a route for full square coverage.
- Obtain permission for access to the entire square where possible.
- Ensure complete and clear recording with post-survey checks for omissions.

## Permissions and landowner engagement
- Obtain access permissions to all parts of the square to avoid data loss.
- Inform and engage farmers/landowners; maintain courteous contact and document ownership details and cooperation levels.
- If access is refused for part or all of a square, predefined contingency rules apply (replace square, or continue with accessible parts).

## Data recording: Field Assessment Booklets (FAB)
- The survey comprises mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- FABs are the primary data collection tool; they consist of structured pages, maps, and coding boxes.
- For each square: ownership information, farmer interactions, physiography, inland water features, land use, boundaries, and other landscape features.
- Neatly completed FABs are essential; neatness and legibility affect downstream data processing and analysis.

## Mapping and data coding (6.1)
- Mapping is done on enlarged 1:10,000 maps; data are recorded using a combination of primary and secondary codes to capture complex mixtures.
- Alpha codes (uppercase) represent combinations of numeric codes to save space and enhance data richness.
- Certain boundaries (actual vs. interpreted) and features are clearly annotated; misalignments between field evidence and API guidance can be overridden by on-ground judgment.
- Minimum mapping units and cross-referencing rules ensure consistency (e.g., minimum 1/25 ha units; 20 m minimum boundary lengths).

### Aerial photograph interpretation (API) (6.1.1)
- API supports identification of features not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundary updates, etc.).
- Dashed lines indicate API-identified boundaries; crosses mark isolated features; diamonds indicate no longer present boundaries.

### Filling in the FAB (6.1.2)
- FAB pages are completed in a consistent order; each page records a square number, location, ownership, and a detailed coding of vegetation and land cover.
- Use of primary and secondary codes, with rules for dominant codes, mosaics, and 25–50/50–75/75–95% cover categories.
- Narrative notes accompany complex or doubtful classifications; supporting sketches and photos accompany entries.

## Plot types and field methods (6.2, 6.2.2–6.2.5)
- 6.2.1 Vegetation sampling context: quadrats and linear plots form the backbone of vegetation data collection; permanent markers (metal plates) enable relocation across surveys.
- Quadrats:
  - Five large quadrats per square: 200 m2 total, nested 4 m2 and smaller plots to capture vegetation structure.
  - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) placed in natural/semi-natural land cover types in each square.
  - Permanent marking adjacent to quadrats for relocation; detailed sketching and photography required.
  - Location decisions consider habitat representativeness and potential changes to land use.
- Linear plots (6.2.3):
  - Up to 5 linear plots per square for hedgerows (H), streamside (S), and roadsides (R); width typically 1 m.
  - Boundary plots located along the nearest boundary features; relocation rules for hedgerows, streams, and roads follow 1978 guidelines.
  - Additional verge plots (R1–R3) to sample road verges of different road types and conditions.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots (6.2.4): detailed guidelines to locate hedge, roadside, and stream plots relative to field features; adjustments when features are changed or missing.
- Species identification guidelines (6.2.5): species-level recording preferred, with accepted combinations where identification is ambiguous; inclusion of bryophytes and lichens with restricted lists.

## Vegetation sampling specifics
- Plot types include:
  - 200 m2 large quadrats and nested sub-quadrats
  - 2 m x 2 m small quadrats
  - Linear plots across hedges, streams, and roadsides
  - Boundary plots linked to dominant vertical feature
- Protocols for marking, measuring, and recording plant species, cover percentages (in 5% increments), and occasionally descriptive notes for complex mosaics.
- Permanent markers, field sketches, and photography accompany each plot for future relocation and analysis.

## Data and specimen handling
- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP) from standing and flowing waters; uses sieve-based collection, formalin preservation, and labeling with square, date, and surveyor information.
- Photographic record for vegetation plots to capture general appearance and landmark context.

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- All vegetation plots photographed with plot number clearly visible; photographs linked to FAB entries.
- End-of-day data checks to minimize omissions; FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.

## GIS implications and products
- Produces rich, multi-layer map data: land cover types, physiography, boundaries, vegetation types, ownership, and land-use characteristics.
- Data are designed to be integrated into GIS workflows with standardized codes, enabling spatial analyses, change detection over time, and integration with satellite imagery.
- Two-tier approach links bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing for improved land-use modelling and landscape pattern detection.
- Emphasizes data standardisation, metadata completeness, and repeatability to ensure robust GIS-derived insights.
