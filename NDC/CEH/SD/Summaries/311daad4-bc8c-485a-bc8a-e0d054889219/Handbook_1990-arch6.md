# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardise data collection for land use and rural vegetation to update land-use databases, monitor changes, and support analyses and modelling of ecological systems.
  - Combine bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) to produce current, shareable data products and to enable pattern detection in the countryside.
  - Track changes over time through repeated resurveys and a hierarchical data framework.

- Study design and sampling
  - Survey of 512 square sites (6 ITE research station teams), divided into six groups; each team manages about 85 squares.
  - The project includes both new sites and revisits to prior sites to build long-term datasets.
  - Two-tier data approach:
    - Mapping and recording of land cover and landscape features on 1:10,000 maps.
    - Field recording of vegetation, boundaries, ownership, physiography, and other attributes via Field Assessment Booklets (FABs).
  - Emphasis on standardisation to minimise observer variability; quality control built into field handbook and procedures.

- Data products and coding
  - FABs: Field Assessment Booklets comprising map overlays, ownership, farmer information, physiography, and vegetation data; designed for neat, interpretable data capture.
  - Data codes: Extensive primary and secondary coding system for land cover, boundaries, trees, crops, and other features; alpha-numeric coding to compress map annotations (e.g., letters representing combined codes).
  - Universal/code system: Includes universal codes (e.g., 888 for new features, 999 for no longer present) to support cross-map consistency and data integrity.
  - Outputs include:
    - Annotated 1:10,000 maps with coded attributes
    - FABs and associated field notes
    - Photography of vegetation plots for contextual reference
    - A permanent marking system for plot relocation and long-term tracking

- Field procedures and data recording
  - Permissions and access
    - Seek permissions from landowners/farmers to access all parts of each square; failure to obtain access can lead to abandoning or rerouting plots.
    - Maintain contact and document ownership details, with guidance on how to handle refusals or limited access.
  - Equipment
    - FABs, aerial photographs, labelled maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers (metal plates), tapes, navigation aids, and personal gear.
  - General survey procedure
    - On arrival: assess site, secure access, plan a route enabling full square examination, and allow time for post-recording review.
  - Data recording workflow (FAB)
    - Maintain square series numbers on pages; use pencils where possible for durability and reworkability.
    - Record ownership, farmer interactions, physiography, and land-use attributes.
    - Attach field sketches and notes to FABs; record quantitative observations using predefined codes and percentages.
  - Mapping and data capture
    - Mapping focuses on marking up 6" (1:10,000) maps with data codes; combination of primary and secondary codes used to describe features.
    - Boundaries, vegetation types, and land-use categories must be clearly defined and linked in a logical order (e.g., boundaries precede related codes).
    - Aerial photo interpretation (API) supports feature identification, boundary delineation, and updates for new buildings, roads, etc., with field-verified ground-truthing.
  - Plot and sample types
    - Large quadrats: 200 m2 (two nested 4 m2, etc.) for vegetation mapping; located to best represent habitat; permanent markers placed for relocation.
    - Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m plots in natural/semi-natural land types to supplement large quadrats.
    - Linear plots: up to 5 plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; located relative to dominant vertical feature; marked with permanent plates; used to capture linear vegetation patterns.
    - Boundary, streamside, roadside, and verge plots: location rules ensure representative sampling across road verges, hedges, and watercourses; special attention to distance between plots and to boundaries.
  - Vegetation sampling and species data
    - Record vegetation using a predefined “200 common species” list with optional unlisted species; use 5% cover categories and note presence/absence, with 0–100% cover combinations allowed (layers may exceed 100% when mosaics occur).
    - Separate handling for ground cover types (grasses, forbs, mosses/lichens) with explicit codes for dominant species, cover proportions, and habitat context.
    - Use of age, height, and canopy codes to describe woodland and tree stands; separate woodland codes for different canopy types and management status.
  - 6.2.5 Species identification
    - Recognise that some species are difficult to separate; allow predefined species combinations to maintain consistency across observers.
  - Sampling and data handling
    - 200 m2 large quadrats, 5 x 200 m2 quadrats placed strategically; nested smaller quadrats (4 m2, etc.) for detailed recording.
    - Permanent markers and sketches to document location and orientation; photographs accompany data entries.
  - Photography and photography protocols
    - Photograph every vegetation plot; include plot number and prominent landmarks; photographs support future interpretation and data validation.

- Field data management and quality control
  - Emphasis on standardised field procedures and an accompanying Field Handbook to ensure consistent data collection across observers and years.
  - Quality control measures include consistent recording practices, standardised plot relocations, and documented changes in land use or vegetation.
  - Data handling flow: complete FABs in the field, transcribe to maps if necessary only in exceptional circumstances, and return FABs and samples to Merlewood for processing.

- Freshwater and sampling programs
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE): standardized procedures described in a separate handbook; sampling targets flowing waters within squares.
  - NELUP sampling (Newcastle University): freshwater biota sampling in standing waters (e.g., ponds, lakes) with emphasis on water beetles; sites chosen to reflect characteristic square habitats.
  - Each square should mark freshwater sampling sites clearly on the map and document the location and site characteristics.

- Post-survey procedures and reporting
  - At day end: review data sheets for omissions; avoid post-hoc transcription unless data damage necessitates it.
  - Return FABs and samples to ITE stations promptly; consolidate and prepare data products for analysis and archiving.

- Timing and outputs
  - The 1990 resurvey reinforces the project’s multi-year, multi-site framework to build a robust dataset for trend analysis and ecological interpretation.
  - Outputs support both local- and national-scale analyses, including maps, datasets, documentation, and archived materials for long-term research.

- Key considerations for data support
  - Manage extensive code lists and ensure accurate field-to-database translation.
  - Maintain meticulous field notes, sketches, and photographs to maximise data usability.
  - Ensure relocation markers are permanent and relocatable, enabling future re-surveys with minimal data loss.
  - Coordinate with multiple stakeholders (landowners, field teams, national research programs) to maintain access, data quality, and timely data return.
