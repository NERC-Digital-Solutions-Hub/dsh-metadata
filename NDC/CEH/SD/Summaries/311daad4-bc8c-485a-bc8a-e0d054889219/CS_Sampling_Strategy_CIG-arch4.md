# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- Overview
  - Documents the ongoing Sampling Strategy and ITE Land Classification developments driving Countryside Survey field sampling through 2007.
  - Emphasizes that current methodology is built on a 30-year evolution of stratified ecological sampling and environmental classification.

- Key concepts for data strategy
  - Stratified sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s varied landscapes.
  - ITE Land Classification: multi-year, environment-based classification used to stratify GB into landscape types (initially 32 classes, later expanded to 40–45 for regional/country reporting).
  - Use of Centre Squares: sampling unit primarily based on 1 km squares (center of 15 x 15 km grid) with surrounding squares allocated to classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) as the multivariate basis for initial land-class grouping.
  - Time-series integrity: framework designed to permit longitudinal assessment of habitat change and land-use dynamics.

- Sampling framework evolution by year
  - 1978 (Initial survey)
    - 1 km square stratification using ISA-based land classes (32 classes).
    - 8 squares per class surveyed; total 256 field squares.
  - 1984 (Second GB land-use survey)
    - 12 squares per class; total 384 squares.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990)
    - Expanded to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Linked with first Land Cover Map of GB; included repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978.
  - 2000 (CS2000)
    - Land Classification revised to separate England+Wales and Scotland for country-level reporting.
    - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit variants; total strata increases to 40.
    - Additional samples added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat focus module introduced.
  - 2007 (CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting: sub-divided Land Classes into country-unit variants (creating 5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata expanded to 45; added 43 Welsh squares to reach minimum representation per Welsh class; England adjustments made to maintain overall balance.
    - Welsh upland habitat module maintained; Wales and England reporting aligned with devolved policy needs.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands module
  - Separate country estimates introduced to deliver England with Wales and Scotland results using country-specific samples.
  - Wales required more detailed Wales-only reporting; upland habitat sampling added to improve precision in upland areas for England and Wales.

- Data quality, consistency, and methodology notes
  - Shifts in Land Classification across surveys can affect national estimates; reporting prefers latest classification for country-specific estimates to maintain internal consistency, though cross-survey comparisons may benefit from using the historic classification in some contexts.
  - Changes to class definitions and sub-divisions influence sample allocation and precision; efforts are made to preserve representative characteristics via near-neighbour class placement when reclassification occurs.

- Outputs and references
  - CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 main reports document methodology, sampling frames, and country-specific results.
  - Acknowledgements and further reading provide credit and deeper methodological context.

- Practical implications for Data Leaders
  - Designs that ensure representativeness across diverse geographies reduce bias and enhance decision support.
  - Time-series analyses depend on stable stratification logic and careful documentation of classification changes and country-unit splits.
  - Metadata needs to capture classification versioning, country-unit definitions, and sample allocations to support reproducibility and cross-year comparability.
  - Cross-country data harmonization (England, Scotland, Wales) requires explicit stratification and adequate sample sizes per class to deliver reliable country-specific estimates.
  - Access to detailed stratification maps, class definitions, and sample counts is essential for evaluating data quality and planning future data initiatives.
