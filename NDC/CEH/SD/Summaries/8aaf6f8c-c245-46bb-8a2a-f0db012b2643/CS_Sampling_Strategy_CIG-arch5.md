# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Shows how the ITE Land Classification has evolved to stratify Great Britain (GB) and underpin time-series habitat estimates.
- Emphasizes the link between past and current surveys and the importance of understanding historical classification and sampling decisions for data use and governance.

## Core Concepts and Approach
- Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative samples and minimize bias.
- Use of Land Classification to create strata that reflect ecological and land-use variation.
- Sampling units based on 1 km squares; initial classification built from environmental attributes rather than species data.
- Centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid selected for classification; surrounding squares also allocated to classes to extend the stratification.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and Sampling Frameworks
- 1978 (The Beginning)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used on environmental data from 1228 centre squares to produce 32 land classes.
  - 4 surrounding squares per centre square classified, giving 6039 km^2 of classification context.
  - Eight 1 km squares per class surveyed (total 256 squares) for national estimates.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - Framework unchanged but expanded to 12 km squared per land class (total 384 squares); eight previously visited retained.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections included.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated vegetation quadrats recorded; Land Cover Map linked to this program.
  - National estimates based on the revised 1990 classification.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
  - GB-wide classification updated to enable separate Scottish reporting; Land Classes increased to 40.
  - Major rework to support regional estimates; national results published (CS1990 main report follow-ups).
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; Fifth Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements driven further adjustments.
  - Introduction of Wales-specific country-unit subdivisions (5 new Welsh sub-classes; total 45 strata).
  - Additional Welsh squares added to ensure representation; English squares adjusted to maintain comparability.
  - Upland habitat module added to improve Wales and England upland estimates.
  - England adjustments: some classes left with fewer squares, but scoping studies indicated acceptable precision.

## Sampling Details and Country-Specific Adjustments
- England & Wales and Scotland
  - Earlier designs used a 32-class scheme; subsequent updates created country-specific sub-schemes to support England, Wales, Scotland reporting.
  - Wales required more targeted sampling due to policy/legislation needs; additional Welsh squares ensured at least six samples per Welsh class.
  - Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with additional GB-wide or country-specific samples.
- Upland Module
  - An additional module in CS2000 added 30 squares in upland classes to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.
- Table/Map Outputs
  - Across surveys, land class maps and detailed tables show class distribution, sample counts, and sampling rates by country and class.
  - Figures illustrate revised land-class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland, and the distribution of sample squares across the GB.

## Data Outputs, Documentation, and Reproducibility
- Primary outputs include:
  - National estimates of habitat area by land class, derived from mean habitat area per square times area of each land class.
  - Time-series data showing changes in land-class distribution and habitat features.
  - Maps and tables detailing class definitions, sample allocations, and sampling rates (1:x).
- Documentation emphasizes methodological transparency:
  - Note on national estimates: changing land classifications affects consistency; within a survey, the latest classification is preferred for consistency with that survey’s aims, while cross-survey consistency may favor the original 1990 classification.
  - History of sampling and classification changes across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

## Data Governance Implications for Data Stewards
- Provenance and Versioning
  - The dataset spans multiple decades with evolving land classifications; maintain clear versioning for both the Land Classification and the sampling frame by survey year.
  - Document which classification version was used for each national estimate and how country-unit estimates were derived.
- Metadata and Documentation
  - Capture detailed metadata on:
    - Land Class definitions (including Welsh/English/Scottish subdivisions).
    - Sampling units and frames (which squares were included or reclassified in each version).
    - Spatial extent and area calculations for each class.
    - Upland module inclusion and its impact on estimates.
- Data Consistency and Interoperability
  - When combining data across years, account for changes in classification schemes and country-unit definitions.
  - Provide guidance on converting or mapping between classifications when users require cross-year comparisons.
- Data Quality and Representation
  - Be aware of under-representation issues in certain classes or countries (e.g., Wales in earlier CS2000 framework) and how additional samples addressed these gaps.
  - Maintain documentation of sampling adequacy thresholds (e.g., minimum squares per class) and the rationale for any deviations.
- Access, Reuse, and Transparency
  - Ensure access to both the classifications and the sampling design details to support reproducibility of national estimates.
  - Publish and link to supporting figures, tables, and methodological notes to facilitate reuse by other researchers and data stewards.

## Challenges and Considerations for Data Stewards
- Incomplete alignment across time due to evolving classifications and country-unit definitions.
- Balancing representativeness with practical sampling constraints, especially for Wales and upland areas.
- Ensuring that large, evolving datasets remain navigable and that legacy classifications remain interpretable alongside newer ones.
- Coordinating cross-country reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) while maintaining a coherent GB-wide narrative.
