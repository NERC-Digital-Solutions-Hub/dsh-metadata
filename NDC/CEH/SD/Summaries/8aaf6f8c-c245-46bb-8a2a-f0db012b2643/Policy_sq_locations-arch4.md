Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Current CS partners listed (CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued landowner access for future surveys.
- Requests for information handled by CEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Access, release, and precision levels
- Approximate location: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid square) released under licence.
- Six-digit (precise) locations: released only in very exceptional circumstances; CEH may preprocess analyses to avoid release.
- Within-square spatial data (maps of habitats, etc.) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms.

## Specific conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at licence end.
- No data released to third parties that could compromise confidentiality; data cannot be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- May require evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP equivalence requirements than six-digit releases; licenses for spatial data include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Roles, responsibilities, and governance
- Decisions on exceptional releases are made by CEH on behalf of NERC, applying policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with terms; approvals/denials follow statutory procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications, decisions, and justifications.
- CEH to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; outside requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data; CEH may provide scientific input for defined needs, potentially via collaborative or paid arrangements.
