# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy governs access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- Aims to maximise public-interest use of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Applies only to location data; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (on behalf of NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, Countryside Council for Wales, Scottish Natural Heritage.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for future surveys, scientific sampling integrity, environmental protection, and continuing landowner permission.
- Public-interest rationale; requests handled by CEH for NERC and CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## Circumstances and precision for release
- Access may indicate whether survey squares fall within pre-defined areas (country, county, ITE land class, environmental zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to identify the relevant 10x10 km grid square.
- Precise six-digit grid references require exceptional justification; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing precise locations; very exceptional external releases require demonstration that the external IP/data carries equal or higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats, linear features) could reveal square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained to fulfill other responsibilities.
- At licence end, licensees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data may be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan or visit CS squares or to check landowner compliance within squares.
- If requested, licensees must show project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP-confidentiality criteria of six-digit releases.
- A clause prevents licensees from using the data to derive precise square locations or to claim such capabilities.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows FOI Act and Environmental Regulations procedures.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners summarising licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- CEH aims to support internal processing needs within reasonable timeframes; moderate demand may be accommodated; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
