# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Scope and aim
  - Maximises the public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - Current CS partners include CEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

- Why locations are confidential
  - Protects sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, which are essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and continued landowner permission.

- When locations may be released and precision levels
  - 4-digit grid references: allowed under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square a survey square falls in.
  - 6-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; requires demonstrating that external data/products have equal or higher confidentiality protection.
  - Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional-circumstance terms as six-digit references.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access restricted to named individuals with legitimate need.
  - Licences are finite and for specific projects; data must not be retained for other responsibilities.
  - End of licensing period: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
  - No sharing with third parties that could compromise square locations; avoid using data to plan visits or verify landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
  - Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality level of six-digit releases.
  - License terms prohibit attempts to deduce exact square locations from the data.

- Responsibilities and process
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC and the CS partners, decides on exceptional releases.
  - CEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data with appropriate clauses; must be signed by an authorised senior signatory.
  - If approval is denied, CEH follows UK FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual report on access applications and decision grounds to CS partners.
  - Reasonable preprocessing support by CEH may be provided within moderate demand; other organisations are handled case-by-case.
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to data use; CEH involvement may be negotiated case-by-case and may vary by collaboration or payment.

- Practical guidance for GIS specialists
  - Consider requesting four-digit grid references for policy or planning work that does not require precise locations.
  - Plan data handling to maintain confidentiality: secure storage, controlled access, and destruction at project end.
  - Engage CEH early to understand requirements, licensing terms, and any preprocessing support available.
