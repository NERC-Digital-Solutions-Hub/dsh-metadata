# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Overview and purpose
- Standardized field recording guidelines to monitor environmental change and support time-series analysis.
- Data are captured on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) using CS1990/CS2000 codes, with emphasis on data quality, comparability across observers, and policy-relevant reporting.
- Covers soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater biota sampling, vegetation photography, GPS data collection, and post-survey data management.

## Sampling framework (CS2000)
- Three main sampling types conducted within the CS2000 framework:
  - Soil sampling
  - Calluna vulgaris sampling
  - Freshwater biota sampling (conducted by Institute of Freshwater Ecology staff)
- Sampling is integrated within 1 km square CS2000 survey framework, with standardized procedures to enable robust, comparable datasets across time and space.

## Soil sampling procedures (Section 10)
- Purpose: build a national, spatially referenced soil dataset for baseline soil quality indicators (pH, loss on ignition, heavy metals), soil fauna diversity, and microbiological status.
- Sampling design:
  - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square (within each square) for chemistry, fauna, and microbiology analyses.
  - In each X-plot center, three soil samples are collected per square: one long black pipe at centre, and two short white pipes at 15 cm east and 15 cm west of the centre.
- Field procedures:
  - Use three pipes per centre plot to collect soil from >5 cm depth.
  - Samples are bagged, labeled, and posted or delivered to ITE Merlewood; short-life samples posted promptly; longer samples collected by regional co-ordinators.
  - Detailed step-by-step method for sampling, handling, sealing, and post-dispatch is provided.
- Equipment and packaging:
  - Specified items provided to teams (e.g., pipes, aluminium plates, trowels, sealable bags, envelopes) with precise packing instructions to align with ITE Merlewood submission.
- Data handling:
  - FABs document plot location, sampling point, and sample identifiers; GPS coordinates may accompany soil data for precise geolocation.

## Calluna sampling (within Section 10)
- Purpose: assess foliar nitrogen and potential nitrogen deposition impacts on Calluna vulgaris across GB.
- Sampling method:
  - In squares containing Calluna vulgaris, collect current year’s growth (CYG) shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from multiple plants.
  - Random selection of CYG shoots; label and seal samples; allow for drying if wet.
- Despatch:
  - Samples posted to ITE Merlewood or delivered via reporting station; retain receipts for T&S claims.

## Freshwater sampling (Section 10)
- Conducted by accredited Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) staff, coordinating with CS2000 field survey teams.
- Timed integration ensures synchronized data collection across field activities.

## Photography (Section 11)
- Equipment: Cameras provided per team; initial supply of film; additional film purchased as needed.
- Coverage: Photograph every vegetation plot to document appearance and location relative to landmarks.
- Reference features: must be obvious, unique, permanent, and visible in future visits.
- Plot labeling: photographs must include square and plot numbers on a board placed at the plot edge; composition aims for clear, usable references with minimal sky.

## Procedures after survey (Section 12)
- Post-survey checks:
  - Review data sheets to ensure all features are captured; avoid retrospective transposition unless essential due to damage.
  - Arrange for transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations as soon as possible.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data (GPS data collection guidance)
- Pre-use checks:
  - Ensure sufficient satellite visibility (at least four satellites; aim for PDOP below 6 for 3D fixes).
  - Manage power and battery life; use external battery if needed.
- Position recording:
  - Stationary positions (plots) and moving features (boundaries) can be recorded with appropriate start/stop procedures.
- File naming:
  - Each plot or feature requires a unique data file named with square and plot identifiers (e.g., 501X4.PSE); new features receive distinct codes (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
- Logging operations:
  - Steps to start/stop logging, monitor time elapsed, and manage data capture.
- Hardware tips:
  - Tips for improving signal quality in obstructed areas (e.g., elevating antenna) and battery charging procedures.
- Attribute reference:
  - A reference sheet accelerates entering the correct plot identifiers to streamline data entry.

## Plant species coding (excerpts from Ferns, Forbs/Woody species, Mosses/Lichens)
- Field coding uses standardized abbreviations for plant taxa (e.g., Athy/At various fern and flowering plant names) to populate FABs efficiently.
- The table provides numerous abbreviations and cross-references for:
  - Ferns
  - Forbs/woody species
  - Mosses/lichens
- The system supports complex taxa and multi-species entries, with guidance on handling borderline identifications and grouping codes when necessary.

## Outputs and data integration
- Outputs include maps (OS base maps and theme maps), CAT-coded data forms aligned with CS1990/CS2000 coding, and broad/habitat-based change reporting for biodiversity policy and sustainable development indicators.
- The handbook emphasizes time-series consistency, standardized observer methods, and robust change-detection capabilities to support environmental monitoring and policy evaluation.
