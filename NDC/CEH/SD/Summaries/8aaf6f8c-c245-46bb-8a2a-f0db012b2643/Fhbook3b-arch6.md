# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Purpose and scope
  - Defines guidelines for CS2000 Countryside Survey, building on CS1990 to monitor land use, habitat change, and landscape features across Britain.
  - Emphasises standardisation, data quality, and time-series consistency to support policy, biodiversity monitoring, and land-management insights.
  - Outputs include mapping, field notes (FABs), and plot-level vegetation data for end-user exploration and policy-relevant insights.

- Aims and scope
  - Re-survey and extend time-series data to monitor changes in land cover, habitats, and landscape features.
  - Link field data with satellite/remote sensing for land-cover mapping; create ground-truth data to support policy and biodiversity objectives.
  - Provide standardized field procedures to minimise observer variation and improve data comparability over time.

- Sampling design and planning
  - Builds on CS1990 with a core sample of 508 squares, expanded to 568 squares for CS2000, plus upland sampling additions.
  - Squares allocated across six ITE Research Stations; teams manage roughly 95 squares each.
  - Plans include re-surveying prior squares for time-series continuity, adding new squares for new classes, and country-specific stratification (England, Scotland, Wales, Isle of Man).
  - Two-tier approach integrates ground surveys with remote sensing; efficient deployment and representation across land classes are prioritized.

- Site visits, permissions, and safety
  - Flexible site operations; minimize unnecessary revisits.
  - Prior landowner permissions are essential; without permission, work may halt or squares may be replaced.
  - Engagement includes standard information sheets and on-day contact; track ownership and stakeholder cooperation.
  - Safety and equipment accountability are emphasized.

- Equipment and field safety
  - Provides an extensive equipment list (FABs, GPS, maps, measuring tools, safety gear, marking plates, cameras, etc.).
  - Emphasises equipment care, safety, and reporting of damaged items; field safety and correct gear for varied conditions.

- General field procedures
  - Two square types: old (time-series) and new (baseline mapping).
  - For new squares: map all features and stock; for old squares: map changes since 1990.
  - Ensure permissions, full square coverage, and documentation of access or data issues.

- Data recording, mapping framework, and outputs
  - Three core data components: mapping (land cover and landscape features), plots with vegetation data, and sampling plots.
  - Mapping refinements include: mapping change only, broad habitat reporting (BAP framework) with upland vs. lowland adjustments, and monitoring of upland/unenclosed areas.
  - Distinguishes Mappable Broad Habitats (woodlands, boundaries, arable) from Plottable Broad Habitats (upland/unenclosed) to guide change recording.
  - Ponds: optional pond mapping for squares with ponds in 1990; note changes.
  - Mapping methodology includes de novo mapping for new squares, change-only mapping for old squares, and a three-tier system (CS1990 base codes, CS1990 parcel references, CS2000 change identifiers) with cross-referencing across maps and forms.
  - Aerial photographs provide guidance; field judgement is used where on-ground evidence differs.

- Plotting and field data collection
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) is used; emphasises neatness, legibility, and consistent coding.
  - Plot types (core vegetation sampling):
    - X PLOTS: Areal plots (central 200 m2 main plot plus nested subplots).
    - Y PLOTS: Small 2x2 m plots for baseline sampling in new squares.
    - U PLOTS: Unenclosed plots (2x2 m) in plottable habitats.
    - B PLOTS: Boundary plots (200 m2) at field boundaries.
    - A PLOTS: Arable margin plots (100x1 m) outward from B plots.
    - H PLOTS: Hedgerow plots (10x1 m) along hedges; up to two per square.
    - D PLOTS: Hedgerow diversity plots (woody species diversity).
    - S/W PLOTS: Streamside plots along watercourses; banks and water edge sampling.
    - R/V PLOTS: Roadsides/verge plots (10x1 m) along roads/tracks.
  - Plot relocation and marking
    - Permanent marker plates (metal) used to relocate old plots; rely on plans, photos, and GPS.
    - New plots placed using predefined rules relative to features; avoid mean high water marks where applicable.
    - Parcel numbers prefixed by theme (P, A, F, B, S) to maintain traceability for new habitat changes.
  - Recording guidance
    - Standardised species lists (top-200) with allowances for additional unlisted species via nested plots and 5% cover bands.
    - Cover estimates in 5% bands; careful documentation for vascular plants and bryophytes.
    - Up to three primary codes per unit; secondary/descriptive codes as needed; special handling for mosaics and combinations.
    - Bryophytes/lichens limited to an approved list with explicit cover values.
  - Photographs and GPS
    - Photos of every vegetation plot; reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within view for future visits.
    - Photos include square/plot numbers on a marker board; composition aims to include plot and landmarks.

- Data quality, standardisation, and training
  - Standardisation of data collection across observers is critical for detecting change.
  - Ongoing training and quality control (QC) are integral; CS2000 includes explicit QC measures and documentation guidelines.
  - unusual or doubtful categories should be documented with notes or qualifiers to preserve data integrity.

- Annexes and supplementary details
  - Annex 1 covers collecting GPS data (recording, file naming, PDOP considerations, and handling moving vs stationary features).

- Practical takeaways for Data Support
  - CS2000 provides a codified framework for standardized data collection enabling reliable time-series analyses of land cover, habitats, and landscape changes.
  - Delivers structured data outputs (maps, FABs, plot-level vegetation data) that support data exploration, dashboard-style analysis, and policy-relevant insights.
  - Emphasises data provenance, repeatability, and traceability through parcel numbers, mapping codes, and relocation procedures.
  - Facilitates integration with remote sensing and biodiversity action plans, with clear reporting pathways at broad habitat and site-specific levels.

- Section 10 and evolving sampling programs
  - Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, and freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
  - Soil sampling in 1 km squares involves five replicate samples per square in central X-plots; detailed protocols for sampling, packaging, and post.
  - Calluna sampling targets foliar nitrogen concentrations to assess nitrogen deposition impacts; standardized collection and despatch procedures.
  - Freshwater sampling may occur concurrently with CS2000 fieldwork under IFE coordination.

- Photography, post-survey procedures, and GPS annex
  - Photography protocol documented to ensure consistent representation and reference for plots.
  - Post-survey steps emphasize data review, avoiding transposition unless necessary, and timely transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations.
  - GPS annex provides step-by-step data collection, file naming, and troubleshooting, including PDOP guidance and handling obstructions.
