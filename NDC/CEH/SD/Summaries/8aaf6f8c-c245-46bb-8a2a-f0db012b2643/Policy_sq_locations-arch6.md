# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Sets rules for access to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares.
- All other Countryside Survey (CS) data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS data while protecting survey integrity and landowner anonymity.

## Partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- The Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- Protect sampling representativeness and goodwill of landowners.
- Preserve scientific integrity of sampling and future survey permissions.
- Public interest supports confidentiality; handled under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Release allowed to show if squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to indicate which 10x10 km grid square contains the CS square.
- Six-digit grid references (precise): only released after CEH pre-processing analysis to avoid actual release; otherwise exceptionally released under licence with strict conditions.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats/linear features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.

## Specific licensing and usage conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must be destroyed and confirmed destroyed at licence end.
- No release to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check individual landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases, but still prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.
- Licences include clauses preventing attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, CEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- CEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing access applications and decision grounds.
- CEH can provide pre-processing support within a reasonable timeframe for CS partnerships; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult CEH before using data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
