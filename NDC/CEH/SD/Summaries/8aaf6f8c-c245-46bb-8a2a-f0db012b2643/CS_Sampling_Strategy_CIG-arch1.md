# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy used in Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Emphasizes linking sampling to the ITE Land Classification, a stratification framework developed over 30 years to ensure representative national, regional, and country-level estimates of countryside habitats and land use.
  - Describes how earlier methods evolved and why continuity with previous surveys is important for detecting change.

- Core concepts and rationale
  - Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage across ecological variation.
  - Stratification based on the ITE Land Classification, which groups land into discrete classes using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, land cover, etc.).
  - Sampling unit historically centered on 1 km squares; the center square of a 15 x 15 km grid was classified, with surrounding squares also allocated to classes to improve accuracy.
  - Use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) and multivariate classification to define land classes and guide sample allocation.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (historical overview)
  - Early work (1970s) established a national sampling framework using a 1 km square unit and a stratified, random approach.
  - 32 original ITE Land Classes established from central 1 km squares (1228 analyzed; 6039 squares total when including surrounding squares).
  - 1978 Countryside Survey used eight samples per class (256 squares total) for national habitat area estimates.
  - 1984 survey expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total) with continuance of the original classification for national estimates.
  - 1990 survey revised to an All Squares Land Classification, integrating data from all 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1990–2000: efforts to extend the Land Classification to cover every square in GB, using surrogates and multivariate methods; some class reassignments occurred, with generally similar class characteristics despite reclassification.
  - 2000: CS2000 introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) to support policy needs; creation of 40 strata through class subdivision and aggregation; additional squares added to improve representation of newer classes.
  - 2007: CS2007 added Wales-only reporting capability; created five new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares allocated; uplands habitat module added to improve upland estimates; Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates.

- Sampling framework by survey year
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per class) across 32 Land Classes; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square times area of each class.
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class) across the same framework; results published later.
  - CS1990: 508 squares; Land Classification revised to All Squares approach; urban/sea corrections applied; broader data collected (repeat quadrats, etc.); national estimates based on 1990 classification.
  - CS2000: substantial restructuring to support separate country estimates; 40 strata created via class subdivision and aggregation; additional 19–30 squares allocated to ensure representation of new classes; upland module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates; Wales receives more targeted sampling due to devolution and policy needs; comprehensive country maps published.
  - CS2007: Wales-focused adjustments to enable Wales-only reporting; five Welsh country-unit classes created; 43 additional Welsh squares allocated; England maintains a smaller increase; Wales sampling emphasized to meet country-level reporting requirements; uplands module retained with expanded sampling in upland-related Land Classes.

- Country-specific reporting and uplands
  - England, Scotland, and Wales each receive country-specific sampling configurations to support policy and regulatory needs.
  - CS2000 established separate country estimates by subdividing Land Classes into country-unit versions and, where needed, aggregating small subgroups within a country.
  - CS2007 further enhanced Wales reporting by introducing Welsh-specific Land Class subdivisions and increasing Welsh sampling, while England did not receive equivalent increases in all classes.
  - An uplands module was added in CS2000 (and continued in CS2007) to improve habitat estimates in upland and marginal upland areas.

- Data practice and dissemination
  - Documentation emphasizes tracking data sources and ensuring datasets are discoverable and usable, including metadata provision.
  - Results are presented with maps of Land Class distributions and with class-based sampling details to support interpretation and replication.

- Endnotes and references (summary)
  - The strategy is anchored in a long lineage of ITE Land Classification development and Countryside Survey iterations.
  - Key references document the evolution of the Land Classification, sampling design, and national vs. country-unit estimation approaches.
  - Acknowledgments recognize contributions from DETR/DOE, CEH, and collaborators in shaping the sampling strategy and statistical guidance.

- Practical takeaways for analysts
  - The Countryside Survey relies on a robust, repeatedly updated land-class-based stratification to produce representative habitat and land-use estimates at GB and country levels.
  - Stratification changes over time (32 to 40 to 45–46 classes; country-unit subdivisions) reflect policy needs and the need for reliable Wales- and England-specific reporting.
  - Sampling intensity and the number of squares per class have progressively increased or been adjusted to improve precision, with special attention to upland habitats and Wales’ country-specific reporting.
  - Data handling emphasizes transparency, reproducibility, and reusability through clear documentation of data sources, classifications, and sampling designs.
