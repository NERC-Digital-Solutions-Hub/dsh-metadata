# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- The CS2000 Field Handbook provides standardized guidelines for planning, conducting, and recording countryside surveys across Great Britain, focusing on land cover, habitat mapping, and vegetation data to support time-series updates and environmental policy.
- It builds on CS1990 methodologies to monitor changes across 508 squares (1 x 1 km) and links survey work to biodiversity policy frameworks (e.g., UK Biodiversity Action Plans).

## Data model and core data elements

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as the primary data recording tool, combining maps with coded entries per square.
- Three main data components:
  - Mapping: spatial annotations using standard codes for areas, lines, and points.
  - Plots: multiple plot types (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S/W, R/V) with distinct sizes and contexts.
  - Vegetation data: detailed species lists (top 200 plus unlisted), cover percentages, bryophytes/lichens lists.
- Broad Habitat (BAP) framework used for reporting results and supporting biodiversity monitoring.
- Data linkage emphasizes provenance via parcel numbers, CS1990 parcel codes, primary codes, and New Parcel Numbers; exact locations supported by survey plates, sketches, GPS data, and photos.

## Data standards, coding, and quality control

- Standardized coding system with primary/secondary codes and universal codes (e.g., 999, 888, 555) including BAP translations.
- Change detection focuses on differences in old squares since 1990, with suitable BAPs and plots for different landscape types.
- Emphasis on consistency through standardized field recording and ongoing quality control during CS2000.
- Handling complexity through coded combinations and flexible notes for mosaics or uncertain identifications; specific rules for difficult taxa.
- Change reliability indicators (e.g., 701 genuine change, 702 probable mis-recording) to document data quality.

## Planning, permissions, and governance

- Site visits are planned with grouped sample squares, ensuring time-series consistency through revisits.
- Mandatory landowner/occupier consent; procedures for denied access (replacement square or adjusted scope).
- Ownership and contact data captured on FAB; engagement with landowners for background/context.
- Data provenance, access permissions, ownership records, and stakeholder communications are integral to legal/ethical data handling.

## Data collection workflow and data integrity

- Workflow includes planning/design, field surveying (old vs new squares; map changes; plot/vegetation data), plot relocation, and documentation.
- Post-field processing involves data entry into FAB, cross-checking coverage, and updating maps/theme layers.
- Data quality practices emphasize standardized data entry, mosaic handling guidance, and thorough documentation of atypical categories.

## Data management, storage, and dissemination

- FABs are the primary field data records, complemented by maps and photographs.
- Base mapping uses OS 1:10,000 scales with historical linkages to 1990/1998 sheets; GPS-enabled plotting added in 1998.
- Metadata considerations include provenance (parcel numbers, codes), collection dates, surveyors, and survey duration; cross-theme traceability across CS1990 → CS2000.
- Data sharing supports government and NGO policy work; datasets are designed for reuse, comparability, and long-term discoverability.

## Annexes and supplementary elements

- Annexes describe GPS data collection and interoperability with cross-dataset datasets (e.g., pond mapping integrations).
- Aerial photography conventions and API guidance offer field-interpretation support; field judgment prevails.
- Data capture aids include FAB structure, field codes, and example workflows to support reproducibility and auditability.

## Section 10 – Sampling

- Three sampling types: soil sampling, Calluna sampling, freshwater biota sampling (the latter by IFE staff).
- Soil sampling aims to establish soil quality baselines and diversity indices; five replicate samples per 1 km square across representative Land Class/Land Cover types.
- Sampling procedure focuses on cores taken from center plots within X-plots, with rapid shipment of certain samples to ITE Merlewood for processing; detailed step-by-step methods provided.
- Calluna sampling targets foliar nitrogen to identify regions with nitrogen deposition exceeding critical loads; strict within-square sampling within Calluna-dominated plots.
- Sampling equipment and distribution are organized by regional coordinators; procedures emphasize timely processing and precise documentation.

## Section 11 – Photography

- Each vegetation plot is photographed to capture appearance and relation to landmarks.
- Reference features should be obvious, unique, and permanent; photographs must include square/plot identifiers on a visible board.
- Composition should show the plot with reference features, avoiding excessive sky; examples of proper and improper shots are provided.

## Section 12 – Procedures after survey

- Post-survey checks to ensure no features are omitted; re-mapping and re-recording are discouraged except for damage/spoilage.
- Arrangements for transporting FABs and samples back to ITE stations are outlined to maintain data integrity and timeliness.

## Annex 1 – Collecting GPS data

- Guidelines for battery power, satellite availability (minimum four satellites, PDOP < 6 preferred), and recording stationary vs moving features.
- File naming conventions require square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE) to maintain clear traceability.
- Instructions cover data logging, stopping/starting recordings, and battery management; almanac updates occur automatically if needed.
- Tips on improving signal reception (e.g., elevating the antenna) and navigation of the device interface are provided.

- Overall emphasis: the handbook underlines rigorous standardization, traceability, and documentation to ensure CS2000 datasets are reliable, interoperable, long-lasting, and suitable for discovery, reuse, and policy-relevant analysis.
