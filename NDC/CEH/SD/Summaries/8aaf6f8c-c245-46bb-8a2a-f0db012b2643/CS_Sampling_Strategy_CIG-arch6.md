# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the development of the ITE Land Classification and the sampling framework for the Countryside Survey GB field surveys up to the 2007 cycle.
  - Emphasises continuity with prior surveys, data stratification, and the goal of robust, representative estimates of habitat features and land use.

- Core concepts
  - ITE Land Classification
    - A stratified classification system to divide land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
    - Enables representative sampling by ensuring all parts of the landscape are represented.
    - Early version produced 32 classes; later expansions increased to 40, then 45 to support country-specific reporting.
  - Stratified random sampling
    - Samples are drawn within land classes (strata) to minimize bias and improve precision.
    - Field sampling unit typically 1 km squares; sampling intensity varied across surveys.

- Historical timeline of the sampling strategy and land classification
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st field survey)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to derive 32 land classes from environmental data for about 1 km squares.
    - Centre squares (from a 15 x 15 km grid) classified; surrounding squares (four per centre) also allocated, totaling over 6,000 squares classified.
    - Field survey: 8 squares per land class (256 total); national habitat estimates based on mean habitat area per square x land-class area.
  - 1984 (2nd field survey)
    - Sampling increased to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
    - National estimates still tied to the 1978 Land Classification.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd field survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Repeated vegetation/soils data; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - National estimates published using the revised classification; groundwork for later regional and policy insights.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th field survey)
    - Classification expanded to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
    - National estimates updated accordingly; CS1990 data reinterpreted with the new framework.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey CS2000; 5th field survey)
    - Addressed policy needs for separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and upland habitat reporting.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions; aggregation used where class counts were sparse within a country, creating 40 strata (up from 32).
    - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (and to balance across England and Wales); Wales received special attention with further subdivisions.
    - Upland habitat module introduced to improve accuracy for upland estimates.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting emphasized; devolution required Wales-specific habitat data.
    - Welsh-class subdivision introduced: 5 new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata expanded to 45.
    - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure adequate representation of Welsh classes; some English classes retained lower sampling in response to precision considerations.
    - Updated England, Wales, and Scotland land-class maps and a revised sampling framework map produced.

- How country-specific reporting was achieved
  - England with Wales and Scotland were treated as separate country units for estimates.
  - Land Classes sub-divided into country-unit versions; in some cases, under-represented classes were aggregated with similar classes within a country.
  - Additional samples allocated to ensure adequate representation of new or country-specific classes (e.g., Wales).

- Upland habitat focus
  - CS2000 added a dedicated uplands module with 30 extra squares placed in upland/marginal land classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates.

- Outputs and estimation approach
  - National estimates are derived by summing across land classes: mean habitat area per square in each class × total area of that class, aggregated across all classes.
  - Documentation discusses the comparability of estimates across classifications and surveys, noting that changing the basic Land Classification affects cross-survey consistency.
  - Table 4 provides historical sample sizes per class under the original 1990 Land Classification to illustrate cross-classification comparability.

- Components and resources
  - Tables and figures (e.g., original 32 Land Classes; sample counts; distributions across England, Scotland, and Wales) accompany the narrative, illustrating sampling intensities and framework changes.
  - Acknowledgements recognize contributions from researchers and statisticians across the evolving methodology.

- Takeaways for data-focused users
  - The Countryside Survey’s sampling strategy hinges on a robust, environmentally informed Land Classification to ensure representative field sampling and credible habitat estimates.
  - Over time, the framework evolved to support country-specific reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) and to improve precision in upland habitats, at the cost of increasing complexity in classification and sampling.
  - When comparing results across surveys, note potential differences in Land Classification schemes and country-unit definitions, which can affect national estimates.
