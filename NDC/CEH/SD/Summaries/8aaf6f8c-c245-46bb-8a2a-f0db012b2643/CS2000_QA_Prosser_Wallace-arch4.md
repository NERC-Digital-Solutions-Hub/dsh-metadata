# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose and scope
  - Assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 field work across 38 of 519 squares, with one quarter resurveyed in each square.
  - Focus areas: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, reliability of percentage cover estimates, potential bias in habitat change detection, landuse mapping accuracy, and change recording.
  - Aims to relate CS2000 findings to the CS1990 benchmark and understand observer, plot, and seasonal effects.

- Methods and scope
  - Sampling: 38 squares; 234 plots across nine plot types (quadrats, linear plots, road verges, streamsides, boundaries, arable margins, etc.).
  - Plate/marker relocation: attempted relocation of buried plates; comparison with 1990/1991 QA benchmarks.
  - Data captured: species presence/absence, cover percentages, landcover codes, boundary features, and changes since 1990.

- Key findings: plot relocation and plate recovery
  - Plot relocation success: 86.7% fully relocated; CS2000 surveyors accurately relocated 60%, approximately relocated 25%, and about 15% inadequately relocated.
  - Plate recovery: assessors located 69.3% of plates; additional plates identified in some cases; overall total plot/plate recovery in the QA assessment around 40–45% (with caveats about plates used for new squares and non-duplicate samples).
  - Comparison with CS1990 QA: relocation efficiency lower for CS2000 but still within a reasonable range given eight-year interval and new protocol changes.

- Key findings: species concordance and recording accuracy
  - Overall accuracy: ~73% initial species concordance; ~71% of ~6000 records confirmed as present at resurvey; 2% non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes.
  - Change in species lists: QA generally yielded longer species lists, with increases over CS2000 similar to prior CS1990 QA, indicating consistent observer performance and similar search efficiency.
  - Mis-matches: main contributors include mis-identifications (especially grasses like Poa and Agrostis), overlooked species, and location/orientation errors; seasonal effects also influence results.
  - Frequency analysis: some common grasses and forbs showed substantial discrepancies in frequency counts; however, overall species richness rankings by plot type were broadly aligned between CS2000 and QA.

- Key findings: vegetation cover and change direction
  - Vegetation cover: comparison of cover values shows both agreement and significant differences for some grasses (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Eriophorum vaginatum); several discrepancies linked to season or plot location/orientation.
  - Change direction (DECORANA axis): no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA; axis scores show no consistent shift, implying changes are not systematically biased in one direction.

- Key findings: landcover mapping and landuse changes
  - Landcover codes: primary landcover concordance ~88%; BAP (broad habitat) codes ~77%; overall primary landcover agreement ~87.5%; excluding BAP codes improves concordance to ~91.6%.
  - BAP codes: some systematic challenges in distinguishing broad habitat types and boundaries; boundaries and other land features show good concordance overall.
  - Change in land use: overall change concurrence ~51.4%; about 33.9% of changes were not noted by CS2000; ~14.7% of changes were recorded but not substantiated by assessors. Indicates substantial potential under-recording of changes since 1990, raising concerns about relying on CS2000 change strings alone for change assessment.

- Key findings: boundary features and hedge assessments
  - Primary boundary features: high concordance in boundary coding, with overall concordance around 85%; boundary boundary coding showed strong agreement (code concordance ~92%).
  - Hedge/wall condition: boundary shape/hedge codes showed moderate concordance (about 67.5%), with some mis-match between hedge shape codes and wall codes; new hedge codes had limited success in capturing all variations.

- Hedge diversity and arable plots
  - Hedge diversity: 19 hedge samples; total species 124, common species 92; overall agreement 74.2% and surveyor efficiency 77.4%; mean species per hedge plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.
  - Arable plots: only five plots; concordance was very poor, with substantial seasonal and identification challenges (ruderals and Veronica/Euphorbia frequently misidentified). Recommendation for multiple visits to future arable margin plots.

- Annex and timing data
  - Annex B provides dates of survey and efficiency figures by square, illustrating variability in field efficiency across locations and land classes (LC, LG, MA, UP) and highlighting ongoing QA trends over time.

- Overall data governance implications for Data Leaders
  - General reliability: CS2000 QA demonstrates solid overall data quality and comparability with CS1990, especially in landcover mapping and boundary coding.
  - Key data quality risks: plot relocation/orientation, mis-location of plots, species misidentifications, overlooked species, and changes not captured; seasonal effects influence cover and species presence.
  - Change detection: substantial proportion of changes since 1990 were not captured or substantiated; highlights need for clearer change-capture protocols and enhanced metadata.
  - Mapping and metadata: high concordance in primary land cover; BAP coding requires further calibration; ongoing need for standardized, transparent coding schemes and codified boundary definitions.
  - Recommendations for data strategy
    - Strengthen plot marking and relocation protocols; consider durable markers and standardized relocation procedures.
    - Invest in targeted training on difficult taxa (grasses, mosses) and on accurate location/orientation documentation.
    - Improve change-detection guidelines and provide explicit criteria for when a change is considered real.
    - Enhance arable margin sampling design (multiple visits, seasonal planning) to improve reliability.
    - Maintain rigorous metadata practices for landcover codes, BAP classifications, and boundary features to support long-term comparability.
    - Continue and expand QA to monitor improvements across plot types, with emphasis on areas with historically higher error rates (e.g., arable margins, hedges).
