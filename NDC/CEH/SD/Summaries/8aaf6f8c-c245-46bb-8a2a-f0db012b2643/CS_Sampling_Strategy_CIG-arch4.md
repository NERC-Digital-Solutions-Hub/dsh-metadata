# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year series.
- Built on the ITE Land Classification, which provides an environmental stratification system to ensure representative sampling across Great Britain.
- Emphasizes the need to understand data lineage, maintain time-series comparability, and align sampling with policy and environmental reporting requirements.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- Origins in the early 1970s: stratified ecological sampling using Quadrat-based vegetation data scaled to land areas; Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to form environmental land classes.
- 1975–1978: development of a national ecological survey framework using 1 km square sample units; center squares of a 15x15 km grid identified for classification, with surrounding squares assigned to classes.
- 32 original Land Classes created from environmental attributes; 6039 squares classified when accounting for surrounding squares.
- 1984 revision: framework expanded to sample 12 squares per class (384 total); focus shifts to land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 CS1990: all GB squares classified (All Squares Land Classification); some squares reclassified; first linkage to a Land Cover Map from satellite data.
- 1998 revision: classification extended to enable Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increases to 40.
- 2000 CS2000: introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) with class subdivisions and aggregations to produce 40 strata; additional sampling to improve representation; upland module added later to bolster upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 CS2007: devolution-driven Wales-only reporting necessitates Wales-specific class subdivisions (now five new rural-UK classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increase to 45; Wales receives additional samples to ensure minimum representation; England sampling adjusted to account for Welsh additions; Wales-specific upland module considerations implemented.

## Sampling Framework by Year
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA-based classification into 32 land classes from 1228 centre squares; eight samples per class; 256 squares surveyed.
- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Same framework as 1978 but 12 squares per class (total 384); aims to capture landscape and habitat changes.
- 1990 (CS1990 All Squares Land Classification)
  - Full GB squares classified with updates; 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping; introduces Land Cover mapping linkage.
- 1998 (CS1998/CS1990 revised to 40 classes)
  - Classification extended to 40 classes; allows separate Scottish reporting; 569 squares surveyed in CS2000 framework.
- 2000 (CS2000)
  - Scoping and adjustments for policy-driven country estimates; separate country-unit estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); 40 strata subdivided into country units; 13477 total GB squares; upland habitat module added to improve England/Wales upland estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting finalized; Welsh class subdivisions created (5 new Welsh classes); total strata 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; England classes adjusted accordingly; adjustments ensure Wales representation while preserving overall UK comparability.
- Upland module
  - Additional sampling (30 squares) targeted in upland and marginal upland land classes to improve country-specific upland habitat estimates.

## Data Products and Outputs

- Tables detailing the number of squares surveyed per class and per country, plus sampling rates (e.g., 1:x).
- National and country-specific estimates derived from class-level statistics and land area distributions.
- Published reports:
  - Countryside Survey 1990: main report
  - Accounting for nature: assessing habitats in the UK countryside (CS2000 context)
  - Countryside Survey UK Results from 2007 (CS2007)
- Visuals: maps showing original, revised, and country-specific Land Class frameworks; sample square distributions.

## Data Governance, Consistency, and Accessibility
- Changing land classifications affects consistency of national estimates; for cross-survey comparability, there is guidance to use the latest classification for internal consistency while acknowledging the 1990 baseline for cross-survey comparability.
- Country-unit reporting introduces complexities in alignment of class definitions across England, Scotland, and Wales.
- Documentation highlights the need to balance representativeness with comparability, and to ensure metadata and classifications are clearly versioned and traceable.

## Key Challenges and Considerations for Data Leaders
- Ensuring representative and unbiased sample selection through stratification across diverse landscapes and policy-relevant regions.
- Maintaining time-series consistency when updating land classifications and when producing country-specific estimates.
- Achieving adequate representation for smaller or underrepresented classes, especially when subdividing by country units.
- Managing data gaps and representational imbalances arising from geographic and administrative changes (e.g., devolution, Wales-only reporting).
- Integrating upland modules to improve precision for upland habitats within England and Wales.
- Providing clear documentation and provenance to support reproducibility, policy relevance, and cross-survey comparability.
