# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

## Executive summary
- Provides guidelines to standardise field recording for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) to produce current, comparable datasets and maintain time-series continuity with CS1990.
- Emphasises standardised procedures, metadata, and coding to minimise observer variation and enable integration with wider data networks.
- Defines sampling framework, plotting schemes, data recording formats, and procedures for post-survey data handling to support policy-relevant analyses and cross-network collaboration.

## Data governance and standardization
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as the core data recording tool, with CS1990 codes reused where possible and new standard codes introduced with guidance.
- Metadata requirements include square/parcel references, dates, surveyors, location details, and clear handling rules for boundary changes between CS1990 and CS2000.
- Emphasises ongoing quality control and standardisation to ensure cross-observer comparability and time-series integrity.
- Documentation and coding conventions support data discoverability, discoverability, and future integration with biodiversity and land-cover datasets.

## Sampling design and time-series
- Sampling framework updates CS1990: re-survey 508 squares, add squares to reach 568 GB squares.
- Spatial stratification across 37 country-wide strata, with enhanced upland coverage (up to ~30 additional upland squares).
- Time-series planning prioritises re-sampling previous squares in the same order, with new squares clustered near existing ones for efficiency.
- Clear logistics and planning to minimise revisits and overtime, enabling robust long-term monitoring.

## Data collection components and plots
- Three core data collection elements: mapping/landscape features, recording plant species in plots, and sampling design/execution of plots.
- Purpose includes updating land-use datasets, monitoring change, and supporting policy-relevant analyses; enables comparisons with CS1990 and integration into national biodiversity assessments.
- Plot architecture includes multiple plot types (X, Y, U, B, A, H, D, S, W, R, V) with specific sizes, placement rules, and relocation procedures.

## Data recording, metadata, and quality control
- Detailed plotting and recording procedures, including nested plots within X plots and standardized species data capture (presence/absence and percent cover).
- Standardized handling for unlisted species, bryophytes, and lichens, with predefined cover categories and validation practices.
- Metadata capture includes surveyors, dates, locations, and context to ensure traceability and comparability over time.
- Emphasis on cross-observer verification, consistent coding, and validation of identifications.

## Mapping and habitat framework
- Mapping approach: de novo mapping for new squares and change mapping for older squares where feasible.
- Uses Broad Habitats for reporting to align with biodiversity policy needs; distinguishes upland/unenclosed habitats from lowland/enclosed landscapes.
- Aerial photography guidance provided; field judgment priority when ground evidence conflicts.
- Ponds and pond-related surveys integrated through referenced definitions and mapping.

## Plot types and data collection methods
- X PLOTS: Large 200 m² plots with nested subplots; relocation markers and permanent markers for precise plotting.
- Y PLOTS: Five 2 m x 2 m plots per square across different land-cover types; GPS enabled in upland/unenclosed areas.
- U PLOTS: Up to 10 plots in Plottable Broad Habitats; random or proportional placement by habitat.
- B PLOTS: Five 200 m² boundary plots in enclosed land near field boundaries.
- A PLOTS: 100 m x 1 m arable field margins, extending into arable land.
- H PLOTS: Hedgerow plots (two 10 m x 1 m plots per square) near X plots; relocation rules if hedges change.
- D PLOTS: Hedgerow diversity plots (ten plots per square) to capture woody species diversity.
- S & W PLOTS: Streamside plots along watercourses; multiple plots oriented to water types.
- R & V PLOTS: Roadside and verge plots across road types.
- Plot relocation: Detailed methods using metal plates, photographs, and plans; re-establishment protocols when markers are missing.

## Vegetation data management and species data
- Standardised recording of plant species within plots; inner/outer nested plots capture presence and percent cover.
- Unlisted species allowed with Latin or common names; careful habitat context documentation required.
- Restricted bryophyte/lichen lists recorded with specific cover values; curated lists for common grasses, sedges, and dominants.
- Emphasis on data validation, cross-checking identifications, and maintaining consistent coding across observers and years.

## Access, permissions, and ethics
- Landowner/landmanager consent is required for all surveys.
- Procedures include prior correspondence and on-site confirmation on survey day.
- If access is refused or partial, replacement squares or adjusted fieldwork are allowed following guidelines.
- Landowner information is collected to support background interactions and potential follow-up.

## Photography and documentation
- Cameras provided; photographs of every vegetation plot to document appearance and reference features.
- Reference features should be obvious, permanent, and within a viewable distance; photographs should include square/plot identifiers.
- Coverage should balance plot area and landmark visibility; avoid excessive sky in photos.
- Visual documentation complements the data, supporting future re-locations and context understanding.

## Procedures after survey
- Post-survey checks to ensure no feature has been omitted; avoid transposing data unless necessary due to damage.
- Arrangements to transport FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing in a timely manner.

## GPS data collection and Annex 1
- Annex 1 provides comprehensive GPS data collection procedures, including battery checks, satellite acquisition, stationary vs moving position logging, and file-naming conventions tied to square and plot IDs.
- Guidance for achieving good PDOP (ideally below 6) and handling obstructions that affect satellite visibility.
- Step-by-step instructions cover equipment distribution, sample naming, data logging, and post-processing logistics.

## Technical notes and data coding
- Attribute reference and coding sheets facilitate quick entry of plot identifiers and features.
- Procedures for handling new features (e.g., fences, hedges) with mobile file naming to support field data management.
- Emphasis on consistent feature naming conventions and traceability of new vs. existing features.

## Implications for data leadership and strategy
- Standardisation and rigorous metadata practices underpin data reliability, governance, and policy relevance.
- Time-series integrity is preserved through careful re-sampling, change management, and boundary documentation.
- The framework supports cross-sector collaboration and alignment with biodiversity action plans and international policy signals.
- Data products derived from standardised plots and habitat classifications enable robust monitoring, reporting, and decision-making across organisations and partner networks.
