# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose: Maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity; policy covers survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.
- CS partners: CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.

- Rationale for confidentiality:
  - Protect representativeness of sampling sites and goodwill of landowners.
  - Safeguard the scientific integrity of the sampling strategy and future survey permissions.
  - Public interest justification; requests handled under FOI Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

- Circumstances and precision for location release:
  - Approximate release: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid square) under licence.
  - Precise release: six-digit grid references only after CEH-preprocessing; exceptional external release possible if IP/confidentiality requirements are equal or higher than CS data.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features): release subject to same exceptional terms as six-digit locations when they could reveal square locations.
  - Any release must avoid enabling visits or landowner compliance checks; must not allow identification of individual CS squares.

- Conditions of licence and use:
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, secure, and access-restricted to authorized personnel for defined projects.
  - Licences are finite; data must be destroyed at project end; no retention for other duties.
  - No third-party sharing that could compromise location confidentiality; consult CEH if in doubt.
  - Usage restrictions to prevent locating CS squares; not for identifying landowners or visiting planning.
  - Evidence of project management standards (JCOP or equivalent) may be required for requested releases.
  - Four-digit releases have similar but lighter IP confidentiality terms than six-digit releases.

- Responsibilities and governance:
  - CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes exceptional release decisions and issues hardcopy licences.
  - Licences must be signed by an appropriately authorized senior official from the licensee.
  - If an approval is denied, CEH supports decision with Act/Regulations procedures.
  - CEH provides an annual public report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - For practical use, CEH aims to provide pre-processing support within reasonable timeframes; requests from non-partner organizations are case-by-case.

- Practical guidance for users:
  - Partners and potential users are advised to consult CEH before committing to work with CS location data.
  - CEH involvement in a project can be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
  - Internal pre-processing needs should be considered to manage timely access.
