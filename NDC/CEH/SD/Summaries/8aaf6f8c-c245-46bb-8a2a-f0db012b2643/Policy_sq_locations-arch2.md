# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Aim and scope
- Maximise utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data in the public interest while minimising risk to future surveys and the anonymity of site locations.
- Policy relates only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

## CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology - CEH)
- Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
- Natural England (NE)
- Welsh Government (WG)
- Scottish Government (SG)
- Northern Ireland Environment Agency (NIEA)
- Forestry Commission (FC)
- Countryside Council for Wales (CCW)
- Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH)

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for the scientific integrity of sampling, environmental protection, and securing future landowner permission to survey.
- Confident confidentiality supports ongoing ability to inform environmental policy.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Four-digit grid references: may be released under licence to identify which 10x10 km grid square contains a CS square.
- Six-digit grid references: only in very exceptional circumstances; require demonstration that the external IP/data to be used with CS data carries equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; CEH may perform pre-processing to avoid release.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features): could potentially identify square locations; treated with the same exceptional release terms as six-digit references.
- In all cases, the released data should not enable locating precise square locations or planning visits, and must not be used to check landowner compliance.

## Licensing conditions and data handling
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in duration and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organisational responsibilities.
- Upon licence expiry, licensees must confirm in writing that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; licensees must not attempt to derive precise locations.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.
- Spatial data releases include a clause preventing attempts to identify exact CS square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- CEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences containing the above clauses, signed by authorised representatives.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports the decision under the Freedom of Information Act / Environmental Information Regulations framework.
- CEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications for access and the grounds for decisions.
- CEH may provide required pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes to CS partners; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly advised to consult CEH before committing to use data covered by this policy; CEH involvement may be through collaboration or payment, negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance for users
- Seek CEH guidance to define requirements and appropriate use of the data.
- Pre-processing analyses by CEH may be used to avoid releasing precise location data when possible.

## Process and compliance overview
- Licences require formal approval, fit-for-purpose use, and signed agreements.
- All licensing decisions operate under UK law (Act and Regulations) and the terms defined in this policy.
- Regular reporting and case-by-case consideration ensure ongoing balance between data utility and confidentiality.
