# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Overview
  - QA exercise on 38 of 519 squares from the Countryside 2000 survey.
  - Re-surveyed 234 species plots across nine plot types to assess consistency, reliability, and data quality.
  - Aims: quantify field-recording accuracy, evaluate plot relocation efficiency, analyze observer/location/season effects, and compare CS2000 with the CS1990 framework; assess landcover and boundary mapping, and changes since 1990.

- Methods in brief
  - Selection: one quarter of each square was re-surveyed; many squares previously included in the 1990 QA.
  - Plot types: seven main CS2000 plot types, subdivided into quadrats and linear plots; resurvey included land-use and boundary features.
  - Relocation: attempted relocation of buried plates marking quadrats eight years later; assessed both plate and plot relocation accuracy.
  - Data products: produced detailed tables and figures comparing CS2000 vs QA outcomes across species, cover estimates, landcover codes, hedge boundary features, and changes.

- Key findings

  - Plot relocation and plate recovery
    - Relocation success: 86.7% of plots fully located; 60% accurately relocated; ~25% relocated with approximation; ~15% not adequately located.
    - Plate recovery by assessors: 69.3% of plates recovered; overall relocation effectiveness (including approximate) estimated around 40–45%.
    - Eight years after burial, relocation was feasible but less robust than the one-year CS1991 QA benchmark; 4 m habitat plots were the most difficult to relocate.
    - Implication: eight-year plate/plot relocation is possible but introduces substantial locational uncertainty.

  - Species concordance and species lists
    - CS2000 mean species per plot: 17.9; QA mean: 20.4 (QA yielded longer lists).
    - Initial field-recording accuracy: about 73% concordance (about 71% of QA-confirmed presence; ~2% non-concordances due to real changes between times).
    - Overall pattern: QA tended to increase detected species; differences partly due to plot relocation and seasonal/management effects.
    - By plot type, QA often expanded species lists; road verges and other linear plots showed distinct patterns in species turnover.

  - Vegetation cover estimates
    - Generally good agreement for cover values, but several species showed significant differences between CS2000 and QA (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum, Elymus repens, Arrhenatherum elatius).
    - Some disparities likely reflect seasonal effects and observer interpretation; several grasses showed notable cover variation.

  - Changes in the direction of vegetation change (DECORANA axis)
    - Overall axis shift between original survey and QA was not significant; no directional bias found when data are grouped by plot type or landclass.
    - Where discrepancies occurred, they related to location/orientation errors and cover-value differences rather than a systematic bias.

  - Landcover and boundary mapping
    - Primary landcover codes: high agreement; overall primary landcover concordance 87.5% (excluding BAP codes), 91.6% when excluding BAP codes from the calculation.
    - BAP (broad habitat) codes: 77.4% concordance; impact on overall landcover mapping modest but non-trivial.
    - Primary boundary features: high concordance (about 92.0% code concordance; ~85–89% overall boundary concordance with some omissions).
    - Hedge shapes and wall boundaries: moderate concordance (67.5%), with notable omissions and mismatches in hedge- and wall-related codes.
    - Change in landuse codes: concordance about 51.4% overall; many changes noted by CS2000 were not substantiated by QA, underscoring challenges in distinguishing true change from coding/recording error.

  - Hedge diversity plots
    - 19 hedge plots; total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
    - Mean species per hedge plot: CS2000 5.16; QA 5.89.
    - Highlights: hedges treated as more error-prone area; occasional omissions of woody species in hedge records.

  - Arable plots
    - Only five plots; concordance was extremely poor (seasonal effects and unfamiliarity with ruderal species likely contributed).
    - Recommendation: future arable-margin work should involve multiple visits to capture seasonal variation.

  - Overall and interpretive conclusions
    - Across plot types, axis scores (CS2000 vs QA) showed no directional bias; mean axis scores were not significantly different.
    - Simple aggregation indicates no systematic over- or under-recording trend, but individual plot types show variable reliability.
    - Mapping and boundary coding were generally reliable, though change detection and hedge-related classifications require caution.
    - The QA exercise demonstrates substantial data quality improvements possible with careful protocols, yet underscores persistent challenges in long-term plot relocation, seasonal effects, and change attribution.

- Data-use implications for data support

  - Data quality and reliability
    - CS2000 data are broadly reliable for many landcover and boundary elements, but changes since 1990 require careful QA to separate real ecological change from coding/recording differences.
    - Relocation and plot-location accuracy is a key driver of mis-matches; robust plate-marking and precise plotting improve downstream analyses.

  - Data products and end-user enablement
    - Potential dashboards and reports to monitor:
      - Plot relocation success rates by square, plot type, and time since original survey.
      - Species concordance and efficiency by plot type and habitat category.
      - Cover-estimate agreement by species and plot type, with flags for significant discrepancies.
      - Landcover and boundary code concordance by code group (primary codes, BAP codes, boundary qualifiers).
      - Change-detection concordance, highlighting instances of real change vs. coding omissions.
      - Hedge diversity and arable plots performance metrics.
    - Metadata should capture surveyor identity, timing, seasonal context, and boundary-change notes to support reproducibility and interpretation.

  - Data governance and QA workflow improvements
    - Strengthen plate/plot marking protocols to improve long-term relocatability.
    - Align coding schemes across surveys to reduce misclassification (especially for hedges, walls, and boundary features).
    - Consider multiple visits for time-sensitive or seasonally variable plots (notably arable margins).
    - Maintain detailed change-attribution workflows to distinguish real ecological change from coding adjustments.

- Recommendations for future practice (in brief)
  - Improve physical marking and documentation to facilitate long-term relocation.
  - Enhance training and standardization to reduce mis-identifications and overlookings, particularly for grasses and boundary features.
  - Increase repeat visits for arable margins and hedge/wall assessments where seasonal dynamics are strong.
  - Develop data products and dashboards that track QA metrics and support self-service quality monitoring for end users.

- Annex and date context (summary)
  - Annex B and related tables provide square-by-square efficiency metrics, including time-bound dates and per-square QA performance.
  - The overall QA framework emphasizes parallel assessment of plot location, species concordance, cover estimates, landcover maps, and change detection to inform data quality improvements for the Countryside Survey series.
