# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- The policy governs access to CS survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Aim: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and landowner anonymity.

## Who are the CS partners
- Natural Environment Research Council (Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, CEH)
- Defra
- Natural England
- Welsh Government
- Scottish Government
- NIEA
- Forestry Commission
- Countryside Council for Wales
- Scottish Natural Heritage

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission for surveys.
- Confidentiality supports the survey’s ability to inform policy in the public interest.

## Release circumstances and precision levels
- Access allows determining if squares fall within pre-defined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid square for broader location awareness.
- Six-digit grid references are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must be justified legally that related IP data is equally or more confidential than CS data; pre-processing by CEH is preferred to avoid releasing locations.
- Spatial data from within squares (habitats, linear features) can potentially identify square locations and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit references.
- Four-digit releases are subject to less stringent IP-confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to approved individuals and purposes.
- Licences are finite and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licensing period.
- Upon licence end, organisations must confirm destruction of location data.
- Data must not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; cannot be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases must include a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations from the data.

## Responsibilities and process
- CEH acts on behalf of NERC to make exceptional release decisions, applying the policy principles.
- CEH issues hardcopy licences with clauses reflecting policy; licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative.
- If approval is denied, CEH supports decisions under UK Act and Regulations, and provides a written rationale.
- CEH reports annually to CS partners on access applications and decision grounds.
- To support internal use, CEH aims to provide necessary pre-processing within reasonable timeframes; external requests are handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential CS data users are advised to consult CEH early; CEH may assist in defining requirements and providing appropriate support, potentially as collaboration or paid work (negotiated case-by-case).
