# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Overview and Aims
- Quality Assurance (QA) evaluated consistency and reliability across CS2000 field work.
- Sample: 38 of 519 squares; one-quarter resurveyed per square; 234 species plots across nine plot types.
- Assessed: plot relocation efficiency, species concordance, percentage cover accuracy, detection of directional bias, comparability with CS1990, land-use mapping accuracy, and changes in land-use/vegetation.

## Methods and Scope
- QA targeted 210 CS2000 plots (total across 38 squares); 234 plots analyzed for species and cover across plot types.
- Plate and plot relocation tracked using original sketches, photos, and metal detectors; multiple relocation categories defined.
- Land cover mapping used primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes with Annex-guided protocols.
- Change assessment compared CS2000 strings to QA strings to separate real change from coding/recording differences.
- Seasonal timing and plot-type differences considered to explain variability.

## Plot Relocation and Relocation Efficiency
- Of 210 plots with full search, 86.7% were satisfactorily relocated (28 not relocated satisfactorily).
- CS2000 surveyors: approx. 60% precisely relocated; ~25% more relocated; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- 4 m habitat (Y-plots) had higher relocation failure (23%).
- Plate relocation success by assessors: 69.3% found; overall recovery comparable to 1991 CS1990 QA (65.2%); total potential recovery around 40–45%.
- Eight-year relocation feasibility demonstrated; however, some mis-placement and “reading the wrong feature” errors occurred.

## Species Concordance and Recording Accuracy
- Approximately 6000 CS2000 records analyzed; ~71% confirmed by QA assessors as present; ~2% non-concordances due to management/season between surveys.
- Initial field-recording accuracy estimated around 73%, slightly below CS1990’s ~78%; differences largely due to plot relocation errors.
- QA found that the QA exercise generally produced longer species lists; mean species per plot: CS2000 = 17.9 vs QA = 20.4.
- Across all plots, CS2000 vs QA concordance indicates that efficiency of field recording remained broadly consistent with prior survey QA.

## Vegetation Cover Estimates
- Visual cover estimates for species >5% were compared.
- Six frequent species showed significantly different cover levels between surveyors and assessors; some differences attributed to seasonality or mis-location.
  - Notable significant differences: Holcus lanatus (p = 0.029), Dactylis glomerata (p = 0.005), Anthoxanthum odoratum (p = 0.040).
- For several species, agreements were strong, while others (notably grasses) showed weaker cover concordance.

## Direction of Vegetation Change
- DECORANA ordination axis shift between original survey and QA was generally insignificant.
- No consistent directional bias across plot types or landclasses.

## Landcover Mapping and Boundary Features
- Land-cover coding used three groups: primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes; mapping agreement varied by code group.
- Primary land-cover concordance: overall 87.5% (excluding BAP codes); BAP codes contributed 77.4% concordance.
- Agreement with CS1990QA comparisons remained favorable; mapping changes from 1990 to 1998 tracked with protocol annexes.
- BAP code assessments showed more straightforward assignment than earlier surveys; some ongoing discrepancies tied to boundary delineation and classification of complex habitats.

## Change in Land Use and Associated Coding
- Change concordance between CS2000 and QA: 51.4% (overall); 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
- A substantial portion of changes since 1990 appeared to be missed or poorly recorded; suggests plot data may be more reliable for detecting change than narrative survey strings.

## Hedge Diversity, Boundary and Arable Plots
- Hedge diversity (19 samples): total species 124; common species 92; overall agreement 74.2%; surveyor efficiency 77.4%.
- Arable plots (5 plots): very poor concordance (29–31% range in some metrics); seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species contributed to discrepancies; two visits per plot recommended for future arable margins.

## Summary of Key Quantitative Findings
- Plot relocation: ~60% exact relocation; ~25% near-relocation; ~15% inadequate; 86.7% plots satisfactorily relocated.
- Species records: ~71% concordance on presence; ~73% initial recording accuracy; QA lists longer species lists on average.
- Cover estimates: several grass species showed significant cover-difference signals; overall cover agreement reasonable but variable by species.
- Change detection: overall low concordance for land-use change (51.4%); many changes noted by CS2000 not substantiated by QA, indicating under-recording or misclassification risk.
- Land-cover mapping: high primary-codes concordance (87.5%); boundary features/conditions showed substantial consistency, though some misclassification and boundary-change issues persisted.
- Overall axis scores: no significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA (mean axis scores: 387.8 vs 392.0; ANOVA p = 0.741).

## Implications for Data Quality and Analysis
- CS2000 field work demonstrates generally robust data collection with credible consistency across plots, though relocation and change-detection processes require careful interpretation.
- Recovery of long-term plot positions eight years on is feasible, but some systematic relocation biases and mis-locations affect concordance.
- Land-cover mapping is reliable for many codes, but some discrepancies persist in boundary delineation and hedgerow-related codes.
- For future surveys, additional targeted QA on arable margins and explicit checking of boundary changes would improve change-detection reliability.
- When analyzing CS2000 data, it is important to account for potential under-recording of changes, seasonality effects, and plot relocation uncertainties.
