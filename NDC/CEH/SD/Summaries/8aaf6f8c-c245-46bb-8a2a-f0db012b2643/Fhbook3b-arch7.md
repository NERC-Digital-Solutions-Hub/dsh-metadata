# CS2000 Field Handbook (updated 27 November 2013)

- Overview
  - Guidelines for Countryside Survey CS2000 in Great Britain (land cover, landscape features, vegetation) using map-based data products.
  - Builds on CS1990 with time-series objectives to monitor changes and support policy/biodiversity aims.
  - Core sampling across 1 km squares with expanded coverage and re-surveys; emphasis on standardized data collection, mapping, and plotting procedures; SGS-like focus on data quality and comparability.

- Vegetation and Flora Coding
  - Extensive standardized codes for flora, enabling GIS-ready data capture and cross-squar e comparability.
  - Abbreviations link to structured species lists (e.g., Athyrium filix-femina, Dryopteris filix-mas, Equisetum arvense, etc.) and broader FORBS/WOODY SPECIES categories.
  - Separate MOSSES/LICHENS section with its own codes.
  - When needed, new unique codes (601–699) may be introduced for features not described by existing codes; primary/secondary codes reflect mosaics or layered features.
  - Map changes use universal codes (e.g., 999 for no longer present, 888 for new to map) and maintain cross-links to recording forms.

- Plot and Mapping Methodology
  - Outputs are tied to OS base maps (1:10,000) with theme maps and BAP-focused maps, linked to data recording forms by parcel numbers.
  - Features are connected to Field Assessment Forms (FABs) with parcel-level coding and map-feature linkages.
  - Emphasis on documenting ownership, physiography, water features, vegetation types, boundaries, buildings, and land use to support GIS analyses.

- Field Procedures and Plot Types
  - Plot types and general rules:
    - X PLOTS – LARGE, MAIN (200 m2); central placement within habitat area; relocatable via plates/photos.
    - Y PLOTS – SMALL (2 m x 2 m); baseline and land-cover-type plots for each square.
    - U PLOTS – UNENCLOSED (2 x 2 m); proportional to Plottable Broad Habitats.
    - B PLOTS – BOUNDARY PLOTS (200 m2) along boundaries; relocation prioritized by boundary markers.
    - A PLOTS – ARABLE MARGIN PLOTS (100 x 1 m); adjacent to B plots.
    - H PLOTS – HEDGEROW PLOTS (10 m x 1 m); positioned relative to large X plots.
    - D PLOTS – HEDGEROW DIVERSITY PLOTS (30 m; all woody species recorded).
    - S/W PLOTS – STREAMSIDE/WATERSIDE PLOTS (10 x 1 m); include an additional water-edge plot.
    - R/V PLOTS – ROADSIDE/V verge PLOTS (10 x 1 m); along verges by road type.
  - Plot positioning and relocation principles aim to maximize data reliability and repeatability; most plots have permanent markers; documentation includes photographs and sketches.
  - Documentation and coordinates are essential; GPS data collection is introduced for higher relocatability, especially upland.

- Data Recording, FABs, and Coding
  - FABs (Field Assessment Books) compile data forms and enlarged maps; require neat, legible entries, consistent square numbering, and pencil for error correction.
  - Recording structure covers Ownership, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Cover Types, Species (if >25%), Uses, and related codes.
  - Coding structure uses primary and secondary codes to describe features; multiple codes may describe mosaics; dominant primary code recorded first.
  - When existing codes cannot describe a feature, new codes (601–699) may be used sparingly; universal map-change codes (e.g., 999, 888) are applied to indicate changes.
  - Data sections include Front Cover, Ownership, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Trees/Woodland, Boundaries, Buildings/Curtilages/Communications, and universal map conventions.

- Photography
  - Each vegetation plot photographed to show general appearance and relation to landmarks.
  - Use square/plot identifiers on a visible reference board; ensure features are clearly visible and reference features are obvious and permanent.
  - Aim for balanced framing with plot area and reference features; minimize sky in photos.

- Sampling: Soil, Calluna, and Freshwater
  - CS2000 includes three sampling streams:
    - Soil sampling (by CS2000 field teams) and freshwater sampling (by IFE staff) alongside Calluna sampling (by CS2000 field teams).
  - Soil sampling (Section 10.3–10.7):
    - Five replicate soil samples per 1 km square square; three cores per X-plot (centre of 2 x 2 m plot) using specified piping; samples sent to ITE Merlewood for processing.
    - Detailed field kit, packaging, and post procedures; standardized envelopes and tubes with square/plot identifiers.
    - Sampling points are recorded with precise location notes; quick processing of certain samples due to short shelf-life.
  - Calluna sampling (Section 10.9–10.10):
    - Collect current year’s growth (CYG) Calluna vulgari s shoots (30–50 g fresh weight) from several plants per square.
    - Samples bagged, sealed, and posted to ITE Merlewood; documentation of sampling time and transport.
  - Freshwater sampling (Section 10.11):
    - Managed by IFE staff; CS2000 field teams coordinate with IFE for scheduling within squares.
  - Equipment distribution (Section 10.6) and packing details included in field kit instructions.

- Permissions and Access
  - Surveys require landowner/farmer consent; documented communications and on-site verifications.
  - Access denial rules: total denial leads to replacement square; partial denial may permit partial survey; vegetation plots may be repositioned with documentation.

- Data Quality and Standardization
  - Emphasis on standardized field handbook usage, training, and quality control to reduce recording errors.
  - GPS data collection enhances relocation precision; cross-square comparability is crucial for time-series analysis.

- Annex: GPS Data and Related Procedures
  - Step-by-step instructions for using GPS devices, including satellite checks, stationary vs moving recording, and file naming conventions.
  - File naming requires square number and plot ID (e.g., 501X4.PSE); feature-based naming for new construction (e.g., 501F1.MOB).
  - PDOP guidance (preferably below 6 for 3D fixes) and handling obstructions.
  - Procedures to manage almanac updates and battery management; guidance on entering plot IDs via Magellan keypad.
  - Recording stationary positions should be performed with clear sky views for 3–5 minutes.

- Procedures After Survey
  - Post-survey checks to ensure no features were omitted.
  - Transcribing data to fresh maps/forms only if needed; arrange transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations promptly.

- Practical Implications for GIS Specialists (implicit)
  - Data products derive from a codified, GIS-ready framework linking map features, parcel codes, FABs, and sampling data.
  - Strong support for time-series analyses, change detection, and scalable biodiversity indicators through standardized mapping and documentation.
  - Robust metadata (ownership, access, habitat type, use) and precise geolocation are central to reproducible GIS workflows.
