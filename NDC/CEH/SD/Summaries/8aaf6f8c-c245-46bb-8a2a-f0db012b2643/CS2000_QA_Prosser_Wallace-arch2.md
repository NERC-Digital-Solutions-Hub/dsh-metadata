# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 2000 QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

## Purpose and scope
- Assess consistency and reliability of CS2000 fieldwork across major components (plot relocation, species recording, vegetation cover, landcover mapping, and change recording).
- Compare CS2000 results with QA assessments to quantify accuracy, bias, and areas of uncertainty.
- Use a subsample (38 squares, 210 plots) to evaluate data quality and methodological robustness.

## Key aims
- Quantify field-recording accuracy and change statistics.
- Examine plot relocation efficiency and observer bias.
- Explain recording differences by plot type, management, season, and location/orientation.
- Relate CS2000 recording quality to earlier CS1990 findings.
- Assess mapping accuracy (land cover and boundaries) and change detection.

## Methods and scope
- QA sampled 38 of 519 CS squares from 1998; one quarter of each square rerecorded (234 plots across 9 plot types).
- Squares include many from CS1990 to enable comparison.
- Relocation and recording tested for plot type, landcover mapping, boundary features, and changes since 1990.

## Major findings

### Plot relocation
- Of 210 plots fully searched, 28 could not be satisfactorily relocated (recovery 86.7%).
- CS2000 surveyors precisely relocated about 60% of 1990 plots; ~25% relocated with approximate accuracy; ~15% inadequately relocated.
- Y-plots (Habitat Plots) most difficult to relocate (23% failure).
- Plate/plot recovery eight years on comparable to 12 months post-burial from prior QA results.

### Plate and plot location accuracy
- Assessors located 69.3% of CS2000 plates; earlier QA (1991) achieved 65.2% recovery for CS1990 plates.
- Surveyors’ success in finding the same plates (or very near locations) estimated around 40–45% (possible range up to 59.4% when combining categories of success).
- Overall relocation performance indicates substantial but incomplete repeatability after eight years.

### Species concordance
- About 6,000 records across 210 plots; 71% of records confirmed as present by reassessment.
- Non-concordances due to real management/seasonal changes accounted for about 2%.
- Initial field recording accuracy around 73% (slightly lower than CS1990’s ~78%, mainly due to plot relocation errors).
- QA consistently yielded longer species lists; the increase over CS2000 was similar to past QA experiences, suggesting consistent assessor behavior.
- Overall indicates similar recording efficiency to the CS1990 QA when adjusted for plot relocation issues.

### Vegetation cover and common species
- Among the 30 most frequent, six species showed significantly different cover levels between CS2000 and QA (one likely seasonal effect).
- Cover agreement at landuse sample points overall around 74% (good given seasonal variation and cover banding).
- Several species showed notable cover differences (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Dactylis glomerata, Anthoxanthum odoratum) with some significant Wilcoxon tests; other common grasses showed closer agreement.
- The overall pattern suggests broadly comparable coverage estimates with some species- and time-specific discrepancies.

### Direction of vegetation change (DECORANA ordination)
- No significant directional bias between CS2000 and QA assessments.
- Axis 1 scores across plot types and landclasses show similar distributions; most discrepancies linked to location/orientation or cover-value differences rather than consistent directional change.

### Landcover mapping and coding concordance
- Landcover mapping codes categorized into primary codes, secondary descriptive codes, and cover codes.
- Primary landcover codes: ~88% agreement; BAP codes (broad habitat types): ~77% agreement; primary boundary codes: ~85%; principal qualifying landcover codes: ~73%; principal qualifying boundary codes: ~83%; species-awarded cover codes: ~63%; species cover codes: ~74%.
- Overall primary land cover agreement: ~87.5% (vs 84.3% for CS1990 QA).
- BAP (broad habitat) concordance: ~77.4%.
- Changes in landuse codes (comparing 1990 to 1998): 16.4% of the 177 change instances reflected errors/omissions in the CS1990 baseline.
- Overall change concurrence CS2000 vs QA: ~51.4% (disappointing); 33.9% of changes not noted by CS2000; 14.7% changes recorded but not substantiated by assessors.
- The QA suggests that many real changes since 1990 may be missed or misinterpreted in coding, highlighting a need for careful change attribution and possibly enhanced training on change detection.

### Boundary features and hedges
- Boundary feature coding (walls, hedges) showed 67.5% overall concordance; observed omissions/non-considerations accounted for ~14.8% of mismatches.
- Boundary heights and stockproof status scanned with relatively high consistency (boundary height concordance ~92.8%; stockproof concordance ~89.4%; overall boundary-related concordance ~83–89% depending on metric).
- Introduction of new hedge codes had limited success; many hedges still coded under older or broader categories.

### Hedge diversity plots
- Hedge diversity plots (H plots) showed total species recorded: 124; common species: 92.
- Overall agreement between CS2000 and QA: 74.2%; surveyor efficiency: 77.4%.
- Mean number of species per plot: CS2000 5.16 vs QA 5.89.

### Arable plots
- Five arable margin plots analyzed; very limited data.
- Concordance extremely poor at 30.6% agreement.
- Seasonality and unfamiliarity with ruderal species likely contributed; recommendation for multiple visits to future arable margin plots.

## Overall interpretation for data use
- CS2000 QA demonstrates substantial reliability in plot relocation, species recording, and landcover mapping, with some notable weaknesses:
  - Plot relocation and mis-location/orientation contribute significant non-concordances, especially for linear plots.
  - Change detection between 1990 and 1998 is the least reliable component, with only about half of changes corroborated by QA; many changes may be missed or misclassified.
  - Landcover and boundary mapping show high concordance overall, but coding differences exist, particularly for hedge types and some landcover categories.
  - Arable margins require more intensive sampling due to high seasonality and identification challenges.
- The exercise confirms that CS2000 data are broadly fit for longitudinal environmental health and habitat-change analyses, but analysts should treat change data with caution and account for potential relocation biases and seasonal effects in cover estimates.

## Implications for the Analyst Archetype
- Data quality and consistency across time are well-supported, enabling scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time, with standardised QA procedures in place.
- When aggregating datasets or linking CS2000 with other environmental datasets, consider:
  - Potential biases from plot relocation and mis-location/orientation errors, especially for non-linear plots.
  - Seasonal timing effects on species presence and cover, particularly for grasses and arable margins.
  - The possibility of under-recording changes since 1990; corroborate change data with independent sources where possible.
  - The strength of landcover and boundary mapping, which generally show high concordance and can be used with confidence for spatial analyses.
- Data reuse should emphasize stable core datasets (landcover codes, boundary features, and hedge classifications) while treating change data with additional validation or sensitivity analyses.

## Conclusion
- The Countryside Survey 2000 QA exercise indicates robust methodological consistency with meaningful levels of concordance in plot relocation, species recording, and landcover mapping.
- Changes since 1990 remain the most challenging aspect, with substantial room for improvement in change detection and coding accuracy.
- Overall, CS2000 data are valuable for environmental monitoring and policy evaluation, provided users account for identified uncertainties and the documented limitations in change detection.
