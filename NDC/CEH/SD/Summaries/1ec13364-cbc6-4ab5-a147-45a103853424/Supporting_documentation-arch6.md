# Supporting information for 'Cunliffe et al. (2020). Allometric modelling of plant biomass from drone-acquired photographs: drone images, ground control marker coordinates and biomass data from 36 sites, 2016-2020.'

## Overview
- A data-rich resource comprising drone images, ground control marker coordinates, and biomass data collected across 36 sites from 2016 to 2020.
- Data are organized by drone survey, with a total of 38 survey directories.
- Each survey directory includes: a markers.csv file, a subdirectory of image files, and a metadata/biomass spreadsheet.
- The dataset is intended to support allometric modelling of above-ground biomass and related analyses.

## Data contents and structure
- Primary data files per drone survey:
  - drone_allometry_observations.csv: metadata and biomass data from harvested plots for the survey.
  - accompanying text file: units and measurement details for the biomass data.
  - markers.csv: coordinates and information for ground control markers (13 markers, 20 cm × 20 cm each).
- Image data: a subdirectory containing the drone-captured images for that survey.
- Survey identification: each survey is identified by a 15-digit survey_ID (date YYYYMMDD, investigator initials, and a 3-character site code).
- Organization: 38 survey directories link image data (for photogrammetry) with corresponding biomass/metadata.
- Target data scope: focus on low-stature, non-forest ecosystems (grasslands, shrublands, woody savannas); highly artificial vegetation excluded.

## Site selection and sampling design
- Ecosystem focus chosen because forest biomass is covered in other work; emphasis on non-forest systems to inform broader biomass mapping.
- Species were regionally widespread and accessible to inform ongoing research.
- Sampling aimed for seasonal peak canopy cover to minimise phenological effects; acknowledges possible variation in more water-limited ecosystems.

## Aerial imaging surveys
- Drone surveys conducted in two passes per site:
  - Nadir imagery for ~5 mm per pixel at canopy top.
  - Oblique imagery (~20°) from ~3–4 m higher.
- Flight parameters:
  - Typical altitude around 20 m above canopy.
  - Ensured 75% forward/side overlap and at least 30 images per study area part.
- Ground control:
  - 13 ground control markers per site, each 20 cm × 20 cm.
  - Markers geolocated with GNSS to ~±0.015 m horizontal and ±0.03 m vertical precision.
  - Marker coordinates provided in meters (UTM zones); EPSG codes documented in the spreadsheet.
- Field conditions and recommendations:
  - Photogrammetry robust but improvements anticipated with better geolocation/orientation data.
  - Protocol optimized for plant canopies up to ~3 m; for taller vegetation, higher survey altitude recommended to reduce parallax.

## Vegetation harvests and ground-truth data
- Harvest plots selected to capture 90% of biomass and canopy within each plot from target taxa.
- Minimum plot size: 0.5 m × 0.5 m.
- Harvest protocol:
  - Plot corners geolocated with high-precision GNSS.
  - Biomass dried to constant weight (50–80°C).
  - For some large taxa, field fresh weighing plus subsamples for moisture content.
- Plot area calculation:
  - Based on corner coordinates; if a harvest frame was used, the frame area used to minimise GNSS-related errors.

## Image-based modelling workflow
- Software: Agisoft PhotoScan (v1.4.3) for Structure-from-Motion (SfM) photogrammetry.
- Preprocessing and alignment:
  - Geotagged images imported and converted to UTM coordinates.
  - Image sharpness threshold set (≥ 0.5).
  - High-quality alignment with large tie-point/point limits; all cameras used for multi-view stereopsis.
  - Lens parameters enabled (f, principal point, distortions, etc.); adaptive model fitting adjustments as needed.
- Ground control and accuracy:
  - Marker locations constrained in the reconstruction; ten projected images used per survey for each of the 13 ground control points; three markers reserved for accuracy assessment.
  - Reprojection-error-based filtering to remove dubious tie points.
- Output:
  - Dense point clouds exported in laz format with coordinates and RGB values.
  - Visual review and refinement of camera positions performed to ensure plausibility.

## Digital terrain models and canopy height derivation
- DTM construction:
  - Terrain models generated by interpolating GNSS corner coordinates (inverse distance weighting, power term = 1).
  - In densely vegetated, discontinuous canopies, photogrammetric point clouds can supply high-quality DTMs.
  - Alternative methods suggested for DTMs, including leaf-off UAV surveys or LiDAR.
- Canopy height modelling:
  - Canopy height estimated as height above ground relative to the interpolated terrain surface.

## Dense point cloud analysis and canopy height extraction
- Tools: PDAL (v2.0.1).
- Processing steps:
  - Subset point cloud to harvest plot using GNSS corner coordinates.
  - Noise points (e.g., posts/flags) identified and excluded.
  - Height above ground calculated relative to a surface interpolated from plot corners (IDW, power 1).
  - Height grid: 0.01 m resolution; per-cell maximum height extracted.
  - For empty cells (no points), heights interpolated with 7 × 7 neighborhoods (IDW, power 1); untouched cells left empty.
- Output metric:
  - Plot-level mean canopy height derived from local maxima elevations across the grid.

## Data quality, transparency, and references
- Detailed methodological references are provided to underpin the photogrammetry workflow, ground control strategy, and canopy height modelling.
- Data collection and processing decisions discussed to aid reproducibility and future improvements.
- Key references span photogrammetry techniques, canopy height research, and related biomass assessment studies.

## Notes for data use
- The dataset is linked to Cunliffe et al. (2020) and the in-review article on drone-derived canopy height predicting aboveground biomass; users are encouraged to consult those works for additional context on data collection and processing decisions.
- For future enhancements, improvements in drone geolocation/orientation data and alternative DTMs are discussed as avenues to improve reliability and accuracy in more complex vegetation settings.
