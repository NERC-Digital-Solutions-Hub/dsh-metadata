# Ecotoxicology data of Eisenia fetida earthworms exposed to four concentrations of bio-based teabags

## Aim
- Assess sub-lethal toxicity of Eisenia fetida to three anonymised bio-based teabags with different PLA-cellulose blends.
- Measure mortality, growth, and reproductive output under four exposure concentrations to inform environmental risk and policy.

## Experimental design
- Material: LUFA 2.2 standard sandy-loam soil; three teabag brands (TBagA, TBagB, TBagC) with varying PLA-cellulose blends; control with no teabags.
- Concentrations: 0%, 0.02%, 0.04%, 0.07% teabag material in soil.
- Setup: 4 replicates per treatment, each with 10 Eisenia fetida adults (total 40 worms per treatment).
- Conditions: 20 ± 1 °C, dark; OECD TG 222 Earthworm Reproduction Test.
- Duration: 28 days with measurements; followed by an additional 28-day incubation to assess fecundity (juvenile number and mass).

## Ecotoxicological measures
- Mortality (survival and survival percentage after 28 days)
- Growth (mass change from day 0 to day 28)
- Reproduction: number of egg cocoons, number of juveniles, mass of juveniles

## Data file and variables
- Datafile: Teabags_worm_ecotoxicology.csv
- Key variables (examples):
  - Test_material, Treatment (combination of teabag name and concentration)
  - n_teabags, teabag_mass_soil, teabag_n_soil
  - Mass_dw_soil, Exposure (days)
  - worms, survival, survival_percent
  - worms_mass_start, worms_mass_end, Mass_change
  - n_eggs, n_juv, mass_juv (per replicate)

## Quality control and materials
- Protocol: OECD TG 222 followed; LUFA soil characteristics documented (pH 5.5 ± 0.1; OC 1.66 ± 0.6%; N 0.19 ± 0.06%; CEC 8.5 ± 1.8 meq/100g).
- Organisms: Eisenia fetida from Blades Biological; acclimated 3 weeks prior to exposure.

## Context and provenance
- Data accompany: Courtene-Jones et al. (2024) Deterioration of bio-based polylactic acid plastic teabags under environmental conditions and their associated effects on earthworms. Science of the Total Environment. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.172806
- Funding: NERC BIO-PLASTIC-RISK project (NE/V007556/1 and NE/V007246/1).

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, multicategory ecotoxicological data linking bio-based teabag materials to earthworm health.
- Data are suitable for integration with other environmental datasets and sharing via appropriate data portals to support monitoring and policy evaluation.
