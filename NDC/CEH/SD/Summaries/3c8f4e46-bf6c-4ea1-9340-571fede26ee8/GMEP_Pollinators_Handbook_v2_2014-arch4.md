# GMEP Procedure, 1 = Pollinator Field Protocol

## Purpose and scope
- Pollinator surveys for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project conducted twice per 1 km2 square (July and August).
- Target taxa: butterflies (species level) and bees/hoverflies (group level); flowering plant groups recorded to help interpret pollinator data.
- Survey structure: a standardized 2 km transect route plus a timed search in a 150 m2 flower-rich area; minimum 10 days between July and August surveys.

## Permissions and access
- Two-week permission window; Farm Liaison Officer issues farmer letters with planned survey periods.
- Maps show access rights and farmer contact details; updated records if ownership changes.
- If farmers cannot be reached in the scheduled window, liaison with FLO to update or obtain access.
- Weekly updates to FLO on completed squares and any access issues.

## Survey design and field procedures
- Transect component: fixed 2 km route across the square, split into two parallel 1-km routes (divided into ten 200 m sections).
  - Routes should be 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge when possible; maintain at least 100 m between lines if deviations occur.
  - Draw exact routes on maps and record six-figure GPS references for each section.
  - Avoid urban habitats; minor intrusions into adjacent squares permitted if necessary.
- Recording during transects:
  - Use 5 m x 5 m x 5 m recording box; record butterfly, bee, and hoverfly abundances in each 200 m section.
  - Record flowering plants using DAFOR scale (Dominant >30%, Abundant 11-30%, Frequent 6-10%, Occasional 2-5%, Rare 0-1%, X for not seen).
  - Capture difficult butterfly species (e.g., Small/Essex Skipper) to determine proportions when identification requires underside of antennae; return to transect point after identifying.
- Timed search component: 150 m2 area within the square, ideally sheltered and with good flowering plant coverage.
  - 10–20 minutes search, stopped if necessary to identify individuals; record start/end times and take a photo of the area.
  - Record DAFOR-X for flowering plant cover in the 150 m2 area; photograph submitted online.
  - If the flowering patch moves between July and August, reselect the 150 m2 area for each survey.
- Plant and insect interaction data:
  - During timed searches, record which plant groups each pollinator visits and note “Not at flower” when applicable.
  - Enter supplementary plant groups as “Other plants” with notes on observed visits.
- Data handling:
  - All data entered online using the axis2poll platform; ensure GPS coordinates, start times, and weather conditions are captured.
  - For timed searches, upload the 150 m2 photograph and provide a caption with surveyor initials, square, and date.

## Data collection tools and data capture
- On-site forms require start times, dates, temperature (to nearest degree, recorded in shade), and weather-related data.
- Recording box limits: document insects within a 5 m box (5 m ahead, 5 m above ground, 2.5 m either side).
- Identification guidance:
  - Butterflies: species-level.
  - Bees/hoverflies: group-level, with additional notes as needed.
- Photographs:
  - Seven photographs (one per bee/hoverfly group) for QA; additional photos permissible for uncertain identifications.
  - Photograph submission format and naming conventions to be used online.
- Online data entry workflow:
  - Register on ukbms axis2poll, define sites, draw transect routes, enter transect data (My Walks), then enter timed observation data (My Timed Obs), then submit photos (Photo Observations).

## Weather and recording conditions
- Preferred survey window: 10:00–16:00; alternative 09:30–10:00 and 16:00–16:30 if conditions permit.
- Conditions for surveying:
  - Temperature: 11–17°C with at least 60% sunshine (upland squares: above 11°C with less than 60% sunshine permitted).
  - If above 17°C, surveys may proceed regardless of sunshine.
  - Wind: Beaufort 0–4 (less than 5).
- Sunshine is estimated by the portion of transect in shadow.

## Quality Assurance
- Photographs reviewed by experts as part of QA.
- Online assessments: two image-based quizzes (30 images each) to test proficiency in identifying pollinators (20 bee/hoverfly images, 10 butterfly images).
- Assessments simulate transect conditions; feedback provided; scores recorded for group-wide accuracy analysis.

## Bio-security and safety
- Mandatory disinfection between farms as per project protocol; enhanced disinfectant use (four bottles of disinfectant per 3 liters) on TB-affected farms.
- Provided equipment: sprayers, gloves, safety gear; boots and vehicle cleaning before/after site visits.
- Landowners’ goodwill is essential; data collection is contingent on bio-security compliance.
- Contact Jodey Peyton for supplies or queries.

## General contacts and governance
- Primary contacts for queries: Anthea Owen (FLO) and Jodey Peyton; project coordinators at CEH.
- Data submission platform: www.ukbms.org/axis2poll; account creation and site setup instructions included.
- Version history: Version 2 (May 2014) includes minor protocol updates, new QA procedures, and updated safety documentation.
