# Pollinator Field Protocol Handbook for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project

- Purpose: A field protocol for conducting pollinator surveys (butterflies, bees, hoverflies) across 1 km² squares, integrated with GIS-friendly data collection and online documentation to support the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project.
- Audience: GIS specialists and data analysts who will map, integrate, and visualise pollinator data for policy colleagues, clients, and the public.

## Study design and spatial data framework

- Survey units: Each 1 km² square is surveyed with a fixed 2 km transect route, split into ten 200 m sections (S1–S10) and aligned on parallel lines (N-S or E-W as near as possible).
- Route placement: Ideally about 500 m apart lines and 250 m from square edge; deviations allowed but lines must not be closer than 100 m.
- GPS and map requirements: Exact routes must be drawn on online maps and hard-copy maps; six-figure GPS grid references recorded at the start of each transect section; routes input into online GIS/maps (ukbms axis2poll) for each survey square.
- Data structure: Separate transect data (butterflies counted by species; bees and hoverflies by groups) and timed search data (150 m² flowering area) with plant group cover (DAFOR scale) and plant groups beyond the predefined list (entered as “Other plants” with notes).
- Timing and repetition: Each square surveyed twice per season (July and August) with a minimum of 10 days between surveys; monthly or seasonal QA checks and updates.

## Field methods and data capture

- Transect recording: 
  - Record abundances of butterflies (species level) and bees/hoverflies (group level) within a 5 m x 5 m recording box along the transect.
  - Record flowering plant groups using DAFOR (Dominant to Rare; X for not seen) only for flowering plants within the 200 m section; vegetative cover is not recorded with DAFOR.
  - If species are difficult to distinguish in flight (e.g., White species), capture and ID as needed, with proportional estimates for shared species, then resume transect after identification.
  - Do not count a single individual more than once unless unsure.
- Timed search (150 m² area):
  - Identify a flowering-rich area within the 1 km², ideally sheltered; photograph the area before the timed search.
  - Spend 10–20 minutes (minimum 10; maximum 20) actively searching for pollinators; record insect counts by plant group and whether observed at flowers vs not at flowers.
  - Use flowering-plant groups to structure the pollen resource context; record DAFOR-X for flower cover within the 150 m² area.
  - Photograph and capture location coordinates (grid reference) for the 150 m² area; enter start time, end time, and weather data.
- Photographs:
  - Take seven photographs: one representative bee group and one representative hoverfly group for each of the groups, plus a timed-search area photo; submit photos online with standardized naming.
  - Optional photos of uncertain identifications can be emailed to project staff for help.
- Data entry readiness:
  - Maintain careful notes on route changes (temporary vs permanent) and update online records accordingly.
  - Record parking/entry points and any access obstructions; update FLO as needed.
- Be prepared for weather and timing constraints:
  - Surveys ideally 10:00–16:00 (or 09:30–10:00 and 16:00–16:30 when unshaded and weather criteria met).
  - Weather criteria: between 11–17°C with at least 60% sunshine (upland exceptions apply), or above 17°C; wind < Beaufort 5.

## Online data entry and GIS workflow

- Registration and site setup:
  - Register at www.ukbms.org/axis2poll; list surveyed sites under “My Sites.”
  - For each 1 km² square, edit transect routes (S1–S10) on the map; the Transect Name and Grid Ref correspond to the square.
- Entering transect data:
  - Use “My Walks” to enter date, time, weather, and pollinator observations per taxon; complete all tabs for butterflies, bees, and hoverflies; complete plant DAFOR-X values.
  - Finish data entry only after all required fields are completed; you can return to incomplete entries via “My Walks.”
- Entering timed search data:
  - Use “My Timed Obs” to select the 1 km² square, enter 150 m² grid reference, upload the 150 m² photograph, and provide a caption (e.g., MSB_TL0438).
  - Enter weather data, DAFOR-X for the flowering plant cover, and complete the taxa matrices for observed insects and plant associations. Use “Other plants” with notes for any additional plant groups observed.
- Photography submission and QA:
  - Submit seven bee/hoverfly photos and the timed-search area photo under the Photo Observations tab with the required naming convention (e.g., JS_07_TL4038_Bee3).
  - Receive QA feedback from taxon experts; use identification help as needed.
- Quality assurance assessments:
  - Two online assessments (30 images total: 20 bees/hoverflies, 10 butterflies) test identification by taxon group; time-limited responses, with immediate feedback and a final score stored for group QA analysis.
- Data integrity and support:
  - If issues arise with online recording, contact project lead Marc Botham or designated support contacts.

## Standards, QA, and training

- Data quality assurance:
  - Photographs used for expert verification; species identification validated through photo QA and online assessments.
- Training and competence:
  - Online assessments mimic field identification tasks; results inform ongoing QA and staff calibration.

## Bio-security, equipment, and logistics

- Bio-security measures:
  - Mandatory disinfection between farms; higher concentration on TB-affected farms.
  - Surveyors receive sprayers, gloves, disinfectant, safety gear, and boot-cleaning protocols; boots and vehicles must be cleaned between sites.
- Supplies and support:
  - Equipment lists and contact points provided for assistance and supply requests.
- Access and permissions:
  - Farmer contact and landowner permission required before surveying; weekly updates to FLO on completed squares and access issues.

## Contacts and coordination

- General contacts for field operations and site access queries:
  - Farm Liaison Officer (FLO): Anthea Owen
  - CEH liaison: Jodey Peyton
  - Head of Conservation, BC Wales: Russel Hobson
  - CEH personnel: Marc Botham, Angus Garbutt, and others noted
- For online data issues or QA queries, contact project coordinators and QA leads as listed in the procedure documentation.
