# GMEP-WP2-004

## Purpose and scope
- This is the pollinator field protocol handbook for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project (GMEP).
- Aims to support data collection on pollinators (butterflies to species level; bees and hoverflies by groups) and flowering plants to enable data-based insights and self-serve data products.
- Surveys occur twice per 1 km²: July and August, with at least 10 days between surveys.
- Data collected feed into wider data use and potential public dissemination; supports data quality, combination, and analysis across topics.

## What you collect and how
- Transect survey (2 km per 1 km²)
  - Fixed route, split into 10 x 200 m sections; routes run roughly N-S or E-W with spacing constraints.
  - Data recorded per section: butterfly species counts (to species level where possible), bee/hoverfly groups, and plant groups.
  - Recording form includes a DAFOR scale for flowering plants (dominant to not seen) limited to flowering cover; “X” for not seen but searched.
  - 5 m recording box around the surveyor for insects; capture only when necessary for identification (e.g., whites separated by underside of antennae); avoid double-counting individuals.
  - Start times, weather, temperatures, and GPS/grid references recorded; routes should be drawn on maps and kept consistent between July and August.
  - Changes to routes allowed only when necessary; permanent changes update the online record; deviations between lines should be minimized.
- Timed search (within a 150 m² area)
  - Locate a flowering patch within the square; spend 10–20 minutes (minimum 10 minutes, maximum 20).
  - Record insects visiting flowers by plant group; also record insects not at flowers.
  - Photograph the 150 m² area before the timed search; record DAFOR-X for flower cover.
  - Data entered in a separate timed-obs form with a grid matching plant groups to insect visits; include location (grid ref) and weather.
- Photographs
  - Seven photographs: one specimen from each Bee and Hoverfly group for QA; additional ID photos as needed.
  - Photos submitted online with standardized naming; reduced file size advised for efficiency.
- Data notes
  - Record additional species if confidently identified without significantly slowing the survey; use separate notes for extra species.

## Data entry and online submission
- All data entered via www.ukbms.org/axis2poll after registering.
- Site setup: edit 1 km² site, draw transect routes, and define 10 sections per square.
- Transect data entry: My Walks – date, time, weather; then species tallies by taxonomic group; fill all plant and observation boxes (DAFOR-X) for transect.
- Timed observation data entry: My Timed Obs – select 1 km square, enter 150 m² plot grid ref, upload the photo, capture notes, and enter weather and plant-influenced tallies.
- Noting extra plant groups: use “Other plants” and “Notes” for additional plant groups; tallies for each pollinator visit can be summed across extra plant groups.
- Photo observations: upload seven photos under Photo Observations with standardized captions.
- Completion: use Finish; re-enter via My Walks or My Timed Obs to complete any missing data.

## Data quality assurance and assessments
- Photographs reviewed by taxonomic experts as part of QA.
- Online assessments: two image-based quizzes (end of July and end of August) to test pollinator identification, using a timed response format.
- Assessments report scores; results compiled in a spreadsheet to evaluate surveyors’ accuracy.

## Bio-security and safety
- Strict bio-security: disinfect between farms; enhanced disinfectant on TB-affected farms.
- Equipment provided (sprayers, gloves, disinfectants, goggles, masks); boots and gear must be cleaned before/after each site visit.
- Carry spray for boots when accessing new landowner properties.
- Contact project staff for additional supplies or queries.

## Schedule, permissions, and field conditions
- Permissions require a two-week survey window reported to the Farm Liaison Officer (FLO); farmers receive access letters.
- Weather and time constraints:
  - Best survey times 10:00–16:00 (or 09:30–10:00 and 16:00–16:30 if conditions allow).
  - Conditions: 11–17°C with at least 60% sunshine (upland: >11°C with less than 60% sunshine allowed), or >17°C regardless of sunshine, and wind < Beaufort 5.
- Meteorological tools recommended for planning (weather apps listed in the document).
- Urban/verge habitats avoided in transect routes; minor intrusions into adjacent squares allowed if necessary.

## Outputs and data use
- Data are intended to support self-serve analysis, dashboards, and reports for policymakers and researchers.
- Outputs include transect routes, species counts, plant-pollinator associations, and timed-search results suitable for mapping and trend analysis.
- QA processes (photograph review and online identifications assessments) bolster data reliability for wider data use.

## Contacts and support
- Roles include Farm Liaison Officer for permissions and logistical queries; CEH and partner contacts for project-specific support and QA.
- Primary points of contact for site access and data issues are outlined in the document.

## Appendix and revision notes
- Version history: initial protocol (2013) with minor updates in 2014; addition of QA procedures and new health and safety documents.
