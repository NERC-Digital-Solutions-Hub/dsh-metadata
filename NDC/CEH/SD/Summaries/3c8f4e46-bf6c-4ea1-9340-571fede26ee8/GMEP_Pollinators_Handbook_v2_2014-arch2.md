# GMEP Pollinator Field Protocol

- Pollinator surveys are conducted twice in each 1 km2 square: July and August, with a minimum of 10 days between surveys.
- If weather prevents a full July survey, the first survey should occur as early as possible in August for the affected squares.
- Permissions: surveyors obtain farm access via a two-week permission window, with FLO issuing letters to farmers; maps provided showing accessible farms and contact details; weekly updates to FLO and project leads on completed squares and access issues.
- Weather and planning: plan surveys using forecast guidance; recommended meteorological apps; flexible scheduling to accommodate weather.

## Who and How They Operate

- Analysts monitor environmental data using standardized, established sources and methods.
- Tasks include data verification, QA, cleaning, transformation, and presenting results in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).
- Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals; emphasis on enabling broad access to underlying data.

## Survey Design and Data Collection

- Insect surveys focus on:
  - Butterflies recorded to species level.
  - Bees and hoverflies recorded by predefined groups.
- Flowering plant groups are recorded to aid interpretation of pollinator data.
- Two-part survey per 1 km2:
  - Standardised 2 km transect route (two 1 km lines split into ten 200 m sections).
  - Timed search in a 150 m2 flower-rich patch within the square.
- Transect data collection:
  - Maps provided with land access classifications, farm boundaries, habitat types, and transect route grid.
  - Recording forms capture abundances (butterflies, bees, hoverflies) in each 200 m section.
  - Plant groups use DAFOR scale (Dominant to Rare) for flower cover; DAFOR-X used when flowers are in patches.
  - Start times, weather, and a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m recording box define the observation area.
  - For difficult species (e.g., separating Small/Essex Skippers), sampling strategies are provided; approximate proportions used to estimate numbers where necessary.
- Route setup and adjustments:
  - Fixed transect routes intended to be 2 km long, with two parallel 1 km lines; sections are 200 m each.
  - Routes should avoid urban habitats; deviation between lines should remain at least 100 m apart.
  - If access issues force changes, temporary changes keep original routes for future visits; permanent changes update the online record.
  - Exact routes drawn on online and hard-copy maps; six-figure GPS references recorded for each section.
- Timed search details:
  - A 150 m2 area chosen within the 1 km2 transect to maximize flowering plant coverage.
  - Photograph the area before the timed search and record a DAFOR-X score for flower coverage in the 150 m2.
  - Timed searches last 10–20 minutes, with continuous movement; up to 20 minutes if abundance is high.
  - If the transect is paused for the timed search, continue from the same point after the search.
  - Data entry includes a plant-by-plant group matrix of insects observed, with separate “Not at flower” categories when applicable.
- Photographs:
  - Required photographs include one specimen photo for each of the seven Bee/Hoverfly groups and a specimen photo for each butterfly group (as applicable); additional photos for uncertain identifications are allowed.
  - Photos must be uploaded online; naming conventions and file size guidelines are provided.
- Recording and identification support:
  - Simple ID guides and online insect identification support are available; expert help can be sought via email.
  - Observers should record only what is confidently identified without unduly increasing survey time.

## Timing, Weather, and Conditions

- Ideal survey window: 10:00–16:00; alternative windows 09:30–10:00 and 16:00–16:30 if conditions permit.
- Temperature: 11–17°C with at least 60% sunshine (upland exceptions: ≥11°C with <60% sunshine acceptable).
- Temperature above 17°C is acceptable regardless of sunshine; wind must be < Beaufort 5.
- Sunshine is estimated by the proportion of transect shaded during the walk.
- Temperature and weather are recorded on the data entry forms; the Beaufort scale is used for wind.

## Online Data Entry and Quality Assurance

- All data are submitted online at ukbms.org/axis2poll.
- Registration required; sites are added under “My Sites” and transects drawn for each 1 km2 (S1–S10 per section).
- Transect data entry:
  - Enter date, time, weather, and insect counts per taxa; use DAFOR-X for plant cover.
  - Complete all sections; use “Finish” to finalize, with the option to return to incomplete entries.
- Timed observation data entry:
  - Under “My Timed Obs,” select the relevant 1 km2, enter 150 m2 plot grid reference, upload the photo, and caption (e.g., initials_1km square).
  - Enter weather details and DAFOR-X scores for the flower cover; complete taxon matrices similarly to transects.
- Photo submissions:
  - Use the “Photo Observations” tab; photos named according to a specified scheme (e.g., JS_07_TL4038_Bee3).
- Quality Assurance:
  - Expert review of submitted photos; online assessments of pollinator identification (two rounds, July and August).
  - Assessments include 30 images (20 bees/hoverflies, 10 butterflies); multiple-choice and species/group identification with immediate feedback.
  - Scores are stored in a spreadsheet for project-wide accuracy assessment.

## Bio-security and Safety

- Strict bio-security: disinfectants and procedures between farms due to TB risks; higher concentration required on TB squares.
- Equipment and supplies provided (sprayers, gloves, disinfectants, protective gear).
- Boots, vehicle tires, and equipment must be cleaned before moving to new landowners; boots sprayed between properties.
- Health and safety guidelines are provided; contact Jodey Peyton for supplies or queries.

## General Contacts and Support

- Farm Liaison Officer: Anthea Owen (permissions, access updates)
- CEH contacts: Jodey Peyton and Marc Botham (project queries, data issues)
- Additional project contacts provided in the document for protocol and QA queries
