# GMEP Procedure, 1 = Pollinator Field Protocol

- Purpose: Pollinator field protocol handbook for the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project (GMEP). Outlines survey design, data collection, recording, submission, quality assurance, and safety requirements for pollinator monitoring.

## Data Governance & Stakeholders

- Key roles: Farm Liaison Officer (FLO), CEH contacts, GMEP Survey Manager, and BC Wales leadership; responsibilities include permissions, access, and data flow.
- Permissions and access: Surveys require landowner permission; initial two-week access window; landowner contacts may be updated by FLO; clear escalation if access issues arise.
- Data ownership and provenance: Data collected across farms within 1 km^2 squares; metadata includes location, route, timing, weather, and survey conditions; changes to routes documented and updated in the online system.

## Data Collection Workflow

- Survey cadence: Two annual pollinator surveys per 1 km^2, in July and August, with at least 10 days between the two surveys.
- Survey windows and weather: Ideally 10:00–16:00, or 09:30–10:00 and 16:00–16:30 if conditions meet criteria; weather thresholds include temperature, sunshine, and wind limits.
- Bio-security: Mandatory disinfection protocols between farms; equipment provided; boots and vehicles cleaned; heightened disinfectant use on TB farms.
- Supplies and safety: Disinfectants, sprayers, gloves, goggles, masks; gear for field access and safety; follow H&S documentation and supplier guidance.

## Field Methods

- Survey components:
  - Transect survey: 2 km total per 1 km^2, comprising two fixed 1-km lines subdivided into ten 200 m sections; recording within a 5 m x 5 m x 5 m box around the observer.
  - Timed search: A 150 m^2 area within the square, chosen each survey, for 10–20 minutes to record pollinators and flowering plant resources.
- Transect setup:
  - Routes should be fixed and drawn on maps; aim for lines 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge; deviations allowed but kept minimal.
  - If routes must change, document temporary vs permanent changes; update online records if permanent changes occur.
  - Avoid urban habitats in transects; use GPS grid references and section-specific mapping for accuracy.
- Data collection details:
  - Recording forms include butterfly species tallies, bee/hoverfly group tallies, and flowering plant groups (DAFOR scale).
  - Plant data collected only for flowering vegetation; DAFOR-X used for flowers observed on 150 m^2 timed area.
  - Timing, start/end times, and weather conditions recorded; average temperature estimated via field readings.
  - Capture of difficult-to-distinguish species (e.g., Small/Essex Skipper) may be necessary; proportions estimated along transect and recorded if identification requires examination.
  - Recording should avoid double-counting individuals unless clearly separate sightings; if unsure, count per observation.
- Photographs:
  - Required photographs of one representative per Bee and Hoverfly group (seven total); additional insect/plant photos optional for identification.
  - Photograph naming conventions provided for submission.

## Recording & Metadata Standards

- Data capture on forms:
  - Transect: species/groups tallies by 10 sections; DAFOR scores for plant groups; only flowering plant cover recorded.
  - Timed search: insect tallies by plant group across observed flowers; Not at flower column used for insects not visiting flowers.
  - Location data: exact grid references for each transect section; start times and weather details.
- Plant and insect taxonomy:
  - Butterflies identified to species level; bees/hoverflies recorded to group level; additional notes for other observed taxa.
  - Extra plant groups observed may be logged under “Other Plant groups” with notes on observed visitors.
- Data entry fields:
  - Transect data entered via My Walks with date, time, weather; structure supports per-taxa tab entry and notes.
  - Timed observations entered via My Timed Obs with 150 m^2 plot grid reference, photograph upload, and corresponding plant-insect matrices.

## Online Data Entry & Data Model

- Platform: www.ukbms.org/axis2poll; user registration required; site-by-site data entry under My Sites.
- Transect data workflow:
  - Define Transect Name and Grid Ref; draw each 1-km section (S1–S10) on map; record start times, weather, and insect counts.
  - Enter tallies per species/group; apply DAFOR-X for flowering plants; include Additional plants in “Other plants” with notes.
- Timed observation workflow:
  - Create entry under My Timed Obs; select 1 km square; specify 150 m^2 plot location (grid reference or map); upload photograph with caption format.
  - Enter weather, DAFOR-X for flower coverage, and per-plant group visitation data for each insect group; include notes for extra plant groups.
- Photos and QA:
  - Submit seven photos (one per Bee/Hoverfly group) via Photo Observations; file naming follows a standardized scheme.
  - Identification assistance available; large photos should be resized for efficient upload.
- Data submission integrity:
  - Finish workflow after completing required fields; ability to revisit and adjust submissions via My Walks or My Timed Obs.

## Quality Assurance

- Photo-based QA: Experts review submitted insect photos for taxonomic accuracy.
- Online assessments: Two image-based quizzes (July and August) test surveyor identification accuracy (30 images per session; timed response; feedback provided).
- Scoring and reporting: Post-assessment scores recorded in a spreadsheet to track overall data quality across surveyors.

## Data Access, Updates & Change Management

- Route changes: Document changes (temporary vs permanent) and update online maps accordingly; ensure future surveys follow updated routes.
- Data updates: All entries are amendable through the online portal; ensure consistent data entry across July and August rounds.
- Resolution of access issues: Contacts provided for site access and permissions; updates to landowner data should be reflected by FLO.

## Appendices & Supporting Materials

- Maps, figures, and recording forms referenced (e.g., Figure 1: 5 x 5 x 5 m recording box; Figure 2: transect design).
- Meteorological references and Beaufort scale for field condition assessment.
- Contact channels for general queries and supply needs (e.g., Field Operations and project leads).

## Version History

- Version 2 (May 2014): Minor protocol clarifications; added QA procedure and new H&S/risk assessment documents; updated to reflect end-of-year field-season feedback.
