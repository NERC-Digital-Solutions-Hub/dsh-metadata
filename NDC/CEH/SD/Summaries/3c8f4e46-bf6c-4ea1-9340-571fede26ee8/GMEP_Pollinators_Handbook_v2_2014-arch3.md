# GMEP Pollinator Field Protocol

- Purpose and scope
  - Pollinator surveys designed to identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy under the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project (GMEP).
  - Focus on butterflies, bees, hoverflies, and flowering plants to inform policy decisions and future monitoring.

- Permissions and field access
  - Surveyors must obtain landowner permission via a two-week notice.
  - Farm Liaison Officer (FLO) to issue letters; surveyors receive access maps and farmer contact details.
  - Surveyors should contact landowners if they cannot survey within the pre-defined period; weekly updates to FLO and designated contacts.

- Survey design and workflow
  - Insects targeted: butterflies (species level), bees and hoverflies (group level); flowering plants recorded to aid interpretation.
  - Two independent components per 1 km2:
    - Standardised 2 km transect route (comprising two 1 km lines, split into ten 200 m sections).
    - Timed search in a 150 m2 flower-rich area within the square (10–20 minutes).
  - Transect setup
    - Transect routes fixed per 1 km2; routes drawn on maps and online; GPS references to be recorded at section start.
    - Lines ideally about 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge; deviations allowed but lines must not converge closer than 100 m.
    - Urban/roadside habitats to be avoided on transects; minor intrusions into adjacent squares permitted.
  - Recording on transects
    - Recording forms include butterfly species and counts, bee/hoverfly groups, and plant groups using a DAFOR scale (for flowering plants only).
    - 5 m x 5 m x 5 m recording box around the surveyor; limit observations to this box.
    - For difficult-to-distinguish species, optional temporary capture for identification; avoid double-counting individuals.
    - Start time, date, and environmental details recorded at top of the form; temperature read during timed search.
  - Timed search specifics
    - Locate a 150 m2 area with good flowering plant coverage; photograph before timed search; record DAFOR-X for flower cover.
    - Begin and end times recorded; 10–20 minutes of continuous search; counts may be tallied or stopped to count if necessary.
    - Insect data captured by plant group during timed search; not necessarily at flowers, with separate “Not at flower” column when applicable.
  - Plant and feeding context
    - Only flowering plants are recorded for pollinator resources; if additional plant groups are important, capture via “Other Plant groups” with notes.
    - Grid references and relevant plant groups noted for online data entry; extra plant groups tallied across the area as needed.
  - Photographs
    - One photo per bee and hoverfly group (seven photos total) plus optional extra photographs for identification help.
    - Photos submitted online; naming conventions provided (e.g., initials_month_1km square_insect group).

- Data capture and online entry
  - Portal: ukbms.org/axis2poll (registration required)
  - Site setup: Create site records, draw transect routes (S1–S10), and input 1 km square grid references.
  - Data entry workflow
    - My Walks: enter date, weather, and pollinators seen by taxonomic group; proceed through tabs for each group; complete all data before finishing.
    - Timed observations: My Timed Obs; specify 1 km square and grid reference for the 150 m2 area; upload timed search photo; enter weather and plant-group data.
    - Plant and insect data: use DAFOR-X for plant cover; note extra plant groups under “Other plants” with notes; combine tallies if multiple plant groups are recorded.
  - Photo observations
    - Submit seven photos (Bee and Hoverfly groups) via “Photo Observations”; file naming guidance provided to standardize submissions.

- Quality assurance
  - Photo-based expert QA of pollinator taxa.
  - Two online assessments (July and August) using a set of 30 images to test identification accuracy (bees/hoverflies at group level; butterflies at species level).
  - Immediate feedback on each image with correct answers; results compiled into a spreadsheet to assess team-wide accuracy.

- Bio-security and equipment
  - Mandatory disinfection between farms; enhanced disinfection (TB farms) with increased concentrate.
  - Equipment provided includes sprayers, gloves, disinfectants, safety gear; boots and vehicle hygiene required between sites.

- General contacts and support
  - Primary contacts for queries: Anthea Owen (Farm Liaison Officer) and Jodey Peyton (CEH)
  - Additional CEH contacts and support line for online issues

- Version history
  - Version 2 (May 2014): Minor protocol clarifications, added QA procedures, updated H&S and risk assessment documents.

- Relevance to Monitoring Framework authors
  - Establishes a standardized, auditable monitoring protocol with explicit data collection, QA, and data submission requirements to support policy scrutiny and future decision-making.
  - Addresses data governance through mandatory online data entry, explicit permissions, and ongoing QA assessments.
  - Acknowledges data challenges typical for monitoring frameworks, including access to field data, metadata completeness (GPS coordinates, timing, weather), and the need for clear communication of complex results (via structured reporting and visual outputs).
  - Incorporates open-data-friendly practices (publicly share underlying data, clear metadata fields, and documented workflow) while recognizing potential barriers such as data-sharing constraints and field-access variability.
