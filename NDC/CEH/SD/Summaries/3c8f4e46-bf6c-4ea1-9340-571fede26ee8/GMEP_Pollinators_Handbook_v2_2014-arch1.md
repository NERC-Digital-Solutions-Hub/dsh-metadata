# GMEP Pollinator Field Protocol

- Purpose: Two pollinator surveys per 1 km² (July and August) to identify correlations among pollinators (butterflies at species level; bees and hoverflies by group) and flowers, supporting the Glastir Monitoring and Evaluation project.

- Study scale and design:
  - 1 km² squares with fixed 2 km transect routes, split into 10 x 200 m sections (S1–S10).
  - A separate 150 m² timed search area within the square to assess flowering resources.
  - Transects are repeated in July and August; routes are intended to be identical across visits, with documented changes if necessary.
  - Routes should generally be 500 m apart and 250 m from square edge; deviations allowed but keep lines at least 100 m apart if they diverge.

- Permissions and access:
  - Surveyors announce a two-week planned survey window to the Farm Liaison Officer (FLO).
  - Letters issued to farmers; maps show access and contact details; surveys require landowner permission.
  - Weekly updates to FLO with completed squares and access issues.

- Field roles and contacts:
  - FLO: Anthea Owen; CEH: Jodey Peyton and others; project leads and coordinators listed.
  - Bio-security and supplies managed through designated contacts (e.g., Jodey Peyton).

- Survey methods and recording:
  - Insect groups:
    - Butterflies recorded to species level; bees and hoverflies recorded by group.
    - Recording forms include a 5 m x 5 m box around the surveyor; tallies used for abundances.
    - High-abundance butterfly counts may use approximate tallies; avoid double-counting the same individual.
    - Small/Essex Skipper differentiation in Wales; capture of ten or more individuals may be used to estimate proportions; release and resume recording from the capture point.
  - Plant data:
    - Flowering plant groups recorded; use DAFOR scale (Dominant, Abundant, Frequent, Occasional, Rare, X).
    - For timed searches, record DAFOR-X for flowering plants only (not vegetative cover).
  - Recording tools:
    - Two main data streams: transect (2 km total) and timed search (150 m² area).
    - Start times, weather, and 6-figure GPS references collected for each 200 m section.
    - Photos of timed search area and specimen photographs for bee/hoverfly groups (7 photos total) required.

- Setting up transects and routes:
  - Each square: fixed routes drawn on online maps; hard-copy maps used in the field.
  -GPS references and precise route drawing required; routes should be drawn for online entry and field use.
  - Changes to routes: temporary changes documented; permanent changes updated in online records.

- Timed search procedures:
  - 10–20 minute continuous search in the 150 m² area for butterflies, bees, and hoverflies; location may vary between July and August.
  - Photograph the 150 m² area before the timed search; record start/end times and plant-coverage (DAFOR-X).
  - If the entire area is covered before 10 minutes, continue searching to reach minimum duration.

- Photographs and submission:
  - Submit 7 photographs (one per bee/hoverfly group) to QA checks; additional photos for uncertain identifications.
  - File naming and upload guidance provided; prefer online submission to minimize large email attachments.

- Online data entry and data management:
  - Data submitted via ukbms axis2poll portal; users must register.
  - Site setup: “My Sites” to edit transect routes; each S1–S10 section mapped.
  - Transect data entry: date, time, weather; then per-taxon tallies; DAFOR-X for plants; notes for extra plant groups.
  - Timed observation data entry: select 1 km square, input 150 m² plot grid reference, upload timed-search photo, and complete weather and plant group matrices; record “Not at flower” observations as needed.
  - Finish and review options to return to incomplete entries if needed.
  - Photo observations tab for submission of pollinator photos; photographs named with a standardized format.

- Quality Assurance (QA):
  - Expert review of submitted photos; two online identifications assessments (end of July and end of August) using a fixed set of 30 images (bees/hoverflies and butterflies).
  - Assessors select identifications; feedback provided; scores stored for cross-surveyor accuracy analysis.

- Bio-security and health and safety:
  - Strict disinfection between farms; enhanced disinfection on TB-infected farms (four bottles disinfectant per 3 L water).
  - Equipment and PPE supplied; boots sprayed between farms; protocols to minimize bio-security risk.

- General operational details:
  - Weather and timing constraints: surveys ideally 10:00–16:00; alternative windows allowed if sun and temperature conditions met.
  - Weather criteria: above 11°C with at least 60% sunshine (upland exceptions); above 17°C or wind < Beaufort 5; sunshine measured as transect shading coverage.
  - Recording should focus on confident identifications; limited to main taxa; additional species can be logged separately if not time-intensive.
  - Data and datasets may be made discoverable with metadata; aim to support broader data integration and analysis.

- Version history and governance:
  - Document created April 2013; last revision May 2014 with minor protocol updates, QA procedures, and new H&S/risk documents.

- Contact points for queries:
  - Primary project contacts listed; FLO for site access; Jodey Peyton for general queries.
