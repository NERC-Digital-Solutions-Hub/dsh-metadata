# Carbon concentrations in natural and restoration pools in blanket peatlands in Scotland, 2013-2015

## Overview
- Study of carbon concentrations in natural and restoration (artificial) pools within blanket peatlands in Scotland, conducted 2013–2015.
- Data generation and collection methods documented in the cited Hydrological Processes 2022 manuscript.
- Data quality controlled; values below detection limits addressed.

## Datasets included
- Six CSV files, with site coverage and variables varying by file:
  - Pool_Carbon_Quarterly (Sites: CL, LL, MU)
    - All data from LL, CL, MU pooled into one table; quarterly sampling.
    - Key fields: Year, Date, Time, Quarter, Pool, Treat (NAT/ART), Site, pH, EC, DO, Water Temp, abs254, SUVA, E4E6, DOC, POC, CH4, CO2, Pool area, Pool depth, Pool volume.
  - Pool_Carbon_Routine (Sites: CL only)
    - Frequent routine sampling at CL.
    - Key fields include Year, Date, Week; DOC_BASE, DOC_INFLOW, DOC_OUTFLOW, DOC_SURFACE, DOC_OLF; pH, EC, DO, Water Temp, WTD; POC, CH4, CO2; abs254, SUVA, E4E6; Pool area, Pool depth, Pool volume.
  - Pool_Carbon_Routine_DOC (Sites: CL only)
    - Piezo soil water DOC data at depth; includes Year, Date, Week; Pool; Depth; DOC.
  - Pool_Carbon_Routine_Colour (Sites: CL only)
    - Piezo soil water colour data; includes Year, Date, Week; Pool; Depth; Abs254; E4E6; SUVA.
  - Pool_Carbon_Routine_Depth (Sites: CL only)
    - Depth below peat (water depth below peat surface); includes Year, Date, Week; Pool; Depth below peat.
  - Pool_Carbon_Routine_Soil (Sites: CL only)
    - Bulked soil solution data; includes Year, Date, Week; Pool; DOC; Abs254; E4E6; SUVA.

## Data quality and standards
- Data quality controlled; values below detection limits addressed as per manuscript protocols.
- Descriptions specify units and measurement methods for consistency across datasets.

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Timeframe: 2013–2015.
- Spatial coverage (datasets): CL, LL, MU for quarterly data; CL for routine and soil/colour/depth datasets.

## Variables and measurements
- Water chemistry and quality: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO), water temperature, absorbance at 254 nm (abs254), specific UV absorbance (SUVA), E4E6 ratio.
- Carbon and related metrics: DOC (dissolved organic carbon), POC (particulate organic carbon), CH4, CO2.
- Hydrology and pool geometry: pool area, pool depth, pool volume; for routine data also water table depth (WTD) and depth below peat.
- Pool classification: NAT = natural, ART = artificial/restoration.

## Data management and accessibility
- Data produced in standardized formats and prepared for storage and upload to appropriate data portals.
- Datasets are designed to support reproducible monitoring and cross-study comparisons.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and analysis
- Enables comparison of carbon dynamics between natural and restoration pools in peatlands.
- Facilitates analyses of DOC fate, carbon losses/gains, and gas emissions in relation to hydrology and pool characteristics.
- Supports integration with additional environmental datasets to enhance monitoring value and policy performance assessments.
- Highlights the importance of broad, standardised data collection approaches and accessible underlying data for transparency and reuse.
