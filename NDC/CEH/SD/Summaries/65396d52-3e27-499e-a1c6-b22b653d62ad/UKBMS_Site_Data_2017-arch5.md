# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview for Data Stewards
- A multi-institution, volunteer-driven program funded by Butterfly Conservation, Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Purpose: provide annual, site-based butterfly population data to monitor biodiversity status and inform policy.
- Large-scale data governance with ongoing data collection across many sites; data are analyzed collectively across components.

## Data collection framework
- Components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, weekly counts from April to September; ~26 counts/year at ~2000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods; timed counts; egg/larval web counts.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares; two parallel transects per square; 2–4 visits/year (July/August focus).
- Scope: UKBMS has monitored since 1976 with over 2500 active sites annually.
- Data are collected to balance depth at key sites with broader coverage in common habitats.

## Data and trend analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
- Indices reflect a constant proportion of the population; detectability varies by species.
- Trend aggregation uses the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) since 2016, with weighting by the proportion of the flight period surveyed per site/year to emphasize observed data over extrapolation.
- All seasonal counts across components are used to model yearly seasonal patterns and generate species-level indices.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, out-of-season records).
- Regional transect coordinators validate and monitor data throughout the season; further automated/manual validation includes range checks and distribution checks against known ranges.
- Corrections are made via queries and discussions with recorders/coordinators; edits update the primary UKBMS dataset.
