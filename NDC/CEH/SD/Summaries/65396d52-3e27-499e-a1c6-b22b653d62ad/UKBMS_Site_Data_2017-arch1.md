# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and governance
  - A long-running program organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Relies on volunteer data to monitor butterfly population status across the UK since 1976.
  - Data support understanding biodiversity trends and informing policy questions.

- Data collection framework and components
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects with weekly counts across a 5 m band, 26 counts per year at nearly 2000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, short-duration timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species or life stages.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects, 2–4 visits per year (4–8 visits encouraged), ~750 squares per year; designed to sample common habitats like farmland.
  - Data from all components are analyzed together to produce national and species-level indices.

- Data structure and analysis
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices are combined into species indices using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting based on the proportion of the species flight period surveyed at each site/year.
  - The approach uses all counts in a season to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, with higher weight given to observed counts.

- Quality control and data validation
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker, and uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, species outside flight period).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate records; ongoing checks during the season.
  - Additional automated and manual validation searches for records outside known distributions or abnormal patterns; edits made as needed.
