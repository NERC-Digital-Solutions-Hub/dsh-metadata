# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- A collaborative program funded and organized by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- Relies on volunteers; data collected annually on butterfly population status across the UK.
- Combines site-based monitoring with random 1km-square sampling; used to understand population changes and inform biodiversity policy.
- In operation since 1976 with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year; results from all components are analyzed together.

## Data collection framework
- Three main components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km), recording all butterflies in a ~5 m wide band, weekly from April to September (target ~26 counts/year; ~2,000 sites).
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific focal species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): transect methodology applied to stratified random 1km squares; ~2 parallel 1-km transects with 2–4 visits per year (spring visits encouraged); ~750 squares sampled annually.
- Sampling framework integrates multiple methods to cover both common and habitat-specific species.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Data are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site index represents a constant proportion of butterflies present, with detection varying by species.
- Annual indices combined using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) (developed 2016), with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- Counts from all components are used to estimate seasonal patterns; gaps are extrapolated, with observed data weighted more heavily than extrapolated data.

## Quality control
- Field data collected on standard forms; entered online or via Transect Walker; uploaded to a centralized database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods); regional coordinators perform ongoing validation.
- Further automated/manual validation screens for distribution range, flight period timing, atypical site records, and extreme abundances.
- Data corrections made through bespoke queries and coordination with transect recorders/coordinators.
