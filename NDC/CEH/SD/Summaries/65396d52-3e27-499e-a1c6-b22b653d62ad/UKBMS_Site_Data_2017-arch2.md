# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and organisation
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteers and provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity status and policy questions.
  - Since 1976, the scheme monitors changes in butterfly abundance across the UK, currently with over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
  - Results from all components are analysed together to produce overall indicators.

- Data collection methods (sampling framework)
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide counts, ~26 counts per year, across ~2,000 sites.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or reduced effort.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects per site, 2–4 visits per year (minimum 2 in July/August), ~750 squares annually.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
  - Trends are produced by combining site data using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with a weighting scheme that emphasizes observed data and accounts for the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year.
  - The approach uses counts from all components to estimate seasonal patterns and extrapolate for gaps, prioritizing actual observations in the final indices.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; data undergo additional automated and manual validation, including checks against known distributions and abnormal abundances.
  - Data corrections are made through queries and discussions with coordinators or recorders as needed.
