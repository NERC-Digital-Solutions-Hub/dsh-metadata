# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC). Volunteers contribute data, acknowledged for their essential role.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status across the UK to understand biodiversity trends and inform policy questions.

## Data Collection and Components

- Sampling framework combines site-based monitoring with randomly selected 1km squares, using three components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route, 2–4 km, surveyed weekly with ~26 counts per year, 5 m width, in suitable weather; ~2000 sites sampled yearly.
  - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and counts of eggs/larval webs for specific species.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–4 visits per year (more in July/August), ~750 squares annually.
- Data coverage spans from 1976 to present, with over 2500 active sites each year.

## Data Processing, Trend Analysis, and Quality Control

- Abundance indices are used (relative measures) rather than absolute counts; site indices reflect a stable proportion of the population, with variation by species detectability.
- Seasonal indices for each species are estimated using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (updated in 2016), weighting site-year data by the proportion of the flight period observed to balance observed and extrapolated counts.
- Quality assurance:
  - Field data recorded on standard forms, entered online or via Transect Walker, with automated checks for anomalous counts or out-of-season records.
  - Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing checks during the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation targets: records outside known distributions, out-of-season records, first-time site records, extreme abundances, and unusual site-year patterns.
  - Data edits are applied to the primary UKBMS dataset as needed.
