# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and leadership: The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. It relies on volunteer contributions and provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy questions.

- Monitoring framework and scale:
  - Combines site-based monitoring with random 1km-square sampling.
  - Main components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects (2–4 km) with weekly counts across a ~5 m band, typically 26 counts per year, at ~2000 sites.
    - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific life stages or species.
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1-km squares with two parallel transects, 2–4 visits per year (~750 squares/year).
  - Since 1976, UKBMS has monitored butterfly abundance across the UK; data from all components are analyzed together.

- Data types and trend analysis:
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices are weighted to reflect a constant proportion of the population observed; the final species indices (collated indices) use the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI, 2016) with site-year weighting by the surveyed proportion of the flight period.
  - Counts from all components are used to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate to account for survey gaps, prioritizing observed data over extrapolated data.

- Quality control and data management:
  - Field data collected on standard forms, then entered online via the UKBMS data site or Transect Walker software.
  - Automated checks flag potential data-entry errors; regional transect coordinators review records.
  - Additional validation checks include range checks against Butterflies for the Millennium data, flight-period alignment, new-site records, and unusual abundances.
  - Corrections are made through queries and consultations with coordinators or recorders; the UKBMS dataset is updated accordingly.

- Data download details:
  - The download provides location and attribute data for UK butterfly monitoring sites (1976–2017); sensitive sites are excluded.
  - Data format: CSV.
  - Key fields include Site number, Site name, Gridreference, Easting, Northing, Length, Country, No. Sections, No. Yrs surveyed, First year surveyed, Last year surveyed, Survey type (UKBMS or WCBS).

- Licence and attribution:
  - Data are available under the Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse with few conditions.
  - Citations and DOIs must be included in any reporting using the data.
  - Attribution statement: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.
  - Since 2017, submitters have agreed to data being shared under OGL; historic data: possible third-party IP restrictions may apply, and submissions can be raised if concerns arise.

- Collaboration and contact details:
  - UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset interpretation and are open to co-authorship and intellectual input in publications, conferences, or posters derived from UKBMS data.
