# Stable isotope values for 108 water samples collected in the Gandak River Basin, in Bihar,  India are presented, with accompanying values for SEC (specific electrical conductivity) for most of these samples.

## Overview
- 108 water samples collected in the Gandak River Basin, Bihar, India
- Sampling period: February 2017 to February 2019
- Sample types: surface water, groundwater, and rainfall
- Includes both daily-use groundwater (boreholes/wells) and surface sources (rivers, canals)
- Isotopes measured: deuterium (dD) and oxygen-18 (d18O) relative to VSMOW
- Accompanying SEC (specific electrical conductivity) data available for most samples
- Isotopic analysis performed by mass spectrometry at British Geological Survey laboratories (UK)
- Part of the CHANSE (Coupled Human And Natural Systems Environment) project

## Data and Methods
- Data fields described include:
  - sample_date
  - d18O VSMOW2 (‰)
  - dD VSMOW2 (‰)
  - SEC uS/cm
  - BGS LIMS or Lab Code (sample identifier or lab code)
- All fields support missing values represented as blanks
- Sample handling at source:
  - Unfiltered samples bottled at source in Nalgene bottles, filled to brim to minimize air incorporation
  - SEC measured at source with a field SEC meter
- Laboratory analysis:
  - Stable isotopes measured via mass spectrometry at BGS, UK
- Data collection context:
  - Data gathered as part of the CHANSE project

## Variables and Data Structure
- Core variables:
  - sample_date: date of sampling
  - d18O VSMOW2 (‰): oxygen-18 isotopic composition
  - dD VSMOW2 (‰): deuterium isotopic composition
  - SEC uS/cm: specific electrical conductivity
- Identified data source code:
  - BGS Sample identifier or Lab Code
- Data schema accommodates groundwater (tube wells, hand pumps), surface water (rivers, canals), and rainfall/rainwater samples
- Dataset includes a mix of groundwater depths, source types, and usage notes, with coordinates and sampling notes for many sites

## Site Locations and Sampling Notes
- Sampling sites span numerous IDs (e.g., 13965-0001 to 14466-0026, CHPat01–CHPat10, NIGL_001–NIGL_016, etc.)
- Geography:
  - Latitude and longitude coordinates provided for many samples
  - Surface elevation (mOD) noted where available
- Source types include:
  - River Gandak, canal, tributaries, rainwater/rainfall, groundwater (tube wells, hand pumps)
- Source use ranges:
  - Domestic use, irrigation, temple sites, hotels, etc.
- Depths vary from zero to over 150 m in some groundwater samples
- Sampling notes provide context such as timing relative to pumping, canal flow, potential contamination indicators (e.g., bubbles in flow, sediment, iron taste), and near-field usage observations
- Rainfall samples include multiple sites (e.g., CHPat*, Hajipur blocks, Valmiki Tiger Reserve blocks) with multiple rainfall events noted

## Data Quality and QA
- Sampling and handling practices described to preserve sample integrity (at source bottling, fill-to-brim technique)
- Use of standardized measurement and reporting formats to facilitate cross-comparison over time
- Missing values clearly indicated as blanks
- Data are intended to be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as part of ongoing monitoring workflows
- Datasets are stored/uploaded to appropriate data portals to enable access

## How this Supports Environmental Monitoring
- Enables assessment of environmental health over time through isotopic tracers and conductivity data
- Supports understanding of groundwater-surface water interactions, recharge sources, and mixing processes
- Facilitates analysis of spatial and temporal isotopic variability across the Gandak Basin
- Provides standardized outputs (isotope ratios and SEC) for integration with other environmental datasets
- Serves as a reproducible data source for policy performance and water resource management monitoring

## Access, Reuse, and Data Sharing
- Data collected as part of a recognised environmental monitoring initiative (CHANSE)
- Analysis performed by a reputable laboratory (BGS, UK) with clear documentation of methods
- Dataset structure and accompanying site metadata support data reuse, integration with other datasets, and broader accessibility
- Themes highlighted for improving data value include:
  - Combining this isotopic/SEC data with additional hydrological, climatic, or land-use datasets
  - Enhancing accessibility of underlying data for downstream users and decision-makers
