# Invasion process of Pinus radiata in South-Central Chile

## Objective and scope
- Characterize the invasion process of Pinus radiata in South-Central Chile.
- Identify which variables are relevant for invasion success and determine how those variables affect the process.
- Recognize that invasion success depends on both the invasive species and the invaded community (seed source, invaded habitat, and P. radiata natural regeneration).
- Use plantation data as seed source and field sampling to assess attributes such as age, height, density, cone counts, and serotiny estimation.
- Include fire as a factor in the experimental design (burned vs. not burned) across different habitat types.
- Evaluate natural regeneration by characterizing density, age, height, and cone presence.

## Study area and sampling frame
- Five representative ecosystems in central Chile: 
  - Bosque caducifolio andino (Huepil)
  - Matorral esclerófilo (San Javier)
  - Bosque Maulino (Constitución)
  - Bosque esclerófilo (Florida)
  - Bosque caducifolio de Concepción (Hualqui)
- In each ecosystem: three Pinus radiata commercial plantations near native patches, recently affected by fires; a control (unburned) area within the same plantation.
- Sampling design: for each ecosystem, 3 burned and 3 unburned sites (total 6 sites per ecosystem; 30 sites overall).
- Fire history context: fires occurred in 2017 (Constitución), 2010–2012 (Florida), 2021 (Hualqui); data collected 2020–2021 across sites.

## Data collection and sampling methods

### Plantation (seed source)
- Establish three 20 x 20 m plots within each plantation site.
- Measurements:
  - Plantation density (trees per hectare) when possible
  - Tree height (m)
  - Serotiny level: proportion of open vs. closed cones in the canopy (per tree)
- Additional data from owners: plantation age, year of last fire
- Cone assessment: for three trees per site, two observers count open/closed cones using binoculars; height measured with a hypsometer

### Invasion gradient (wilding regeneration)
- Establish three 2 m wide transects starting at the plantation edge; transects segmented into 10 m sections (up to 100 m, depending on native patch size)
- For each section:
  - Record all P. radiata wilding trees
  - Note tallest tree height and its age
- Native patch characterization along the same transects:
  - Ground, understory, and canopy cover via Braun-Blanquet categories (0–4; with corresponding percentage classes)

## Data structure and availability
- Data organized into three databases:
  - Database_Pradiata_invasion-Habitat.csv: habitat description and Braun-Blanquet cover (ground, understory, canopy) by area, fire status, site, transect, and section
  - Database_Pradiata_invasion_Plantation.csv: plantation seed-source data including area, fire status, site, fire year, plantation year, density, sampled trees, height, cone counts (open/closed/total) from two observers
  - Database_Pradiata_invasion_Regeneration.csv: regeneration data including area, fire status, site, transect, section, wilding abundance, tallest height, age, and estimated density

## Analytical and monitoring implications
- Standardized data collection across multiple ecosystems and fire conditions supports cross-site comparisons of invasion dynamics.
- Enables identification of key variables driving invasion success (seed-source attributes, habitat conditions, and regeneration metrics).
- Data can be used to monitor environmental health and inform management policies on invasive conifers, with outputs suitable for reports, maps, and charts.
- Datasets are structured to facilitate verification, quality assurance, and potential integration with other relevant data to enhance environmental monitoring value.
- Addresses challenges of data value and accessibility by organizing data into clear, portable CSV databases and planning for broader data sharing and reuse.
