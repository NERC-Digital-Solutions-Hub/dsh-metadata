# Characterization of the invasion process of Pinus radiata in South-Central Chile

## Aim
- Characterize the invasion process of Pinus radiata in South-Central Chile.
- Identify which variables influence invasion success and how they affect the process.
- Consider both the invasive species and the invaded community (seed source, invaded habitat, and natural regeneration).

## Study area
- Five representative ecosystems in central Chile:
  - Bosque caducifolio andino (Huepil)
  - Matorral esclerófilo (San Javier)
  - Bosque Maulino (Constitución)
  - Bosque esclerófilo (Florida)
  - Bosque caducifolio de Concepción (Hualqui)
- For each ecosystem:
  - Three Pinus radiata commercial plantations near native forest patches recently affected by fires (or unburned control within the same plantation).
  - On each condition (burned Q or not burned NQ), three sites were established (total 6 sites per ecosystem; 30 sites overall).
- Fire history and data collection timeline:
  - Fires occurred in Constitución (2017), Florida (2010–2012), Hualqui (2021); Huepil and San Javier had no recent fires.
  - Data collected in 2020 (San Javier, Tucapel) and 2021 (Constitución, Hualqui, Florida).
- Geographic scope: Maule and Biobío Regions, South-Central Chile.

## Sampling design and methods
- Plantation characterization:
  - Three 20 m × 20 m plots per site within the plantation stand.
  - Variables measured: plantation density (trees/ha), tree height (m), serotinity level (open vs. closed cones as a percentage of total cones per sampled tree).
  - Additional data: plantation year, year of fire (from plantation owners).
  - Cone counts: three trees per site; two observers counted open/closed cones using binoculars; height estimated with a hypsometer.
- Invasion wave (native patch) assessment:
  - Three 2 m wide transects starting from the plantation edge and extending into the native patch.
  - Transects divided into 10 m sections; up to 100 m long sections depending on patch size.
  - For each section: record all P. radiata wilding trees, plus height of the tallest tree and its age.
- Native patch characterization (along transects):
  - In each section, estimate ground, understory, and canopy cover using Braun-Blanquet categories (five categories from 0 to 4 corresponding to 0–100% cover in graded steps).
- Spatial purpose:
  - Designed to capture short-distance dispersal from plantation into native vegetation.

## Data collected and variables
- Plantation data (seed source characteristics):
  - Study area, fire status (NQ or Q), Site (1–3), Fire date, Plantation year, plantation density, sampled trees (1–3), height, observed cones (open, closed, total) by two observers.
- Habitat data (invaded habitat description):
  - Study area, fire status, Site (1–3), Transect (1–3), Section (1–10), ground/understory/canopy Braun-Blanquet categories (1–4).
- Regeneration data (natural regeneration of P. radiata):
  - Study area, fire status, Site (1–3), Transect (1–3), Section (1–10), pine abundance (number of wildings per section), tallest pine height, age, estimated pine density (pines/ha) per section.

## Database structure
- Database_Pradiata_invasion-Habitat.csv
  - Habitat description and cover data per study area, fire status, site, transect, section, and Braun-Blanquet cover categories for ground, understory, and canopy.
- Database_Pradiata_invasion_Plantation.csv
  - Plantation source data per study area, fire status, site, fire year, plantation year, density, and for each sampled tree: height, cones (open/closed/total) from two observers.
- Database_Pradiata_invasion_Regeneration.csv
  - Regeneration data per study area, fire status, site, transect, section, pine abundance (wildings), tallest height, age, and estimated density (pines/ha).

## Temporal context
- Fieldwork conducted in 2020–2021 across the five ecosystems.
- Data capture includes recent fire histories and spatially explicit sampling to relate invasion patterns to habitat structure and serotiny-related cone dynamics.
