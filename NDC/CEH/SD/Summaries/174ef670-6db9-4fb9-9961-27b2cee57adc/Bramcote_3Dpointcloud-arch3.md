# Data collection

- A dataset of two overlapping terrestrial LiDAR scans capturing 18000 m² of woodland in Bramcote Hills Park, Nottinghamshire, UK, collected on 13 January 2023 using a Leica RTC360 instrument.
- Purpose: part of a study linking forest structure with (e)DNA metabarcoding of soil and leaf litter samples to understand ecological connections facilitated by lianas (specifically Hendra helix) within forests.
- Scope: approximately 200 million forest-structure measurements across mixed infested and non-infested trees, with lianas present increasing structure and leaf litter production/quality.

- Contextual details: spatial coverage defined as coordinates around 52.936°–52.938° lat and -1.251°–-1.249° lon.

- Relevance to monitoring: supports integration of structural forest data with ecological and biodiversity analyses, informing monitoring of habitat complexity and potential drivers of soil/litter biodiversity.

- Data provenance and governance considerations:
  - Data produced for scientific analysis combining LiDAR with molecular data.
  - Requires clear metadata to enable reproducibility and reuse, including instrument model, scan settings, and processing steps.
  - Sharing of underlying data is feasible but depends on metadata availability and data governance practices.

- Key links to monitoring framework practices:
  - Demonstrates the need to quantify and document data quality, provenance, and processing workflows.
  - Highlights potential barriers identified in monitoring frameworks, such as metadata gaps, data access, and governance requirements for large, high-density datasets.
