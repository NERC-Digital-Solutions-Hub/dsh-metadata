# Data collection

- What it is: Terrestrial LiDAR (laser scanning) point cloud data from Bramcote Hills Park (Nottinghamshire, UK), consisting of two overlapping scans covering ~18,000 m² of woodland, including lianas (Hendra helix) and non-infested trees. Collected to study ecological connections facilitated by lianas by linking forest structure with eDNA metabarcoding of soil and leaf litter.
- Acquisition and scope:
  - Date: 13 January 2023
  - Instrument: Leica RTC360
  - Coverage: approximately 52.936–52.938 N and -1.251–-1.249 E
  - Combined dataset contains ~200 million points; point density ~11,000 points per m²
- Data products and workflow:
  - Two scans converted from proprietary .scan to LAS (.las) using Leica Cyclone; missing header info added with LAStools
  - File names: wooded_scan_location1.las and wooded_scan_location2.las
  - Individual scan statistics: scan1 ≈ 94.9 million points; scan2 ≈ 100.7 million points
- Data format and content (LAS format):
  - Per-point attributes:
    - X, Y, Z: coordinates (easting, northing, height) in metres
    - intensity: 0–65534 (unitless)
    - return_number: order of the return for a laser pulse
    - number_of_returns: total returns for the pulse
    - R, G, B: color values (0–65280)
- Coordinate system and units:
  - Spatial reference: WGS84 UTM Zone 30N
  - Distances (X, Y) and heights (Z) in metres
- Quality and reliability:
  - Horizontal/vertical accuracy: 5.3 mm at 40 m distance (sensor specification)
  - Overall data quality supported by high point density and dual-scan coverage
- Data structure summary:
  - LAS format with key fields: X, Y, Z, intensity, return_number, number_of_returns, R, G, B
- Relevance for data use and analysis:
  - Enables high-resolution analysis of forest structure (e.g., canopy and understory geometry)
  - Facilitates integration with ecological data (e.g., eDNA metabarcoding) to explore links between physical structure and biodiversity or litter/soil processes
  - Supports development of data products for end users (e.g., dashboards, self-serve analyses) and potential visualization or export of structural metrics
- Practical considerations for data support:
  - Ensure consistent coordinate reference when combining with other datasets
  - Maintain metadata on processing steps (conversion from .scan to LAS, header completion)
  - Be mindful of integrating data from two scans to avoid duplicate features or misalignment when creating unified products
