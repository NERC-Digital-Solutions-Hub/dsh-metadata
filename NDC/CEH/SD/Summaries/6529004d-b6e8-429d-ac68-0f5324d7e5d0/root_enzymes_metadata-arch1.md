# AFEX Experiment

- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02° 25' S, 59° 43' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (dry season August to rainy season April).

## Experimental design

- Type: full factorial nutrient addition experiment.
- Treatments: eight total – Control, N, P, Cations (Ca, Mg, K), N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- Replication and layout: 4 independent blocks; 32 plots total (4 blocks × 8 plots per block).
- Plot size and area of measurements: each plot 50 m × 50 m; central 30 m × 30 m area used for main measurements.
- Nutrient application: dry granules applied three times per year.

## Nutrient application rates

- N (urea): 125 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹
- P (triple superphosphate): 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹
- Ca: 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹
- Mg (dolomitic limestone): 20 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹
- K (potassium chloride): 50 kg ha⁻¹ year⁻¹

## Root sampling and processing

- Sampling design: in each plot (n = 32), five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep, root-free ingrowth cores installed in August 2017.
- Sampling interval: every three months; cores combined by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm).
- Timeframe used for analysis: fine roots produced between Nov 2017 and Feb 2018 (middle of the wet season).
- Processing: roots washed, dried, and homogenized; cumulative root biomass extrapolated from 60 minutes of sampling to estimate 180 minutes using Michaelis–Menten asymptotic curve.
- Focus: fine roots for enzyme assays.

## Root subsampling and enzyme assays

- Subsampling: fine roots from both depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) used for enzyme assays.
- Enzyme targeted: acid phosphomonoesterase (PHOS) activity in root tips <1 mm.
- Assay method: fluorimetric MUF (Methylumbelliferyl-phosphate) substrate in triplicate per plot per depth; includes sample, buffer, and substrate blanks.
- Procedure: 30 min incubation at ~25°C with gentle shaking; terminate with 50 µL of 1 M NaOH; measure fluorescence (50 µL aliquots) after termination.
- Measurement and units: PHOS expressed as μmol MUF g⁻¹ dry mass h⁻¹.

## Data and metadata

- Spreadsheet fields: Block (1–4), Plot (1–8), TRT (treatment description), Depth (0–10 cm or 10–30 cm).
- Depth categories: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
