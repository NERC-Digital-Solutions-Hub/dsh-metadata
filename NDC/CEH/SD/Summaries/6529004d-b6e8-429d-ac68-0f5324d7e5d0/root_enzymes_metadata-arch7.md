# Site description

- Location and climate
  - AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25'S, 59°43'W)
  - Mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% (wet season August–April)

- Experimental design: AFEX Experiment
  - Full factorial nutrient addition since May 2017
  - Treatments (8 total): control, N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K), N+P, N+cations, P+cations, N+P+cations
  - Plots and blocks: 32 plots (50 m × 50 m each) arranged in 4 independent blocks (minimum 250 m apart)
  - Central measurement area: 30 m × 30 m within each plot (nutrients applied across plots; central area used for measurements)
  - Nutrient application rates per year: N 125 kg ha⁻¹ (urea); P 50 kg ha⁻¹ (triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha⁻¹; Mg 20 kg ha⁻¹ (dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha⁻¹ (KCl)

- Root sampling design
  - In each plot (n=32), five ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) installed in August 2017 within the central 30 m × 30 m area
  - Cores collected every three months; five cores per plot depth combination (N=64 for depth strata)
  - Fine roots used: sampling focused on November 2017–February 2018 (wet season middle)
  - Sampling procedure: roots washed; 60-minute extraction; extrapolated to 180 minutes using Michaelis–Menten asymptotic curve to estimate total biomass captured

- Root subsampling and enzyme assays
  - Subsampling by depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm)
  - Enzyme assays on root tips (<1 mm) to assess phosphorus acquisition activity

- Root phosphatase activity measurement (PHOS)
  - Fluorimetric microplate assay using MUF substrate
  - Procedure: ~10 mg fresh root tissue incubated with MUF; blanks prepared; incubation ~30 min at ~25°C; reaction terminated with NaOH; fluorescence read at 365 nm/450 nm
  - Outcome: PHOS expressed as μmol MUF g⁻¹ dry mass h⁻¹ per plot

- Data structure and variables
  - Data fields captured: Block, Plot, TRT (treatment), Depth
  - Block: 1–4; Plot: 1–8 per block (32 plots total); TRT: 8 nutrient treatments; Depth: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm
