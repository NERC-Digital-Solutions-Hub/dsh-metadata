# Site description

- Location: AFEX project area at the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Amazonas, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% across the rainy season (Aug–Apr).

## Experimental setup - AFEX Experiment

- Design: full factorial nutrient addition (eight treatments) including untreated control and combinations of N, P, and cations (K, Mg, Ca).
- Treatments: Control, N, P, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations.
- Layout: eight treatments with four replicate plots per treatment; total of 32 plots arranged in four independent blocks (≥250 m apart).
- Plot size: each 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrient application: dry granules applied three times per year.
  - Rates: N 125 kg ha−1 year−1 (as urea); P 50 kg ha−1 year−1 (as triple superphosphate); Ca 50 kg ha−1 year−1; Mg 20 kg ha−1 year−1 (dolomitic limestone); K 50 kg ha−1 year−1 (KCl).

## Root sampling

- Per plot: five 12 cm-diameter, 30 cm-deep ingrowth cores (2 cm plastic mesh bags) installed in Aug 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
- Collection: every three months; cores homogenised by plot and soil depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm; total N=64).
- Focus: fine roots produced between Nov 2017 and Feb 2018 (middle of the wet season); roots washed and 60-minute sampling used to estimate total potential sampling for 180 minutes via Michaelis-Menten extrapolation (Metcalfe et al., 2007).

## Root subsampling

- Fine roots from both depths (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) subsampled.
- Enzyme assays conducted on root tips (<1 mm diameter), known to be absorptive and nutrient-uptake active (McCormack et al., 2015).

## Root phosphatase activity

- PHOS: potential root acid phosphomonoesterase activity measured within 3 days of sampling.
- Method: fluorimetric microplate assay using MUF phosphate substrate.
  - Procedure: ~10 mg fresh root tissue incubated with MUF phosphate; blanks prepared; 30 min incubation at ~25°C; reaction terminated with 50 µL of 1 M NaOH; fluorescence read at 365 nm (ex) / 450 nm (em).
  - Output: PHOS expressed as μmol MUF g−1 dry mass h−1.
- Data handling: samples assayed in triplicate per plot and depth (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm).

## Spreadsheet details

- Data structure: Block (1–4) identifies installation block; Plot (1–8 per block) identifies specific plots.
- TRT: treatment description (eight levels: control, P, N, cations, N+P, N+cations, N+P+cations).
- Depth: soil layer sampled (0–10 cm or 10–30 cm).
- PHOS: measured enzyme activity (μmol MUF g−1 dry mass h−1).
- This structure supports aggregation by block, plot, treatment, and depth for analysis and visualization.
