# AFEX Experiment

## Overview

- Location: AFEX project area, Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil.
- Climate context: mean annual temperature ~26 °C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% across seasons.
- Study focus: a full factorial nutrient addition experiment examining how different nutrient inputs affect root dynamics and root enzyme activity in a tropical forest setting.

## Experimental Design

- Treatments: eight total – control, N, P, cations (Ca, Mg, K), and all combinations (N+P, N+cations, P+cations, N+P+cations).
- Replication and layout: four independent blocks; four replicate plots per treatment; 32 plots total; plots 50 m x 50 m with the central 30 m x 30 m area used for main measurements; minimum ~250 m between blocks.
- Nutrient application rates (per year): N 125 kg ha^-1 (as urea), P 50 kg ha^-1 (as triple superphosphate), Ca 50 kg ha^-1, Mg 20 kg ha^-1 (as dolomitic limestone), K 50 kg ha^-1 (as potassium chloride).

## Data Collection and Sampling Protocols

- Root ingrowth cores: five per plot (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep, root-free), installed Aug 2017 in the central 30 x 30 m area; collected every three months (N=64 total samples across depth strata 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm).
- Sampling window used: fine roots produced between Nov 2017 and Feb 2018 (middle of wet season).
- Biomass estimation: manual extraction of roots during 60 minutes, with five cores homogenised by plot and depth; extrapolation to 180 minutes using a Michaelis-Menten asymptotic curve.

## Root Subsampling and Enzyme Analyses

- Depths for sub-sampling: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm.
- Enzyme focus: phosphatase activity in root tips (<1 mm diameter) related to phosphate acquisition.
- PHOS assay: potential root acid phosphomonoesterase activity measured within 3 days of sampling using a fluorimetric MUF substrate; triplicate subsamples per plot per depth.
- Procedure: ~10 mg root tissue incubated with MUF substrate, blanks included; 30 min incubation at ~25 °C; reaction terminated with 50 μL of 1 M NaOH; fluorescence read at 365 nm excitation / 450 nm emission; results reported as μmol MUF g^-1 dry mass h^-1.

## Data Structure and Metadata

- Data fields (as described in the accompanying spreadsheet): 
  - Block (1–4): plot installation blocks.
  - Plot (1–8): within-block plot identifiers.
  - TRT (eight treatment codes): treatment applied to each plot.
  - Depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm): soil depth for sampling.
- Documentation clarifies unit definitions and the interpretation of each field (e.g., treatment coding, plot descriptions, depth interpretation).

## Data Quality and Methods Reference

- Replication and controls: triplicate enzyme measurements; inclusion of blanks and standards in PHOS assays.
- Methodological grounding: references to established methods for soil enzyme assays, root sampling, and biomass extrapolation (Metcalfe et al., 2007; Turner & Romero, 2010; Lugli et al., 2019; German et al., 2011; McCormack et al., 2015).
- Data provenance: explicit recording of block, plot, treatment, and depth to support traceability and reuse.
