# AFEX Experiment

## Site description
- Conducted at the AFEX project area within the Biological Dynamics of Forest Fragments Project (BDFFP/INPA), ~80 km north of Manaus, Brazil (02°25' S, 59°43' W).
- Climate: mean air temperature ~26°C; mean annual precipitation ~2,400 mm; relative humidity 75–92% across the year (rainy season peaks in April).

## Experimental setup - AFEX Experiment
- Full factorial nutrient addition design with eight treatments: Control, N, P, Cations (Ca, Mg, K), and their combinations (N+P, N+Cations, N+P+Cations).
- 4 independent blocks; 32 plots total (4 blocks × 8 plots per block), with at least 250 m between blocks.
- Plot size: 50 m × 50 m; central measurement area: 30 m × 30 m.
- Nutrient application rates (dry granules, three times/year, avoiding the main dry season):
  - N: 125 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (urea)
  - P: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (triple superphosphate)
  - Ca: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1
  - Mg: 20 kg ha^-1 year^-1 (dolomitic limestone)
  - K: 50 kg ha^-1 year^-1
- Central 30 × 30 m area used for main measurements.

## Root sampling
- In each plot (n=32), five ingrowth cores (12 cm diameter, 30 cm deep) installed in August 2017 within the central 30 × 30 m area.
- Cores sampled every three months; five replicates per plot and depth (0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) combined per time point (N=64 total samples per time point).
- Only fine roots from the November 2017–February 2018 (wet season middle) interval used.
- Roots were extracted manually in 60 minutes total; sampling time extrapolated to 180 minutes using Michaelis-Menten asymptotic curve to estimate total root biomass.

## Root subsampling
- Fine roots from both depths (~0–10 cm and 10–30 cm) were subsampled.
- Enzyme assays performed on root tips (<1 mm diameter), representing absorptive fine roots responsible for nutrient uptake.

## Root phosphatase activity (PHOS)
- Measured within 3 days of sampling using a fluorimetric microplate assay with MUF-substrate (Methylumbelliferyl-phosphate).
- Procedure:
  - ~10 mg fresh root material incubated with MUF substrate.
  - Triplicate subsamples per plot; blanks included for sample, buffer, and substrate.
  - Incubation ~30 min at ~25°C; reaction terminated with 50 μL of 1 M NaOH.
  - Fluorescence read at 365 nm excitation / 450 nm emission.
  - Data expressed as μmol MUF g^-1 dry mass h^-1.
- Samples scanned, dried at 60°C for 72 hours, and root moisture corrected as part of downstream processing.

## Spreadsheet details
- Data organization includes:
  - Block: 1–4 (indicating plot installation block)
  - Plot: 1–8 within each block
  - TRT: eight treatments (Control, P, N, Cations, N+P, N+Cations, P+Cations, N+P+Cations)
  - Depth: 0–10 cm and 10–30 cm
  - PHOS: measured PHOS (μmol MUF g^-1 dry mass h^-1)
