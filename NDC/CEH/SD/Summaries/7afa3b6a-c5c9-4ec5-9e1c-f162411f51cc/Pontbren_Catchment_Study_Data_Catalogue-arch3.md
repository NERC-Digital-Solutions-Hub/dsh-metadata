# Introduction to the Database Catalogue

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the Pontbren Database, detailing instrumentation, data types, and how data are organized and managed.
  - Emphasizes data quality, metadata, openness, and governance; notes outputs are shared via reports, charts, dashboards, and publicly shared underlying data where appropriate.

- Data organization and format
  - Data files organized into directories forming a framework; QA codes accompany quality-assured data.
  - Outputs typically provided as plain text files, often in six-month blocks; file names indicate collection dates.
  - Appendices supply supplementary context and metadata for users.

- Database framework and major data categories
  - AWS (Automatic Weather Station)
  - Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension data
  - Groundwater monitoring
  - Hillslope study site runoff and soil water tension data
  - Llyn Hir study site soil water tension data
  - Land use manipulation plots
  - Neutron probe soil moisture data
  - Rain gauge data
  - Field diaries
  - Streamflow

- Key data categories and instrumentation
  - AWS: minute-by-minute sensors with daily/10-minute averages; outputs include radiation, wind, soil/air temperatures, humidity.
  - Bowl study site runoff and soil water tension: includes runoff measurements (weir boxes, tipping buckets) and tensiometers at multiple depths.
  - Groundwater: five monitoring locations with barometrically compensated pressure transducers; reports height of water and temperature; varied sampling intervals.
  - Hillslope study site: runoff (weir boxes, 1-minute sampling, 5-minute logging) and tensiometers at multiple depths; tree shelterbelt overland flow plots with traps and later tipping buckets.
  - Llyn Hir: tensiometers at several depths with 10–15 minute sampling.
  - Land use manipulation plots: four plots with replicates; tensiometers and overland flow data; treatment layouts described.
  - Neutron probe: soil moisture profiles up to about 120 cm, across multiple sites; includes raw counts, calibrations, and calculations.
  - Rain gauges: tipping bucket and storage gauges across sites; reported as mm/day or mm.
  - Field diaries: Word documents with notes on instrumentation and issues affecting data.
  - Streamflow: multiple sites using Starflow acoustic Doppler systems or other sensors; minute-by-minute readings (averaged to 15-minute intervals) with site-specific calibration relationships.

- Calibration, data treatment, and references
  - Site-specific calibrations for streamflow (y = αx + β) with uncertainties; low-flow data deemed unsuitable for calibration.
  - Neutron probe moisture depends on calibration parameters derived from clay calibrations.
  - Quality assurance codes and treatments are documented to support consistent processing.

- Quality assurance, metadata, and governance
  - Appendices provide a QA coding system for tensiometers, rain gauges, weirs, groundwater, Starflow, and plots.
  - Borehole and neutron probe logs included to support traceability; metadata and field diaries enhance interpretability.
  - Data sharing and governance focus on openness and data management standards; notes barriers such as sharing requirements, metadata gaps, and data transformation needs.

- Practical notes and site-specific caveats
  - Patchiness and equipment damage (e.g., rodent damage to traps) affecting data continuity.
  - Some tensiometer arrays removed or reconfigured; data files split by array/logger.
  - Groundwater and borehole data reflect multiple equipment configurations and completions.
  - Visual figures aid locating instrumentation for interpretation.

- Appendices overview
  - Appendix A: Quality assurance coding system (for tensiometers, rain gauges, weirs, groundwater, Starflow, and plots).
  - Appendix B: Groundwater borehole logs (equipment, methods, depths, and completion details).
  - Appendix C: Neutron probe access tube logs (locations and logs).
  - Appendix D: Streamflow gauging sites flow metered spot measurements.

- Endnotes: Intended use for policy scrutiny and decision-making
  - The catalogue provides comprehensive context for researchers and policymakers to identify environmental health measures, data sources, metadata, and governance considerations to scrutinise policy, evaluate outcomes, and inform future decisions.
