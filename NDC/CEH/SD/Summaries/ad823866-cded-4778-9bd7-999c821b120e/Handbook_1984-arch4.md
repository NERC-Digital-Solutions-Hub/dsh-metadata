# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Purpose and scope
- Establishes guidelines for a GB ecological survey conducted in 1976–1984 to assess changes in rural land use, habitat, vegetation, and related features.
- Defines a standardized data collection framework, including sampling design, field procedures, data recording, and post-survey handling.
- Aims to create a quality baseline for future comparisons using map-based, coded data across multiple landscape categories.

## Sampling design and planning
- 384 squares (12 from each of 32 land classes) selected to cover Great Britain; intended to improve statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling in the future.
- Each square is surveyed by teams from six research stations; travel-time efficiency is prioritized to control costs.
- Planning considers daily travel logistics, with options such as single-square trips, overnight stays for two squares, or longer blocks for a group of squares.
- Prohibitive revisits are avoided to prevent inflated costs; permissions and site access are essential.

## Equipment and field tools
- Minimal equipment required: data recording booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, film, pens, maps for site locations, navigation gear, ITE identity card, camera, and weather gear.
- Equipment geared toward mapping and recording rather than precise measurement.

## Suggested field procedure
- On-site: assess access, obtain permissions for the full square, plan a route for complete coverage, and ensure post-survey review for omissions.
- Permissions: obtain consent from owners/farmers beforehand; use a farmer/landowner information sheet; carry identity; document ownership and cooperation levels.
- Data recording approach emphasizes systematic map annotation with predefined data codes to capture diverse landscape features.

## Data recording and coding system
- Field data are annotated on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a structured, codified system; numeric codes are combined to form alpha representations of features.
- Maps require clear marking of boundaries, with specific conventions for boundary types and boundary descriptions.
- The smallest mappable unit is defined (roughly 0.5 hectares and 0.2 km in length); field decisions are made in situ to ensure timely and coherent data capture.
- FAB (Field Assessment Booklet) pages organize data by square, series number, location, ownership, farmer interviews, physiography, vegetation, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, and photography.

## Ownership and farmer information
- Ownership of land units within each square is recorded; tenants and recent changes are flagged.
- A farmer/landowner information sheet captures background conversations, with guidance to engage at least one farmer per square and summarize discussions for context.

## Physiography, inland water, and coastal features
- Detailed coding for cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat forms and erosion, ground leveling, drainage features, lakes, rivers, canalized rivers, ponds, springs, ditches, levees, and shoreline substrates.
- Coastal and inland water features are to be recorded and mapped, even if not currently visible at survey time.

## Agriculture, natural vegetation, and habitat types
- Covers land categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, bogs, fen, flushes, crops) with extensive subcategories and conditions.
- Species lists are used for key grasses and forbs when ground cover is substantial; curtilage-based recording excludes urban gardens unless relevant to the survey unit.
- Detailed coding for crops, stock types, and land uses, plus notes on management practices (e.g., fallow, burnt moor, abandoned land).

## Forestry, woodland, and trees
- Records woodland units whether a single stand or larger; distinguishes between woodland, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, and individual trees.
- Covers tree cover, species composition, age classes, management status (unmanaged, planted, natural regeneration), and practices (underplanting, clear-cutting, brashing).
- Specifies how to code hedgerows, belts, and regeneration, with guidance on when to map individual trees versus grouped features.

## Boundaries
- Boundary types and descriptive codes are used to convey the nature of walls, fences, hedges, gaps, and stockproofing.
- Focus on practical mapping of boundaries, especially where curtilages are involved; includes methods to denote gaps and changes in boundary integrity.

## Recreation and built features
- Recreation features, informal spaces, and formal recreational facilities are catalogued.
- Built structures and communications (buildings, roads, tracks, footpaths, pipelines, barriers, signs) are recorded with use descriptions and location cues.
- Colour conventions are provided to aid map readability when coding across multiple categories.

## Photography and post-survey procedures
- Five photographs per square capture representative views; exact camera locations and viewpoints are annotated on FAB maps.
- After surveying, a thorough check of the FAB and maps is recommended; data should not be transcribed into new maps unless absolutely necessary.
- Completed FABs are sent to Merlewood in batches; timely transport arrangements are advised.

## Data quality, governance, and coordination
- Emphasizes consistent field recording, avoidance of deferred decisions, and qualification notes where necessary.
- Encourages use of codes to enable compact, interoperable data across surveys and time periods.
- Recognizes the importance of user feedback and potential data product co-ownership by policy colleagues and other stakeholders.
- Highlights the need for coordination within the broader data community to maximize the utility and discoverability of data assets.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Defines a structured, scalable data collection and coding framework suitable for organizational data strategy and cross-network collaboration.
- Demonstrates a model for encoding complex landscape information into standardized, machine-readable formats to support reuse, archival quality, and longitudinal analysis.
- Shows explicit attention to metadata (location, ownership, series numbers, square IDs) and data governance (permissions, batch handling, partner coordination).
- Illustrates how user needs (policy colleagues, landowners) can influence data collection practices and data product development through documented processes and feedback loops.
