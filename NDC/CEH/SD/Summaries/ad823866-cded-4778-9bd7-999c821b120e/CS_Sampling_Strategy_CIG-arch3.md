# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Documents the development of the Countryside Survey sampling framework through successive updates of the ITE Land Classification from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the need for representative, stratified sampling to support national and country-level environmental estimates, and to inform policy and monitoring decisions.

## ITE Land Classification: Evolution and Application
- Origin: ITE Land Classification developed in the 1970s to stratify GB land into discrete classes for ecological surveying.
- 32 classes originally (circa 1978) created using centre squares of a 15x15 km grid and ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) on environmental attributes.
- Early approach: classify key environmental factors (altitude, geology, climate) to define land classes; use surrounding squares to extend classification.
- 1990 refinement: extend classification to cover all GB squares, enabling all-squares estimates, with some class changes to accommodate broader data needs.
- 1998 revision: permit separate reporting for Scotland; number of classes increased to 40.
- 2000 revision: further adjustments to support separate England & Wales reporting; 40->40+ strata; added country-unit subdivisions and additional squares to ensure representation.
- 2007 refinement: introduce Wales-only reporting with Wales-specific sub-divisions (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata; increases in Welsh sampling to ensure six squares per new class; England adjustments maintained despite removal of some Welsh squares.

## Sampling Framework by Survey
- 1978 (First GB survey): 8 squares per Land Class; total 256 squares; fieldwork on vegetation quadrats and soils; taxonomic/habitat mapping.
- 1984 (Second GB survey): sampling increased to 12 squares per class; total 384 squares; build on 1978 data.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; CS1990): classification expanded to include data for all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed; repetition of 1978 quadrats; integration with first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 2000 (CS2000): address policy-driven needs for regional and country-level estimates; split classifications into country units; adjusted sample allocation (40 strata → 40-ish with country subdivisions); additional upland habitat module planned to improve upland representation.
- 2007 (CS2007): respond to devolution-driven reporting needs (Wales); Welsh squares expanded; five new Wales-specific land classes created; overall 45 strata; 43 additional Welsh squares; minimum six squares in each Welsh class; England retained most classes but with some reductions in Welsh representation.

## Separate Country Reporting and Upland Module
- England with Wales and Scotland-focused reporting established to meet country-specific environmental policy requirements.
- Wales-focused sampling expanded further for Wales-only estimates.
- Upland and marginal upland habitats added (CS2000 onward) to boost statistical accuracy for upland regions in England and Wales.

## Calculation of National Estimates and Consistency
- National estimates derived as: mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
- Note on consistency: changing the Land Classification across surveys affects comparability; preferred practice for GB consistency is to use the latest classification when computing national estimates, while recognizing cross-survey comparability challenges.
- Table 4 in the document shows sample sizes per class across surveys under the original 1990 classification for historical reference.

## Outputs and Impact for Monitoring
- Outputs include detailed Land Classification maps and national/state-level habitat estimates.
- Provides a robust, stratified framework for monitoring environmental changes, informing policy, and guiding land-use planning and conservation actions.
- The framework supports time-series analyses and change detection, enabling policymakers to track habitat status and trends across England, Scotland, and Wales, with Wales-specific and upland-focused insights.
