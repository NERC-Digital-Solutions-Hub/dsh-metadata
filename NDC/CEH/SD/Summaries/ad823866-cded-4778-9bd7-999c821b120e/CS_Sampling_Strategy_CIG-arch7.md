# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document outlines the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field work up to 2007 and frames how the ITE Land Classification has evolved over 30 years to support national, and later country-specific, ecological and habitat estimates for Great Britain.

- It emphasizes that the 2007 strategy is built on a long lineage of stratified, random sampling using a land-classification framework, and that understanding earlier versions is essential for interpreting time-series data.

- The content covers the origins of the ITE Land Classification, its application to successive Countryside Surveys (1978, 1984, 1990, 2000, 2007), and the methodological adjustments needed to produce Wales-only and England/Scotland reporting.

- It also discusses practical issues for data products and GIS work, including how to map, classify, and sample GB land areas, and how classification changes affect comparability of national estimates across surveys.

- An additional upland habitat module was added for CS2000 to improve precision for upland estimates in England and Wales, reflecting the need for country-specific reporting in policy contexts.

- The document includes acknowledgements, further reading, and an appendix detailing a brief history of the ITE Land Classification.

- It concludes with notes on national estimate creation and cross-survey consistency, including a comparison of sample sizes under the original 1990 Land Classification versus the revised classifications used in later surveys.
