# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year lineage of the ITE Land Classification-based approach.
- Emphasises that the current methodology is tightly linked to its predecessors and relies on a stratified, random sampling design to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain (GB).

## Core methodological concepts
- Stratified sampling to avoid bias and ensure typical representation of ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification used to create land-class strata, based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Sampling units are 1 km x 1 km squares; initial approach used centre squares with surrounding squares for classification continuity.
- Field surveys per class were historically allocated to a fixed number of squares to balance precision and resources (e.g., 8 squares per class in CS1978; later expansions).

## Evolution by survey wave

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - Used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to derive 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 km grid; plus surrounding squares).
  - Surveyed 8 squares per land class (total 256) to estimate national habitat areas as a function of class areas.

- 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
  - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384) using the same framework.
  - National estimates calculated from the 1978 Land Classification.

- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; urban and sea adjustments included.
  - Field survey cohort: 508 squares; repeated vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping conducted.
  - National estimates based on the updated 1990 classification.

- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1990 updated; CS1990 results published)
  - Classification extended to allow separate Scottish reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.
  - National results framed for policy needs; groundwork for country-specific estimates.

- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed representation and policy needs for England, Scotland, Wales with separate country estimates.
  - Introduced country-unit versions of land classes, increasing strata to 40.
  - Added 19 additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; Wales-specific adjustments implemented.

- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Wales-only reporting requirements prompted further Wales-specific refinements (additional Welsh classes and squares).
  - Introduced five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - Added 43 Welsh squares; English coverage adjusted (some classes in England ended up with as few as 4 squares).
  - Wales-focused sampling improvements aimed at Wales-specific environmental policy needs; England adjustments maintained overall precision.

## Country-specific reporting and governance
- Separate country estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) were implemented to meet policy needs.
- Framework adaptations included:
  - Sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions.
  - Aggregation of underrepresented rump classes within each country.
  - Additional sampling to ensure adequate representation of new country-unit classes.
  - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with new England squares.
- Wales received dedicated Welsh-class subdivisions and increased sampling to support Wales-only reporting.

## Uplands module
- CS2000/CS2007 included an uplands module funded separately, adding about 30 squares in upland/marginal-upland land classes.
- Purpose: improve statistical accuracy of upland habitat estimates for England and Wales within country-based reporting.

## Data quality, consistency, and harmonization
- Acknowledges that changing the basic Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates across surveys.
- For GB consistency, it is preferred to use the latest classification for national estimates, while acknowledging historical classifications may be used for cross-survey consistency.
- Tables and figures document sample numbers and class distributions, highlighting how class representation shifts with each revision.

## Outputs and documentation
- Detailed tabular data (Tables 2, 3, 4) and maps (Figures 4–7) illustrate:
  - Number of squares by class and by survey year.
  - Sampling rates and country-specific allocations.
  - Revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and for Scotland, and the distribution of sample squares across GB.
- Acknowledgements and references accompany the report, noting statistical guidance and data synthesis contributions.

## Implications for data strategy (for Data Leaders)
- Strong emphasis on a centralized, repeatable stratified sampling framework anchored to a formal land classification system.
- Importance of data harmonization across survey waves to maintain comparability, while accommodating policy-driven country-specific reporting needs.
- Clear governance implications around class definitions, cross-year comparability, and the handling of country-unit estimates.
- Demonstrates the value of transparent metadata, lineage, and documentation to support discoverability and reuse of complex, multi-year environmental data products.
- Highlights opportunities for cross-partner collaboration to maintain and evolve a shared data classification framework, and to ensure consistent, auditable data assets for user needs across policy and research communities.
