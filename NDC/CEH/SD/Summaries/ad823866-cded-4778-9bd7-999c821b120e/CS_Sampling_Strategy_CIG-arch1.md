# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Aims and scope
  - Provides the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Built on the ITE (Institute of Terrestrial Ecology) Land Classification to enable change detection over time.
  - Key goal: representative, stratified sampling to support national, regional, and country-specific environmental estimates.

- Core concept: stratified sampling using the ITE Land Classification
  - Stratification divides land into discrete classes (strata) with similar environmental attributes.
  - Sampling aims to cover all strata proportionally to their area and ecological variability.
  - Early use of stratified random sampling reduces bias and enhances representativeness.

- Origin and development of the ITE Land Classification
  - 1970s: Foundation in Bunce and Shaw work; classification based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) plus vegetation indicators.
  - 1978: First GB-wide sampling framework using 32 land classes derived from a 1 km square grid; central 1 km squares used for classification with surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
  - Classes described by average environmental characteristics; used to stratify national sampling.

- Chronology of Countryside Survey sampling (with evolving classification)
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 8 samples per Land Class; total 256 squares.
    - National estimates: mean habitat area per square in a class multiplied by the class’s total land area.
  - CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - 12 squares per Land Class; total 384 squares.
    - Used the 1978 Land Classification for estimates.
  - CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
    - Land Classification updated to classify every 1 km square in GB.
    - 508 squares surveyed; added repeat vegetation/quadrat data and land-use mapping.
    - Satellite-derived Land Cover Map linked to this program.
  - CS2000 (New Land Classification; Fourth Field Survey)
    - Addressed regional and policy needs; prepared for separate England & Wales and Scotland estimates.
    - Major change: classification extended to classify every GB square; introduced separate country estimates.
    - Adjustments to sampling to ensure adequate representation; added 19 extra squares (minimum 6 per new class); additional Wales sampling to align with country reporting.
    - Upland habitat module added to improve estimates in upland England & Wales.
  - CS2007 (Final presented framework; Wales-focused updates)
    - Wales reporting formalized with Wales-specific Land Class subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Overall 45 strata (expanded from 40); 43 additional squares in Wales to ensure adequate representation.
    - England adjustments balanced by not adding English squares; some classes in England maintained with minimal squares.
    - Wales received enhanced sampling to support country-specific estimates.

- Separate country estimates and sampling adjustments
  - Framework subdivides Land Classes by country unit (England & Wales vs Scotland) to enable dedicated country estimates.
  - When necessary, classes were aggregated within a country to maintain adequate sample sizes.
  - Isle of Man samples were replaced to avoid contributing to country-unit estimates.

- Upland habitat module and Wales-specific reporting
  - CS2000 included a dedicated upland module for better statistical accuracy in upland habitats of England and Wales.
  - CS2007 introduced Wales-only class subdivisions and increased Welsh sampling to support Wales-only reporting requirements.

- Data handling and national estimates
  - National estimates calculated as: mean habitat area per square in a class × land area of that class.
  - Note on consistency: changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; two approaches exist (latest classification for current survey estimates vs original for cross-survey consistency).
  - Table 4 in the document outlines sample sizes per class across surveys using the original 1990 Land Classification as a reference.
