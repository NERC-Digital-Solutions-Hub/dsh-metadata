# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and Aim
- A 1984 field survey handbook for the Rural Environment project (Project 424 Ecological Survey of Great Britain) to establish a quality baseline by ground surveying and aerial photography comparison.
- Purpose: produce map-based data suitable for GIS, combining land cover, land use, and habitat information across Great Britain.
- Sampling design: 384 squares (12 from each of 32 Land Classes) surveyed in 1984, using 1:10,000 maps; data items chosen to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant for grid-based analysis.
- Output intent: create repeatable, mapable units and a flexible coding system to support spatial analysis and change assessment.

## Sampling and Planning
- Squares are grouped into seven survey groups; six ITE research stations with roving liaison teams; each square planned for ~1 day of fieldwork.
- Travel-based scheduling prioritized to avoid double visits; multiple planning options (single-site travel, overnight stays, or extended runs) are provided to meet schedules.
- Emphasis on consistency and coverage across the whole square, with attention to accessibility and permissions.

## Equipment
- Minimal, map-and-recording focused kit:
  - FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 6" (1:10,000) maps, film, pens, maps for locating sites, basic navigation gear, ITE ID, clipboard, pencils, weatherproof clothing, reference books as needed, and a camera.

## Field Procedure
- On arrival: assess access and potential problems; determine permissions for the entire square.
- Plan a route that enables full coverage; complete and review records after surveying to ensure no omissions.
- Permissions: obtain access for all areas within a square; build goodwill with farmers/owners; carry identity; update ownership lists; prioritize surveillance of the most land-rich informants.

## Data Recording and Coding
- Surveys are essentially mapping exercises annotated on 1:10,000 maps with a structured set of codes.
- Use a combination of numeric and alpha codes to represent features; boxes on data sheets allow codes to be combined (example given shows how multiple codes describe a single feature).
- Boundaries and features should be clearly marked on the map; interpretive decisions in the field should be recorded and qualified when needed.
- Smallest mappable unit: roughly 0.5 hectare with a mapped length of about 0.5 km; ensure edge corners and boundary segments are captured.
- If a square becomes too complex to encode with codes, use color overlays and notes; avoid clutter by writing codes close to features rather than using arrows.

## The Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
- Each square is documented in a FAB along with the 6" maps.
- Pages and sections are designed to capture: ownership, farmer information, physiography, land cover/use, flora/fauna, boundaries, recreation, built structures, and photography.
- General FAB guidelines:
  - Record series and location identifiers; use pencil when possible; note dominant cover first; map mosaic components in proportion (e.g., 104/105/164/191/162/190 for a Moorland area).
  - Use X marks for specific features like hedgerow trees; add notes or color coding when necessary.
  - For woodland, curtilages, and non-agricultural areas, reference specific sheets (e.g., woodland sheet) and follow the color convention for map readability.
- Immediate post-survey checks to ensure all data are captured before transcribing to new maps if needed.

## Section-by-Section Outline (FAB Contents)
- 1 Cover: all sections completed; series number and location details recorded.
- 2 Ownership: confirm access rights; mark ownership units with identifiers; assess owner/tenant cooperativeness on a coded scale.
- 3 Farmer/Landowner Information: discuss land use with at least one farmer; summarize conversations; keep it unobtrusive.
- 4 Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed physiographic features (cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, ground leveling, springs), inland water features (lakes, ponds, rivers, canalisations), and coastal attributes; include drainage signs and substrates.
- 5 Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: covers the majority of GB ground cover categories excluding urban and woodland; built-up curtilages are recorded under this sheet for the curtilage area; includes categories such as amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow/abandoned land, and species lists with proportions and height classes where relevant.
- 6 Forestry/Woodland/Trees: record woodland units and related tree data; distinguish trees, coppice, belts, hedgerows, and regenerating stands; define cover types by species and structure; include age and management status (unmanaged, planted, natural regeneration, underplanting, etc.); provide guidelines for recording plots, regeneration, and coppice details.
- 7 Boundaries: capture boundary types (e.g., mortared wall, hedges, stockproof borders, fences) and descriptions; consider boundary condition and gaps; indicate curtilage involvement when applicable.
- 8 Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas (parks, golf courses, playgrounds, school fields, etc.); information points and access-related features.
- 9 Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types; descriptions of buildings and curtilages; various use categories (residential, commercial, industrial, public services, educational, religious, institutional); structures (pipes, pylons, bridges) and road/track/footpath data; color-coding guidance for map readability.
- 10 Photography: five photographs per square with indicated viewpoints; mark exact photo locations and directions on FAB.
- 11 Procedure Subsequent to Survey: post-survey checks; prefer not to transpose data onto new maps unless necessary; notify Merlewood about batch completions and coordinate transport of FABs.

## Data Standards, Coding, and Output
- The handbook emphasizes a comprehensive, standardized coding scheme to support GIS-ready data products.
- Codes cover a wide range of categories:
  - Cover types and vegetation (e.g., various grasslands, moorlands, heaths, aquatic vegetation, crops, and fallow land).
  - Species lists for flora and fauna (with representative species codes).
  - Boundary types and conditions (stockproof, gaps filled, etc.).
  - Woodland types, age classes, management status, and regeneration.
  - Land use, ownership, and occupancy statuses.
  - Built environment and infrastructure (including roads, tracks, fences, and utility features).
- A detailed color palette is provided to aid map readability when coding complex features.

## Relevance to GIS Specialists
- The document provides a clear framework for creating rich, map-based data products that capture land cover, land use, landscape features, and infrastructure at a standardized 1:10,000 scale.
- It supports integration with prior surveys by using compatible categories and codes, enabling longitudinal analysis and change detection.
- The FAB and its structured sections offer a blueprint for structured data capture, provenance, and quality assurance in GIS workflows.
