# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIROMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Overview
  - Purpose: Establish a quality baseline and assess changes in rural environments in Great Britain as part of Project 424 (Ecological Survey of Great Britain), using ground surveys and aerial photography comparison.
  - Sampling design: 32 land classes derived from a multivariate grid; 384 squares (12 per class) surveyed in 1984, with some exceptions where original squares were unavailable.
  - Goals: Record land cover, land use, habitat features, and landscape-related data to support long-term monitoring and comparative analyses.

- Sampling design and objectives
  - Grid: 1 km squares across Great Britain, grouped into 32 land classes.
  - Re-sampling: Additional four squares per class planned to increase statistical confidence and enable partial replacement sampling in the future.
  - Data items: Selected to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant to grid-based analyses.

- Survey planning and logistics
  - Teams: Six ITE research stations fielding teams; each square typically assigned to about one day of survey work, with a liaison team for some squares.
  - Scheduling considerations:
    - Avoid visiting a site twice if possible due to travel time.
    - Travel-based costs assumed; overnight subsistence not routinely provided.
    - Several planning options exist (travel from station for one square per day; one night away for two squares; longer blocks for more).
  - Permissions: Essential to gain access to all parts of each square to avoid wasted work; prior contact and a working knowledge of landowners are encouraged.
  - Ownership records: Maintain ownership data and update lists of owners, with codes indicating cooperativeness and potential for future surveys.
  - Contact and identity: Surveyors should carry ITE identity and a background information sheet for farmers; a farmer interview is encouraged in each square.

- Equipment and field procedures
  - Equipment: Minimal—mapping and recording focus (FABs, 6" maps, films, colored pens, navigation gear, cameras, weather-appropriate gear, etc.).
  - Field procedure: On-site assessment, obtain permissions, plan a route for full square coverage, and review records after surveying to ensure completeness.

- Data recording and coding system (FAB)
  - Core idea: Annotate 6" (1:10,000) maps with structured data using numeric and alpha codes to describe land cover, land use, boundaries, and features.
  - Coding approach: Boxes on data recording forms allow combination of numeric codes; some fields use letters to denote boundary types or features. Codes are designed to be composable to capture complex mosaics.
  - Decision-making: Field surveyors must make recording decisions in the moment; post-hoc modifications should be minimized, with qualifying notes if needed.
  - Map and unit scale: Minimum mappable unit is 1/250 ha (approx. 0.4 ha) with lengths down to 1/5000 km; ensure survey of square corners and edges.

- FAB structure and key sections
  - Front cover and basic information: Series number, location, ownership, and project identifiers.
  - Ownership: Mark ownership of all parts of the square; distinguish tenants vs. owners; rating of owner cooperativeness for future access.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: Non-official background conversations to capture useful contextual data; encourage interviewing at least one farmer per square.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: Detailed categories for cliffs, rocks, peat, erosion, ground leveling, springs, ditches, rivers, lakes, ponds, coastlines, and related features; special attention to hazards and landforms.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: Land cover categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops, fallow, abandoned land, etc.); guidance on when a curtilage is recorded and how to code mosaics and dominant cover types; provisions for crop-specific notes and livestock presence.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: Codes for woodland types, tree cover, regeneration, age classes, planted vs. natural regeneration, hedgerows, belts, scrub, and related descriptions; guidance on proportional coding, species lists, and tree-related attributes.
  - Boundaries: Types (e.g., stone walls, fences, hedges, stockproof boundaries); descriptions to add context; recording of gaps and stockproof status; emphasis on boundaries relevant to curtilages.
  - Recreation: Formal and informal recreation areas and accessables; notes on recreation-related landscape features.
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: Built cover types, descriptions, and use codes (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional); new developments, derelict sites, and vacant land; infrastructure like pipelines, signs, and transport-related features; color-coding guidance for common map rendering.
  - Photography: Five photographs per square to reflect the square’s landscape; mark exact photo locations and view directions on FAB; minimize inclusion of unnecessary surroundings.
  - Colour conventions: Recommended color scheme for various land-use and boundary categories to aid mapping clarity.
  - Additional notes: Pages provide a page-by-page guide with definitions for many categories and guidance on how to complete and interpret each section.

- Photography and documentation
  - Five slides per square; capture viewpoints to reflect the square’s landscape and features.
  - Location tagging: Mark on FAB the exact map location and direction for each photo.

- Procedure subsequent to survey
  - Data review: End-of-survey checks to ensure no feature was omitted; avoid unnecessary data transposition unless necessary due to damaged originals.
  - Reporting and submission: Inform Merlewood in batches when squares are completed; arrange transport of completed FABs for processing.

- Data management and dissemination notes
  - Emphasis on standardized, documented data collection to enable comparability across squares and over time.
  - Baseline data intended to support later re-surveys, cross-method comparisons (ground vs. aerial), and long-term landscape change monitoring.

- Endnotes and context
  - The handbook situates the field survey within a broader program to re-visit original sites, compare with aerial photography, and build a robust baseline for monitoring habitat and land-use changes across Great Britain.
