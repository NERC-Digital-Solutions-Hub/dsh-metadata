The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the evolution of the Countryside Survey sampling framework and the ITE Land Classification from 1978 to 2007.
- Emphasizes the importance of stratified, random sampling using a land-class framework to obtain unbiased, representative national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and landscape features.
- Documents how classifications and sampling numbers were adjusted to support England, Scotland, and Wales (and upland/wales-only reporting) over time.

## Core concepts and approach
- Stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across ecological variation.
- ITE Land Classification as the primary stratification tool, linking environmental attributes to land-cover types.
- Use of 1 km squares as the sampling unit, with centre squares originally classified and surrounding squares allocated by the ITE framework.
- Progression from a purely national GB framework to country-specific estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and Wales-only reporting, reflecting devolved policy needs.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
- The beginning (1970s)
  - Development of an environmental stratification system (ITE Land Classification) to classify land into discrete types based on environmental attributes.
  - Early use of a 1 km square sampling unit for nationwide surveys; 32 land classes were established.
- The first national sampling (CS1978)
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to define 32 land classes from environmental data on 1228 centre squares (1 km squares).
  - Eight samples per class were selected at random (total 256 squares) for field survey.
- The 1984 survey (CS1984)
  - Sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (total 384).
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- The 1990 survey (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to include data from all GB squares ("All Squares" approach); urban and sea corrections added.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats and habitat mapping collected.
  - Results linked to the first Land Classification but national estimates now based on the expanded framework.
- Developments leading to CS1990–CS2000
  - Realisation that a GB-wide, detailed classification for every square was computationally challenging; surrogate factors (climate, geology, physiography) used to reclassify squares.
  - Comparison showed about 62% correspondence with the original 1228-square classification; most mismatches fell into neighboring classes, and class means remained similar.
- The CS2000 framework (England, Scotland, Wales)
  - Need for separate country estimates identified; sampling framework subdivided Land Classes into country-unit versions, increasing the number of strata to around 40.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes; 19 extra squares for country-unit representation (plus 11 more to balance England and Wales sampling rates).
  - Wales-specific refinement included subdivision of Class 17 to reflect Welsh landforms and ensure Welsh coverage; two Isle of Man squares replaced with England squares for country estimates.
  - An upland module was added to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
- The CS2007 adjustments (Welsh reporting and Wales-focus)
  - To support Wales-only reporting, five Welsh country-unit subdivisions were created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to guarantee minimum representation (at least 6 squares per Welsh class); English classes in some instances retained fewer squares but still deemed adequate for reporting.
  - The sampling framework maps (England/Wales/Scotland) reflect these changes.

## Sampling sizes and structure (key figures)
- GB-wide framework progression
  - CS1978: 256 squares (8 per 32 classes).
  - CS1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - CS1990: 508 squares (All Squares approach; national estimates by the revised classification).
  - CS2000: totals expanded with country-unit subdivisions; overall GB sample adjusted to improve country estimates.
  - CS2007: total squares increased in Wales to support Wales-only reporting; England/Wales/Scotland framing retained with 45 strata (later 45) and 591 total GB squares in CS2007.
- Representative sample distribution
  - England, Scotland, and Wales each had country-specific sampling rates and class representations.
  - Tables and maps in the report illustrate class distributions, country-specific allocations, and the number of squares per class across surveys.

## Country-specific estimates and Wales/uplands
- Separate country estimates
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit versions of Land Classes (England with Wales, Scotland) to support country-level reporting.
  - Additional sampling and class subdivisions were implemented to ensure robust Wales and England-specific statistics.
- Wales-focused refinements (CS2007)
  - Welsh-only reporting requirements driven by policy and environmental governance needs led to new Welsh sub-classes and increased Welsh sampling.
  - Upland habitat sampling added to improve estimates in upland England and Wales.
- Implications for comparability
  - National estimates can be computed using the newest country-specific Land Classification, which may affect cross-survey consistency.
  - The report discusses trade-offs between using the latest country-specific classifications versus maintaining consistency with the original 1990 Land Classification for GB-wide comparisons.

## Outputs, usage, and challenges
- Outputs
  - Stratified estimates of habitat areas and landscape features by Land Class and country unit.
  - Maps and tables illustrating sample allocation, class descriptions, and changes across survey years.
- Data use and dissemination
  - The framework enables self-contained, country-specific habitat status assessment and trend analysis over time.
  - Outputs are used to inform policy, land-use planning, and ecological monitoring, with emphasis on improving data creation and access to promote broader reuse.
- Challenges highlighted
  - Ensuring adequate data consideration across wider teams to avoid delays in “understanding the ask.”
  - Managing data across patchy formats and multiple systems.
  - Communicating complex stratified classifications and ensuring outputs are widely shared and reusable.
  - Balancing precision and representation across countries, especially with devolution and Wales-specific reporting needs.
