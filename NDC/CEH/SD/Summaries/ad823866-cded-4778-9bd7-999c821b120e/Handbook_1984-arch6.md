# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Aim and purpose
  - Establish a standardized field recording framework to document changes in rural environments.
  - Build a quality baseline for land use, habitat, and landscape features to enable future comparisons (ground surveys and aerial photography).
  - Create compatible data items and formats that can be used with previous surveys and future monitoring.

- Scope and sampling design
  - Survey 384 squares across Great Britain (12 squares from each of 32 land classes) in 1984 to cover diverse landscapes.
  - Each square is part of a larger program to assess land cover, land use, and habitat features, with plans to increase statistical confidence via additional sampling in the future.
  - Planning coordinated by six ITE research stations, with liaison from Merlewood; teams typically handle about 56 squares each.
  - Survey logistics emphasize efficiency: minimize revisits, prefer travel-based planning, and consider single-square-per-day or grouped-field travel options.

- Equipment and field tools
  - Minimal equipment required: data recording booklets (FABs), 6" (1:10,000) maps, photos/films, pens, maps, navigation aids, identity cards, clipboards, and weather gear.
  - Equipment is designed for mapping and recording rather than precise measurement.

- Field procedures and workflow
  - On-site: quickly assess access, potential problems, and permissions; plan a route to ensure full square coverage.
  - Obtain permissions for the entire square before starting; secure goodwill and background information from landowners where possible.
  - After surveying, review records for omissions and ensure clear presentation; avoid late-stage data rewriting unless absolutely necessary.

- Permissions and access
  - Obtain access rights for all parts of the square to avoid wasted work if access is later refused.
  - Prior consultation is often beneficial, though it may cause delays; surveyors should carry identity and project explanations.
  - Maintain a contact list of landowners and update ownership data sheets as needed.

- Data recording and the FAB system
  - Data are primarily a mapping exercise: annotate 6" maps with a structured set of data codes on a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB).
  - Use numeric and alpha codes that can be combined in designated boxes to describe each category; codes may be extended or supplemented for atypical cases.
  - The minimum mapable unit and the exact coding decisions are determined in the field by the surveyor, who should note uncertainties or qualifiers if needed.
  - Each FAB is organized by square, with pages for cover, ownership, farmer information, physiography/inland water/coastal, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry/woodland/trees, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography, and post-survey procedures.
  - Colors are recommended as an optional aid when coding becomes dense to reduce clutter; avoid relying on colors for long-term interpretability.

- Ownership, tenants, and farmer information
  - Ownership data are recorded for all land units within a square; tenant farmers are marked with a “T,” and owners who changed since 1977/78 are marked with a “C.”
  - An owner/cooperation rating (0–3) assesses the owner’s willingness to assist future surveys.
  - In Farmer/Landowner Information, surveyors aim to engage at least one farmer per square (preferably the major landholder) in a guided conversation to collect context while recording key sheet data.

- Physiography, inland water, and coastal features
  - Detailed codes cover cliffs, rock outcrops, boulders, peat (including erosion and vegetation interactions), ground leveling, drainage features (ditches, tile drains), water bodies (lakes, ponds, rivers, canalised rivers), shores, springs, and related landforms.
  - Coastal and inland water features include shore types, substrate codes, and aquatic vegetation types.

- Agriculture and natural vegetation
  - Cover types include a broad range of land covers (amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, various crop types, fallow/abandoned land, and more).
  - Special attention to curtilage: when a square includes built-up curtilage, record land within the curtilage according to relevant non-agricultural categories; do not double-count garden areas as agricultural land.
  - Provides guidance on recognizing and coding mixed vegetation mosaics, dominant cover, and proportions, as well as species notes for major grasses and semi-natural communities.
  - Includes stock and livestock use codes (beef, dairy, dual-purpose cattle, sheep, goats, horses, poultry, etc.) and production/use codes (produce for sale, farm amenities, etc.).

- Forestry, woodland, and trees
  - Detailed tree/woodland classifications: scattered trees, coppice, copse, scrub, lines of trees, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and woodlands/forests.
  - Codes cover canopy extent, species (with emphasis on dominant or representative species), age classes, proportions, management status (unmanaged, planting, regeneration), and signs of regeneration or underplanting.
  - Special notes on hedgerows, belts, and lines of trees; recording of regeneration, grazing impact, and associated features (amenity, shelter, recreation, etc.).

- Boundaries
  - Boundary types include walls, hedges, fences, stockproof boundaries, mixtures, and other features; descriptions add contextual information (e.g., filled gaps, boundaries no longer present).
  - Boundaries are mapped and coded to reflect their physical and management characteristics, with attention to curtilage boundaries when relevant.
  - Practical coding emphasizes the most impactful boundary types first and allows multiple codes for complex boundaries.

- Recreation
  - Categories distinguish formal and informal recreation areas, with codes for specific uses (parks, golf, race tracks, playgrounds, boating, nature trails, informational points, etc.).

- Buildings, structures, and communications
  - Built cover types cover a wide range of rural and urban-related features, including buildings by use (residential, agricultural, industrial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional) and associated grounds.
  - Descriptions provide additional detail for particular structures and uses.
  - Infrastructure elements include pipelines, signs, bridges, tunnels, poles, fences, verges, tracks, and roads.
  - Road and track classifications differentiate tarmac roads, verges, tracks (constructed or unconstructed), footpaths, and other forms of access infrastructure.

- Photography
  - Five photographs per square, captured as slides/films to reflect square-scale context while minimizing extraneous sky or distant surroundings.
  - The first photo should be of the square’s front cover area; locations and viewing directions must be precisely marked on the FAB with arrows indicating direction of view.

- Procedure subsequent to survey
  - After completing a survey, thoroughly review the FABs to confirm no feature is missing.
  - Transferring data to fresh maps is discouraged unless absolutely necessary to protect data integrity.
  - Communicate completion batches to Merlewood and arrange transport of finished FAB squares as soon as practical.

- Documentation and references
  - The handbook provides detailed figure references (e.g., Figure 1 for grid layout, Figure 2 cover, Figure 5 physiography/coastal, Figure 6 agriculture/natural vegetation, Figure 7 woodland/trees, Figure 8 recreation, Figure 9 communications) to guide page-by-page data entry and interpretation.
  - Emphasizes consistency with past surveys and the need to qualify ambiguous field observations for accurate later processing.

- Overall emphasis for data support
  - The document presents a comprehensive, standardized coding framework to capture landscape, land-use, vegetation, ownership, and built/environmental features across rural GB.
  - It underscores the importance of timely permissions, careful on-site decision-making, structured data capture, and robust post-survey data handling to enable reliable future analyses and monitoring.
