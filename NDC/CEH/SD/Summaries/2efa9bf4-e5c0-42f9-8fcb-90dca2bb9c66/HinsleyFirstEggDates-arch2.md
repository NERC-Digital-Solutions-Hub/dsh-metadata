# First egg dates for Great Tits and Blue Tits breeding in three deciduous woods in Cambridgeshire, England in 1993 to 2015.

## Purpose and context
- Uses timing of breeding as a proxy for spring phenology to assess climate warming effects.
- Part of a larger long-term study on how habitat, structure, and landscape influence woodland birds.

## Study design and scope
- Species: Great Tit (Parus major) and Blue Tit (Cyanistes caeruleus).
- Study sites: Monks Wood, Brampton Wood, and Wennington Wood in Cambridgeshire, England.
- Nest boxes: Birds monitored in wooden boxes (approx. 110 x 130 x 200 mm) at 1–2 m height; box hole sizes determine species access; density kept low to minimize impact.
- Timeframe: Data collected 1993–2015.
- Box details: Monks Wood includes non-existent boxes (23–30) in some years; Brampton and Wennington have varying box counts over time.

## Data collection and measurement
- Inspection schedule: Approximately weekly during the laying period (starting late March).
- Phenology measure: First egg date calculated by counting backwards from observed clutch size (one egg laid per day); dates normalized so April 1 = 1; March dates appear as negative values.
- Inclusion criteria: Only active nests at observation (at least one more egg to be laid) and only first breeding attempts (no replacement clutches or second broods).
- Sample size: Yearly N indicates the number of clutches included per year.

## Data structure and file details
- File: GTBTfirsteggdates.CSV (Unicode), 42 KB.
- Columns:
  - Species code: 1 = Great Tit; 2 = Blue Tit.
  - Site: 1 = Monks Wood; 2 = Brampton Wood; 3 = Wennington Wood.
  - Year number: Year 1 = 1993 through Year 23 = 2015.
  - Nest box identifier (note: Monks Wood boxes 23–30 do not exist).
  - First egg date (Apr 1 = 1; March dates negative; three negative values observed, all in Year 5).
  - Sample size (N) for the number of clutches included per year.

## Quality control and data validation
- Field data collected by trained personnel.
- Egg dates cross-checked against original paper records.
- Data lines and values checked for outliers.
- Individual egg dates validated against yearly means per site.

## Relevance for environmental monitoring
- Provides standardized, long-term phenology data across multiple sites for cross-site comparisons.
- Supports monitoring of climate change impacts on spring phenology and breeding timing.
- Data can be integrated with habitat and landscape variables from the broader study to assess drivers of changes in bird phenology.

## Notes and considerations
- First-egg dating assumes one egg per day and relies on accurate detection of onset of laying.
- March dates fall before April 1 and are represented as negative values; only three such values observed (Great Tit: Brampton Wood; Blue Tit: Monks Wood).
- Data management: Raw data are stored and prepared for upload to appropriate data portals, aligning with standardised monitoring practices.
