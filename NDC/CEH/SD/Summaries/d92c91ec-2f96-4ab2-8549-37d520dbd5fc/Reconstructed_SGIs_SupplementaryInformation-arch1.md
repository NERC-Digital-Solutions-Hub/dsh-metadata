# Historic Standardized Groundwater level Index (SGI) for 54 UK boreholes (1891-2015)

- Project context
  - Historic Droughts was a four-year (2014–2018), £1.5m project funded by UK Research Councils to develop a cross-disciplinary understanding of past UK droughts and to improve tools for managing droughts in the future.
  - Aims to link hydrometeorological and social systems to better understand droughts and water scarcity, informing management and policy decisions.

- Inventory and outputs
  - Historic Droughts Inventory is a knowledge base of past drought characteristics, impacts, and responses compiled from multiple sectors (hydrometeorological, environmental, agricultural, regulatory, social, cultural).
  - Inventory includes two main elements:
    - hydro-meteorological timelines (rainfall, river flows, groundwater) with consistent drought indicators
    - references to past droughts from newspapers, legislation, agricultural media, and oral histories
  - SGI dataset is one of the groundwater-related datasets within the Inventory, alongside reconstructed groundwater levels.

- Dataset description (SGI)
  - Standardized Groundwater level Index (SGI) comprises monthly, standardised groundwater levels for observation boreholes across the UK.
  - SGI values are produced by a non-parametric normal scores transform applied per calendar month.
  - For each date, probabilities are provided for SGI being less than 0, less than -1, less than -1.5, and less than -2.
  - Time period covered: 1891–2015.
  - Sites are located on Principal Aquifers across the UK, with a majority on Chalk aquifers; most boreholes are in southern and eastern England.

- Motivation and purpose
  - Generated by the British Geological Survey as part of Historic Droughts to enable defining and monitoring groundwater drought and to enable comparisons with meteorological drought indices (e.g., SPI) and other hydrological drought indicators.
  - Aims to support understanding of historic drought severity and duration and to inform drought planning (e.g., utilities’ drought management plans).

- Data sources and standardization methods
  - Data based on reconstructed groundwater level time series (Bloomfield et al., 2018) created for the Historic Droughts Inventory.
  - Standardization method: non-parametric normal scores transform applied to monthly groundwater levels for each calendar month (described in Bloomfield & Marchant, 2013).
  - Uncertainty quantification: Generalised Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology; behavioural parameter sets defined by Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency > 0.5; converted to SGI series to yield monthly probabilities for SGI thresholds.

- Format and access
  - Datasets are provided as CSV files (one per site) with headers:
    - Date: YYYY-MM-DD (monthly dates; first day of month)
    - SGI: standardized groundwater level
    - Prob0: probability SGI < 0
    - Prob1: probability SGI < -1
    - Prob15: probability SGI < -1.5
    - Prob2: probability SGI < -2
  - File naming follows: [Project] [Model Identifier] [Run of the model] [Input or Output] [Time] [Variable] [Catchment/Borehole ID] [Version]
  - An additional file, Metadata_forGWLandSGI_reconstructions.csv, provides site-level metadata (Site_name, Easting, Northing, WellMaster_ID, etc.).
  - Data hosted as part of the Historic Droughts project outputs; acknowledgments attribute support to NERC.

- Data usage and interpretation
  - SGI <= 0 indicates groundwater drought; SGI between -1.0 and -1.99 indicates severe drought; SGI between -1.5 and -1.99 indicates severe drought; SGI ≤ -2 indicates an extreme groundwater drought.
  - SGI probabilities allow assessment of likelihoods for drought conditions on a given date, enabling probabilistic interpretations and risk assessment for groundwater droughts.
  - Enables cross-comparison with meteorological drought indices (e.g., SPI) and contributes to historical drought planning and management decisions.

- Limitations and context
  - While the dataset extends back to 1891, most groundwater records in the UK date from the late 1960s/early 1970s; earliest drought perspectives rely on reconstructed series and cross-sector references.
  - Some sites are located in coastal or regionally variable aquifers; results are most robust where data density and reconstruction uncertainty are well characterized (via GLUE).

- Sites overview
  - The SGI dataset comprises 54 UK boreholes across Principal Aquifers, with a metadata file listing site-specific identifiers and coordinates (e.g., 8HackpenCottages, Alstonfield, AmpneyCrucis, etc.). The majority of sites are associated with Chalk aquifer contexts.
