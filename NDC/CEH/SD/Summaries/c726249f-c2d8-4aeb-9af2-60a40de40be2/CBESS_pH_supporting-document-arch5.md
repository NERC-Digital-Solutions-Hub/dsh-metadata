# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil pH on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset records soil pH from 10 g soil samples taken from the top 5 cm within 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
- Part of the CBESS project focusing on coastal biodiversity and ecosystem service sustainability.
- Data collection occurred during Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Lead staff: Hilary Ford.

## Location and site context
- Study areas: Essex and Morecambe Bay saltmarshes.
- Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
- Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates provided for all sites:
  - Essex: AH (51°47'N, 0°52'E), FW (51°49'N, 0°58'E), TM (51°41'N, 0°56'E)
  - Morecambe Bay: CS (54°10'N, 3°0'W), WS (54°8'N, 2°48'W)
- Sites represent two contrasting soil types: clay soils (Essex) and sandy soils (Morecambe Bay), with differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Land-use context varies by site, including heavy hare grazing in Essex and grazing by geese; in Morecambe Bay, intensive sheep grazing with geese in winter, contrasting with lighter grazing at West Plain.

## Sampling design and timeline
- Sampling windows: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples include an additional window (2–6 March 2013).
- Quadrat-level sampling within 1 m x 1 m plots, covering multiple sites across both regions.

## Methods and measurement
- Procedure for pH measurement: 10 g soil (fresh mass) mixed with 25 ml deionised water, 1:2.5 dilution, shaken ~30 minutes, pH measured with a Jenway 4320 pH/electrical conductivity probe.
- Calibration: None documented.
- Observations focus on the parameter pH; no other variables are indicated.

## Data structure and metadata
- Core dataset field descriptions include:
  - Row Number: sorting aid (numeric)
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S)
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E)
  - Site: CS, WS, WP (Morecambe); AH, FW, TM (Essex)
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM)
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22
  - Scale: A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m to upper limit)
  - pH: numeric value, adjusted for ambient temperature
- Format: Excel workbook
- Additional documentation fields include general data checks, quality control steps, and other information as part of the dataset

## Quality, provenance, and governance
- Data quality control and basic statistical treatment are referenced but not detailed; includes quality checks on observations.
- Provides a clear record of who collected the data, where, when, and how the measurements were made, supporting provenance and repeatability.
- Metadata supports discoverability and reuse, with explicit site, habitat, and sampling details.

## Data format and access
- Primary data format: Excel workbook.
- Dataset contains explicit field-level descriptions enabling interoperability and re-use, including standardized site and habitat codes and coordinate references.

## Stewardship considerations
- Alignment with data governance goals for data stewards:
  - Ensure consistent metadata across sites and time periods (site codes, habitat types, quadrat numbers).
  - Maintain clarity on sampling windows and methods to support reproducibility.
  - Monitor and update calibration practices or document any changes to measurement instruments.
  - Plan for updates or extensions (new sampling campaigns) and versioning to preserve data lineage.
  - Consider storing coordinates and site descriptions in a centralized metadata repository for improved interoperability across datasets.
