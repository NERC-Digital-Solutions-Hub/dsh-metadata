# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil pH on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Overview
  - Dataset covering soil pH measurements from saltmarsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay.
  - Measurements based on 10 g soil samples from the top 5 cm within 1 m x 1 m quadrats; pH determined after mixing with 25 ml deionised water (1:2.5 dilution), shaken ~30 minutes, using a Jenway 4320 pH/EC probe.
  - Field campaigns conducted in Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
  - Site selection represents contrasting soil types (clay in Essex vs sandy in Morecambe Bay) and differing inundation, creek structure, and grazing regimes.

- Staff and locations
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Coordinates provided for several locations (Essex and Morecambe Bay sites).

- Habitat and sampling design
  - Habitats: Saltmarsh (SM) and Mudflat (MF).
  - Site descriptions include grazing regimes (e.g., heavy grazing by Brent geese at AH and FW; intensive sheep grazing at CS and WS; lighter grazing at West Plain).
  - Quadrat numbers per site: 1–22.
  - Spatial scale codes:
    - A = 1 m
    - B = 1–10 m
    - C = 10–100 m
    - D = 100 m to upper limit

- Measurements and procedures
  - Observed variable: pH (adjusted for ambient temperature).
  - Observation protocol: 10 g soil + 25 ml DI water; 1:2.5 dilution; ~30 min shake; pH measured with Jenway 4320.
  - Calibration: None reported.

- Data structure and format
  - Dataset fields include:
    - Row Number (sorting)
    - Season (Winter W or Summer S)
    - Location (Morecambe M or Essex E)
    - Site (CS, WS, WP for Morecambe; AH, FW, TM for Essex)
    - Habitat (MF or SM)
    - Quadrat Number (1–22)
    - Scale (A–D)
    - pH (numeric, temperature-adjusted)
  - File format: Excel workbook.

- Data quality and notes
  - Calibration details not provided; data checking procedures and statistical treatment are listed but not detailed in the text.

- Potential data use and data support implications
  - Enables comparison of soil pH across regions, habitats, seasons, and spatial scales.
  - Suitable for integration with CBESS biodiversity and ecosystem service analyses.
  - Supports creation of data products (dashboards, pivot tables, reports) to enable exploration and self-service analysis of pH variation.
