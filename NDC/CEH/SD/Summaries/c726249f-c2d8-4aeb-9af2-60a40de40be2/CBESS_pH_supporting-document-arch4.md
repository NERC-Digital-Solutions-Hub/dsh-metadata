# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil pH on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- Dataset documenting soil pH measurements from salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay, as part of CBESS.
- Sample: pH of 10 g soil from the top 5 cm of soil within 1 m x 1 m quadrats.
- Lead staff: Hilary Ford.
- Sampling window: Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter samples (2–6 March 2013).

## Content and scope
- Locations:
  - Essex: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
- Coordinates provided for Essex and Morecambe Bay sites.
- Site descriptions reflect contrasting soil types (Essex: clay; Morecambe Bay: sandy) and differing inundation, creek structure, and vegetation.
- Grazing regimes vary by site (Essex: hare grazing; Morecambe Bay CS/WS heavy sheep grazing with geese; West Plain lightly grazed).

## Methods and sampling design
- Field campaign: Winter and Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Sampling details: 10 g fresh soil + 25 mL deionised water; 1:2.5 dilution; shaken ~30 minutes.
- Measurement: pH measured with Jenway 4320 pH/electrical conductivity probe.
- Calibration: Not documented in dataset metadata.
- Statistical treatment and quality control procedures mentioned but not detailed.

## Data structure and format
- File format: Excel workbook.
- Dataset fields (examples):
  - Row Number: 1–22 (sorting index).
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: Morecambe – CS, WS, WP; Essex – AH, FW, TM.
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22.
  - Scale: A = 1 m; B = 1–10 m; C = 10–100 m; D = 100 m to upper limit.
  - pH: numeric value; pH adjusted for ambient temperature.
- Dataset includes precise site coordinates and descriptive context for habitats and grazing regimes.

## Data quality, provenance, and governance
- Quality assurance mentioned (data checking procedures), but specific QA steps are not detailed in the metadata.
- Calibration details for pH measurement are not provided.
- Rich provenance: links to specific sites, habitats, and seasonal sampling enhance traceability and potential cross-site integration.

## Considerations for use and reuse
- Useful as baseline soil pH across contrasting salt marsh environments and grazing regimes.
- Supports cross-site comparisons of pH in relation to habitat type, inundation, and management practices.
- Appropriate for integration with broader CBESS datasets or other environmental/biodiversity datasets, with attention to metadata completeness and standardization.
- Temporal scope limited to 2013; consider when comparing with newer data or longer time series.

## Practical takeaways for Data Leaders
- This dataset demonstrates the importance of including site-level context (soil type, inundation, vegetation, grazing) to interpret pH measurements.
- Ensures discoverability through detailed fields (locations, habitats, quadrat/grid scale, seasonal labeling) and explicit coordinate data.
- Highlights need for clear calibration and QA documentation to accompany measurement data.
- Provides a structured schema (season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale, pH) conducive to data integration and aggregation across CBESS sites.
