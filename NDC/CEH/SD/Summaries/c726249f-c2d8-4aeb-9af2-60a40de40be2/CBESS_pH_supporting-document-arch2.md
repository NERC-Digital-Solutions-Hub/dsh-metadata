# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil pH on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

## Overview
- A dataset measuring soil pH from salt marsh sites in two UK regions (Morecambe Bay and Essex) as part of the CBESS program.
- Focuses on pH of a 10 g soil sample from the top 5 cm within a 1 m × 1 m quadrat.
- Collected during Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter samples collected 2–6 March 2013.
- Staff: Hilary Ford.

## Study sites and environmental context
- Essex locations:
  - Abbotts Hall (AH) – 51.783°N, 0.8667°W
  - Fingringhoe Wick (FW) – 51.8167°N, 0.9667°W
  - Tillingham Marshes (TM) – 51.6833°N, 0.9333°W
- Morecambe Bay locations:
  - Cartmel Sands (CS) – 54.1667°N, 3.0°W
  - Warton Sands (WS) – 54.1333°N, 2.8°W
  - West Plain (WP) – location described as West Plain
- Habitat and soil types:
  - Essex: predominantly clay soils; saltmarsh sites selected to represent these soils.
  - Morecambe Bay: sandy soils; saltmarsh sites selected to represent these soils.
- Broad regional differences:
  - Inundation frequency, creek structure, and dominant vegetation differ between regions.
  - Grazing regimes differ: Essex sites heavily grazed by hare and over-wintering Brent geese; Morecambe Bay sites heavily grazed by sheep with pink-footed geese wintering; West Plain lightly grazed.

## Sampling design and timing
- Part of a general field campaign in 2013 (Winter and Summer), with Essex winter samples collected outside the main window (2–6 March 2013).
- Quadrat-based sampling within 1 m × 1 m plots; up to 22 quadrats per site ( Quadrat Number 1–22).

## Measurements and methods
- Primary variable measured: soil pH.
- Sampling procedure:
  - 10 g of fresh soil blended with 25 ml deionised water (1:2.5 dilution).
  - Shaken for ~30 minutes.
  - pH measured using a Jenway 4320 pH/electrical conductivity probe.
- Calibration: No separate calibration procedures documented for the measurements.

## Data structure and content
- Data are stored in an Excel workbook.
- Dataset field descriptions include:
  - Row Number: numeric sorting key.
  - Season: Winter (W) or Summer (S).
  - Location: Morecambe (M) or Essex (E).
  - Site: Morecambe – Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP); Essex – Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Habitat: Mudflat (MF) or Saltmarsh (SM).
  - Quadrat Number: 1–22 (numeric).
  - Scale: A = 1 m; B = 1–10 m; C = 10–100 m; D = 100 m and above.
  - pH: numeric value; adjusted for ambient temperature.
- File format: Excel workbook.

## Data quality and management
- Procedures mentioned include data checking and standardised measurement methods to support environmental monitoring outputs.
- Observations are tied to clearly defined metadata (site, habitat, season, quadrat, scale) to enable cross-site comparisons and long-term monitoring.
- Data are prepared in a standardised format to support sharing and portal upload as part of monitoring datasets.

## Relevance for monitoring and policy analysis
- Provides standardized pH data across contrasting salt marsh soils and grazing regimes, enabling assessment of soil chemistry conditions within CBESS.
- Structured data description supports reproducibility, quality assurance, and integration with other environmental datasets for broader environmental health assessments.
- The dataset’s standardized fields (season, location, site, habitat, quadrat, scale) facilitate temporal trend analysis and spatial comparisons essential for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.
