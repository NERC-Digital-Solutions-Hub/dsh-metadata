# Coastal Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Sustainability (CBESS) soil pH on salt marsh sites at Morecambe Bay and Essex

- Overview
  - Dataset measuring soil pH across salt marsh sites in Essex and Morecambe Bay as part of the CBESS program.
  - Staff responsible: Hilary Ford.
  - Sampling timeframe: Winter and Summer 2013, with additional Essex winter samples (2–6 March 2013).

- Study design and locations
  - Essex sites: Abbotts Hall (AH), Fingringhoe Wick (FW), Tillingham Marshes (TM).
  - Morecambe Bay sites: Cartmel Sands (CS), Warton Sands (WS), West Plain (WP).
  - Geographic coordinates provided for each observation site.
  - Habitat context: Saltmarsh (primary) and Mudflat; contrasts in inundation, creek structure, and dominant vegetation between regions.
  - Grazing regimes:
    - Essex: hare grazing; heavy grazing by Brent geese (winter).
    - Morecambe Bay: intensive sheep grazing with pink-footed geese present in winter; West Plain lightly grazed.

- Monitoring and sampling details
  - Sampling unit: 10 g soil from the top 5 cm within a 1 m x 1 m quadrat.
  - Sampling schedule: General field campaign in Winter/Summer 2013; Essex winter samples collected in an additional window (2–6 March 2013).
  - Quadrat and scale: Quadrat numbers 1–22; scale categories A (1 m), B (1–10 m), C (10–100 m), D (100 m to upper limit).
  - Variable measured: pH (soil solution).

- Observational procedures and lab methods
  - Procedure: 10 g soil with 25 ml deionised water; 1:2.5 dilution; shake ~30 minutes; pH measured with Jenway 4320 (pH/EC probe).
  - pH adjustments: pH values adjusted for ambient temperature.
  - Calibration: Not specified (Calibration procedures = None).
  - Quality control: Data checking procedures described (details not provided in the metadata excerpt).

- Data structure and metadata
  - Primary data: pH values plus supporting fields (season, location, site, habitat, quadrat number, scale).
  - Dataset fields include:
    - Row Number (sorting key)
    - Season (Winter W, Summer S)
    - Location (Morecambe M, Essex E)
    - Site (CS, WS, WP, AH, FW, TM)
    - Habitat (Mudflat MF, Saltmarsh SM)
    - Quadrat Number (1–22)
    - Scale (A–D)
    - pH (numeric; temperature-adjusted)
  - Data format: Excel workbook.
  - Personnel: Hilary Ford responsible for the dataset.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates a structured approach to collecting, processing, and documenting soil health metrics across multiple coastal sites with differing environmental contexts.
  - Provides a clear protocol for field sampling, lab measurement, data formatting, and metadata annotation, suitable for governance and data-sharing requirements.
  - Highlights the importance of site-specific metadata (habitat, grazing regime, inundation) for interpreting environmental health indicators.

- Challenges and considerations for data governance (aligned with monitoring framework authors)
  - Data gaps and consistency: calibration procedures not documented; ensuring consistent calibration in future datasets.
  - Metadata completeness: while detailed, ongoing enhancement of metadata (e.g., data lineage, QA/QC steps) would support reuse.
  - Access and reuse: data presented as an Excel workbook; consider broader data-sharing standards to reduce barriers.
  - Silo-breaking and governance: the dataset’s structured metadata and cross-site scope illustrate the value of centralized, interoperable datasets to avoid duplication and improve decision-making.
