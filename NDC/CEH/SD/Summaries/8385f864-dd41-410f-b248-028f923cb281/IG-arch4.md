# IG Protocol

## Aim and Rationale
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio as potential responders to environmental change.
- Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous groups to detect indirect or amplified environmental signals.
- Pitfall trapping is the core sampling method; carabids are taxonomically tractable with substantial existing data; morphs of P. madidus by leg colour may relate to climate; harvestmen (Mitopus morio) are also collected.
- Protocol aligns with established methods (e.g., M.L. Luff) and emphasizes standardisation, data quality, and comparability across sites.

## Field Methods and Sampling Design
- Sampling design: three transects per site, ideally in different vegetation types and including the target TSS; avoid cattle-access areas.
- Trap layout: 10 pitfall traps per transect, with 10 m spacing between traps.
- Transect handling: approach from different directions when attending traps to minimise trampling; if trampling impacts vegetation long-term, move a trapline but restitute to the original position every three years; movements must be recorded and reported to the Central Co-ordination Unit (CCU).
- Sampling schedule: traps set on the first Wednesday in May; emptied and replaced fortnightly for 13 sampling periods (May–October).
- Target taxa and measurements: all carabid beetles (not limited to Carabus spp.); harvestmen Mitopus morio collected; measure second femur length of M. morio (varies with altitude/latitude and may reflect environmental change); retain adult Craneflies to verify larval identifications (separate protocol for Tipulidae).
- Data recording emphasis: ensure data capture supports later analysis of management impacts and environmental responses; records to be stored and aggregated properly.

## Equipment and Trapping Setup
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter × 10 cm deep.
- Protective cage: chicken wire (approx. 15 mm × 20 mm mesh) to deter small mammals; trap covers from 5" plant pot saucers and galvanized wire to prevent rain ingress and disturbance.
- Preservative and storage: antifreeze preservative used undiluted (depth ~3 cm); replacements used with marked lids; traps stored at 4°C prior to processing.
- Sorting and preservation: contents sieved with a 1 mm mesh; preserved in labelled vials containing 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water; avoid damage to Mitopus morio legs; store catches at 4°C, or transfer to 75% alcohol if sorting exceeds three days.
- Initial handling and re-placement: pre-filled replacement traps with marked lids; reseat traps and ensure lids are correctly managed during replacement.
- Appendix I details supplier and equipment specifics; test sieves and other items are listed.

## Data Collection, Recording, and Coding
- Core measurement: invertebrates – ground predators (IG Protocol); 13 sampling occasions (May–October) per transect; each transect of ten traps treated as a single sampling location.
- Recording framework: for each trap in each transect, record trap ID, species code, species name, number caught, units, and any individual-level data (e.g., sex, specific morph codes for P. madidus).
- Harvestmen: capture data include genus/species, count, and femur length (precision 0.1 mm).
- Species morph codes for Pterostichus madidus (leg colour morphs) to be recorded using standardized codes:
  - FR = female red legs
  - MR = male red legs
  - FB = female black legs
  - MB = male black legs
- Data structure and standards:
  - Four core identifiers required for each dataset entry: Site Identification Code (e.g., T05), Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), Sampling Date/time.
  - Tracking and coding follow Biological Records Centre standards; all data to be aligned with ECNCCU data transfer documentation.
  - Data entry forms:
    - Species recording form (one per transect; includes morphs and gender)
    - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
    - Femur length recording form for harvestmen
- Data formatting and quality:
  - Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
  - Separate rows for different leg colour morphs and gender for P. madidus.
  - Data are prepared for bulk storage by transect and trap, with subsequent aggregation after identification.

## Data Management, Access, and Documentation
- Data management flow: data collected at field sites and submitted to the ECN Central Co-ordination Unit (CCU); Data Transfer documentation governs dataset formats (restricted access via Site Managers' extranet).
- Access and contact: ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access to documentation and datasets.
- Documentation supports discoverability, traceability, and interoperability across ECN sites and datasets.

## Appendices and Standards
- Appendix I: Equipment details and supplier information (pitfall traps, test sieves).
- Appendix II: Example forms (species recording form, trap dates/quality form, femur length form).
- Notes on coding and data capture:
  - Trap IDs are unique within a site.
  - Morph and gender codes are used consistently in species records.
  - Coding follows the Biological Records Centre standards.
  - Femur length precision is 0.1 mm.

## Key Takeaways for Data Leaders
- Provides a standard, auditable field protocol for monitoring ground predators as environmental indicators.
- Establishes a clear sampling design (three transects, ten traps per transect, 13 sampling periods) and a rigorous specimen processing workflow.
- Enforces consistent data capture with predefined core fields, morph/gender codes, and specimen-level measurements to enable robust analyses and cross-site comparisons.
- Includes formal data governance, transfer, and access pathways via ECNCCU and restricted extranets, with explicit documentation and data standards to support discoverability and reuse.
