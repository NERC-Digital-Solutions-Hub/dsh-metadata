# IG Protocol

- Aim: Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio that may respond to environmental changes; include predatory invertebrates to enhance sensitivity to environmental change and potential climate-related morph variations.

- Rationale:
  - Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with a history of use as environmental indicators.
  - Pitfall trapping is a well-established, standardised method; carabids have shown sensitivity to management and climate-related changes.
  - Pterostichus madidus leg-color morphs may respond to climate; these morphs will be recorded separately.
  - Mitopus morio (harvestman) is also collected and monitored to detect environmental responses.
  - Data collection builds on the protocol by M.L. Luff; standardisation efforts are ongoing.
  - Measurements (e.g., femur length in M. morio) may vary with altitude/latitude and environmental change.

- Method:
  - Sampling approach: Use pitfall traps at each site to sample Carabidae and Mitopus morio; retain adult craneflies for cross-checking identifications with larvae (see separate Tipulidae protocol).
  - Standard protocol is supported by a well-developed trap design and handling process; analyses may rely on later data quality checks and collaboration with domain experts.

- Ground Predators (Core measurement):
  - At each ECN sampling location (transect of ten traps), collect data on Carabidae and Mitopus morio, and record harvestman morphology (femur length) where applicable.
  - All carabids (not limited to Carabus spp.) are of interest.

- Equipment:
  - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep.
  - Protection: chicken-wire cage to reduce bycatch of small mammals; trap covers (e.g., plant pot saucers and galvanised wire) to prevent flooding and interference.
  - Preservative: antifreeze (blue antifreeze preferred) in traps to a depth of ~3 cm; pre-filled replacement traps used for efficient sampling.

- Location:
  - Three transects in different vegetation types, including the TSS; avoid cattle access.
  - 10 traps per transect, spaced 10 m apart.
  - Consider directional approaches to minimize trampling; if trampling impacts vegetation, move traplines but rotate back to original positions every three years with movement recorded.

- Sampling:
  - Start on the first Wednesday in May; empty and replace traps fortnightly for 13 periods (through October).
  - Replacement traps are pre-filled and marked; maintain seating and lid handling to ensure consistent sampling.

- Handling and storage:
  - Store catches at 4°C prior to sorting; if sorting is delayed beyond three days, preserve in 75% ethanol.
  - Sorting: pass contents through a 1 mm mesh sieve; collect antifreeze separately for reuse; rinse to remove adhering dirt.
  - Preserve taxa in labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, and 25% water mixture; take care with Mitopus morio leg integrity for measurements.
  - Label catches with site ID, trap number, and collection date; store catches separately until identified, then bulk the ten-trap catches for storage.

- Sorting and identification:
  - Sorting and identification performed by an experienced sorter; references and prior identifications inform the process.
  - Appendix I provides supplier details for traps and sieve equipment.

- Recording and labeling:
  - Unique trap IDs per ECN site (e.g., T1–T30 across transects).
  - Separate rows for different leg color morphs and sex for P. madidus; use codes after species name:
    - FR: female red legs
    - MR: male red legs
    - FB: female black legs
    - MB: male black legs
  - For harvestmen, record femur length (to 0.1 mm precision) and sex if recorded.

- Data specification and recording conventions:
  - Data capture should follow the ECNCCU data transfer documentation and site metadata standards.
  - Core variables identify the sample in space and time; the first four key parameters are:
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/Time
  - Core measurement: Invertebrates - ground predators (IG Protocol) includes fortnightly variables for each transect with ten traps (13 sampling periods).
  - Data forms:
    1) Species recording form (one per transect)
    2) Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
    3) Form for recording femur lengths for harvestmen

- Data collection specifics (records and conventions):
  - Trap IDs are unique within a site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
  - For species recording, separate rows are used for leg color morphs and gender of P. madidus with the codes FR, MR, FB, MB appended to the species name.
  - Coding follows the Biological Records Centre standards (ITE Monks Wood).

- Appendices and notes:
  - Appendix I provides supplier details for pitfall traps and test sieves.
  - Records are submitted to ECNCCU with standard dataset formats; restricted access Site Managers' extranet houses the data transfer documentation.
  - References informing rationale include Eyre et al. (1989) on beetles as indicators and Terrell-Nield (1992) on leg-color morphs; Thiele (1977) for carabid ecology.

- Overall data quality and practical considerations:
  - Standardisation is emphasized; data may come from multiple sites with varying vegetation and management practices.
  - Ensures traceability from field sampling to laboratory processing and data storage, enabling robust comparative analyses and potential neuroecological or climate-related inferences.
