# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio to detect responses to environmental changes; include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous groups to amplify signals of change.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with substantial existing information.
- Pitfall trapping is well established; standardisation efforts are ongoing.
- Carabids can be sensitive indicators of management and climate-related changes; P. madidus leg-colour morphs may reflect climate effects; M. morio features may respond to environmental change.

## Method

### Sampling design
- Three transects per ECN site, each with ten pitfall traps (10 m spacing) within different vegetation types; avoid cattle access.
- If trampling damages vegetation, move traplines yearly but return to original positions every three years and record moves.
- All data tied to a Central Coordination Unit (CCU).

### Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups (7.5 cm diam x 10 cm deep).
- Predator-relief cage: chicken wire (mesh ~15 mm x 20 mm), ~70 mm high.
- Covers: cheap 5" plant pot saucers with galvanised wire.
- Optional: antifreeze preservative (Blue antifreeze) for sample storage.

### Location and setup
- Select three transects in different vegetation types including the target transect (TSS area).
- Do not place traps where cattle have access.

### Sampling schedule
- Set traps on the first Wednesday in May.
- Empty and replace fortnightly for 13 sampling periods (May–October).

### Preservation and storage
- Use undiluted antifreeze to a depth of ~3 cm in each trap.
- Replace traps with marked lids; store catches at 4°C prior to sorting.
- If sorting cannot occur within 3 days, transfer catches to 75% ethanol to prevent deterioration.

### Sorting, identification, and handling
- Sort catches by passing trap contents through a 1 mm mesh sieve; preserve filtrate for antifreeze recovery.
- Transfer sorted material to labeled vials containing a 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water solution.
- Take care to preserve legs of M. morio for femur measurements.
- Label each catch with site ID, trap number, collection date; keep trap records separate until identification is complete, then bulk ten-trap catches for storage.

### Measurement and morphology
- For M. morio, measure femur length (as a variable that may reflect environmental change).
- Record leg colour morphs for P. madidus:
  - FR female red legs
  - MR male red legs
  - FB female black legs
  - MB male black legs
- Harvestmen (Mitopus morio) data include femur length where recorded.

## Data collection and recording

### Core dataset and formats
- Variables required for each sampling location (transect of ten traps): Trap ID, Species code, Species name, Number caught, Units, Taxon-specific fields (e.g., gender, morph codes, femur length for harvestmen).
- Core metadata: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
- Data submission to ECNCCU; refer to Data Transfer documentation for ECN dataset formats.

### Recording forms
- Three forms provided by CCU:
  - Species recording form (one per transect; includes morphs and gender).
  - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form.
  - Femur length recording form for harvestmen.

### Coding and conventions
- Trap IDs must be unique within a site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
- Morph and gender codes follow the Biological Records Centre conventions:
  - P. madidus: FR, MR, FB, MB codes after species name.
- Use standard BRC coding for dataset compatibility; data formats align with ECNCCU requirements.

## Quality, provenance, and notes

- Data provenance: maintain separate trap records until identification is complete; bulk after identification.
- Identification confidence: implement standardised protocols to reduce misidentification; morph data (e.g., leg colour, femur length) provide additional ecological signals.
- Referenced methodologies: standard ground beetle sampling and ecological protocol literature (e.g., Eyre et al. 1989; Terrell-Nield 1992; Thiele 1977; Luff protocol).
