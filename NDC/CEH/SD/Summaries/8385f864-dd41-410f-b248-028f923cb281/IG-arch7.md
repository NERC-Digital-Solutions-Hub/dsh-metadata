# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio to detect responses to environmental changes.
- Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous groups to amplify or indicate environmental shifts.
- Produce data suitable for GIS mapping and spatial analyses, with standardized collection and recording.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with reliable biological information and are sensitive indicators of management and climate-related changes.
- Pitfall trapping is a well-established method; standardisation and morph-specific data (e.g., leg-colour morphs) can enhance climate-change analyses.
- Harvestmen (Mitopus morio) are also collected as potential environmental indicators.
- Method aligns with the Dr M.L. Luff protocol; aims to integrate with existing ecological data frameworks.

## Method (Sampling design)
- At each site, establish a pitfall-trapping system adjacent to the TSS to sample Carabidae and Mitopus morio, with adult craneflies retained for cross-checking.
- Measure leg-length morph where applicable (e.g., M. morio) due to potential altitude/latitude effects.
- Target all carabid beetles (not limited to Carabus spp.).

## Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep.
- Protective cage: chicken wire netting (~15 mm x 20 mm mesh, ~70 mm high) clipped to trap rim.
- Covers: lightweight covers from plant pot saucers and galvanized wire.
- Preservative: undiluted antifreeze (blue antifreeze) stored and used to fill traps to ~3 cm depth.
- Replacement traps: pre-filled with marked lids; stored at 4°C before use.
- Sorting materials: 1 mm mesh sieve, 10 cm diameter, white trays, labeled vials with ethanol/glycerol/water mix (70/5/25).
- Storage: 4°C for catches; 75% alcohol for longer-term storage if sorting delayed.

## Location (Site and transect design)
- Three transects within different vegetation types, including the TSS, avoiding cattle access.
- Ten pitfall traps per transect, spaced 10 m apart.
- Consider varying transect approach directions to minimize trampling; relocate lines if trampling becomes long-term issue (record movements and inform Central Co-ordination Unit).

## Sampling schedule
- Start on the first Wednesday in May.
- Empty and replace traps fortnightly for 13 sampling periods (through to end of October).

## Time and processing
- Collect and preserve samples; maintain cold storage (4°C) before sorting.
- If sorting cannot occur within three days, transfer catch to 75% ethanol to prevent deterioration.
- Sorting procedure: pour contents through 1 mm mesh sieve, drain antifreeze for reuse, rinse to remove adhered soil, transfer to crystallising dish for inspection under good light.
- Identify taxa of interest; place organisms in labeled vials with preservative; label each sample with ECN site ID, trap number, and collection date.
- Separate records by trap until identification is complete; then bulk the catch from ten traps for storage.

## Recording conventions and data formats
- Core measurement: invertebrates – ground predators (IG Protocol).
- For each transect of ten traps, record as a single sampling location with standard variables.
- Key identifiers (must be included in all datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time
- Data collection includes:
  - Trap ID, species code, species name, number caught
  - Individual records may include gender and morph codes
  - For harvestmen, femur length recorded (mm, 0.1 precision)
- Morph codes for Pterostichus madidus leg colour and gender:
  - FR female red legs; MR male red legs; FB female black legs; MB male black legs
- Use Biological Records Centre (ITE Monks Wood) coding standard; follow the ECN dataset formats and the Data Transfer documentation (restricted access via Site Managers’ extranet).

## Recording forms
- Three forms provided by the Central Co-ordination Unit:
  1) Species recording form (one per transect)
  2) Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
  3) Form for recording femur lengths for harvestmen

## Notes and conventions
- Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, T21–T30 for transect 03).
- Detailed notes on morph coding and gender representation are provided to ensure consistency across datasets.
- Data management documentation and contact (ECNCCU) are available for access to dataset specifications and transfer formats. Appendices provide equipment details and example forms.
