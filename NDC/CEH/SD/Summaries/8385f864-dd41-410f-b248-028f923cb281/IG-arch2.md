# IG Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio to detect responses to environmental changes.
  - Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous groups to capture potential amplification or different responses to environmental change.
  - Use standardized methods to enable comparability over time and across sites.

- Rationale
  - Carabidae are taxonomically tractable with substantial background data.
  - Pitfall trapping is an established method with a developing standardization.
  - Ground beetles can be sensitive to management and climate factors; P. madidus leg-colour morphs may indicate climate effects; M. morio may reflect environmental changes.

- Method (summary)
  - Sampling design
    - Three transects per sampling location, across different vegetation types, near the TSS, avoiding cattle access.
    - Ten pitfall traps per transect, 10 m apart; traps are moved only if vegetation trampling is severe, and movements must be recorded and reported to the Central Co-ordination Unit.
  - Equipment
    - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups 7.5 cm diameter × 10 cm deep.
    - Protective cage: chicken wire to prevent small mammal captures.
    - Covers: plant pot saucers and galvanized wire.
  - Location and timing
    - Transects approached from different directions to minimize trampling bias.
    - Trapping begins the first Wednesday in May; fortnightly collections for 13 periods (May–October).
  - Taxa and measurements
    - Target taxa: Carabidae (all species) and Mitopus morio (harvestman); adult craneflies kept for identification checks against larvae.
    - Morphometrics: measure second femur length of M. morio (altitude/latitude-related variation; potential environmental signal).
    - Pterostichus madidus morphs recorded separately: leg colour morphs (FR, MR, FB, MB) and gender.
  - Preservation and handling
    - Preservative: antifreeze (undiluted) added to traps to ~3 cm depth; used antifreeze can be replenished from a 25 L supply.
    - Replacement traps: pre-filled with marked lids; new traps placed in the ground, old lids replaced on trap with catch.
    - Sorting/storage: catches stored at 4°C prior to sorting; if sorting >3 days after collection, transfer to 75% alcohol.
    - Sorting process: sieve catch through 1 mm mesh; preserve taxa in labelled vials with 70% alcohol, 5% glycerol, 25% water.
    - Labeling: traps identified by ECN site, trap number, and collection date; records kept per trap until after identification, then bulked for storage.
  - Data handling and formats
    - Core measurement: invertebrates - ground predators (IG Protocol).
    - Key dataset identifiers: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date.
    - Data submission: ECNCCU standard dataset formats; use dedicated recording forms.
  - Recording forms
    - Species recording form (one per transect).
    - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form.
    - Femur length recording form for harvestmen.
  - Notes on coding and conventions
    - Trap IDs are unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, etc.).
    - Morph codes for P. madidus: FR female red legs, MR male red legs, FB female black legs, MB male black legs.
    - Coding follows Biological Records Centre standards (ITE Monks Wood, UK).

- Equipment and logistics (Appendix)
  - Pitfall traps: supplier A W Gregory & Co Ltd; specifications and accessories (netting cage, covers).
  - Test sieves: Endecotts Ltd.
  - Appendix I provides the detailed equipment list and supplier contacts.

- Data quality and accessibility
  - Emphasizes verification, quality assurance, and standardization of data from established sources.
  - Ensures datasets are stored and uploaded to the appropriate ECN portals for accessibility and reuse.
  - Central Coordination Unit (CCU) coordinates movement/changes to traplines with proper documentation.

- Practical considerations for analysts
  - Standardized procedures enable comparison over time and across sites, supporting environmental health assessments and policy performance monitoring.
  - The protocol facilitates data interoperability by using defined data fields, codes, and recording forms.
  - Encourages leveraging dataset integration by linking ground-predator data with other monitoring data to increase dataset value.
