# IG Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio that may respond to environmental change.
  - Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous groups to amplify or signal environmental changes; benefit from existing, standard pitfall methods and taxonomic knowledge.
  - Record morphs of Pterostichus madidus separately when relevant (leg-colour morphs).

- Rationale
  - Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable and have established interpretation as indicators of management and climate effects.
  - Pitfall trapping is an established, standard method; sampling follows a protocol aligned with Dr M.L. Luff’s approach.
  - Data such as leg-colour morphs and femur length for M. morio may be informative for environmental-change analyses.

- Method
  - At each site, establish pitfall traps sampling Carabidae and Mitopus morio; retain adult craneflies for verification against larvae (see separate Tipulidae protocol).
  - Measure femur length of M. morio (altitude/latitude-related variation suspected).
  - Include all carabid beetles, not limited to Carabus spp.

- Equipment
  - Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter × 10 cm deep.
  - Protective cage: chicken wire (≈15 mm × 20 mm) to reduce non-target captures; trap covers from plant pot saucers and galvanised wire.
  - Optional: antifreeze preservative for sample storage; 25 L drums with decanting for field use.
  - Sorting and storage: 1 mm sieve, test sieve (10 cm diameter), 70% alcohol/5% glycerol/25% water preservation solution; labeled vials; storage at 4°C; 75% alcohol if sorting is delayed beyond ~3 days.

- Location and sampling design
  - Three transects per ECN site, each in different vegetation types, including the TSS; traps away from cattle access.
  - Ten traps per transect, 10 m apart; consider approaching from different directions to reduce trampling.
  - If trampling impacts vegetation, move a trapline but return to original position after three years; record any movement and report to Central Co-ordination Unit.

- Sampling schedule
  - Traps deployed on the first Wednesday in May.
  - Fortnightly sampling for 13 periods (May–end October); replacement with pre-filled traps as needed.

- Field procedures and storage
  - Use antifreeze preservative; replace traps with marked lids; store catches at 4°C prior to sorting.
  - If sorting is delayed, transfer catches to 75% alcohol to prevent deterioration.
  - Sorting: pour trap contents through 1 mm mesh sieve; collect preservative for reuse; rinse to remove adhering dirt; sort taxa on a white tray under good light; place each taxa in labeled vials with preservative solution.
  - For each catch: label with ECN site ID, trap number, and collection date; store catches separately by trap until post-identification bulk storage.

- Core measurement and data recording (IG Protocol)
  - Variables collected fortnightly per transect: trap ID, species code, species name, number caught, and additional fields as required.
  - For harvestmen (Mitopus morio): record femur length (mm) with 0.1 mm precision.
  - Morphs and gender (for P. madidus): record leg-colour morphs with codes (e.g., FR, MR, FB, MB) following the standard coding.
  - Data formats: dedicated forms for each data type (species recording per transect, trap dates/quality, and femur lengths for harvestmen).

- Data standards and recording conventions
  - Data uniquely identified by: Site Identification Code (e.g., T05), Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC), Location Code (e.g., 01), and Sampling Date/time.
  - Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site (e.g., T1–T10 for transect 01, T11–T20 for transect 02, etc.).
  - Recording conventions follow Biological Records Centre (ITE Monks Wood) standards; leg-colour morphs and gender recorded as specified.
  - Appendix II provides example forms; additional data transfer documentation available from ECNCCU.

- Data management and sharing
  - Data submitted to ECN Central Co-ordination Unit (ECNCCU); refer to restricted-access Data Transfer documentation on the ECN extranet.
  - Data formats and dataset specifications are maintained by ECNCCU; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access and guidance on submission.
