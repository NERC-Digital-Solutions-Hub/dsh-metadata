# IG Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor the abundance of ground beetles (Carabidae) and record features of Pterostichus madidus and Mitopus morio to detect responses to environmental changes.
- Include predatory invertebrates alongside phytophagous species to amplify or reflect environmental signals.
- Follow a standardised pitfall-trap protocol and record leg-length morphs where relevant; emphasize quality data for environmental monitoring.

## Rationale
- Ground beetles are taxonomically tractable with substantial existing biological information and have shown sensitivity to management and climate factors.
- Pterostichus madidus leg-colour morphs and Mitopus morio measurements may reveal environmental change effects.
- Established methods (pitfall trapping) enable standardised data collection and comparability across sites and time.

## Method
- Sampling framework: at each ECN Site, establish three transects within different vegetation types, including the TSS; 10 pitfall traps per transect at 10 m spacing.
- Transect placement: avoid cattle access; if trampling is an issue, move traplines but document movements and report to the Central Co-ordination Unit.
- Sampling schedule: traps deployed on the first Wednesday in May; emptied and replaced fortnightly for 13 sampling periods (through to end of October).
- Target data: collect Carabidae and Mitopus morio; retain adult craneflies for cross-checking identifications with larvae (separate protocol for Tipulidae); measure second femur length of M. morio as an environmental-change indicator.

## Equipment
- Pitfall traps: polypropylene cups, 7.5 cm diameter x 10 cm deep; wire netting cage to deter small mammals; trap covers from plant saucers; antifreeze preservative (undiluted) to a depth of ~3 cm.
- Replacement/trap handling: pre-filled traps with marked lids; storage and handling guidance (traps stored at 4°C prior to sorting; catches stored at 4°C; if sorting >3 days, preserve in 75% alcohol).
- Sorting and preservation: sort through a 1 mm mesh sieve; collect preservative for reuse; transfer taxa to labelled vials with 70% ethanol, 5% glycerol, 25% water.
- Labeling and storage: label catches with ECN site ID, trap number, collection date; store samples in labelled tubes; maintain records per trap until bulked by transect.
- Documentation: Appendix I lists traps and suppliers; Appendix II contains recording forms.

## Location and sampling conventions
- Three transects per site; ten traps per transect; 10 m spacing; avoid long-term vegetation damage; moving traplines requires recording and reporting.
- Traps are active during May–October, with 13 sampling periods in total.

## Data recording and formats
- Core dataset structure: each sampling location (transect) yields data for 13 periods; first four core identifiers are required for all datasets:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if higher frequency)
- Core measurement: invertebrates – ground predators (IG Protocol) with variables recorded fortnightly per transect:
  - Trap ID, Species code, Species name, Number caught, Units, BRC code
  - For harvestmen: genus, species, count, femur length (mm) with precision
  - Gender, morph codes for Pterostichus madidus (e.g., FR, MR, FB, MB) and corresponding notes
- Forms: three forms are used
  - Species recording form (one per transect)
  - Pitfall trap dates and quality information form
  - Femur length recording form for harvestmen
- Morphology and coding notes: morphs and gender codes follow standard BiRC conventions (e.g., FR female red legs, MR male red legs, FB female black legs, MB male black legs).
- Data standards and transfer: reference to ECNCCU data transfer documentation; data sharing and governance considerations are implied by standardized formats and metadata requirements.

## Data governance and openness
- Emphasises the need for clear labeling, standardized data capture, and the potential for data sharing of underlying datasets, aligning with monitoring framework needs for transparent, quality-assured data.
- Metadata and dataset formats are specified to support verification and reuse, with designated contacts for access (ECNCCU) and restricted documentation for dataset formats.

## Notes and practical considerations
- Trap IDs must be unique within each ECN site.
- Coding system aligns with Biological Records Centre standards.
- Appendix I/II provide supplier and form details to support consistent implementation across sites.
- Practical time considerations: identification work can be time-intensive (noted hours for sorting/identification).
