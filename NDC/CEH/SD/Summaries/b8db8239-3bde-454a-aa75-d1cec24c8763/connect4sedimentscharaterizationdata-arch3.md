# SEDIMENTS CHARACTERISATION DATA FOR CONNECT4 PROJECT

## Overview
- Compilation of sediment characterization datasets from four countries (Botswana, South Africa, Zimbabwe, Mozambique) for dam sediment cores.
- Each country provides multiple cores analyzed for sedimentological and geochemical properties.
- Data collected primarily in 2019–2020; methods emphasize grain size, organic matter, and trace metal concentrations.
- Data intended to support environmental health monitoring, with emphasis on data quality, metadata, and governance.

## Data Content by Country

- Botswana
  - 7 cores from Gaborone, Lobatse, Shashe dams (GC1, GC2, L11, S5, S6, S7, S8).
  - Analyses: grain size distribution, organic matter content (LOI), and heavy metals (Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb); GC1/GC2/S8 include extensive geochemical data.
  - Data structure varies by core; some cores include raw data, replicates, and detailed geochemical tables (e.g., S8 includes averages, standard deviations, replicates for several elements).

- South Africa
  - 10 cores from Hout rivier dams (H1–H3, H5) and others (M4, N4–N?; Nwanedi etc.) across multiple sites.
  - Analyses: grain size, LOI, organic matter, and geochemical data (As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn) with varying completeness.
  - Core data structures include lines/columns for depth, LOI calculations, organic matter, grain size, and multi-element geochemistry; some cores have complete geochemistry while others are limited or missing raw data.

- Zimbabwe
  - 10 cores from Ripple Creek, Zhovhe, and Creek dam systems (B1, B3, B5, B6, Z1–Z6).
  - Analyses: grain size distribution, organic matter content, and geochemical data (Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb) with some datasets including raw data.
  - Data structures provide depth, LOI calculations, organic matter, grain size, and element concentrations; some cores feature detailed replicates and statistics for several elements.

- Mozambique
  - 10 cores from dams (MA1–MA5B, MA7, MA10; OX1, OX2) across multiple sites.
  - Analyses: grain size distribution, organic matter content; several cores include geochemical data (XRF, ICP-OES/MS) with varying completeness.
  - Data structures show depth, LOI calculations, grain size, organic matter, and elemental data; some cores (e.g., MA10) include XRF data; some datasets have missing or non-uniform data points.

## Sampling and Analytical Methods
- Sampling: Push corer with extension rods; cores collected from shore or by small boat; 50 mm diameter PVC cores; stored at 4 °C for water retention; cores split in half, photographed, and sub-sampled.
- Measurements:
  - Grain size distribution (micrometres)
  - Organic matter content via Loss on Ignition (LOI) (%)
  - Geochemical analyses via ICP-OES/ICP-MS/XRF (ppm for elements)
- Data presentation: Core-specific details include depth of samples, LOI calculations, and elemental concentrations; some datasets include averages, standard deviations, relative standard deviations, and replicates.

## Data Structure and Variables
- Common structure across cores:
  - Depth of sample (column A)
  - LOI-related calculations and/or LOI (%) (columns B–H, varying by core)
  - Organic matter (%) (where available)
  - Grain size distribution (columns J–L and beyond, varying by core)
  - Geochemical data (ppm) for elements such as As, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Zn (locations and formats vary by core; some include averages, SDs, replicates)
- Country-specific variations reflect differences in data completeness:
  - Some cores provide full geochemical suites with replicates and statistics.
  - Other cores provide partial data (e.g., grain size and LOI only) or raw data sets.
  - A few datasets explicitly note missing data or missing LOI/organic matter for certain depth ranges.

## Quality Control and Limitations
- General QC approach noted: inspection for measurement errors and anomalies; awareness of large standard deviations and detection-limit issues.
- Common limitations:
  - Some datasets contain missing values or incomplete metadata.
  - Some cores lack geochemical analyses or raw data.
  - Potential issues with comparability due to differing methods, units, or data structures across cores and countries.
- Documentation indicates some datasets require careful interpretation where data are incomplete or partially missing.

## Data Availability and Governance Considerations
- Metadata completeness varies; some datasets include detailed structure (columns, units, methods), while others are less complete.
- Public sharing of underlying data is a recurring governance concern; several entries note barriers related to sharing and standardization of metadata.
- For monitoring framework use, standardized metadata and consistent data formats across cores and countries would enhance comparability and policy relevance.

## Implications for Monitoring Frameworks
- Key indicators available:
  - Sediment grain size distribution trends
  - Organic matter content variations
  - Concentrations of heavy metals/trace elements (e.g., Cr, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Pb, As) across depths and cores
- Cross-country comparability opportunities:
  - Harmonize data structure, units, and quality control practices
  - Standardize core labeling, depth intervals, and geochemical reporting
- Gaps to address:
  - Incomplete geochemical data in several cores
  - Missing or inconsistent metadata and raw data accessibility
  - Need for robust data governance, provenance tracking, and open data sharing to support transparent decision-making
- Data use recommendations:
  - Leverage grain size and LOI as baseline sediment characterisation indicators
  - Use geochemical data to assess sediment contamination and potential ecological risk
  - Integrate time-anchored cores where possible to monitor trends and inform management decisions for dam sedimentation and pollution control
