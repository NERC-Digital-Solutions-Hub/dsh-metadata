# Overview

- This dataset compiles in-stream nitrogen cycling data from the PRINCe project, led by Prof. Mark Trimmer (QMUL). Data were generated by Dr Chun Ma and Dr Dave Clark under supervision of Prof. Trimmer, Dr. Boyd McKew, and Dr. Corinne Whitby.
- Two field campaigns in 2018 (winter February and summer July) across 12 permeable rivers in Hampshire Avon catchment, Kent, and Essex.
- Focus: in situ rates of nitrogen transformations, porewater chemistry, and microbial gene abundance and transcripts in permeable riverbeds.

## Study Context and Design

- Rivers: permeable beds (sand or chalk geology) with three unvegetated sediment patches per site.
- Sampling setup: 15 bespoke stainless steel riverbed probes installed at two depths (7 at 5 cm, 8 at 10 cm) to cover patches; 20 cm minimum distance from push-pull probes to avoid water intrusion.
- Sediment cores: a single 2 cm core per patch, subsampled at 5 cm and 10 cm for molecular analyses; cores cryopreserved in liquid N2.
- Push-pull and tracers: 15N-labeled ammonium or nitrite injected into the riverbed (300 µM; ~98 atom % 15N) with ~25 mL tracer per experiment; recovery from the same probe over time with four sampling points, total duration ≤ 60 minutes.
- Measurements during in situ experiments: rates of nitrate production (R_NO3) and N2 production (R_N2), nitrification efficiency, plus physical water parameters (temperature, pH) and porewater chemistry (O2, NO2, NO3, NH3, PO4).

## Metadata and Site Information

- Sample and site identifiers: Sample_ID, SiteCode, SiteName; geographic coordinates (Lat, Long); geology type (Chalk or Sand); season (Winter or Summer); depth and core identifiers.
- Experimental treatments: Treatment_15A_15N indicates whether the substrate injected was 15N-labeled ammonium or nitrite.
- Core and sediment depth workflow: cores collected and subsampled at 5 cm and 10 cm for downstream molecular analyses.

## Measurements, Units, and Methodologies

- Nitrogen transformation rates:
  - R_NO3: mean rate of 15N-NO3 production; unit µmol N L^-1 h^-1; calculated via linear regression of accumulated 15NO3- over time.
  - R_N2: mean rate of 15N-N2 production; unit µmol N L^-1 h^-1; calculated via linear regression.
  - nitrification_efficiency: (R_NO3 / (R_NO3 + R_N2)) × 100 (%).
- Physicochemical porewater parameters:
  - temp: river water temperature (°C); pH (dimensionless); O2 concentration (µM) with calibration and contamination correction; NO2 (µM); NO3 (as NOx, µM) with cadmium reduction for NOx analyses; NH3 (µM); PO4 (µM).
- Molecular biology (DNA and RNA) targets (abundance and transcripts):
  - RNA targets (transcripts per g dry weight): Comammox amoA, Anammox hzo, nirS (clade I), nosZ (clade I).
  - DNA targets (gene copies per g dry weight): AOA amoA, AOB amoA, Bac 16S rRNA, Anammox hzo, Anammox hzsA, nirK (clades I–III), nirS (clades I–II), nosZ (clades I–II), Nitrospira nxrB, Thaumarchaeota ureC.
  - Methods: RNA extracted from 2.0 g wet weight sediment; RT-qPCR for transcripts; DNA extracted from 0.25 g wet weight sediment; qPCR for gene copies; primer sets and references provided.
- High-throughput sequencing data:
  - NCBI_BioProject_accession: embargoed accession for raw amplicon data (archaeal/bacterial 16S, hzo, nirK_C3, nirS_C1, nosZ_C1, AOA/AOB amoA, comammox amoA, Nitrospira nxrB).
  - Library preparation: DNA extraction (PowerSoil kit), locus-specific PCR, Nextera XT indexing, Illumina MiSeq sequencing (4 runs); data embargo until publication.
- Quality control and calibration details:
  - O2 measurements calibrated with zero solution and a known concentration; contamination correction estimated at 10 µM and subtracted; LOD and precision values provided (e.g., O2 LOD 10 µM, precision 2%); NO2 LOD ~0.08 µM, precision 1%; NOx/NO3 LOD ~0.3 µM, precision 1%; NH3 LOD 0.6 µM, precision 3%; PO4 LOD 0.1 µM, precision 1%.
  - NOx analysis involves cadmium reduction to nitrite prior to colorimetric detection; standard references and materials used for calibration.

## Data Governance, Access, and Sharing

- Data are linked to NCBI BioProject with embargo status; raw sequence data are deposited but released upon publication of related manuscripts.
- Metadata schema includes detailed identifiers, geolocation, geology, season, depth, and treatment, enabling traceability and reuse.
- Data collection and sharing adhere to QA/QC practices and standard methodologies to support verification and comparability.
- Underpinning data and outputs are intended for public sharing, but practical barriers exist (embargoes, metadata completeness, and data governance requirements).

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks

- Provides a comprehensive, multi-dimensional dataset for evaluating nitrogen cycling processes under different geologic and seasonal contexts in permeable rivers.
- Demonstrates integration of process-based measurements (15N-tracer rates) with porewater chemistry and microbial community/functional gene data, aligning with robust monitoring approaches that combine process rates, chemistry, and biology.
- Highlights data governance considerations critical for monitoring frameworks:
  - Need for standardized metadata (site, depth, geology, season, treatments) to enable data integration and cross-site comparisons.
  - Balance between data sharing openness and publication-driven embargo periods; importance of accessible metadata and clear data provenance.
  - Challenges around data access, silos, and ensuring up-to-date metadata to support reproducibility and reuse.
- Useful as a model for designing monitoring programs that require rapid, in situ process measurements coupled with molecular analyses to inform policy decisions and targeted management actions.
- Underlines the importance of clear QA/QC documentation, including instrument calibration, detection limits, and data processing methods, to ensure data usefulness for governance and decision-making.
