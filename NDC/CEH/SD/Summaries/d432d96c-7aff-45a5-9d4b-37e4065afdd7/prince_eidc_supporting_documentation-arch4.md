# Overview

- Purpose and scope: A dataset compiling results from the in-stream N-cycling component of the NERC-funded PRINCe project, measuring nitrogen transformations, porewater chemistry, and microbial gene abundance/transcripts in riverbeds.
- Project and personnel: Led by Prof. Mark Trimmer (Queen Mary University of London); data generated by Dr Chun Ma and Dr Dave Clark under supervision of Prof. Trimmer, Dr. Boyd McKew, and Dr. Corinne Whitby.
- Study area and campaigns: Two field campaigns in 2018 (winter February and summer July) across 12 permeable-bed rivers in the Hampshire Avon catchment, Kent, and Essex (sand or chalk geology).
- Field methods (in-stream push-pull design): 
  - 15 stainless steel riverbed probes installed at two depths (5 cm and 10 cm) to cover three unvegetated sediment patches.
  - Porewater sampling with syringe and slight vacuum; measurements of O2 and pH in porewater; preservation for Fe(II) or gas analysis; 0.45 μm filtrate frozen for later nutrient and chloride analysis.
  - 15N-labelled ammonium or nitrate injected (≈300 μM, 98 atom % 15N) into riverbed; 4 time points collected; total duration ≤ 60 minutes.
  - A single 2 cm sediment core taken per patch, subsampled at 5 and 10 cm for molecular analyses; cores placed ≥20 cm from probes and cryopreserved in liquid N2.
- Data structure and identifying information:
  - Sample_ID, SiteCode, SiteName, latitude/longitude, geology (Chalk or Sand), season (Winter or Summer), treatment (15A_15N; 15N), depth, core identifiers.
- Measurements, units, and methodologies: 
  - Chemical/ rate data: R_NO3 (µmol N L^-1 h^-1), R_N2 (µmol N L^-1 h^-1), nitrification_efficiency (%), temp (°C), pH, O2 (μM), NO2 (μM), NO3 (NOx) (μM), NH3 (μM), PO4 (μM).
  - Calculations and methods: nitrification efficiency from R_NO3 and R_N2; O2 measured with microelectrode and calibrated; NOx/NO3/NO2 determined by automated colorimetry with specified detection limits and standards.
  - Molecular data (RNA): transcript copies per g dry weight for Comammox amoA, Anammox hzo, nirS_C1, nosZ_C1; extraction and RT-qPCR methods described.
  - Molecular data (DNA): gene copies per g dry weight for AOA amoA, AOB amoA, Bac 16S, Anammox hzo/hzsA, nirK (C1–C3), nirS (C1–C2), nosZ (C1–C2), Nitrospira nxrB, Thaumarchaeota ureC; detailed primer sets and qPCR methods provided.
  - Sequencing data metadata: NCBI BioProject accession for raw amplicon sequences (archaea/bacteria 16S, hzo, nirK_C3, nirS_C1, nosZ_C1, AOA_amoA, AOB_amoA, comammox_amoA, Nitrospira_nxrB); data currently embargoed until manuscript publication.
- Data provenance and references:
  - Methodology references include Lansdown et al. (2014) for fine-scale in situ measurements and the 15N tracing approach; sequencing and qPCR protocols described with specific primers and internal calibration standards.
- Data access and embargo:
  - Raw sequence data available under a NCBI BioProject accession; embargoed until publication of manuscripts using these data.
- Relevance for data leadership:
  - Demonstrates end-to-end data collection, from in situ chemical measurements to multi-omics data, with explicit metadata standards (sample identifiers, site coordinates, season, geology, depth).
  - Highlights data governance considerations for complex coastal/riverine datasets, including unit consistency, provenance, data versioning, and embargo management.
  - Emphasizes integration of environmental chemistry, biogeochemical rates, and microbial functional potential, offering a rich, multi-layered data asset for cross-network data sharing and collaboration.
