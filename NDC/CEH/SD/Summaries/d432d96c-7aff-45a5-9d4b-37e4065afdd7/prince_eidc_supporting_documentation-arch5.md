# A new dynamic for Phosphorus in Riverbed Nitrogen Cycling - PRINCe

## Dataset scope and purpose
- Compilation of results from the in-stream N-cycling component of the NERC-funded PRINCe project led by Prof. Mark Trimmer (QMUL).
- Field campaigns: winter 2018 (February) and summer 2018 (July).
- Study sites: 12 rivers with permeable beds across Hampshire Avon catchment, Kent, and Essex.
- Focus: in situ rates of nitrogen transformations, porewater chemistry, and microbial gene abundance/transcripts in riverbed sediments.
- Data collection used a “push-pull” technique in permeable riverbeds with multiple sediment patches and depths.

## Dataset content and structure
- Identifying information (metadata)
  - Sample_ID, SiteCode, SiteName, Lat, Long, Geology (Chalk or Sand), Season (Summer or Winter), Treatment_15A_15N (labelled ammonium or nitrite), Depth (cm), Core (core identifier).
- Measurements, units, and methodologies
  - Nitrogen transformation rates: R_NO3 (µmol N L-1 h-1), R_N2 (µmol N L-1 h-1), nitrification_efficiency (%).
  - Physicochemical: temp (°C), pH (unitless), O2 (µM).
  - Nitrogen species concentrations: NO2 (µM), NO3 (µM), NO3.NO2 (NOx) (µM), NH3 (µM), PO4 (µM).

  - Oxygen measurement details include calibration and contamination correction (subtraction of ~10 µM for O2 during transfer).
  - References to detailed methodology: Lansdown et al. (2014) for in situ riverbed nitrate production/consumption.
- Molecular data (gene and transcript abundances)
  - RNA transcripts: RNA_Comammox_amoA, RNA_Anammox_hzo, RNA_nirS_C1, RNA_nosZ_C1 (transcripts per g dry weight sediment); extraction/RT-qPCR methods described.

- Data provenance and sequencing
  - NCBI BioProject accession for raw amplicon sequence data (archaea/bacteria 16S, hzo, nirK_C3, nirS_C1, nosZ_C1, AOA_amoA, AOB_amoA, comammox_amoA, Nitrospira_nxrB).
  - Sequences embargoed and to be released upon publication; DNA was extracted with PowerSoil kit; PCR with locus-specific primers; Illumina MiSeq (4 runs).
  
## Methods, data handling, and quality assurance
- Field and sampling procedures
  - Push-pull probes: 15 bespoke probes installed at two depths (5 cm and 10 cm) across three unvegetated sediment patches per sediment patch.
  - Porewater sampling: syringe collection with slight vacuum; immediate on-site measurements of O2 and pH; preservation for Fe(II) or gas analysis; filtration (0.45 µm) for later nutrient/ chloride analysis.
  - Sediment subsampling: single 2 cm core per patch, sampled at 5 and 10 cm depths for molecular analyses; core kept at least 20 cm from probe to avoid surface water intrusion; cryopreserved in liquid N2.
- Nitrogen transformation measurements
  - 15N-labelled tracer injections (NH4+ or NO2−) at ~300 µM, 98 atom % 15N; 25 mL tracer per experiment.
  - Four time points (immediately after injection and three subsequent points) over up to 60 minutes.
  - Rates calculated via linear regression of isotopically labeled products over time.
  - References to detailed methodology: Lansdown et al. (2014).
- Molecular analyses
  - RNA: extraction from 2.0 g wet weight sediment; RT-qPCR with internal calibration curves for target transcripts.
  - DNA: extraction from 0.25 g wet weight sediment; qPCR with gene-specific primers and absolute quantification against standard curves.
- Data quality and documentation
  - Explicit reporting of detection limits and precision for all measurements (e.g., NO2, NO3, NH3, PO4, O2, etc.).
  - Calibration procedures and references provided; corrections applied where needed (e.g., O2 contamination adjustment).
  - Documentation of instrumentation, kits, and primers to enable reproducibility.
- Data updates and sharing
  - Datasets uploaded to relevant portals and catalogues; ongoing data documentation.
  - Embargoed sequence data via NCBI BioProject until manuscript publication; access granted upon release.

## Data access, sharing, and governance
- Access and embargo
  - Raw sequence data accessible via NCBI BioProject under embargo; to be released upon publication.
  - Other dataset components (chemical, isotope, and gene/transcript abundance data) are published with the manuscript or within the project data portals.
- Provenance and stewardship
  - Data generated by the PRINCe project, with field teams and supervisors named (Chun Ma, Dave Clark; Prof. Mark Trimmer; Dr. Boyd McKew; Dr. Corinne Whitby).
  - Primary data types span chemical measurements, isotopic tracer experiments, and multi-omics data (RNA and DNA targets) with explicit metadata fields for traceability.
- Documentation and usability
  - Metadata includes detailed field definitions, units, and measurement methodologies to support reuse by data users and software pipelines.
  - Cross-references to established methods and literature to enable replication and validation.

## Practical considerations for Data Stewards
- Coverage and interoperability
  - Diverse data types (chemical, isotopic, transcriptomic, and genomic) across 12 rivers and two seasons; standardized metadata fields facilitate cataloguing and discovery.
- Metadata completeness
  - Comprehensive identifying information and measurement metadata provided; ensure continued completeness when integrating with institutional data catalogs.
- Data governance and access
  - Embargo status for sequence data; ensure proper access controls and release timing aligned with publication.
  - Maintain provenance links to PRINCe project, methodologies, and cited literature for traceability.
- Data updating and versioning
  - Document any updates to measurements or methods; maintain versioning to reflect embargo status changes and publication milestones.
- Compliance with data standards
  - Metadata fields and units align with common environmental datasets (e.g., site, season, depth, core identifiers; µmol, °C, µM, %), aiding interoperability with other riverine biogeochemistry datasets.
