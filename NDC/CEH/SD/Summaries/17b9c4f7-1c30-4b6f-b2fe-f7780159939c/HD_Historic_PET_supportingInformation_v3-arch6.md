# Historic Gridded Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) based on temperature-based equation McGuinness-Bordne calibrated for the UK (1891-2015)

## 1. Brief description of the dataset
- 5 km gridded PET data for the UK, derived from a temperature-based McGuinness-Bordne equation calibrated for the UK (calibration period: 1961-1990).
- PET grids available as daily (mm/day) and monthly (mm/month) values; covers 1891-2015.
- Uses 5 km Met Office monthly mean temperature grids; daily values generated by disaggregating monthly temps using pchip interpolation.
- Includes performance metric grids (quality measures) for both daily and monthly PET.
- Data stored in NetCDF4 format and projected on the British National Grid.
- Derivation details documented in Tanguy et al. (2018).

## 2. Context of the dataset
- Produced under the NERC Drought and Water Scarcity Programme, spanning two projects: Historic Droughts and IMPETUS.
- IMPETUS (2014-2018) aimed to improve drought forecasting and decision-making, including testing PET inputs in hydrological forecasting.
- Historic Droughts (2014-2018) sought a cross-disciplinary understanding of UK droughts and the development of tools for future drought management.
- Historic Droughts Inventory provides multi-sectoral references on past droughts to support policy and planning.

## 3. Motivation
- PET is a key input for hydrological models to reconstruct past and forecast future streamflows.
- A long-term PET dataset was needed; the temperature-based method was chosen because full Penman-Monteith data are not consistently available for the entire historical period.

## 4. Data sources
- Met Office 5 km monthly mean temperature grids (combining UKCP09 data 1910-2011, updates 2012-2015, and rescued 1891-1909); daily temps derived via pchip interpolation.
- CHESS temperature data used to calibrate the McGuinness-Bordne equation (1961-1990) and CHESS PET data (1961-2012) for evaluation.
- CHESS PET and CHESS-met datasets underpin calibration and validation (based on PM equation).

## 5. Method for deriving PET grids
- Evaluated multiple PET formulations; McGuinness-Bordne (UK-calibrated version) performed best for the UK.
- Parameters calibrated using 43 catchments (calibration period: 1961-1990).
- Daily PET grids computed from the calibrated equation; monthly PET grids are sums of daily values.

## 6. Metrics to characterise quality of the data
- Metrics: Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), correlation coefficient, bias ratio, variability ratio (VR), Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE).
- Calculated by comparing PET estimates to CHESS-PM PET reference over 1991-2012 (daily and monthly).
- MAPE provided as mean monthly values to indicate uncertainty.

## 7. Format of the PET dataset
- NetCDF4 format following CEH gridded dataset conventions.
- Monthly grids: 2D UK grids with 12 monthly grids per year.
- Daily grids: 2D UK grids with 365 or 366 grids per year.
- Four accompanying metric NetCDF files (two daily, two monthly).
- Projection: British National Grid.
