# Historic Gridded Potential Evapotranspiration (PET) based on temperature-based equation McGuinness-Bordne calibrated for the UK (1891-2015)

- Overview
  - 5 km gridded PET data based on the McGuinness-Bordne temperature-based equation, calibrated for the UK (calibration period: 1961-1990).
  - Temporal coverage: 1891–2015.
  - Outputs: daily PET grids (mm/day) and monthly PET grids (mm/month), stored in NetCDF4 format.
  - Performance metrics grids accompany both daily and monthly PET grids to indicate spatial data quality.

- Dataset contents and format
  - Daily PET grids: 2D UK grids with 365 or 366 time steps per year (leap years accounted for).
  - Monthly PET grids: 2D UK grids with 12 monthly grids per year.
  - Accompanying metric files: four NetCDF files (two for daily grids, two for monthly grids) describing data quality metrics.
  - Projection: British National Grid.
  - Archive format: NetCDF4 following CEH gridded dataset conventions.

- Calibration and methodology
  - Equation: McGuinness-Bordne (as described in Oudin et al., 2005) with UK-specific calibration.
  - Calibration period: 1961-1990; parameters tuned using 43 UK catchments.
  - Data sources for inputs:
    - Met Office 5 km monthly mean temperature grids (1910-2011 from UKCP09, plus 2012-2015 updates and 1891-1909 rescued data).
    - CHESS temperature data used for initial calibration and evaluation (best available gridded temperature dataset).
    - CHESS PET data used as reference to calibrate and evaluate PET (PM-based) against the temperature-based approach.
  - Temperature time series: daily values generated by disaggregating monthly temperatures via piecewise cubic Hermite interpolation (pchip).

- Why PET was developed here
  - PET is a key input for hydrological models to estimate past and future streamflows.
  - Temperature-based PET was chosen due to data availability for historical periods; Penman-Monteith (PM) requires variables not readily available for past/future periods.
  - The dataset supports historic drought reconstruction (Historic Droughts) and drought forecasting (IMPETUS).

- Quality and evaluation
  - Metrics used to assess goodness-of-fit between temperature-based PET and CHESS PET (PM-based reference) over 1991–2012:
    - Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE)
    - Mean absolute percentage error (MAPE)
    - Correlation coefficient
    - Bias ratio
    - Variability ratio (VR)
    - Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) combining correlation, bias, and VR
  - MAPE provided as mean monthly values to indicate uncertainty.
  - Metrics enable users to gauge confidence in PET estimates by location.

- Data provenance and context
  - Part of two UK projects:
    - Historic Droughts (2014–2018; £1.5m) with multi-institution collaboration to understand past UK droughts and inform planning.
    - IMPETUS (2014–2018; £1m) focused on improving drought forecasting by integrating meteorological, hydrological, and demand forecasts.
  - The dataset supports cross-disciplinary understanding of droughts via hydrometeorological, environmental, agricultural, regulatory, social, and cultural perspectives.

- Usage notes
  - Users can assess regional data quality via the accompanying metric grids and the evaluation period (1991–2012).
  - Daily and monthly PET grids enable both short-term and long-term hydrological analyses for UK drought studies.
  - PET inputs derived from a simpler, less data-intensive method suitable for historical reconstructions, with calibration to UK conditions.
