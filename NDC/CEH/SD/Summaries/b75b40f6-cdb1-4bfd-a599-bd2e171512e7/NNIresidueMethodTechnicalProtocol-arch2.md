# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Overview
- Large-scale field study across the UK, Germany, and Hungary to quantify the effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees.
- Focus on determining neonicotinoid (TMX and CLO) concentrations in insect pollinator hive products (nectar, honey, pollen, wax) using LC-MS/MS.

## Analytical approach and matrices
- Target compounds: Thiamethoxam (TMX) and Clothianidin (CLO).
- Matrices analyzed: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax from hive samples.
- Internal standards: labeled thiamethoxam-D4, clothianidin-D3, and QMX.
- Extraction framework:
  - Nectar/honey: 0.1 g samples spiked with internal standards; extraction with 2 mL of 50:50 methanol:water; vortexing, centrifugation, aqueous transfer, and reconstitution.
  - Pollen/wax: 0.1 g samples spiked with internal standards; extraction with 1 mL of hexane:isopropanol 80:20; heat bath at 45°C; addition of 1.8 mL 50:50 methanol:water; vortexing, centrifugation, aqueous transfer, and reconstitution.
- Cleanup: Oasis HLB cartridges (60 mg, 3 mL); conditioning with methanol and water; drying then hexane washing; elution with 6 mL acetonitrile; dryness and re-dissolution in mobile phase.

## Instrumentation and chromatography
- Instrument: LC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole TSQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher) using ESI in positive mode.
- Column: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion (2.5 µm, 50 mm × 2 mm ID).
- Mobile phases: A = water with 0.1% acetic acid; B = methanol with 0.1% acetic acid.
- Gradient: Start 95% A / 5% B; ramp to 50% B in 15 min; to 100% B in 5 min; hold briefly; return to initial conditions.
- Detection: SRM with two characteristic fragments per compound; data acquisition and quantification via ICIS in Xcalibur software v2.0.7.

## Quantification and calibration
- Quantification via response factors against deuterated internal standards.
- Calibration: linear with 1/x weighting; R² > 0.99; range from “ND” to 2.5 ng/mL; at least 5 calibration standards.
- Retention time and ion-transition verification against certified standards.

## Method performance and validation
- Linearity: validated from ND to 2.5 ng/mL.
- Limit of detection (LOD): 0.4 ng/g for the entire procedure.
- Limit of quantification (LOQ): 0.6 ng/g for the entire procedure.
- Expanded uncertainty: 40% (based on Nordtet TR537 guidance).
- Recoveries (method performance):
  - Nectar/honey: TMX-D4 91.3% ± 7.2; CLO-D3 89.7% ± 7.2.
  - Pollen: TMX-D4 83.5% ± 8.2; CLO-D3 82% ± 10.1.
- Quality control and assurance:
  - Blanks: solvent blanks and matrix-matched blanks to detect contamination; mobile phase blanks every four samples to monitor carryover.
  - In-house QC: neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO (from Sigma); different origin than calibration standards.
  - External verification: traceable NIST-certified standards (CLO and TMX) analyzed periodically.
  - Blind analysis: samples analyzed without revealing treatment identity; double-checks on identification and quantification.

## Data handling and reporting
- Final measurements are derived from internal-standard corrections and validated against QC criteria.
- Results facilitate assessment of environmental exposure of honeybees to NNIs and support the broader field study’s objectives.

## Context and attribution
- Project: NERC Centre for Ecology and Hydrology NEC05367.
- Purpose: quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees, using rigorous LC-MS/MS methodology across multiple matrices and stringent QA/QC practices.
