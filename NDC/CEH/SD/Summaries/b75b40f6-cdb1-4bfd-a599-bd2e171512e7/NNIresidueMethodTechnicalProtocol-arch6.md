# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Objective: quantify the concentrations of neonicotinoids (Thiamethoxam and Clothianidin) in honeybee hive products to assess exposure from seed dressings across UK, Germany, and Hungary.
- Analytes: Thiamethoxam (TMX) and Clothianidin (CLO).

## Analytical workflow overview

- Extraction: solid-liquid extraction of homogenised samples.
- Internal standards: use of labelled internal standards (Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, QMX).
- Cleanup: Oasis HLB SPE (60 mg, 3 mL) cartridges after conditioning with methanol and water.
- Concentration and reconstitution: evaporation to dryness, re-dissolve in 1 mL mobile phase (95% A / 5% B) for LC analysis.
- Instrumentation: LC-MS/MS with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (Thermo TSQ) using electrospray ionisation (ESI).

## Sample types and preparation details

- Nectar and honey
  - Sample size: 0.1 g, spiked with internal standards.
  - Extraction: 2 mL of 50:50 methanol-water, vortex, centrifuge.
  - Cleanup: aqueous layer processed through SPE, eluted with acetonitrile.
- Pollen and wax
  - Sample size: 0.1 g, spiked with internal standards.
  - Extraction: 1 mL of 80:20 hexane/isopropanol, 45°C water bath with mixing, add 1.8 mL of 50:50 methanol-water, vortex, centrifuge.
  - Cleanup: SPE as above.

## LC-MS/MS analysis

- Column and separation: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion, 2.5 µm, 50 mm × 2 mm; gradient of water with 0.1% acetic acid (A) and methanol with 0.1% acetic acid (B).
- Gradient profile: start 95% A / 5% B, ramp to 50% B over 15 min, to 100% B in 5 min, return to 5% B, hold, then re-equilibrate.
- Detection: SRM mode in positive ESI; monitor two characteristic fragments for each analyte.
- Instrument parameters: optimized spray voltage, temperatures, and gas conditions specified (e.g., 3000 V spray, 350–300°C capillary/auxiliary settings, nitrogen as desolvation gas, argon as collision gas).

## Calibration, quantification, and performance

- Quantification approach: response factor of neonicotinoids to corresponding internal standards; linear calibration with 1/X weighting.
- Linearity and range: R^2 > 0.99; linear from not-detected (ND) up to 2.5 ng/mL.
- Standards: minimum of five calibration standards per run.
- Sensitivity: LOD for whole procedure = 0.4 ng/g; LOQ = 0.6 ng/g.
- Uncertainty: expanded uncertainty for TMX and CLO = 40%.
- Recoveries (method performance):
  - Nectar/honey: TMX-D4 ~91.3% (±7.2), CLO-D3 ~89.7% (±7.2).
  - Pollen: TMX-D4 ~83.5% (±8.2), CLO-D3 ~82% (±10.1).

## Quality control and assurance

- Blanks: solvent blank and matrix-matched blank for every batch (≤16 real samples per batch).
- Mobile phase blanks: injected every four samples to check for carryover.
- In-house QC: neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO, sourced from different lots than calibration standards.
- Reference standards: traceable NIST-certified standards analyzed periodically (every 8–10 samples) to monitor retention times and instrument sensitivity.
- Blind analysis: samples prepared and analyzed without knowledge of treatment to prevent bias.
- Confirmation: identities of detected neonicotinoids confirmed by comparing MRM transition ratios with pure standards.

## Data outputs and applicability

- Output: quantitative concentrations of TMX and CLO in nectar, honey, pollen, and wax samples, with associated QC metrics and uncertainties.
- Data integrity: comprehensive QA steps (blanks, QC samples, replicate checks, and blind analysis) support reliable datasets suitable for exposure assessment and regulatory or policy-oriented data products.
- Documentation linkage: method details, calibration, recovery, LOD/LOQ, and uncertainty explicitly reported to enable traceability and reproducibility.
