# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Purpose and scope
- Large-scale field study across the UK, Germany, and Hungary to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees.
- Focus on two neonicotinoids: Thiamethoxam (TMX) and Clothianidin (CLO).

## Target analytes and matrices
- Analytes monitored: TMX and CLO.
- Matrices analyzed: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax from pollinator-related hive products.

## Sample preparation
- Nectar/honey (0.1 g): spike with labeled internal standards (TMX-D4, CLO-D3, QMX); extract with 2 mL of 50:50 methanol:water; vortex and centrifuge; collect aqueous phase; adjust with water; prepare for cleanup.
- Pollen/wax (0.1 g): spike with internal standards; extract with 1 mL 80:20 hexane:isopropanol; heat bath (45°C) with intermittent mixing; add 1.8 mL 50:50 methanol:water; vortex; centrifuge; collect aqueous; proceed to cleanup.
- Clean-up: Oasis HLB SPE cartridges (60 mg, 3 mL); condition with methanol and water; load, dry, elute with 6 mL acetonitrile; dry and re-dissolve in 1 mL mobile phase for LC-MS/MS.

## Instrumentation and analysis
- Instrument: LC-MS/MS with Thermo Fisher Quantum Ultra TSQ, ESI positive, using Xcalibur software.
- Column and separation: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion (2.5 µm, 50 mm × 2 mm ID); mobile phases with 0.1% acetic acid in water (A) and in methanol (B); gradient from 95:5 A:B to 100% B and back.
- Detection: Single Reaction Monitoring (SRM) with two characteristic fragments per compound; internal standard–based quantification.
- Key parameters (optimized): spray voltage, temperature settings, and related MS conditions as specified for robust detection.

## Calibration and quantification
- Quantification approach: response factors relative to deuterated internal standards; linear calibration using 1/X weighting; R² > 0.99.
- Calibration range: linear between ND and 2.5 ng/mL; minimum of five standards used.
- Quality and traceability: use of deuterated internal standards; calibration and verification against known standards.

## Performance metrics
- Limits of detection and quantification: LOD 0.4 ng/g; LOQ 0.6 ng/g for the entire procedure.
- Uncertainty: expanded uncertainty ~40%.
- Recovery (as overall method performance): nectar/honey TMX-D4 91.3% ± 7.2; CLO-D3 89.7% ± 7.2; pollen TMX-D4 83.5% ± 8.2; CLO-D3 82% ± 10.1.

## Quality control and assurance
- Contamination and carryover checks: blanks (solvent, matrix), and mobile phase blanks inserted every four samples.
- In-house QC materials: neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO from Sigma; sourced from different origins to avoid bias.
- External standards: traceable NIST-certified CLO and TMX standards analysed periodically (every 8–10 samples) to monitor retention times and instrument sensitivity.
- Blind analysis: samples analysed without treatment knowledge; confirmation of identities by comparing MRM transition ratios to standards.

## Data integrity and governance considerations
- Emphasizes traceability, comprehensive QA/QC, and auditable procedures to support robust monitoring outputs and data quality essential for framework-based decision-making.
