# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary

- Purpose and scope
  - Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) conducted alongside a large-scale neonicotinoid exposure experiment in the UK, Germany and Hungary.
  - Cross-country site setup with standardized nest labeling, sampling, monitoring, and data collection to assess exposure and impacts on wild pollinators.

- Field setup and labeling
  - 12 Bombus terrestris colonies per study site, arranged in central area as four multi-hives (each with three colonies) produced by Biobest.
  - Unique field labeling: each Bombus nest and trap nest given a CEH-provided number; multi-hives marked on outer and inner boxes.

- Bumblebee and Osmia measures
  - Osmia nesting: 2 wooden trap nests and Osmia release tin on 2 m high poles; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons placed per site; six uniform solitary bee trap nests along a field boundary (2 m poles, various hole sizes).
  - Nest placement: traps along field margins near tall vegetation, spaced roughly 20–25 m apart; orientation and mounting details provided; soil and water logistics included.

- Bombus multihives layout
  - Four multihives per field, nest entrances facing east or west, positioned 15–20 m apart (max ~60 m), set back 1–2 m from crop edge.
  - Colonies set up by Eurofins with pollen/biogluc on for 5 days post-setup; marked with field and multihive numbers.

- Weather station
  - One weather station per set of three fields, located away from crops and trees to maximize clearance; pyranometer earth connection; platform height ~1.5 m; orientation guidelines (north-facing open side).

- Visit 1: Setup
  - Set up margin nests, Osmia trap nests, Osmia cocoons, mud supply; install weather sensor/logger at one field in each main set.

- Visit 2 and Visit 3: Monitoring
  - Conditions for monitoring: ambient temperature ≥ 14°C and ≥ 50% sun.
  - Bee sampling and observations:
    - Bombus pollen samples: net foragers returning to multihives; collect 5–15 pollen loads within 15 minutes from 3 nests per multihive; label and preserve; wash equipment between fields.
    - Bombus colony weights: six hives weighed roughly every 7 days after crop exposure.
    - Pollinator transect: 30-minute observation along crop edge (100 m), recording all bee visits to flowers with as much taxonomic detail as feasible; optional capture for later identification.
    - Crop flowering stage: record as Yellow haze, All yellow, Green appearing, Green dominant.
  - Visit 3 repeats the same monitoring activities as Visit 2.

- Shutting up and sampling of bumblebee nests
  - Nests sampled in two waves: mid-May (end of OSR flowering) and mid-June (peak queen production).
  - Nests frozen at CEH Wallingford; collection timing per site to minimize disturbance; mid-May sample focused on largest filled Osmia tubes for the single Osmia nest.

- Mid-May Bumblebee sampling (CEH Wallingford)
  - Six colonies per site dissected for: colony weight, live worker counts, stored products (pollen, nectar, wax) for neonicotinoid residues, five workers for disease analysis, and long-term archiving of all individuals.
  - Queen cells counted if present; larvae collected and stored; note few queens expected at this stage.

- Mid-June Bumblebee sampling (CEH Wallingford)
  - Six colonies per site dissected for: weight, counts of live workers, queens, drones; stored products for residue analysis; larvae collected and archived; queen cells distinguished from workers.

- Solitary bee margin trap nests
  - Margin trap nests collected in two phases: mid-May/early June and September.
  - All trap nests from all countries returned to CEH Wallingford for processing to assess population metrics and exposure to neonicotinoids.

- Mid-May trap-nest sampling (O. bicornis focused)
  - Two of six nests per site dissected for O. bicornis cell counts, provisioned cell analysis, pollen/nectar residue in cells, and larval analysis; pollen colour noted for plant provenance; microscopy samples prepared.

- September trap-nest sampling
  - Remaining four nests collected; dissection and counting of cells; cocoons stored for forced diapause (cold ~4°C) to rear bees and parasitoids; identification of parasitoids and bees.

- Data, timing, and logistics
  - Sampling windows align with oilseed rape flowering for timing relevance across UK, Germany, and Hungary.
  - Overall timetable includes pallet delivery, OSR flowering onset, multiple monitoring visits, and scheduled retrievals for field edge nests.

- Relevance for GIS work
  - Precise spatial arrangement: nest locations, boundary traps, weather stations, and field margins are specified for mapping.
  - Data collection points include species counts, weights, transect observations, nest labelling, and sample provenance, enabling GIS-based visualization of spatial-temporal pollinator activity and exposure patterns.
  - Cross-country coordination requires standardized geolocation and metadata to enable integrated analyses across sites.
