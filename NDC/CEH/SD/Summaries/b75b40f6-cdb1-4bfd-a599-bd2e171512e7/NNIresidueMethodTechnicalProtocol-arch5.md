# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Purpose and scope
- Quantify neonicotinoid (TMX and CLO) concentrations in honeybee hive products: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax.
- Study conducted across the UK, Germany, and Hungary under the NERC CEH NEC05367 project.
- Analytical approach: LC-MS/MS with internal standards and rigorous QA/QC to ensure accuracy, precision, and traceability.

## Sample preparation and extraction
- Nectar and honey:
  - 0.1 g samples spiked with labelled internal standards (Thiamethoxam-D4, Clothianidin-D3, QMX).
  - Extraction with 50:50 methanol:water, vortex, centrifuge, collection of aqueous layer, dilution with water.
- Pollen and wax:
  - 0.1 g samples spiked with labelled internal standards (TMX-D4, CLO-D3, QMX).
  - Extraction with 80:20 hexane:isopropanol, heat bath at 45°C, iterative mixing, then addition of 50:50 methanol:water.
- Both matrices undergo cleanup using Oasis HLB SPE cartridges, conditioning with methanol and water; drying, hexane wash, drying; elution with acetonitrile; dryness and re-dissolution in 1 mL of mobile phase for LC-MS analysis.

## Instrumentation and analytical method
- Instrument: LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Scientific Quantum Ultra TSQ with ESI, controlled by Xcalibur.
- Column and conditions: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion (50 mm × 2 mm, 2.5 µm); gradient of 0.1% acetic acid in water (A) and 0.1% acetic acid in methanol (B).
- Gradient: start 95% A / 5% B, ramp to 50% B over 15 min, to 100% B in 5 min, return to 5% B, hold.
- Detection: SRM in positive mode; two characteristic fragments per analyte for quantification.
- Key MS settings: spray voltage ~3000 V; controlled temperatures for source and capillary; collision gas and parameters optimized for TMX and CLO.

## Calibration, quantification and performance
- Quantification approach: response factors relative to deuterated internal standards (TMX-D4 and CLO-D3).
- Calibration: linear 1/X weighted curves (R² > 0.99) using at least 5 standards; range from ND to 2.5 ng/mL.
- Performance metrics:
  - LOD: 0.4 ng/g; LOQ: 0.6 ng/g.
  - Expanded uncertainty: ~40%.
  - Recoveries (total procedure):
    - Nectar/Honey: TMX-D4 ~91.3% (±7.2), CLO-D3 ~89.7% (±7.2).
    - Pollen: TMX-D4 ~83.5% (±8.2), CLO-D3 ~82% (±10.1).

## Quality control and validation
- Use of deuterated internal standards alongside matrix-matched controls.
- Routine blanks:
  - Solvent blanks and matrix blanks to check for contamination in extraction/cleanup.
  - Mobile phase blanks every four samples to monitor carryover in LC-MS/MS.
- In-house QC material:
  - Neonicotinoid-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with known TMX and CLO (from Sigma) to produce QC samples from a different origin than calibration standards.
- Traceability and material checks:
  - Inclusion of a traceable NIST-certified standard (CLO and TMX, Spex) every 8–10 samples to monitor retention time and instrument sensitivity.
- Blind analysis and verification:
  - Samples analyzed blind to prevent treatment identification; identities confirmed by comparing MRM transition ratios between samples and pure standards.
  - Identities of detected neonicotinoids double-checked to ensure accuracy.

## Data, metadata and stewardship considerations
- Data provenance and traceability:
  - Detailed documentation of sample type, matrix, internal standards, calibration range, LOD/LOQ, recovery, and uncertainty.
  - Batch identifiers for extractions, cleanup, instrument run, and QC samples.
- Metadata to capture:
  - Analyte, matrix, treatment (if applicable), processing steps, instrumental conditions, digestion/extraction details, internal standards used, calibration curve parameters, and QC results.
- Data quality and reproducibility:
  - Regular QC checks (NIST standards, blanks, in-house QC) to ensure method performance over time.
  - Documentation of retention time stability and instrument sensitivity checks.
- Data storage and sharing:
  - Preserve raw MS data, processed results, and all method parameters to enable reproducibility and re-use in future datasets.
  - Clear reporting of QA/QC outcomes, uncertainties, and detection limits in any data releases.
