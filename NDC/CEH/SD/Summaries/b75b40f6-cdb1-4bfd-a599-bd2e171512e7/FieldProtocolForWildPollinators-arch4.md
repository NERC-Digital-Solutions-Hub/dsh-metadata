# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary
Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary

## Purpose and scope
- Large-scale, cross-country field experiment to quantify effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees.
- Additional field protocol for measuring impacts on wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) in the UK, Germany and Hungary.
- Companion to the main experiment study plans; provides detailed methods for wild pollinator sampling and data collection.

## Field setup and organisms
- Sites: UK, Germany, Hungary; within each study site:
  - 12 Bombus terrestris colonies placed centrally (central patch of cut crop or central headland).
  - Colonies organized as four multi-hives (each with three colonies) produced by Biobest.
- Nest labeling and tracking:
  - Each Bombus colony and trap nest uniquely numbered by CEH.
  - Multi-hives marked on inner and outer boxes.
- Wild pollinators:
  - Osmia trap nests: two wooden trap nests, release tin on a 2 m pole; four single trap nests on 2 m poles.
  - 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons per site placed in a release tin on a 2 m pole at field boundary.
  - Six uniform solitary bee trap nests along boundary with 2 m poles (varied hole sizes 4/6/8/10 mm).
  - Spacing and placement: along field margin, edge-oriented openings facing the field; posts driven 0.60 m into ground; nests set back from crop edge (min 1 m, preferably 2 m).
- Weather data collection:
  - Weather station per set of three fields; located away from crops; platform 1.5 m high; pyranometer earth reference wired to a red ring terminal on post.
  - Clear location guidelines and orientation (open area, north-facing platform side noted).

## Data collection components (labels, sampling, sensors)
- Unique identification and labeling:
  - Indelible labeling for nests and traps; field and nest IDs recorded for traceability.
- Biological sampling and samples:
  - Bumblebees (Bombus): five worker bees per nest sampled for disease analysis and stored at -80°C; sampling can be done with the nest in or out of the multihive.
  - Osmia and trap nests: collection of cocoons, larvae, and provisioned cells; pollen/nectar balls captured for residue and plant-source analyses.
  - Storage and sample handling: samples are stored at ambient temperature where specified or frozen; strict labeling and cross-field hygiene to minimize cross-contamination.
- Measurements and observations:
  - Bombus pollen load on returning workers (minimum 5, maximum 15 loads per 15 minutes from a set of 3 nests per multihive; samples kept separate per multihive).
  - Bombus colony weights: six hives weighed roughly every 7 days during field exposure.
  - Pollinator transects: 30-minute observation along crop edge (1 m into crop) documenting visits to flowers; various taxonomic resolution depending on expertise.
  - Crop flowering stage: recorded as Yellow haze, All yellow, Green appearing, Green dominant.
- Sampling and analyses timeline:
  - Mid-May: first sampling round for Bombus and osmia nests; dissection and residue sampling scheduled at CEH Wallingford later for some colonies.
  - Mid-June: second sampling round with emphasis on queen production; dissection and residue analyses conducted; collection kept for long-term archiving.
  - Solitary bee margins: two-phase collection (mid-May/early June and September) to assess population metrics and exposure; samples returned to CEH Wallingford for processing.

## Nests, bees, and specimen management
- Bombus nests:
  - Set up 4 multi-hives per field; nest entrances oriented east or west; spacing 15–20 m between multi-hives (max 60 m total); at least 1–2 m from crop edge.
  - Pollen and biogluc turned on initially; turned off 5 days after establishment or at OSR yellow haze stage.
- Osmia nests and cocoons:
  - Two wooden trap nests, Osmia release tin, four single trap nests; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons per site.
  - Placement aligns with field boundary margins near tall vegetation to attract Osmia.
- Data points from dissections and residue analyses:
  - For mid-May sampling: dissection of six colonies per site; collect workers for disease analysis; store pollen, nectar, wax for neonicotinoid residue analyses; count queen cells when present.
  - For mid-June sampling: similar dissection protocol including age/stage categorization of workers, queens/drones; residue sampling and long-term archiving.
  - For late-season (September) trap nests: complete rearing and sampling, parasitoid identification, and diapause simulation for cocoons to enable emergence and analysis.

## Timing, workflow, and timetable
- Overall timing aligned with oilseed rape (OSR) flowering and crop phenology:
  - Start date around early to mid-April; OSR flowering windows inform scheduling of visits and sampling rounds.
  - Visit 1: setup of margins nests, Osmia trap nests, and weather sensor.
  - Visit 2: ongoing monitoring including pollen sampling, hive weights, pollinator transects, and crop flowering stage assessments.
  - Visit 3: continued monitoring with similar procedures as Visit 2.
- Two major sampling rounds for Bombus and Osmia:
  - Mid-May: end of OSR flowering period; dissection and residue sampling planned for selected colonies.
  - Mid-June: peak reproductive period; extended sampling for broader metrics; includes queen production assessment.
- Solitary bee sampling:
  - Mid-May/early June: first rounding focusing on population metrics and residue exposure in O. bicornis.
  - September: second round focusing on population metrics, cocoons, and parasitoids.
- Retrieval and processing windows:
  - Field edge trap nests retrieved in September (two waves) for processing and identification of parasites and species.

## Data management and governance (conceptual)
- Data traceability:
  - Unique IDs for all nests, hives, traps, and field locations; linkage across field notes, sampling events, and laboratory analyses.
- Metadata and storage:
  - Samples and samples metadata stored and tracked with CEH’s central handling; materials require controlled temperatures during transport (e.g., -80°C for some samples).
- Quality control considerations:
  - Standardized labeling, cross-field contamination minimization during pollen handling (ethanol wash between fields), and consistent measurement protocols for weights, pollen loads, and transects.
- Cross-site coordination:
  - Central coordination for field setup, nest labeling, sample collection, and CEH Wallingford processing for dissection and residue analyses.
