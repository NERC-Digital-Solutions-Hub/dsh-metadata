# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

- Purpose of the document: Field protocol outlining additional measures of wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis) across UK, Germany and Hungary as part of the neonicotinoid impact study (Version 2.0, 01 Mar 2015).
- Scope of work: Setup, sampling, monitoring and lab analyses to quantify pollinator exposure and effects, including data collection on colonies, nests, trap nests, weather, flower phenology, and residue analyses.

## Data assets, identifiers and provenance

- Site and field structure
  - Per site: 12 Bombus terrestris colonies arranged as four multihives (three colonies each).
  - Unique identifiers: field/site IDs, multihive numbers (1–4), outer/inner nest labeling, CEH-provided unique numbers for Bombus nests.
- Solitary/pollinator nests
  - Osmia sampling: wooden trap nests, Osmia release tin, 2-m high poles; six uniform 2-m trap nests along field margins; trap nest internals with drilled holes (4, 6, 8, 10 mm).
  - Margin traps and Osmia cocoons: 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons per site, with relocation and release setup.
- Additional instruments
  - Weather stations: one per field set; level platform, pyranometer, orientation notes (north), earth reference wiring details.
- Data collection events and samples
  - Visit 1 (setup): margin nests, Osmia setups, weather logger installation.
  - Visit 2 (monitoring): pollen samples from Bombus, hive weights, pollinator transect, crop flowering stage; sampling protocols and avoidance of cross-field contamination noted.
  - Visit 3 (monitoring): repeat monitoring as above.
  - Sampling rounds (lab analyses): mid-May and mid-June for Bombus and Osmia; September for late-stage trap nests.
- Biological samples and measurements
  - Bombus: pollen load from returning workers; colony weights; transect observations; crop flowering staging.
  - Osmia: trap nest dissections, provisioning cells, pollen/nectar residue samples, larval samples for residue/disease analyses; microscopy samples for plant-identification of provisioning pollen.
  - Solitary bees: two-phase sampling (mid-May and September) for O. bicornis cells, residues, and parasitoids.
- Lab analyses and storage
  - Residue analyses of pollen, nectar, and wax (neonicotinoids).
  - Disease analyses on selected workers.
  - Long-term archiving: all individual samples preserved; larvae stored; cocoons stored for rearing in September.

## Data collection, workflow and formats

- Data captured at multiple levels
  - Field/site metadata: site ID, field ID, field location, crop type, OSR flowering stage windows.
  - Nest and nest-related data: nest ID, multihive ID, nest position, sampling round, date, sampling method.
  - Sample details: pollen loads, weights (hive), transect observations, color/volume of provisioning pollen, number of cells, larval counts.
  - Biological counts and measurements: counts of live workers and casts, queen cells, drones, and stored products; number of provisioned cells per hole; nectar, pollen, wax masses for residue analysis.
  - Lab results: neonicotinoid residue levels, disease markers, microscopy identifications, parasitoid identifications.
- Data quality and handling
  - Standardized labeling and unique IDs to ensure traceability across sites and sampling rounds.
  - Ethanol and cleaning steps between fields to minimize cross-field contamination during pollen handling.
  - Regular weights and counts performed to nearest gram or specified unit; consistent recording templates.
- Data flow and storage
  - Field data and samples collected on-site and coordinated for transfer to CEH Wallingford for processing.
  - Specimens stored under specified temperatures and archival conditions; data and metadata documented for long-term accessibility.
  - Documentation referenced via instruction sheets and site-specific notes; overarching study plan remains in the main experiment documentation.

## Data governance, standards, and metadata

- Data standards and interoperability
  - Use of consistent identifiers (site, field, multihive, nest; Osmia nest IDs; trap nest hole counts) to enable cross-site comparisons.
  - Uniform measurement methods (pollination metrics, weights, counts, transects) to support comparability across countries.
- Metadata and provenance
  - Capture of sampling dates, environmental conditions, equipment configurations, and lab processing steps to maintain data provenance.
  - Clear labeling for each sample (field number, multihive/nest number) to ensure traceability back to field context.
- Data sharing and archiving
  - Data and specimens routed to CEH Wallingford for centralized processing and long-term storage/archiving.
  - Documentation and versioning aligned with university/research network practices; see main experiment study plans for full rationale and governance.

## Quality assurance, risks and mitigations

- QA measures
  - Rigorous labeling scheme to prevent misidentification across nests, fields, and sampling rounds.
  - Standardized procedures for pollen handling, dissection, and residue analysis; avoidance of cross-contamination between fields.
  - Regular calibration and verification of scales and measurement instruments; consistent data entry formats.
- Potential challenges
  - Incomplete user needs or gaps in data due to timing constraints or field access.
  - Variability in data formats across participating countries; reliance on centralized processing to harmonize outputs.
  - Large, heterogeneous datasets requiring robust metadata and version control.

## Timeframe and lifecycle

- Overall timeline highlights
  - Early setup: field pallets and OSR flowering windows; nominal start around April 13–20.
  - Monitoring windows: visits and sample rounds spread from April through June, with a mid-May sampling phase and a mid-June phase aligned with oilseed rape flowering and peak exposure.
  - Key sampling rounds: mid-May (largest provisioning activity), mid-June (queen production focus), September (full development/rearing phase).
  - Retrieval: field edge trap nests retrieved in early to mid-September.
- Scheduling notes
  - OSR flowering timing assumed similar across UK, Germany, Hungary with minor country-to-country variation; site-specific start dates are captured in the protocol timetable.

## Practical considerations for data stewards

- Ensure robust data dictionaries and field data capture templates are in place to cover:
  - All identifiers (site, field, nest, multihive, trap nest, Osmia cocoon release tubes).
  - All measurement types (weights, counts, pollen loads, cell provisioning, sample masses, residue concentrations).
  - All lab processes and processing steps to maintain provenance.
- Establish data governance plan with:
  - Clear data submission timelines to CEH Wallingford.
  - Metadata standards, versioning, and archiving procedures.
  - Documentation of QA steps and contamination prevention measures.
- Plan for cross-country data harmonization to accommodate multiple systems and formats, ensuring full discoverability and reuse by other researchers.
