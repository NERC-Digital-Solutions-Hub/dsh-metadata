# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary Version 2.0 01 Mar 2015 Mike Edwards, Ben Woodcock, Richard Pywell See current version of the main experiment study plans for full details of the rationale and experimental design

## Overview
- Supplements the main neonicotinoid field experiment with standardized measures of wild pollinators across UK, Germany, and Hungary.
- Aims to quantify exposure and potential effects on wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) alongside honeybee results.
- Emphasizes cross-country comparability, data standardisation, and integration with central data management (CEH).

## Field setup and equipment
- Study sites include 12 Bombus terrestris colonies per site, organized as four multi-hives (three colonies each) supplied by Biobest.
- Nests and traps labeled with unique identifiers; nested Bombus multihives tracked.
- Osmia provisioning includes wooden trap nests, release tins, 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons per site, and six solitary bee trap nests mounted along field boundaries.
- Equipment placement:
  - Osmia nests positioned along field margins, near trees/shrubs, at 20–25 m intervals.
  - Bombus multi-hives placed 15–20 m apart, oriented with entrances east or west, away from crop edges.
  - Weather station deployed in open, clear of crops, with the pyranometer earth reference properly wired.
- Data management: site maps, field numbers, and nest identifiers documented; field data linked to CEH records.

## Data collection protocols

### Visit 1 – Set up
- Establish margin nests, set up Osmia nests and cocoons, and install weather sensor/logger at designated field.

### Visit 2 – Monitoring (minimum 14°C and 50% sun)
- Bombus pollen samples: capture returning workers, extract pollen loads from legs into labeled tubes (minimum 5, maximum 15 loads per 15 minutes from a set of 3 nests per multihive; separate samples for each multihive).
- Bombus colony weights: six hives weighed roughly every 7 days during field exposure.
- Pollinator transect: 30-minute observation within the flowering crop along the same edge as trap nests; identify visits to crop flowers to the highest feasible taxonomic resolution without capturing bees (1 m into crop; 100 m transect).
- Crop flowering stage: record as Yellow haze, All yellow, Green appearing, Green dominant.

### Visit 3 – Monitoring (as Visit 2)
- Repeat pollen sampling, colony weighing, transects, and flowering stage assessments.

## Shutting up and sampling timing
- Bumblebee nests and Osmia trap nests shut down on timing aligned with oilseed rape phenology and queen production cycles (mid-May and mid-June).
- Freezing and storage timing coordinated; sampling performed the morning after shutdown.

## Species- and sample-specific sampling protocols

### Bombus terrestris (mid-May and mid-June rounds)
- Mid-May: collect six colonies per site; assess stored products and perform dissections to quantify workers, queens, and brood; collect samples for neonicotinoid residue analysis (pollen, nectar, wax) and disease analysis.
- Mid-June: similar dissections and residue sampling; record reproductive status (queen cells) and include all workers and casts; archive samples for long-term study.

### Osmia bicornis and margin nests
- Mid-May (first round): break apart trap nests to count occupied drilled holes, provisioned cells, and collect a subset of pollen/nectar for residue analysis; collect pollen color data to infer plant sources; larvae counted and stored for residue/disease analyses.
- September (second round): collect remaining nests, rear to cocoons, and identify parasitoids; count occupied holes and provisioned cells; store cocoons for controlled diapause and emergence.

### Solitary bee margin nests (Osmia and related)
- Two-phase sampling: mid-May/early June focuses on occupancy, provisioning details, and residue analysis; September focuses on population-level assessments via rearing and identification of emerging individuals and parasitoids.

## Data outputs and management
- Standardised datasets across sites include:
  - Nest occupancy, brood counts, and colony health indicators.
  - Pollen load measurements and foraging activity.
  - Colony weights and growth metrics.
  - Stored products (pollen, nectar, wax) and associated neonicotinoid residues.
  - Cell counts, provisioning details, and species/parasitoid identifications.
  - Flowering stage and crop phenology linked to sampling events.
- Data labeling, storage, and archiving procedures align with CEH requirements to facilitate data sharing and long-term accessibility for analysis and policy evaluation.

## Timetable and coordination
- Overall timetable covers March to September, with key field activities phasing around oilseed rape (OSR) flowering and peak exposure periods.
- Start around mid-April for field work, with successive visits and sampling months (May, June) and retrieval/processing in September.
- Cross-country coordination via standardized templates, equipment, and data handling to enable comparative analyses.

## Data accessibility and use
- Protocol designed to enable access to underlying datasets for broader analysis, supporting assessment of environmental health and policy performance in agriculture and pollinator conservation.
- Outputs intended to integrate with main experiment plans to build a comprehensive environmental monitoring evidence base.
