# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary Version 2.0 01 Mar 2015 Mike Edwards, Ben Woodcock, Richard Pywell See current version of the main experiment study plans for full details of the rationale and experimental design

## Overview
- Purpose: quantify effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees and add parallel measures for wild pollinators.
- Scope: field apps across the UK, Germany and Hungary with standardized cross-country procedures.
- Subjects: Bombus terrestris (bumblebees) and Osmia bicornis (solitary bees) plus associated trap nests.
- Main data objective: obtain robust, comparable datasets on pollinator activity, colony health, breeding, disease, and neonicotinoid residues to inform risk assessment.

## Field Setup and Sampling Design
- Bombus terrestris colonies per site: 12 in total, arranged as four multi-hives (each with three colonies) sourced from Biobest.
- Nest labeling: each Bombus colony and trap nest uniquely numbered; multi-hives marked on inner/outer boxes.
- Osmia provisioning: two wooden trap nests and an Osmia release tin on a 2 m high pole; four single trap nests on 2 m poles; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons per site.
- Additional solitary bee traps: six uniform margin nests (11×11×28 cm blocks with variable hole sizes) placed along a field boundary.
- Placement strategy: nests along field margins and edges to follow landscape features; weather/field equipment placed away from crop canopies for unobstructed measurements.
- Field equipment: weather station per set of three fields; pyranometer platform mounted 1.5 m above ground, oriented with platform edge facing north.

## Data Collection and Measurements

### Bumblebees (Bombus terrestris)
- Disease sampling: five worker bees per nest collected and immediately frozen (min -18°C; dry ice) for disease assays.
- Pollen tracking: pollen samples collected from returning workers at Bombus multihives; target 5–15 pollen loads across four multihives per field (from three nests in each multihive); samples kept separate by multihive.
- Colony weights: six hives weighed approximately every 7 days during field exposure.
- Pollinator transect: 30-minute observational transect within the flowering crop, recording visits to flowers by bees with as high taxonomic resolution as feasible; transect runs along field edge at 100 m, looking 1 m into the crop.
- Crop phenology: recording crop flowering stage as Yellow haze, All yellow, Green appearing, Green dominant.
- Mid- and late-season sampling (dissection and residue): mid-May and mid-June rounds where six colonies per site are transported to CEH Wallingford for:
  - Dissection: colony weight, total live workers, other casts; sample 5 workers for disease analysis; archive all individuals.
  - Residue analysis: samples from stored products (pollen, nectar, wax) and larvae for neonicotinoid residue analysis.
  - Queen cells: counts if present; larvae and cells counted and staged.
  - All samples stored for long-term archiving.

### Osmia and solitary bees
- Osmia sampling: mid-May focus on trap nests with the largest number of filled tubes; two round sampling across early and late season.
- Mid-May procedure: broken apart trap nests to count O. bicornis cells, provisioned cells, and pollen/nectar balls; collect ~1–1.5 g of stored product from cells for neonicotinoid residue analysis; collect pure pollen for microscopy to identify forage plants; count larvae.
- September sampling: remaining trap nests collected for dissection and counting; cocoons identified and prepared for emergence; parasitoids and bees collected.
- Breeding population metrics: occupancy of drilled holes, number of provisioned cells per hole, pollen/nectar ball colors, and larval counts documented to assess exposure and breeding success.
- Residue and microscopy: pollen/nectar residues analyzed for neonicotinoids; pollen used for plant-source identification via microscopy.

### Margin/trap nests for solitary bees
- Two-phase collection (mid-May/early June and September) to assess exposure and population dynamics across years.
- Mid-May collection: two of six nests per site dissected; count occupied holes, provisioned cells, collect larvae and pollen for microscopy, and collect pollen/nectar residues for neonicotinoid analysis.
- September collection: remaining nests collected; cocoons reared, forced diapause simulated for winter; emergence data collected; parasitoids and bees identified.

## Data Processing and Archiving
- Centralized processing at CEH Wallingford for dissection, residue analysis, and disease testing; standardized protocols across countries.
- Comprehensive metadata and documentation to enable cross-country comparability; datasets intended to be discoverable and usable via data portals.
- Emphasis on traceability: labeling, sample tracking, and field notes used to link measurements to specific nests, multihives, and field sites.

## Timing, Scheduling, and Logistics
- Overall timetable aligned with oilseed rape (OSR) flowering and field schedules across all three countries.
- Key milestones include:
  - Pallets delivered to sites in March; field start around OSR flowering in April.
  - Visit 1: setup activities (nests, Osmia, weather sensors).
  - Visit 2: ongoing monitoring (pollinator visits, pollen loads, weights, transects, crop phenology).
  - Sampling rounds: mid-May and mid-June for Bombus; corresponding Osmia/nest sampling coordinated with crop stages.
  - September: retrieval of trap nests and late-season sampling.
- Explicit field-date framework provided to synchronize across sites and countries.

## Key Considerations for Analysis
- Cross-country comparability achieved via standardized field setup, labeling, and sampling protocols.
- Data challenges anticipated include managing multiple data streams (behavioral counts, physiological measures, residue analyses, and molecular/disease data) and harmonizing formats across sites.
- Data quality relies on robust metadata, careful sample handling (e.g., strict freezing protocols, avoidance of cross-field contamination during pollen handling), and consistent timing across fields.
- The protocol anticipates eventual data integration into centralized data portals with rich metadata to support reproducibility and downstream analyses of NNI effects on both honeybees and wild pollinators.
