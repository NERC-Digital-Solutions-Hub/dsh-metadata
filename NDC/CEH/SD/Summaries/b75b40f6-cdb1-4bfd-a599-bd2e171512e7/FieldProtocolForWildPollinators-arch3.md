# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary Version 2.0 01 Mar 2015 Mike Edwards, Ben Woodcock, Richard Pywell See current version of the main experiment study plans for full details of the rationale and experimental design

## Purpose and scope
- Field protocol to quantify effects of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees and to implement additional measures for wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) across the UK, Germany and Hungary.
- Supplements main experiment with standardized methods to assess pollinator health, exposure, and ecological responses.

## Field setup and target pollinators
- Field sites use 12 Bombus terrestris colonies per site (arranged as four multi-hives of three colonies).
- Osmia bicornis monitoring using wooden trap nests, release tins, and solitary bee trap nests along field margins.
- A weather station (one per set of three fields) installed near the bee nests to capture environmental context.

## Nest labeling and initial handling
- Each Bombus nest and trap nest uniquely labeled with CEH-provided IDs.
- Clear documentation and traceability for all nests and samples.

## Sampling and data collection procedures
- Disease and health sampling of Bombus: sampling five worker bees per nest, immediate freezing, careful handling to avoid nesting disruption.
- Osmia sampling: use trap nests, release tins, and standardized margins for nest placement; specified spacing and orientation relative to field features.
- Field-to-lab workflow: samples collected and stored for subsequent dissection, residue analysis, and disease testing at CEH Wallingford.
- Weather data: pyranometer-equipped platforms with standardized mounting and orientation; regular calibration and adjustment as needed.

## Visits and monitoring cadence
- Visit 1 (Set up): establish margin nests, Osmia trap nests, cocoons, mud supply, and weather sensor/logger placement.
- Visit 2 (Monitoring): conduct multiple measurements under conditions of minimum ambient temperature 14°C and at least 50% sun.
  - Bombus pollen load sampling from returning foragers (target 5–15 loads per 15 minutes from a set of 3 nests within a multi-hive).
  - Bombus colony weights (selected hives weighed roughly every 7 days during field exposure).
  - Pollinator transect: 30-minute observational survey within the flowering crop, documenting visits at high taxonomic resolution.
  - Crop flowering stage: record as yellow haze, all yellow, green appearing, green dominant.
- Visit 3 (Monitoring): repeat monitoring as specified in Visit 2.
- Timing aligns OSR flowering across sites with ongoing field work, beginning mid-April to early May.

## Mid-season sampling rounds and analyses
- Mid-May B. terrestris sampling: return colonies to CEH Wallingford for:
  - Dissection and counts of workers and other casts.
  - Removal and freezing of stored products for neonicotinoid residue analysis (pollen, nectar, wax).
  - Queen cell identification and counting; collection of larvae and stored products.
  - Weighing and recording of colonies; sampling for disease analysis and long-term archiving.
- Mid-June B. terrestris sampling: similar dissection, weighing, and residue analyses focused on breeding and reproductive stages; emphasis on queen cell status and residue storage.
- Data outputs include colony weight, live worker counts, stored products, larval samples, and clone-specific residue analyses.

## Solitary bee margin nest sampling (Osmia bicornis)
- Two sampling rounds: mid-May/early June and September.
- Mid-May: dissect and count occupied drilled holes, provisioned cells, and collect a sample of nectar/pollen for neonicotinoid residue analysis; pollen for microscopy to identify forage plants; collect and store larvae for residue and disease analyses.
- September: collect remaining nests, count occupied cells, rear cocoons for emergence, and identify parasitoids and bees; all specimens stored for later analysis.
- Purpose: quantify breeding population size, provisioning behavior, residue exposure, and parasitism rates.

## Data, governance, and data handling considerations
- Standardized labeling, location mapping, and field documentation to ensure traceability across sites and species.
- Samples are processed with predefined protocols to support transparent disease, residue, and population analyses.
- Data are intended for archiving and later analysis, with emphasis on quality control (weighing, dissection, residue testing, and microscopy).
- The protocol implies data sharing through CEH Wallingford processing and integration into broader project outputs (reports, dashboards, or policy-relevant summaries).

## Overall timetable and logistics
- Start around mid-April with OSR flowering; field pallets delivered in March.
- Week-by-week schedule for setup, monitoring, and collection windows from April through September.
- Retrieval of field edge trap nests planned for September; subsequent processing and analysis at CEH Wallingford.

## Policy-relevance and monitoring considerations
- Provides a structured framework to monitor pollinator health and exposure to neonicotinoids in real-world, multi-country agricultural contexts.
- Supports evidence-based decision-making on pesticide use, pollinator conservation strategies, and agricultural landscape management.
- Emphasizes integration of ecological metrics (pollinator activity, breeding success, disease status) with chemical residue data to inform environmental health assessments.
