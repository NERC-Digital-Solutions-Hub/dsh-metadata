# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary

## Overview
- Study aims to quantify how neonicotinoid seed dressings affect honeybees across the UK, Germany, and Hungary.
- Focuses on measuring neonicotinoid concentrations in hive products (nectar, honey, wax, pollen) to assess exposure.

## Sample collection and preparation
- Matrixes analyzed: nectar, honey, pollen, and wax.
- Nectar and honey: 0.1 g wet samples spiked with labelled internal standards; extraction with 50:50 methanol–water, vortexing, centrifugation, and careful transfer of the aqueous layer.
- Pollen and wax: 0.1 g wet samples spiked with labelled internal standards; extraction using hexane/isopropanol followed by methanol–water, vortexing, and centrifugation.
- Cleanup: extracts cleaned using Oasis HLB SPE cartridges; conditioning with methanol and water; drying, hexane rinse, and re-drying.
- Re-dissolution: dried extracts re-dissolved in 1 mL of mobile phase for LC-MS/MS analysis.

## Instrumental analysis (LC-MS/MS)
- Instrumentation: LC-MS/MS using a triple quadrupole with ESI (positive mode) and Xcalibur software.
- Column and mobile phase: Phenomenex Synergi Fusion column; gradient of water with 0.1% acetic acid (A) and methanol with 0.1% acetic acid (B); initial 95% A to 50% B, then to 100% B, then back to 5% B with re-equilibration.
- Detection: SRM mode monitoring two characteristic fragments for each neonicotinoid; native-to-deuterated internal standards used for quantification.
- Parameters: spray voltage 3000 V; desolvation conditions optimized; argon as collision gas; nitrogen as desolvation gas.
- Quantification: response factors of neonicotinoids to their internal standards; linear calibration curves with 1/X weighting; at least five standards; linearity reported with R^2 > 0.99.

## Calibration, quantification and uncertainty
- Calibration: linear between non-detectable (ND) and 2.5 ng/mL; use of internal standards for each analyte.
- Uncertainty: method expanded uncertainty reported at 40%.
- Detection/quantification: LOD 0.4 ng/g; LOQ 0.6 ng/g for the entire procedure.

## Method performance (recovery and quality control)
- Recoveries (total procedure):
  - Nectar/honey: TMX 91.3% ± 7.2; CLO 89.7% ± 7.2.
  - Pollen: TMX 83.5% ± 8.2; CLO 82% ± 10.1.
- Quality control and assurance:
  - Use of blanks (solvent, matrix-matched) and mobile phase blanks every four samples to monitor contamination and carryover.
  - In-house QC using NN-free honey, pollen, and wax spiked with native TMX and CLO; QC standards from a different origin than calibration standards.
  - Traceable NIST-certified standards (CLO and TMX) analyzed periodically (every 8–10 samples) to check retention times and instrument sensitivity.
  - Samples analyzed blind; identification and quantification double-checked.
  - Data processing and peak integration performed with ICIS algorithm in Xcalibur.
  - Calibration and instrument checks included to ensure accuracy and consistency across batches.

## Data integrity and workflow
- Traceability: strict tracking of samples, standards, and QC materials; aim to keep datasets discoverable with associated metadata.
- Verification: identities of detected neonicotinoids confirmed by comparing transition ratios to pure standards.
- Analytical workflow designed to minimize bias through blind analysis and repeated QC checks.
