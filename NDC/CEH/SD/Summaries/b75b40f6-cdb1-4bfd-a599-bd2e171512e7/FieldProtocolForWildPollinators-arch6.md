# A large-scale field experiment to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid (NNI) seed dressings on honeybees in the UK, Germany and Hungary Field protocol for additional measures of wild pollinators ( Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis ) in UK, Germany and Hungary

- Purpose and scope
  - Large-scale field experiment across the UK, Germany, and Hungary to quantify the impacts of neonicotinoid seed dressings on honeybees.
  - Adds measures of wild pollinators (Bombus terrestris and Osmia bicornis) with a detailed field protocol.
  - Supports data collection, standardization, and downstream analysis for cross-country comparison.

- Field setup and organisms
  - Each study site houses 12 Bombus terrestris colonies arranged in central locations as four multihives (each with three colonies).
  - Bombus multihives are labeled with unique CEH-issued codes on both outer and inner boxes.
  - Disease sampling of bumblebees: 5 workers per nest sampled and deep-frozen (min -18°C) for later analysis.
  - Osmia sampling: two wooden trap nests and Osmia release tin; 50 Osmia bicornis cocoons placed per site; six solitary trap nests along a field boundary.
  - Nest placement: margins along field boundaries, with precise spacing and orientation guidelines to optimize detection and minimize disturbance.
  - Weather data: a weather station per set of three fields, with carefully positioned pyranometer and level sensor platforms; data logged to support environmental covariates.

- Setup and equipment details (Visit 1)
  - Set up margin nests and Osmia trap nests; place Osmia cocoons and mud supplies.
  - Install weather sensor/logger at one field per main set.
  - Detailed layout instructions to ensure firm mounting, correct orientation, and field boundary positioning.

- Monitoring protocol (Visit 2 and Visit 3)
  - Temperature and light thresholds for monitoring visits (minimum ambient temperature 14°C and 50% sun).
  - Bombus pollen sampling: net returns and pollen extraction from the legs; target 5–15 pollen loads from 3 nests within a multihive; strict labeling and contamination controls.
  - Bombus colony weights: six hives weighed approximately every 7 days following field exposure.
  - Pollinator transect: 30-minute observational transect within flowering crop to record visits by bees, with high taxonomic resolution.
  - Crop flowering stage records: yellow haze, all yellow, green appearing, green dominant, to contextualize foraging and exposure.
  - Additional data collection options: choice of classification and sampling methods (field- or lab-based) depending on experience and throughput.

- Shutting up and sampling schedule (Mid-May and Mid-June)
  - Bumblebee nests and Osmia trap nests shut down for sampling the evening before collection; timing site-specific and coordinated with field conditions.
  - Mid-May sampling (peak OSR exposure): dissection and analysis at CEH Wallingford
    - Six colonies per site dissected for workers, stored products (pollen, nectar, wax) for neonicotinoid residue analysis, and disease analysis.
    - Colony metrics: weight, live workers counts, presence of other castes; five workers collected for disease; stored products and larvae collected for residue analyses; queen cells counted if present.
  - Mid-June sampling (maximum reproductive output): similar dissection and analysis with emphasis on reproductive stages.
    - Counts of workers and reproductive stages, archived samples of stored products, residues (pollen, nectar, wax), five larvae for residue analysis, and parasitoid/allocation data.
  - Distinctions between worker and queen/drones recorded; queen excluders enforced to prevent escape during sampling.

- Solitary bee margin trap nests (two-phase collection)
  - Mid-May: two of six trap nests per site dissected to count O. bicornis occupied cells, provisioned cell counts, and color-coded pollen/nectar provisioning balls for residue and microscopy analyses; larvae counted and stored for residue/disease analysis.
  - September: remaining four trap nests collected for processing; cocoons reared to assess emergence, with targeted identification of parasitoids and bees.
  - Procedural notes emphasize specimen handling to minimize disturbance and to preserve residue/disease integrity.

- Data quality, provenance, and handling considerations
  - Unique site and nest labeling (CEH codes) to ensure traceability across study components.
  - Rigorous sample handling: deep-freezing, ethanol-based cleaning between fields, and meticulous labeling to prevent cross-field contamination.
  - Comprehensive data capture across multiple taxa (Bombus terrestris, Osmia bicornis, solitary bees), life stages, and environmental conditions.
  - Centralized sample processing and archiving at CEH Wallingford for dissection, residue analysis (neonicotinoids in pollen/nectar/wax), disease analysis, and parasitoid identification.
  - Data products expected include colony metrics (weights, counts), pollen loads, transect observations, nest cell counts, residue profiles, and emerging parasitoid/disease patterns.

- Timetable and sequencing
  - Detailed start dates aligned with oilseed rape flowering and OSR phenology, with staggered fieldwork across Weeks 1–10 and retrievals planned for September.
  - Coordinated delivery and setup of field materials, with explicit milestones for monitoring visits, collection rounds, and sample returns.

- Key data outputs and potential analyses
  - For Bombus: pollen load metrics, colony weights over time, visit counts, and exposure-linked health and disease indicators.
  - For Osmia and solitary bees: nest occupancy, provisioning patterns, cell counts, residue profiles, and emergence/parasitism data.
  - Integration of biological data with environmental measurements (weather/pyranometer data) to model exposure, foraging behavior, and population-level responses to NNIs.
  - Outputs suitable for dashboards and self-serve data exploration, enabling cross-site and cross-country comparisons of pollinator health and exposure dynamics.
