# Morphology phenotype data of 88 types of galls induced on oak trees by cynipid gallwasps from 6 sites in Hungary, 2000-2003: Supporting information

## Overview
- Dataset of quantitative and categorical phenotype scores for 88 gall types induced on oak trees (Quercus spp.) by cynipid gallwasps (Cynipidae: Cynipini).
- Collected from 6 sites in Hungary (samples gathered 2000–2003; mature galls measured using digital calipers).
- Includes separate phenotypes for sexual and asexual generations; 31 sexual generation galls and 58 asexual generation galls across 69 cynipid species.
- Aims to document internal and external gall structure and properties that may relate to defense against natural enemies.

## Data scope and collection
- For each gall type, 10 individual galls were sampled across sites 1–5 (and related map vicinity) during 2000–2003.
- Phenotypic properties capture the mature gall’s external and internal structure.
- Measurements include categorical, ordinal, and continuous variables; continuous measurements are in millimeters (mm) or cubic millimeters (mm³).
- 17 data columns cover a mix of binary, ordinal, and continuous traits.

## Data structure and variables (17 columns)
1. Linnean species name
2. Generation (Asexual or Sexual)
3. Hair — binary: hairy (1) or not (0)
4. Dense_spines — binary: dense coating of fine spines (<1 mm) (1) or not (0)
5. Sparse_spines — binary: sparse coating of larger spines (>1 mm) (1) or not (0)
6. Sticky — binary: coating of sticky resin (1) or not (0)
7. Space — binary: internal air space (1) or not (0)
8. Dummy — binary: decoy/dummy inner chamber (1) or not (0)
9. Peduncle — binary: connected by a peduncle (1) or not (0)
10. Nectar — binary: secreting sugar-rich nectar on surface (1) or not (0)
11. Dehisce — binary: dehiscing (falling) at maturity (1) or not (0)
12. Tough — ordinal: hardness with 4 levels (1 softest to 4 hardest); some missing values
13. Shape — categorical: cone, cylinder, or sphere
14. Radius — continuous (mm): radius (or base radius for cones)
15. Height — continuous (mm): height for cones/cylinders; not applicable for spheres
16. Gall_Size — continuous (mm³): volume assuming the Shape category
17. Locularity — categorical: Unilocular (single chamber) or Multilocular (multiple chambers)

- Values -999 indicate missing data for species/generation where data are unavailable.
- Data are organized with separate rows for each cynipid species and generation, focusing on the mature gall.

## Quality control and validation
- Gall maturity confirmed by presence of fully mature larval/pupal in larval chambers.
- Tough scores validated with continuous penetration measurements (QTS-25 texture analyser); details not shown.
- Gall identifications based on diagnostic external gall phenotypes by experienced staff; some identifications confirmed via DNA barcoding (partial mitochondrial cytochrome b and nuclear ITS2) when needed.
- Data extensively checked for errors to ensure reliability.

## Data use and relevance for environmental monitoring
- Structured to enable standardized analysis of gall morphology and potential defense traits across species and generations.
- Facilitates comparative analyses and integration with other ecological datasets to monitor environmental influences on host-plant–insect interactions.
- Demonstrates practices for data quality assurance, species verification, and documentation to support data reuse and transparency.
- Highlights considerations for data sharing and enabling access to underlying data to maximize dataset value.
