# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

## Overview
- Inshore surface water temperature dataset for Windermere, UK, presented for 1944–2002 (data collection began in 1933).
- Collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) and later by CEH and its predecessor IFE, with a later return to FBA.
- Part of a data series used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist to study climate-change effects on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems.
- Metadata and related datasets are available through the CEH data portal.

## Dataset Details
- Format: CSV (comma-separated values)
- Size: 24 kb
- Columns:
  - TEMP: Annual mean surface temperature of the lake (°C)
  - YEAR: Year corresponding to the annual temperature
- Sampling site: Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
  - Approximate grid reference: SD393960 (OS Grid)
  - Coordinates (WGS84): 54.360193, -2.935836
- Sampling regime: Inshore surface temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis from 1933 to present; presented data cover 1944–2002
- Collection cadence: Near daily measurements, around 09:00 h

## Collection Methods & Analytical Methods
- Measurement method: Handheld mercury thermometer with 0.1°C accuracy
- Frequency: Near daily readings; annual means calculated from daily records
- Data quality considerations: Measurements were cross-checked by two individuals

## Provenance, Quality Control & Publications
- Data provenance: Collected by FBA; later by CEH and IFE; subsequently by FBA
- Quality control: Two-person verification of measurements
- Key references:
