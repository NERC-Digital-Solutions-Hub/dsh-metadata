# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

## Overview
- Inshore surface water temperature dataset for Windermere Lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
- Presented for 1944–2002 (collection began in 1933); part of the data used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist on climate change effects in freshwater ecosystems.
- Data lineage: originally collected by the Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), then by CEH and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003), and subsequently by FBA.

## Sampling design and methods
- Location: Inshore near the middle of the lake’s long axis; ongoing series from 1933 onward.
- Collection method: Inshore surface temperature recorded with a handheld mercury thermometer at approximately 09:00 h, near-daily intervals.
- Measurement accuracy: ±0.1 °C
- Data processing: Daily records converted to annual means as described in Winfield et al. (2008)

## Data quality and processing
- Quality control: Measurements checked by two individuals.
- Reference for methodology and interpretation: Winfield, Fletcher, and James (2008) on Windermere fish populations and climate-related trends.

## Usage and provenance
- Primary use: Baseline environmental temperature data for climate-related ecological studies; supports trait-based analyses of freshwater predators (e.g., context for Vindenes et al. 2013).
- Data availability and governance: Metadata and related datasets are published and linked; data contributors and institutions include FBA and CEH, with documented provenance and sampling details.
