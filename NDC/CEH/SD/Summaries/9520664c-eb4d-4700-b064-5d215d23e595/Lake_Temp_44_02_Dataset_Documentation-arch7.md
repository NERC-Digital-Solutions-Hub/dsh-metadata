# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

- Overview
  - Inshore surface water temperature (°C) data for Windermere, UK, covering 1944–2002 (data collection began in 1933).
  - Part of the dataset used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist (Effects of climate change on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems).
  - Historical data stewardship: Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) → CEH and predecessor IFE (1989–2003) → FBA again.

- Data content
  - Format: CSV (comma separated values).
  - Columns:
    - TEMP: Annual mean surface temperature of the lake (°C).
    - YEAR: Year to which the annual temperature pertains.
