# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

- Overview
  - Inshore surface water temperature dataset for Windermere, covering 1944-2002 (annual mean in °C).
  - Part of data used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist study on climate change effects in a freshwater top predator system.
  - Related to a broader set of Windermere lake datasets and other Pike-related data series.

- Data details
  - File format and size: CSV, WindTemp1944_2002.csv, ~24 KB.
  - Columns: TEMP (annual mean surface temperature in °C), YEAR (year the temperature pertains to).

- Sampling site and coordinates
  - Location: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain.
  - Approximate grid reference: SD393960; OSGB36 Easting/Northing 339385,496080; WGS84 coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836.

- Collection methods and timing
  - Measurement method: inshore surface water temperature recorded with a handheld mercury thermometer.
  - Timing: near daily intervals, approximately 09:00 h.
  - Accuracy: 0.1 °C.
  - Data processing: daily records were used to compute annual mean temperatures.

- Experimental design and data provenance
  - Sampling regime: inshore site near the middle portion of Windermere’s long axis; continuous monitoring from 1933 onward, with this dataset presenting 1944-2002.
  - Data custodians: Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), then Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and predecessor Institut e of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) (1989–2003), and then FBA again.
  - Quality control: measurements checked by two individuals.
  - Foundational reference for methodology: Winfield, Fletcher, and James (2008) on Windermere fish populations and environmental factors.

- Metadata and related datasets
  - Metadata record: Pike 1944-2002 data series (link provided in the dataset description).
  - Related datasets (metadata links): Pike - Fecundity Data (1963-2002); Pike - Growth Data (1944-1995); Pike - Survival Data (1953-1990).

- Practical considerations and potential uses
  - Use cases: analyze long-term temperature trends, correlate with ecological responses in Windermere (e.g., fish populations, eutrophication effects), or combine with other linked data series for broader environmental analyses.
  - Considerations for analysts: limited to right-scale temporal but area-specific (inshore Windermere); verify data continuity and any methodological changes over time; data quality control steps and historical protocols should be accounted for when integrating with other datasets.
