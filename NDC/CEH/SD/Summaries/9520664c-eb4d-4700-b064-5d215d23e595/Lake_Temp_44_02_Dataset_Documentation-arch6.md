# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

## Overview
- One data file from a set used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist (Effects of climate change on trait-based dynamics of a top predator in freshwater ecosystems).
- Inshore surface water temperature (°C) data for Windermere, presented from 1944 onwards (collection began in 1933).
- Collected by Freshwater Biological Association (FBA), then CEH and its predecessor IFE (1989–2003), and subsequently again by FBA.
- Document version: 1. 29-8-2013.

## Data file details
- Format: comma separated values (CSV)
- Size: 24 kb
- Columns:
  - TEMP, YEAR: Annual mean surface temperature of the lake (°C)
- File name: LakeTemp1944_2002.csv

## Sampling site
- Location: Windermere lake, Cumbria, Great Britain
- Approximate center coordinates: OS Grid SD393960; OSGB36 Easting/Northing 339385,496080; WGS84 54.360193, -2.935836

## Experimental design
- Inshore surface temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis.
- Monitoring period: from 1933 to present.

## Collection methods & analytical methods
- Temperature measurements (accuracy 0.1 °C) using handheld mercury thermometer.
- Time of measurement: around 09:00 h, near daily intervals.
- Annual means calculated from daily records (method described in Winfield et al., 2008).

## Quality control
- Temperature measurements checked by two individuals.
- Referenced in Winfield, Fletcher & James (2008) on Arctic charr populations in Windermere.

## Usage notes
- Suitable for time-series analyses of lake temperature and potential integration with ecological datasets (e.g., Pike-related datasets) to study climate impacts on freshwater ecosystems.
- Data is ready for self-service analysis and visualization (e.g., dashboards or pivot analyses) to support broader data use and interpretation.
