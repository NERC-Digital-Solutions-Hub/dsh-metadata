# Windermere Lake Temperature 1944-2002

## Overview
- Dataset of inshore surface water temperature (°C) for Windermere, presented 1944-2002 (data collection began in 1933).
- Historical custody: Freshwater Biological Association (FBA) → Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH) and predecessor Institute of Freshwater Ecology (IFE) → FBA again.
- Part of a set used in Vindenes et al. (2013) American Naturalist (climate change effects on trait-based dynamics in a top freshwater predator).

## Data Content and Structure
- Format: CSV (Windermere Lake Temperature 1944_2002.csv); size 24 KB.
- Columns:
  - TEMP: Annual mean surface temperature of the lake (°C).
  - YEAR: Year to which the annual temperature pertains.
- Sampling site: Windermere, Cumbria, Great Britain. Approximate grid reference at lake centre: SD393960 (OS Grid), 339385,496080 (OSGB36 Easting/Northing); coordinates 54.360193, -2.935836 (WGS84).
- Timeframe: Inshore surface temperature monitored near the middle of the lake’s long axis from 1933 to present; dataset covers 1944-2002.
- Sampling regime: Near-daily measurements around 09:00 h.
- Instrumentation: Handheld mercury thermometer; accuracy ±0.1°C.
- Data processing: Daily records aggregated to produce annual means (as documented in Winfield et al., 2008).

## Provenance, Methods and Quality Assurance
- Experimental design: Inshore lake temperature monitoring location fixed near the lake center along the long axis.
- Collection methods: Daily measurements with standardized timing; documented in Winfield et al. (2008).
- Analytical methods: Annual means calculated from daily records.
- Quality control: Measurements checked by two individuals.
- Documentation references: Winfield, Fletcher, and James (2008) on Windermere ecosystem dynamics and climate-related trends.

## Governance and Stewardship Considerations for Data Stewards
- Ensure discoverability and linkage: Maintain clear metadata records and links to related datasets and publications (e.g., the 58357e70-… and Pike dataset records).
- Metadata completeness: Preserve sampling method details, timing, instrument accuracy, QA steps, and data lineage from original collection to present.
- Data format and accessibility: Retain CSV format with explicit column definitions; include units and coordinate references for site localization.
- Provenance and licensing: Respect rights statement; track data provenance across institutions (FBA, CEH, IFE) and the dataset’s use in Vindenes et al. (2013).
- Update and versioning: Establish a process for updating annual means if new data become available; document version changes and date stamps.
- Data quality and standards: Maintain QA procedures (two-person verification) and provide references to methodological sources (e.g., Winfield et al. 2008).
- Data integration: Ensure compatibility with related Windermere datasets (fecundity, growth, survival) by aligning metadata schemas and identifiers.
