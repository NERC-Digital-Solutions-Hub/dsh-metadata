# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- Jointly organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH), the British Trust for Ornithology (BTO), and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC).
- Recognises and thanks volunteers for data contributions.
- Since 1976, UKBMS has monitored butterfly population changes with data from over 3000 active sites per year.
- Data support understanding of insect population trends and policy-related biodiversity questions.
- Data come from multiple sampling methods and are analyzed together to produce national trend indicators.

## Data collection: sampling framework
- Three main components:
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes, typically 2–4 km, 5 m wide, weekly counts (up to 26 per year), weather-conditional; over 2000 sites monitored annually by 2022.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects; 2–3 visits per year across ~800 squares, sampling common habitats.
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg and larval web counts) focused on specific species.
- All sampling methods are analyzed together to produce comprehensive indices.

## Nature of data and trend analysis
- Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Indices reflect a consistent proportion of butterflies present, with variation by species detectability.
- Overall species indices (collated indices) produced using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with site-by-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed.
- The method uses all counts across a season to model seasonal patterns and extrapolate gaps, giving more weight to observed data than to extrapolations.

## Quality control
- Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data portal or Transect Walker.
- Automated checks flag data entry errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate records; continuous season-long checks.
- Additional automated/manual validation targets anomalies such as records outside known distributions, unusual flight periods, first-ever site records, and extreme abundances.
- Necessary edits are made to the main UKBMS dataset based on validation outcomes.

## Details of this data download
- Provides annual site- and species-specific abundance indices from 1976–2022 in CSV format.
- Key columns:
  - SITE_CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES_CODE, SPECIES, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, SITE_INDEX
- Notes:
  - If a species was present but the site wasn’t sufficiently monitored to calculate an accurate index in a year, SITE_INDEX may be -2.
- Taxonomy references follow Agassiz et al. updates (2013, 2019–2020).

## Licence and attribution
- Open Government Licence (OGL) permitting broad use with few conditions.
- Must cite the dataset (including DOI) in any reports or publications using the data.
- Attribution statement required: Contains UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

## Offer of collaboration and contact details
- UKBMS partners offer guidance on dataset details and interpretation of outputs.
- Opportunities for co-authorship and intellectual input for scientific outputs (papers, conferences, posters).

## Analyst relevance
- Standardized, long-running time series suitable for trend analysis and policy evaluation.
- Robust quality control and documentation of data provenance.
- Open licensing and clear attribution facilitate reuse and integration with other environmental datasets.
- Multi-method design enables cross-validation and comprehensive ecosystem monitoring; clear avenues for collaboration and data-driven insights.
