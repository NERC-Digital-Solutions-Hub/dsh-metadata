# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Organizations and purpose
  - The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - It relies on volunteer data to monitor butterfly populations across the UK since 1976, with over 3,000 active sites annually.
  - Data support policy questions on biodiversity status and trends; data are analyzed to produce indices that are used to understand population changes.

- Data collection framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, weekly counts (up to 26 visits/year) along a 5 m width, April–September.
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares using the same transect method but with 2–3 visits per year (min 2 visits in July/August; spring visits encouraged).
  - Targeted surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts for specific species or habitats.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Data are reported as abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts) reflecting proportions of butterflies observed.
  - Indices are combined using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016), with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed each year at each site.
  - All data types (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) are used to estimate seasonal counts and fill gaps in observation.

- Quality control
  - Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online or via Transect Walker; automatic checks flag anomalies.
  - Regional transect coordinators review records; ongoing validation checks assess distribution range, flight period alignment, first-time site records, and unusual abundances.
  - Data corrections are made through queries and coordinator/recorder discussions before finalizing the UKBMS dataset.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides annual indices of abundance for each species at each UK site with sufficient data from 1976–2022.
  - Delivered as a comma-separated value (.csv) file.
  - Key columns include:
    - SITE_CODE: unique site identifier
    - COUNTRY: regional origin of data
    - SPECIES_CODE: unique species code
    - SPECIES: scientific name
    - COMMON_NAME: vernacular name
    - YEAR: year of the collated index
    - SITE_INDEX: abundance index for the species at the site and year (with -2 indicating insufficient data for reliable calculation)
