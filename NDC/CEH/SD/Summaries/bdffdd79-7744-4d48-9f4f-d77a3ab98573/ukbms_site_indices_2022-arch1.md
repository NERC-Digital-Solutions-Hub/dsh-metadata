# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Overview
  - A long-running, volunteer-based program to monitor butterfly population status across the UK.
  - Organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the UK Centre for Ecology & Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - >3,000 actively recorded sites annually; data used to understand changes in insect populations and inform biodiversity policy.

- Sampling framework
  - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km, 5 m wide, weekly counts from early April to late September (up to 26 visits/year).
  - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel transects, 2–3 visits/year (min 2 in July/August; spring visits encouraged); ~800 squares/year.
  - Targeted surveys: Single-species transects, alternative methods (e.g., timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on specific species or life stages.

- Nature of data and analysis
  - Outputs are abundance indices (relative measures, not absolute counts).
  - Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present, with variation by species detectability.
  - Collated indices for species produced using Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with site-by-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed; combines counts from all methods to estimate seasonal patterns and fill data gaps, prioritizing observed data.

- Quality control
  - Data captured on standard forms, entered online via UKBMS MyData or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
  - Automated checks and regional transect coordinators validate data during and after the season.
  - Additional automated/manual validation screens for out-of-range records, out-of-season records, first-time site records, and anomalous counts; edits made after coordination with recorders.

- Details of this data download
  - Contains annual indices of abundance for each species at each site with sufficient data from 1976–2022.
  - Format: CSV with columns including SITE_CODE, COUNTRY, SPECIES_CODE, SPECIES, COMMON_NAME, YEAR, SITE_INDEX.
  - SITE_INDEX is -2 if a site-year could not produce an accurate index due to insufficient monitoring.

- Licence and attribution
  - Open Government Licence (OGL) for free use and reuse with few conditions.
  - Must cite the dataset (including DOI) in publications using the data.
  - Attribution: Contains UKBMS data © Butterfly Conservation, CEH, BTO, and JNCC.

- Offer of collaboration and contact details
  - UKBMS Partners welcome advisory input and collaboration, including potential co-authorship on publications.
