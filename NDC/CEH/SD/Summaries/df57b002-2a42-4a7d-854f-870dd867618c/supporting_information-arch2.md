# Supporting information for R Shiny demonstrator application for advancing reproducible research

## Purpose and context
- Provides supporting information for a reproducible-research focused Shiny demonstrator.
- Emphasises collection, transformation, and provenance of environmental data used in the app.
- References live demonstration access for verification of workflows.

## Data sources and datasets
- ECN precipitation chemistry data (1992–2015): ECN_PC1.csv from the Environmental Information Data Centre (EI DC).
- ECN rainfall meteorology data (1991–2015): rain_hourly.feather (produced from ECN meteorology CSVs).
- Lamb weather types data (UK): 20CR_1871-1947_ncep_1948-2020_12hrs_UK.csv from the Climate Research Unit (CRU) data archive.
- Reading daily Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) data: AMO_smoothed_from_the_Kaplan_SST_V2.csv (Kaplan SST-based AMO data).
- Notes indicate where to download all data files and the respective DOIs/URLs for each dataset.

## Data creation and transformation
- The rain_hourly.feather file is generated by:
  - Placing downloaded ECN meteorology CSV files into a folder named ECNmet.
  - Running an R script that reads all CSVs in ECNmet, filters rows where FIELDNAME == "RAIN", and combines them.
  - Writing the resulting dataset to a feather file placed in the data folder.
- The workflow uses common data tools (R) with packages to handle data wrangling and feather I/O.

## Quality control and reproducibility
- A session_info.txt file records the versions of R packages used during the project, supporting reproducibility checks.
- A live demonstration of the workflow is available at: https://cptecn-sandboxdemo.datalabs.ceh.ac.uk/.

## Data structure and organization
- Dataset references and file names:
  - ECN_PC1.csv: ECN precipitation chemistry data (1992–2015).
  - rain_hourly.feather: ECN rainfall meteorology data (1991–2015).
  - 20CR_1871-1947_ncep_1948-2020_12hrs_UK.csv: Lamb weather types data (CRU).
  - AMO_smoothed_from_the_Kaplan_SST_V2.csv: AMO data (Kaplan SST-based).
- Guidance notes indicate where to download and how datasets are stored and used within the demonstrator.
