# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) in the UK.
- Use a droppings-count index to estimate relative abundance and detect changes over time, including responses to past events (e.g., myxomatosis).

## Method
- Species monitored: rabbits and deer; direct population counts are not practicable, so dropping counts are used as an index.
- Transects:
  - Use the same transect as the ECN butterfly monitoring (IB) and extend to about 2 km.
  - Add a second transect covering major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; length adapted to site conditions (include a field centre for agricultural sites).
- Timing: counts conducted in late March and late September (two sampling occasions per year).
- Transect segmentation: the butterfly transect is divided into up to 15 sections by habitat type or management differences; the second transect is subdivided similarly.
- Field procedures:
  - Clear all droppings within 1 m of both sides of the transects two weeks before recording.
  - Record droppings again during the survey; count per section on each transect.
  - Distinguish rabbit, deer, and sheep droppings where present.
  - Include information on any rabbit/deer control and disease prevalence.
- Recording and reporting: data are prepared for ECNCCU with accompanying transfer documentation; findings are conveyed via reports, charts, or dashboards.

## Location
- Primary transect: same as ECN butterfly monitoring (IB).
- Secondary transect: covers habitat types not represented on the butterfly transect.
- Each transect is divided into sections with recorded length and habitat type.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Key recording identifiers for each sampling occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if sampling more frequently than daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates - rabbits and deer (BU Protocol)
  - Variables recorded per transect section:
    - Date droppings cleared
    - Date droppings recorded (sampling date)
    - Transect section
    - Number of rabbit droppings
    - Number of deer droppings
    - Transect section length
    - Habitat description (units = character code, Tn)
- Recording forms:
  - One form for recording droppings (rabbits and deer)
  - One form for lengths and habitat types per section (to be completed in the first year and whenever habitat/transect changes)
  - Transect sections are numbered sequentially across both transects to remain unique within each ECN site
