# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in the United Kingdom.
- Use an index based on dropping counts to estimate relative abundance, capturing impacts on vegetation structure, plant diversity, and habitat for other organisms.
- Detect changes over time (e.g., responses to past events like myxomatosis).

## Method
- Use standardized transects to monitor population trends; two transects per site.
  - One transect should be the same as the ECN butterfly monitoring transect (IB) and extended to 2 km if needed.
  - A second transect covers major habitat types not encountered on the butterfly transect; length adapted to site conditions (e.g., include a field centre at agricultural sites).
- Sampling schedule: late March and late September each year.
- Dropping counts along predefined transects to record relative abundance of rabbits and deer (if present).
- Transects are divided into sections (no more than 15 per butterfly transect) by habitat type or management differences; lengths and habitat types recorded for each section.
- Droppings within 1 m of the transects on both sides cleared two weeks before recording; transects walked again at recording time to count droppings within the cleared zone.
- Separate records kept for each section of each transect.
- Recorders must distinguish droppings of rabbits/deer from sheep when present.
- Include information on site-specific rabbit/deer control (fencing, shooting) and disease prevalence with data.

## Location
- Transects aligned with ECN butterfly monitoring routes where possible; second transect designed to capture dominant habitat types at the site.
- Ensure transect sections are consistently defined across both transects.

## Sampling
- Conduct two sampling occasions per year: late March and late September.
- Maintain consistent transect sectioning and recording of section length and habitat type.
- Maintain clear, separate records for each transect section.
- Ensure data can be traced to exact section, transect, site, and sampling date.

## Specification of results and recording conventions
- Data must include four key parameters to identify a sample/recording occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (with time if sampling occurs more frequently than daily)
- Core measurement: vertebrates - rabbits and deer (BU Protocol)
- Recording fields (for each sample): 
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (sampling date)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (coded)
  - Units/precision (e.g., precision of recording = 1)
- Data formatting and ECNCCU dataset requirements are described in the accompanying Data Transfer documentation.

## Recording forms
- Two recording forms available from the CCU:
  - One for recording droppings of rabbits and deer.
  - One for describing lengths and habitat types for each section (first year of survey and whenever habitat or transect alterations occur).
- Number of transect sections is site-specific and should reflect habitat patterns.

## Note
- Transect sections must be numbered sequentially across both transects so that section identifiers are unique within each ECN site.

## Data management and access (for analysts)
- Data submitted to ECNCCU; refer to Data Transfer documentation for ECN dataset formats.
- Access to documentation and support via ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
