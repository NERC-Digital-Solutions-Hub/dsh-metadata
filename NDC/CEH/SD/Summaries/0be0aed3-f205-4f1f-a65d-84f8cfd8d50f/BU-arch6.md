# RABBITS AND DEER

## Purpose
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer Cervus elaphus, roe deer Capreolus capreolus).
- Use dropping counts as an index of relative abundance due to impracticality of direct population size measurements.
- Aim to detect changes similar to past dynamics (e.g., rabbit declines and recovery after myxomatosis).

## Location and Transects
- Use the same transect as ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extended to 2 km.
- Establish a second transect to cover major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; length adjusted to site conditions (e.g., include a field centre in agricultural sites).

## Sampling Schedule
- Conduct sampling in late March and late September each year.
- Record droppings along the transects to capture relative abundance; zero counts are important for future comparisons.
- Transects are divided into ≤15 sections based on discrete habitat types or different management, with extensions following the same scheme.

## Data Collection Procedures
- Clear within-1 m zones of transects on both sides two weeks before recording; count droppings during the survey.
- Maintain separate records for each transect section.
- Distinguish droppings from rabbits, deer, and sheep where present.
- Collect contextual information on site management (fencing, shooting) and disease prevalence.

## Data Recording Conventions
- Key identifying variables for each sampling occasion:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time
- For ECNCCU datasets: follow Data Transfer documentation; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
- For each transect section:
  - Date droppings cleared and date droppings recorded (sampling date)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (character code)
- Precision notes indicate recording precision (e.g., 1 or 0.1 units as applicable).

## Data Formats, Access, and Documentation
- Data submission follows ECNCCU dataset specifications; formats are documented on the restricted-access Site Managers' extranet.
- Data transfer documentation accompanies the protocol for correct data structuring and integration.

## Recording Forms
- Two forms available:
  - One for recording droppings (counts by species per transect section).
  - One for describing section lengths and habitat types.
- The habitat/length form is completed in the first year and whenever habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
- Transect sections should be numbered sequentially across both transects to remain unique within each ECN site.

## Additional Notes
- Transect sections are uniquely numbered across both transects to ensure unambiguous site-level tracking.
- The protocol accommodates variation in habitat patterns and site conditions, including disease and management interventions.
