# RABBITS AND DEER

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer, Cervus elaphus; roe deer, Capreolus capreolus) and their impact on vegetation structure and habitat.
- Use an index-based approach (dropping counts) as a practicable proxy for population size and dynamics, capturing changes over time (e.g., past declines or recoveries after interventions).

## Location
- Use the same transect as the ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extending to 2 km if needed.
- Establish a second transect covering major habitat types not encountered on the butterfly transect; length adapted to site conditions (at agricultural sites, include a field centre).

## Sampling and Methods
- Timing: late March and late September each year.
- Transects: droppings counted along predefined sections; zero counts are informative for trend comparisons.
- Transect structure: butterfly transect divided into up to 15 sections by habitat type or management differences; second transect subdivided similarly.
- Data collection steps:
  - Clear all droppings within 1 m of both transects two weeks before recording.
  - Re-walk transects and record droppings within the cleared zones.
  - Record separately for each section of each transect.
- Species distinction: ensure confident identification of droppings for rabbits, deer, and any sheep droppings present.
- Contextual data: include information on rabbit/deer control (fencing, shooting, etc.) and disease prevalence accompanying the data.

## Data Structure and Recording Conventions
- Core data specifications (as required for ECN datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (unique per ECN Site)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., BU Protocol)
  - Location Code (replicate sampling locations per core measurement)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time element if sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Recording variables for each sampling occasion:
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (Sampling date)
  - Transect section (identifier)
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (character code)
  - Units and precision (e.g., precision of recording = 1)
- Data format and transfer:
  - Refer to ECN Data Transfer documentation (ECNCCU dataset formats) and restricted Site Managers' extranet.
  - Contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access to documentation and datasets.

## Recording Forms and Workflow
- Two forms provided by the CCU:
  - One for recording droppings (rabbits and deer)
  - One for recording lengths and habitat types for each section
- Use:
  - The habitat/length form is completed in the first year and whenever habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
  - Transect sections are numbered sequentially across both transects to ensure unique identifiers within each ECN site.

## Data Quality, Governance, and Practical Considerations
- Data quality practices:
  - Acknowledge the potential for zero counts as meaningful baseline data.
  - Maintain careful separation of rabbit and deer counts, and note any sheep droppings to avoid misclassification.
  - Include site-level information on deer/rabbit control and disease prevalence with the dataset.
- Governance and access:
  - Data are intended to align with ECNCCU standards and dataset formats; use the Data Transfer documentation for consistency.
  - Access and documentation are managed via the restricted extranet; contact the ECNCCU support email for access.
