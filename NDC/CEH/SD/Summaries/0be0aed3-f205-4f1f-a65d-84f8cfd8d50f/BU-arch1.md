# BU Protocol

## Aim
- Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red Cervus elaphus and roe Capreolus capreolus) in the United Kingdom.
- Use an index method based on dropping counts to estimate relative abundance, since direct population size is impracticable.
- Detect population changes over time and relate them to past events (e.g., rabbit declines after myxomatosis) and habitat effects.

## Location and transects
- Use the same transect as the ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extended to 2 km.
- Establish a second transect to cover major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; length tailored to site conditions (e.g., include a field centre at agricultural sites).

## Sampling design
- Timing: late March and late September each year.
- Transects subdivided into up to 15 sections by discrete habitat types or management differences; the second transect subdivided similarly.
- For each section: record transect section length and habitat type.
- Droppings cleared within 1 m of the transects on both sides two weeks before recording; during recording, count droppings within the cleared zone.
- Maintain separate records for each section of each transect.
- Ensure ability to distinguish rabbit and deer droppings from sheep droppings.
- Include information on rabbit/deer control (e.g., fencing, shooting) and disease prevalence.

## Data collection and recording conventions
- Core measurements: vertebrates – rabbits and deer; each transect treated as a sampling location (codes 01, 02, etc).
- Required fields for each sample/recording occasion (space and time identification plus measurements):
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., BU protocol for vertebrates)
  - Location Code
  - Sampling Date/Time
  - Date droppings cleared
  - Date droppings recorded (sampling date/time)
  - Transect section
  - Number of rabbit droppings
  - Number of deer droppings
  - Transect section length
  - Habitat description (character code)
- Units and precision: transect section length in meters; habitat description as coded; precision of recording = 1 (and 0.1 for some fields as specified in documentation).
- Data formats: follow the ECNCCU Data Transfer documentation; access via ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
- Data structure notes: each transect section is treated as a sampling location; transects sections are numbered sequentially and uniquely within each ECN site.

## Recording forms
- Two forms available: one for recording droppings, one for describing lengths and habitat types for each section.
- The second form is to be completed in the first year of the survey and again if habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
- The number of transect sections depends on the habitat pattern at each site.

## Note
- Transect sections should be numbered sequentially across both transects so that they remain unique within each ECN site.
