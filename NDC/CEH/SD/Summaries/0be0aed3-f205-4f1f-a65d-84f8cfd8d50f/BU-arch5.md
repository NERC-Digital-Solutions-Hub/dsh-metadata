# BU Protocol

- Aim
  - Monitor broad changes in populations of rabbits (Oryctolagus cuniculus) and deer (red deer Cervus elaphus and roe deer Capreolus capreolus) in the United Kingdom.
  - Use droppings counts as an index of relative abundance to detect population changes and trends, including historical patterns (e.g., post-myxomatosis decline and recovery).

- Method
  - Index method based on transect droppings counts; practicable alternative to direct population estimates.
  - Location: use the same transect as ECN butterfly monitoring (IB), extended to 2 km; add a second transect covering major habitat types not on the butterfly transect; at agricultural sites, ensure the second transect includes a field centre.
  - Sampling periods: late March and late September; zero counts are informative for trend analysis.
  - Transect design: butterfly transect divided into up to 15 sections by discrete habitat types or management differences; extensions subdivided similarly; record section length and habitat type.
  - Data collection: clear all droppings within 1 m of the transect on both sides two weeks before recording; recount during transect walk; separate records for each section of each transect.
  - Species identification: ensure ability to distinguish rabbit and deer droppings from sheep droppings where present.
  - Contextual data: accompany data with information on rabbit/deer control (fencing, shooting, etc.) and disease prevalence.

- Location and site coding
  - Each ECN Site uses unique site codes; transects are treated as sampling locations with codes (e.g., 01, 02, etc.).
  - Core measurement code identifies the study (vertebrates – rabbits and deer).

- Sampling and data variables
  - For each sampling occasion: site code, core measurement code, location code, date/time of sampling.
  - Additional fields: date when droppings were cleared, date when droppings were recorded, transect section number, number of rabbit droppings, number of deer droppings, transect section length, habitat description (character code), and units.
  - Variables are recorded per transect section; data allow aggregation by site, transect, and habitat type; precision of recording may be specified (as per data transfer documentation).

- Specification of results and recording conventions
  - Four key parameters (Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time) must be included for every dataset entry.
  - Data submission and formats: ECNCCU data transfer documentation governs ECN dataset formats; documentation available on the restricted access Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.
  - Recording approach: two records per transect section (one for rabbit droppings, one for deer droppings) with accompanying fields for transect details and habitat.

- Recording forms
  - Two forms provided: one for recording droppings (rabbit and deer) and one for describing transect lengths and habitat types.
  - First-year submission requires the habitat/section description form; update if habitat changes or transect sections are altered.
  - The number of transect sections is determined by habitat pattern at each site.

- Note on numbering and consistency
  - Transect sections should be numbered sequentially across both transects to ensure uniqueness within each ECN site.
