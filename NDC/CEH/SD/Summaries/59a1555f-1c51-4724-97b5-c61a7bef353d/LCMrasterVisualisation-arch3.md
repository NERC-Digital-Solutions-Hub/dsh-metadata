# Visualising UKCEH Land Cover Class using a GIS application

- Overview of data structure
  - Land Cover Map rasters come in multiple resolutions:
    - 20m and 10m rasters: two bands total
      - Band 1: UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
      - Band 2: classification confidence indicator
    - 25m rasters: three bands total
      - Band 1: dominant UKCEH Land Cover Class identifier
      - Bands 2 and 3: confidence indicators
- Purpose for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a concise, repeatable method to visualise land cover classifications for policy scrutiny, reporting, and decision-making.
  - Facilitates clear communication of classification maps to stakeholders.
- General approach
  - Visualisation uses Band 1 to represent the Land Cover Class and applies a predefined color style to ensure consistent interpretation across platforms.
  - The accompanying style files standardise colouring and symbolisation to aid comparability and governance.
- Visualising with QGIS
  - Steps (high level):
    - Add the Land Cover data to the project; locate in layers panel.
    - Open Layer Properties -> Symbology -> Paletted/Unique Values -> Band 1.
    - Load the provided style file LCMcolours_QGIS.qml, then apply.
    - Map is redrawn with correct classification colours.
- Visualising with ArcGIS Desktop
  - Steps (high level):
    - Browse to data folder, expand raster to view bands.
    - Drag band_1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties -> Symbology -> Unique Values (if prompted, answer YES to build attribute table).
    - Use Import to load LCMcolours.lyr and apply.
    - Map is redrawn with correct classification colours.
- Visualising with ArcGIS Pro
  - Steps (high level):
    - Open catalog, locate data folder, view raster bands.
    - Drag band_1 into the Table of Contents.
    - Layer Properties -> Appearance > Symbology -> Unique Values.
    - Use the Import option in the symbology panel to load LCMcolours.lyr.
    - Map is redrawn with correct classification colours.
- Additional notes
  - The instructions refer to accompanying style files (LCMcolours_QGIS.qml for QGIS and LCMcolours.lyr for ArcGIS) to achieve consistent visuals.
