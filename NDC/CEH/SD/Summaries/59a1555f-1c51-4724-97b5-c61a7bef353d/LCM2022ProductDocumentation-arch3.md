# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2022

## Purpose
- User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022 (LCM2022), detailing data production, validation, and accuracy to help informed application and decision-making.
- Aims to enable monitoring of state and change in the UK countryside and support environmental objectives.

## What LCM2022 includes
- Seven datasets in total, with three datasets for each region (Great Britain and Northern Ireland): 
  - 10 m Classified Pixel dataset (pixel-level land cover with a confidence measure)
  - Land Parcel dataset (integration with a spatial parcel framework)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset (parcel-based rasters)
- A separate 1 km summary raster product covering both GB and NI.
- Datasets align with 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, linked to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats, with mappings and caveats described in Appendices.

## Data production and method overview
- Land cover mapping is automated: classification scenes are created by combining Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images with Context Rasters; classification uses Bootstrap Training and a Random Forest (RF) classifier.
- Seasonal Composite Images:
  - Derived from Sentinel-2, resampled to 10 m; four seasons (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) with 10 spectral bands; occasional null data due to cloud cover.
- Context Rasters (10 m GB; NI differs slightly):
  - Terrain (Height, Aspect, Slope)
  - Distances to features (buildings, roads, tidal water, freshwater)
  - Foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh masks
- Classification Scenes:
  - GB: 32 tiles (approx. 100 x 100 km) classified independently; some overlap between tiles
  - NI: a single 49-band Classification Scene
- Bootstrap Training and RF:
  - Bootstrap Training uses historic LCM mappings (LCM2019–LCM2021) with Pixels >80% probability and consistent class across years
  - RF classifier trained with balanced sampling (10,000 samples per class)
  - Software combines WEKA, PostGIS, and GDAL (open source)
- Land Parcel Spatial Framework:
  - 0.5 ha minimum parcel size (MMU)
  - Parcels derived from generalized national cartography to reduce noise and provide a stable unit for change detection
  - Note: gid values differ from LCM2015; direct parcel-id comparisons across versions may not be possible

## Product structure and data specifics
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI):
  - Pixel-level class (UKCEH Land Cover Class) plus a second band with the associated class confidence
  - 10 m pixels are not generalized to preserve fine features; validation is performed against the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset
- Land Parcel datasets:
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m Classified Pixels with the Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Parcel-level attributes include: gid, hist (history of class proportions), mode (dominant class), purity, conf (mean class-membership probability), n (number of 10 m pixels per parcel), agg (aggregated class)
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets: three-band rasters carrying per-parcel land cover mode, conf, and purity
- 1 km Summary Raster products:
  - Dominant class per 1 km pixel (1 band for classes; 1 band for aggregates)
  - Percentage cover per 1 km pixel for both classes (21 bands) and aggregates (10 bands); values are integer-rounded and may not sum exactly to 100 due to rounding
- Validation and accuracy:
  - 33,107 validation points across all 21 classes
  - Overall accuracy: 86.1% (full thematic detail)
  - Appendix 4 provides detailed confusion matrices and producer’s/user’s accuracies

## Data quality, validation, and known issues
- Validation dataset composed from GB countryside surveys, open data inventories, and bespoke validation points
- Known issues:
  - A small number of vector land parcel polygons are missing, causing nodata gaps in the 25 m rasterised land parcels; impact on 1 km products is negligible
  - 10 m Classified Pixels have not been generalized via the Land Parcel Framework; this preserves fine features but means validation is against the 25 m raster dataset
- Citing and reproducibility:
  - Each LCM2022 dataset has a DOI; recommended citations provided (see Table 5)
  - Users should note that methods have evolved; changes between maps may reflect real change or methodological differences

## Context, data access, and governance
- Datasets produced with open-source tools; integration with UKCEH spatial frameworks and metadata standards
- Seasonal composites, context rasters, and classification scenes designed to support change detection and temporal consistency
- Data licensing and DOIs enable traceability and reproducibility; citations also reference methodological overviews (e.g., Marston et al. 2023, 2024)

## Appendices and user guidance
- Appendix 1 and 2: notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes and UK BAP Broad Habitats; definitions, caveats, and mapping considerations
- Appendix 3: full list of LCM2022 datasets and DOIs
- Appendix 4: correspondence/validation matrices (class-by-class accuracy)
- Appendix 5 and 6: recommended colour schemes for displaying UKCEH Land Cover Classes (including color-blind friendly variants) and accompanying QGIS symbol files
- Disclaimer: ongoing methodological evolution may yield differences between maps beyond real land-cover change

## Practical implications for monitoring and policy
- LCM2022 provides a standardized, annually updated land-cover framework with consistent methodology across GB and NI, enabling trend analysis and change detection.
- The combination of fine-grained 10 m pixels and aggregated parcel-based products supports both detailed habitat mapping and high-level land-cover change monitoring for policy evaluation.
- Explicit validation and confidence metrics help assess uncertainty in classifications; the 1 km summaries facilitate integration with coarser-scale monitoring and reporting.
- Clear documentation of data structures, spatial frameworks, and harmonization with BAP Broad Habitats supports comparability with historical products and other biodiversity/land-cover datasets.
