# The UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022

- Purpose andScope
  - User guide for the UKCEH Land Cover Map 2022 (LCM2022), describing data production, validation, and accuracy.
  - Product comprises seven geospatial datasets: three for Great Britain and Northern Ireland each (10 m Classified Pixel dataset, Land Parcel dataset, and 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset) plus a 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
  - Aims to help users make informed decisions about applying LCM data, including understanding data structure, quality, and limitations.

- Data products and structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixels (GB and NI)
    - Generated by mosaicking Classification Scenes; first band = most likely UKCEH Land Cover Class, second band = class membership probability.
    - Not generalised by the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to preserve fine landscape detail.
  - Land Parcel Datasets (GB and NI)
    - Land Parcel Product (vector) plus 25 m Rasterised Land Parcels (raster) derived by rasterising parcel geometries.
    - 25 m raster bands carry per-parcel attributes: mode (dominant class), conf (mean class membership probability), and purity.
  - 1 km Summary Raster Data
    - Summary products: dominant class and percentage cover (21 class bands for GB/NI; 10 bands for aggregates) with rounding considerations near coastlines.
  - Classifications and naming
    - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes aligned with Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; class names are capitalised and linked to detailed appendices.
  - Seasonal and contextual inputs
    - Seasonal Composite Images derived from Sentinel-2 (four seasons) plus Context Rasters (terrain, proximity to features) to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Display and access
    - Appendix provides recommended colour schemes (including color-blind friendly options) and associated QGIS symbology files.

- How LCM2022 was produced
  - Classification approach
    - Automatic classification using Bootstrap Training to generate training observations from historical LCM maps, paired with a Random Forest classifier.
    - Bootstrap Training relies on pixels with high confidence (>80%) from multiple years (LCM2019, LCM2020, LCM2021); areas with change over three years are treated with alternative training data (e.g., LCM2022 Crops data for arable crops).
  - Data inputs and features
    - Classification Scenes combine Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images with Context Rasters to reduce spectral confusion.
    - 10 m Context Rasters include terrain (height, aspect, slope) and proximity masks (buildings, roads, tidal water, freshwater, foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh) with region-specific adaptations for GB and NI.
  - Tiles and processing
    - GB uses 32 Classification Scenes (tiles ~100 x 100 km); NI uses a single Classification Scene due to smaller extent.
  - Land Parcel Framework
    - UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework: parcels ~0.5 ha MMU, generalised from national cartography to create discrete units that help with noise reduction and change detection.
  - Validation and accuracy
    - Validation dataset of 33,107 points across 21 classes; overall accuracy of 86.1% for LCM2022 (full thematic detail).
  - Data and methods evolution
    - Annual production approach to improve temporal consistency and support change detection; notes that method changes may yield different results year-to-year.

- Data quality, accuracy, and known issues
  - Overall accuracy: 86.1% (Producer’s and User’s accuracies vary by class; detailed confusion matrices are provided in Appendix 4).
  - Known issues
    - A small number of polygons missing from the vector Land Parcel products, leading to nodata in the 25 m rasterised parcels; impact considered negligible for 1 km products.
    - 10 m Classified Pixels are unaffected by the missing parcels.
  - Classification challenges and caveats
    - Spectral confusion among land cover types with similar spectral signatures (e.g., various grassland and peat-related habitats; coastal and urban interfaces).
    - Saltwater vs. Freshwater distinctions near coastlines can be less certain; Saltwater training can be affected by tidal conditions.
    - Some habitat classes (e.g., Neutral Grassland, Fen, Marsh, Swamp, Bog) exhibit inter-class confusion; context rasters and training data help but do not eliminate all misclassification risk.
  - Temporal considerations
    - Annual maps help distinguish real change from random classification error; widespread changes are expected to persist year-to-year, whereas random errors “flicker.”
  - Validation data sources
    - Validation points drawn from GB countryside survey, National Forest Inventory, Rural Payments Agency, and manual/image interpretation and field data.

- Data governance, access, and citations
  - Data identity and availability
    - Each LCM2022 dataset has a DOI; citation guidance is provided (references include Marston et al., 2023; Marston et al., 2024a–g for specific products).
    - Data products are hosted and cited via the UKCEH and NERC Environmental Information Data Centre (EDC).
  - Coordinate systems and extents
    - GB: British National Grid (EPSG 27700); NI: Irish grid TM75 (EPSG 29903).
  - Documentation and appendices
    - Appendix 1–2 provide notes on UKCEH Land Cover Classes and their relationship to UK BAP Broad Habitats.
    - Appendix 3 lists dataset details; Appendix 4 provides full correspondence (confusion) matrices by class; Appendix 5–6 offer colour schemes and display files for varied audiences.
  - Usage guidance
    - A disclaimer notes method changes over time; users should consider potential methodological differences when comparing across versions.
  - Attribution
    - Proper DOIs and citations should be used when referencing datasets; guidance references Marston et al. (2023–2024).

- Practical implications for data leaders
  - The LCM2022 provides a robust, annually updated set of land cover maps at high resolution (10 m) with parcel-level attributes and a 1 km summary, enabling change detection, system-wide data governance, and cross-partner collaboration.
  - Governance considerations
    - Clear provenance, metadata richness, and versioning are embedded (DOIs, processing notes, validation results).
    - The Land Parcel Spatial Framework provides a stable basis for time-series analysis, but users should be aware gid values may differ from LCM2015 when comparing parcels.
  - Data use and integration
    - The 10 m classified pixels preserve detail for fine features; the 25 m rasterised parcels and vector land parcels enable efficient aggregation and change tracking.
    - 1 km products support regional assessments and coarser-scale analyses; edge effects near coasts are noted.
    - Context rasters and classification scenes illustrate the importance of multi-source features to improve classification accuracy.
  - Implementation and future-proofing
    - With annual updates, data leaders should design workflows to accommodate method evolution and ensure consistent change detection.
    - The documentation provides clear guidance on class definitions, training data provenance, and display conventions to support consistent reporting across networks.

- Quick takeaways
  - LCM2022 delivers high-resolution, annually updated land cover data with extensive documentation on methodology, validation, and usage.
  - Key datasets: 10 m classified pixels, land parcels (vector), 25 m rasterised parcels, and 1 km summary rasters (GB and NI).
  - Validation demonstrates strong overall accuracy (86.1%), with known caveats around spectral confusion and coastal classifications.
  - Data are citable via DOIs; access through NERC EDS/UKCEH; supporting materials include colour schemes and display files.
