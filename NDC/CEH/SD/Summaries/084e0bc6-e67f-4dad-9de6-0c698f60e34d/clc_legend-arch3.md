# Monitoring environmental health measures for scrutinising policy

## Aim and context
- Identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and informing future decisions.
- Practitioners typically hold managerial roles within government departments or environmental quangos responsible for designing and implementing monitoring approaches.

## Who they are
- Managers in government departments or environmental quangos tasked with deciding on and implementing environmental health monitoring strategies.

## How they meet their aims
- Engage with stakeholders and experts to understand which measures are useful and to learn from others to avoid duplication.
- Locate and verify available data, often overcoming metadata shortcomings by contacting data originators.
- Add metadata as needed and, where possible, publicly share underlying data (a potential barrier).
- Commission new data to fill gaps, ensuring quality, openness, and data management standards at the data source.
- Ensure data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and presented clearly (via reports, charts, dashboards).
- Disseminate outputs, consult stakeholders, share underlying data where appropriate, and implement data governance processes.

## Data management and governance
- Emphasize data quality assurance, cleaning, transformation, analysis, and clear presentation of findings.
- Prioritize openness and appropriate sharing of underlying data.
- Establish data governance to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and kept up to date.

## Outputs and dissemination
- Produce outputs through reports, charts, dashboards, and other accessible formats.
- Engage in stakeholder consultation and ensure data transparency to support decision-making.

## Particular challenges
- Lack of data, including data that meet adequate standards.
- Limited access to data, including delays in obtaining it.
- Siloes within and between organisations hindering data sharing and coordination.
- Public-facing data-sharing requirements can deter use of existing datasets.
- Concerns about keeping data current hindering data sharing.
- Inadequate metadata making it difficult to assess data suitability.
- Data formats requiring significant transformation to be usable.
- Difficulties in communicating complex findings clearly.
- Establishing and maintaining robust data governance to ensure standards, storage, sharing, and ongoing updates.
