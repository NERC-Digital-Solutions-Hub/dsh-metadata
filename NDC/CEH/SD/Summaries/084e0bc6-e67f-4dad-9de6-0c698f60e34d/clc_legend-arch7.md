# GIS Specialists

## Aim
- Create data products, primarily map-based formats, that enable audiences to understand and explore relevant information.
- Focus on GIS-centered data analysis to produce map-based visualisations for policy colleagues, clients, and the public.

## Who they are
- Data analysts specializing in Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
- They develop map-based visualisations for diverse audiences, including policy makers, clients, and the general public.

## How they meet their aims
- Collaborate closely with end users to understand needs throughout the process.
- Find and verify data appropriate for their purposes.
- Clean, transform, and quality assure data; often integrate datasets from different resolutions.
- Analyse data to identify meaningful features and determine effective presentation methods.
- Present data as maps using GIS to clearly show spatial features.
- Test early prototypes and iterate based on user feedback.

## Particular Challenges
- Responding to requests that overlook data constraints rather than proactively prioritising work.
- Data scattered across many locations.
- Lack of data, especially at suitable resolutions.
- Inconsistent data standards.
- Large or complex datasets not packaged into manageable chunks.
- The effort required to clean and transform data.
- Building teams with sufficient GIS and data skills.
