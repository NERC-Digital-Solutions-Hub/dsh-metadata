# Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

- Purpose and scope
  - Metadata for Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets covering the UK and nearby territories (Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, Northern Ireland).
  - Supports environmental monitoring, land cover and land use assessment, and policy-relevant indicators within the Copernicus framework.
  - Datasets underpin monitoring of environmental change, biodiversity protection, climate change tracking, agriculture developments, and EU Water Framework Directive reporting.

- Datasets included
  - Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
    - Status map for 2018 for the UK.
    - Attributes: CLC classification codes (level 3), area (hectares), length, total area of features, remarks, and unique ID.
    - Projection: British National Grid; Transverse Mercator; GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum OSGB 1936.
  - Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
    - Updated 2012 map for the UK, revised during 2018 change mapping.
    - Same projection and datum as above; status map aligned with 2018 revision processes.
  - Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) for the UK (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
    - Change layer showing land cover changes between 2012 and 2018 (mapped directly).
    - Same projection, geographic scope, and MMU considerations as above.

- Dataset attributes and metadata
  - All datasets include: CLC classification codes at level 3; area (ha); length (where applicable); remarks; unique ID.
  - Metadata language: English; encoded with UTF-8.
  - Spatial extent: UK plus specified territories; geographic bounding box West -8.62 to East 1.76; South 49.88 to North 60.84.
  - Spatial resolution: denominator 100000 (scale context provided).

- Metadata standards and access
  - Metadata compliant with the EEA Metadata Profile (INSPIRE-compliant metadata with some extended elements).
  - Online resource and linkage provided; primary contact points include University of Leicester (originator), Defra (custodian), European Environment Agency (owner), and DG-ENTR (owner).
  - Use limitations reference GMES/Copernicus regulations, with conditions for open access and proper attribution.

- Lineage and methods
  - 2018 Corine Land Cover UK update: detection and mapping of land cover changes above 5 ha.
  - Imagery basis: Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 images from 2017; supported by Google Earth imagery for interpretation.
  - Production followed EEA technical guidelines using InterChange for CLC mapping; revision of 2012 map integrated into the 2018 workflow.
  - MMUs: 25 ha for status layers; 5 ha for change layers.

- Quality control and validation
  - Internal quality control by University of Leicester: each work unit interpreted by two people; use of InterCheck software; iterative feedback and edits.
  - External quality control by European Technical Team (CTT): two remote verifications in 2018 assessing harmonisation with European CLC2018 standards; error logging and corrective actions communicated to interpreters.

- Governance, provenance, and acknowledgments
  - Project executed by University of Leicester (Originator), Defra (Custodian), European Environment Agency (Owner), and European Commission DG-ENTR (Owner); supported by European Union Copernicus programme (Grant EEA/IDM/R0/16/009/UK).
  - Acknowledges collaboration with Specto Natura; metadata and data sharing governed by EU Copernicus licensing and attribution requirements.

- Relevance for monitoring frameworks
  - Provides a consistent, Europe-wide land cover dataset and change information essential for environmental monitoring, indicator development, policy evaluation, and cross-border comparability.
  - Supports tracking of ecosystem change, biodiversity, climate-related impacts, agricultural development, and compliance with EU environmental directives.
