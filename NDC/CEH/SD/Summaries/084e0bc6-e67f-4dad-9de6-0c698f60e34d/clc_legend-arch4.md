- Apply prior data analysis knowledge to shape the organisation’s data function.
- Consider data’s value for a wider community and may operate across partner networks.

## Who they are
- Management professionals focused on implementing an effective data strategy.
- Individuals who apply past data analysis experience to the organisational data function.
- Leaders who consider data’s role for a broader community, often collaborating across networks of partners.

## How they meet their aims
- Think about the whole data system end-to-end.
- Understand user needs (e.g., policy colleagues) as an ongoing process and may foster co-ownership of data products.
- Know what data is available, identify gaps, and verify data suitability to prioritise efforts.
- Source data through platforms, online searches, and outreach to others.
- Commission new data and creatively pursue data gathering when needed.
- Promote good analytical, presentation, and dissemination practices within their team.
- Ensure data assets are managed properly (format, quality, metadata, discoverability, updates).
- Validate that data products meet user needs through feedback and iterative improvements.
- Collaborate with the wider data community to support an effective data system.

## Particular Challenges
- Understanding user needs across diverse public audiences.
- Gaining an overview of available data due to fragmentation.
- Lack of data, especially at the required level of granularity.
- Paywalls and data protection barriers limiting access.
- Difficulty quickly verifying data content and format.
- Inconsistent data standards, variable data quality, and unclear metadata.
- Sector-wide coordination gaps, duplicated effort, and limited communities of practice.
