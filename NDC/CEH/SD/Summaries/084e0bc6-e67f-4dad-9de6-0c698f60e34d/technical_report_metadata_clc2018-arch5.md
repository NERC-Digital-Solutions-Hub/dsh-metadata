## Lineage and production (production process)
- Objective: Update the UK CORINE Land Cover data for 2018; identify and map land cover changes above 5 ha.
- Data sources: Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 imagery from 2017; supported by aerial imagery from Google Earth.
- Methodology: EEA technical guidelines; production using InterChange mapping support package for CLC changes; revision of the 2012 map.

## Quality control and governance
- Internal quality control: All Working Units (WUs) independently interpreted by two people; InterCheck software used; feedback loops ensured revisions before finalisation.
- External quality control: European Technical Team (CTT) conducted two remote verifications in 2018 (covering multiple WUs/interpreters) to ensure harmonised European CLC2018 standards.
- QC outcome: Ensures data quality and harmonisation across the European CLC 2018 dataset.

## Access, licensing, and use constraints
