# Analysts Answering Questions with Data

## Aim
- To find and analyse data to identify correlations, report findings, and make predictions about the likely impact of actions.

## Who they are
- They possess expertise in their topic combined with strong analytical skills.
- They seek statistically significant patterns, correlations, and create predictive models.
- They often work in government or large environmental bodies to inform practical decisions or in academic contexts.

## How they meet their aims
- They understand the user's needs and what data might address it, which may involve understanding requirements from those working on delivery and relying on goodwill to access topic expertise.
- They find and verify data sufficient to answer their questions, potentially extrapolating to fill gaps.
- They quality assure, clean, and transform data, combining different datasets.
- They analyse data, create models, look for or develop scripts (e.g., Python, R), and often test the analysis early.
- They discuss their approach and interpretation with colleagues or experts.
- They present findings in reports, using charts, clearly stating conclusions.
- They track data sources and may make the datasets created discoverable and usable by uploading them to portals with metadata.

## Particular Challenges
- A lack of data, particularly at the right scale or for local levels.
- Data is stored in ways that are hard to access, such as journals, reports, site data, and local authority data.
- Difficulty readily accessing datasets (e.g., multiple clicks, lengthy registration), which can lead to effort on 'red herrings'.
- Datasets are only known within specific academic or closed circles, making them hard to find if you don't already know they exist.
- Thinking about how best to analyse data and needing to rely on access to domain experts to help interpret data correctly or sense check the analysis.
- Unifying data from multiple sources and formats, dealing with variable quality and lack of standardisation, and working with 'wildly different' scales.
- Those working on public health faced stronger challenges around getting timely access to data and navigating data protection and risks of accidental disclosure.
- IT barriers were a major issue for many, including a lack of admin rights, access to old software versions, and coping with the heavy computational demands of large datasets.
- Promoting findings to achieve impact, particularly for academics.
- Data may also lack useful details such as administrative boundaries.
