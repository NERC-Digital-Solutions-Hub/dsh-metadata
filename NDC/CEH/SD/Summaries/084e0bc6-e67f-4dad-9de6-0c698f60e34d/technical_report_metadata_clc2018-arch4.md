# Metadata for Corine Land Cover data 2018. UK.

- Overview
  - Metadata report for three UK Corine Land Cover (CLC) datasets: 2018 UK status map (CLC2018_UK.shp), 2012 revised UK map (CLC2012rev_UK.shp), and Corine Changes 2012-2018 UK (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp).
  - Coverage includes the UK and its dependencies (Isle of Man, Channel Islands, Guernsey, Jersey, Northern Ireland).
  - Datasets contain CLC level-3 codes, area (hectares), length, area per feature, remarks, and a unique ID.

- Datasets and technical details
  - Dataset 1: Corine land cover 2018 (CLC2018_UK.shp)
    - Status map for 2018 for the UK.
    - Projection: British National Grid (Transverse Mercator); Geographic: GCS_OSGB_1936; Datum: D_OSGB_1936.
  - Dataset 2: Corine land cover 2012 (revised) (CLC2012rev_UK.shp)
    - Updated 2012 map reflecting changes mapped during 2018 process.
    - Same projection, geographic system, and datum as Dataset 1.
  - Dataset 3: Corine land changes (2012-2018) (CLC_CHA12-18_UK.shp)
    - Changes between 2012 and 2018, mapped directly.
    - Same projection and geodetic parameters as above.
  - Spatial scope and resolution
    - Geographic bounding box: West -8.62, East 1.76, South 49.88, North 60.84.
    - Spatial resolution denominator: 100,000 (1:100,000 scale).

- Metadata standards and online resources
  - Metadata language: English.
  - Hierarchy level: Dataset.
  - Metadata profile: EE A Metadata Profile (INSPIRE compliant with some extended elements).
  - Online resource and linkage: Copernicus/CORINE metadata portal (EEA/EIONET); file identifier CLC_metadata_UK; UTF-8 encoding.

- Lineage and method
  - Objective: detect, identify and map land cover changes above 5 hectares for the UK.
  - Data sources: Sentinel-2, Landsat-8 (2017 imagery); supporting aerial imagery from Google Earth.
  - Methodology: follow EEA technical guidelines; use InterChange software for mapping CLC changes; revision of 2012 map.

- Access, use, and licensing
  - Access governed by EU Regulation 1159/2013 (GMES) and related licensing; free, full, open access under conditions:
    - Users must inform the public of data source.
    - Do not imply official EU endorsement.
    - State if data are adapted or modified.
  - Data ownership and funding: EU; acknowledgment required for funded work; data produced under Copernicus framework.

- Quality control and verification
  - Internal QA: University of Leicester performed two-person interpretation per Working Unit (WU) with InterCheck software; feedback loops to interpreters.
  - External QA: European Technical Team (CTT) conducted two remote verifications in Feb and Jun 2018 across multiple WUs to ensure harmonised European CLC2018 standards.
  - Process ensured consistency between UK production and European CLC standards.
