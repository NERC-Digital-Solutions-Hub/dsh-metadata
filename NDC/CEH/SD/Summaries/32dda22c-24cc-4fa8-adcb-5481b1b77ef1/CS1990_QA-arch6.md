# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview
- A QA study of the 1990 Countryside Survey to quantify the accuracy and reliability of field recording, explain sources of observer error, and recommend methodological improvements for future surveys.
- Assessed variability due to large numbers of recorders, training, seasonal and site factors, and data handling across major field components.

## Aims
- Quantify the accuracy of field recording and change statistics from the 1990 survey.
- Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, time of year, plot location, information type, and regional factors (e.g., drought).
- Relate conclusions to previous comparative work (ITE surveys).
- Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics in future surveys.

## Methods
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares reassessed using original sketch maps for plot relocation; split between two independent assessors.
  - 1991: added photographs of individual plots and a self-assessment of a subset of squares; all 1 km squares from 32 terrain classes used.
- Sampling:
  - One quarter of each square resurveyed to include all six plot types; plot types include quadrats (200 m² X-plots; 4 m² Y-plots) and various linear/edge plots (road verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries).
- Relocation and plates:
  - Buried plates relocated where possible; relocation success tracked (plate and plot relocation rates).
- Data and analyses:
  - Species lists compared between times using multiple concordance indices; cover values also compared.
  - DECORANA (ordination) analyses to examine ecological shifts.
  - Landuse mapping and boundary coding evaluated for consistency; primary and descriptive codes analyzed.
- Annexes:
  - Detailed methods for field plots, relocation, photo annotation, and coding schemes; and variations in cover estimates by landclass.

## Key Findings

### Overall Recording Accuracy and Change Statistics
- Autumn 1990 QA showed about 60% concordance between original and QA species lists (overall % agreement ~60.9% when combining series; 45% in the initial autumn assessment).
- 1991 reassessment (with photographs) demonstrated an increase in mean species per plot from 20.2 (original) to 23.4 (1991 QA), and a significant rise in agreement when including 1991 data (overall 60.9% concordance; 1990 QA accuracy ~74% before removing certain seasonal/annual differences).
- After excluding seasonal differences (e.g., species not identifiable in the QA window), the apparent difference in species richness between years remained, indicating real ecological changes in some plots.

### Seasonal and Weather Effects
- Substantial portion of variation attributed to seasonal/annual changes (e.g., drought vs normal growing season) and management changes, especially in lowland arable and marginal lands.
- In upland areas, fewer seasonal effects observed; drought year amplified species turnover in more susceptible vegetation types.

### Plot Relocation and Recording of Plot Types
- Plate/plot relocation success improved with photographs and self-checks:
  - Autumn 1990: ~71% recovery rate for plates within 5 minutes; overall relocation categories included exact relocation, insufficient information, or non-relocation.
  - 1991: higher relocation success when photographs used; plate-based relocation remained time-consuming in unenclosed uplands.
- Y-plots (small 4 m² plots) were the most challenging to relocate accurately; photographs and enhanced ground markers helped but recommended improvements (e.g., marking, clearer photo annotations).
- Recommendation: use metal markers for plots where feasible; annotate photos with distance and nearby features to aid relocation.

### Species-Level and Group-Level Changes
- Across plot types, observed marked changes in species composition between 1990 and 1991; some species appeared more or less frequently due to climatic conditions rather than recording bias alone.
- Certain species (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis) showed genuine population changes; others (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis) largely reflected under-recording in the original survey.
- At the level of species groups, no significant difference in cumulative frequency across years for X plots, verges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries, or Y-plots, though individual species fluctuated with climate and land use.

### Cover Estimates
- Visual cover estimates for dominant species were compared; most differences were not statistically significant, though several key grasses and forbs showed differences between 1990 and 1991.
- Recommendation: train more explicitly on grass identification and include more bryophytes in field training to improve consistency.

### Ecological Gradient Shifts (DECORANA)
- Axis 1 shifts indicate movement along a gradient from upland to lowland vegetation; overall direction of change was consistent with longer-term ecological trends, though year-to-year variation existed.
- Plot-type-specific shifts showed variation but generally aligned with landclass aggregates (UP shows distinctive moor/heath vegetation).
- No single cause for large axis-score discrepancies; crop changes, relocation problems, and cover-value disagreements contributed.

### Landuse Mapping and Boundary Coding
- Primary landuse codes showed high concordance (about 88–95% depending on category); boundary codes were slightly less concordant (around 80–83%), with re-surveyings by the same assessors lending some inflated agreement.
- Level-of-detail codes (qualifiers) had variable agreement; overall mapping codes were reasonably robust, but interpretation differences remained.
- Noted difficulties with specific codes (e.g., marsh, upland vs moorland distinctions; hedges vs boundary types; forb cover codes lacking definitions).
- Recommendation: subdivide certain upland codes (e.g., 102 upland grassland vs upland improved meadow/pasture); recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type; restrict primary boundary codes to hedge vs other boundary types; expand code definitions to reduce misinterpretation.

### Mapping of Species Cover
- Point sampling showed that recording a dominant species at a point had an ~81% chance of retaining dominance in a later survey; co-dominant species had much lower concordance (around 34%).
- Overall mapping of vegetation units was generally consistent, with better concordance in unenclosed uplands than in enclosed areas; stronger concordance for the most evident species.

## Recommendations (Selected Highlights)
- R1: Retain lichens in surveys, with improved training and habitat context.
- R2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the initial survey timing.
- R3: Require surveyors to annotate photographs with plot location and features; link photos to sketches.
- R4: Use metal marker plates for plot localization where feasible; plan for more manpower in difficult upland relocation.
- R5: Improve quadrat positioning for small Y plots; photograph locations clearly showing surrounding features; use guidance to orient ground-based plots consistently.
- R6: Target bryophyte and grass identification in training; consider expanding allowable bryophyte taxa for certain habitat surveys.
- R7-R8: Expand landuse code clarity; clearly define boundary and hedgerow codes to reduce misclassification.
- R9-R10: Introduce specific codes for lowland rush pasture and wet heath; standardize mapping for these vegetation types.
- R11-R12: Simplify and standardize codes to improve reproducibility; emphasize mapping of the most prevalent species rather than all species for consistency.
- R12: Limit cover coding to the most prevalent species to enhance reproducibility and reduce subjectivity.

## Endnotes / Conclusions for Future Surveys
- Photographs and sketches are critical for accurate plot relocation, particularly in unenclosed areas.
- Ensure time-aligned QA (same year as original survey) to minimize climate-driven differences.
- Photographic annotation, ground markers, and clear feature references substantially improve data reliability.
- Training should prioritize grasses and bryophytes, and the mapping framework should be streamlined to reduce ambiguity in landuse and boundary coding.
- The QA exercise demonstrates that while the survey data are broadly reliable, careful attention to plot relocation, seasonal effects, and coding definitions remains essential to maintain data quality across future ecosystem surveys.
