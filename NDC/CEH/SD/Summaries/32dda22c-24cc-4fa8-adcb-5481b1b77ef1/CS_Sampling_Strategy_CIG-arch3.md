# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey up to 2007, tying current methods to three decades of development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Aims to understand how the sampling framework was derived, maintain temporal continuity, and support change detection and policy-relevant habitat estimates.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage and minimize bias across heterogeneous landscapes.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental-attribute based stratification of Great Britain into land classes to guide sampling.

- Historical development and approach
  - 1978 (CS1978): First nationwide ecological survey using 1 km squares as sample units, stratified by 32 land classes; eight samples per class (256 total) selected randomly from classified squares.
  - 1984 (CS1984): Sampling expanded by 50% within the same framework (12 squares per class; 384 total); emphasis broadened to land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB squares reclassified to reflect a broader dataset, enabling regional estimates; 508 squares surveyed; link to first Land Cover Map from satellite imagery.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Addressed representational imbalances caused by the revised land classification; introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); subdivided land classes into country-unit versions and added squares to ensure adequate representation; included upland habitat surveying module.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved policy needs; further subdivision into country-specific classes (creating 45 strata); added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; continued adjustments in England to maintain overall precision.

- Separate country estimates and upland focus
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales and Scotland) to align estimates with devolved policy needs.
  - Additional upland module (CS2000) funded to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales, supporting country-level reporting accuracy.

- Sampling framework details
  - Sampling units: 1 km squares; initial method used central squares of a 15 x 15 km grid with surrounding squares also classified.
  - Stratification: Land Classes defined by environmental attributes; classes used to allocate samples and calculate national habitat estimates.
  - Representation and class balance: Adjustments across CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007 to ensure adequate representation of new and subdivided classes within each country unit; class subdivisions increased the number of strata (e.g., from 32 to 40, then to 45).
  - Welsh adjustments: Wales received additional Welsh-specific classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and extra Welsh squares to improve Wales-only reporting; some English classes had reduced square counts to maintain overall balance.

- Data and estimates
  - National estimates are computed as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the area occupied by that class.
  - Results span England, Wales, and Scotland, with explicit notes on when estimates are derived from a unified GB classification versus country-specific classifications.

- Outputs and reporting
  - The sampling strategy underpins the Countryside Survey reports and country-specific environmental policy reporting.
  - Figures and tables (e.g., class maps and numbers of squares per class) illustrate the distribution of samples and the evolution of the classification system across surveys.

- Considerations for monitoring frameworks
  - Continuity vs. change: Balancing methodological continuity with necessary reclassification to meet policy needs and improve accuracy for Scotland, Wales, and England.
  - Representativeness: Ensuring adequate sample sizes across all land classes, including new sub-classes, to support precise estimates.
  - Devolution and reporting: Adapting the sampling framework to provide Wales-only and Scotland-only estimates while maintaining cross-survey comparability.
  - Upland habitat assessment: Introducing dedicated upland sampling modules to strengthen habitat estimates in higher elevations.
