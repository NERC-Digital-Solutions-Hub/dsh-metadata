# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

## Overview and Aims
- Documents the scope, results, and recommendations of the quality assurance (QA) conducted for the 1990 Countryside Survey.
- Aims:
  - (a) Quantify the accuracy of field recording and assess change statistics.
  - (b) Explain differences in recording in terms of observer error, season, plot location, information type, and region.
  - (c) Relate conclusions to previous comparative work on ITE surveys.
  - (d) Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.

## Methods at a Glance
- Two QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 survey squares; relied on original sketch maps; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Added photographs of individual plots and expanded itinerary; tested impact of photos on relocation and accuracy.
- Plot types (six total, subdivided):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots including road verges, hedges, streamsides, and boundaries
  - Buried plate relocation used to locate quadrats; supplemented by photographs and sketch maps
- Assessments included:
  - Plate/plot relocation success rates
  - Species concordance measures (four indices)
  - Estimates of species richness per plot
  - Cover estimates and their consistency
  - LANDUSE and boundary mapping codes and their agreement
- Data analysis approaches:
  - Concordance indices for species lists
  - Initial efficiency of recording
  - DECORANA ordination axis scores to examine ecological gradients and changes
  - Comparison of mapping codes and boundary classifications

## Key Findings

- Overall recording accuracy and species concordance
  - Initial overall percentage agreement across time 1 (1990) and time 2 (1991) around 60.9% (with emphasis on observer and seasonal effects).
  - Initial efficiency of recording (1990 survey) averaged about 74%.
  - 1991 re-assessment showed a significant increase in mean species per plot (1990: ~20.7; 1991: ~23.4); much of this attributed to real seasonal/annual changes (about 27%) versus improved recording efficiency (about 73%).
  - Seasonal/climatic variation (drought in 1990 vs comparatively normal 1991) influenced species detection and change statistics, particularly in lowland, arable, and marginal land classes.
  - For common species, frequencies tended to be stable across years, though some species showed apparent changes due to climatic differences or recording biases.
- Plot relocation and plate accuracy
  - Plate relocation success and plot recovery improved when photographs were used.
  - Autumn 1990: plate recovery around 71% with a five-minute search.
  - 1991 QA (including photographs): plots and plates relocated with higher success; breakdown into categories indicated: (i) plate and plot relocated; (ii) plate not found but location satisfactory; (iii) insufficient information to relocate.
  - Relocation agreement varied by plot type; X plots and road verges were easier to relocate than Y plots; higher reliability when using plates in enclosed land; Y plots remained the most challenging.
- Effects of photographs and QA design
  - The use of photographs substantially improved relocation accuracy, reducing misalignment and mis-location errors.
  - QA results improved when assessment included photographs and related to exact plot locations; seasonal and crop changes still affected accuracy, but photographs mitigated some relocation issues.
- Landuse and boundary mapping
  - Primary landuse codes showed high concordance across assessments (roughly 88–89% overall).
  - Boundary codes and descriptive qualifiers were less consistent; the mapping task generated substantial interpretive variation due to many codes and qualifiers.
  - Recommendations to improve mapping consistency included simplifying codes, subdividing certain upland land classes, and focusing on the most prevalent species for landuse mapping.
- Species and vegetation cover
  - Cover estimates varied between surveys; only a few species showed statistically significant differences in cover between 1990 and 1991 across plots.
  - The frequency of dominant species remained relatively stable for many widespread taxa; however, some species' frequencies changed due to climate or management changes.
  - Recommendations included improving bryophyte recording for mire/wetland communities and focusing training on distinguishing grasses with similar vegetative features.
- DECORANA (ordination) analysis
  - Axis 1 captured a gradient from shade-tolerant to shade-intolerant species, with upland moor/bog vegetation showing distinctive patterns.
  - The 1990–1991 shift in axis scores suggested a general but not always statistically significant continuation of longer-term ecological trends; year-to-year variability and landclass interactions were evident.
- Overall implications
  - Photographs are essential for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; distance measurements and compass bearings greatly aid relocation.
  - Conduct QA in the same year/season as the original survey to minimize climate/phenology-induced discrepancies.
  - Mapping codes require refinement to improve reproducibility, with emphasis on primary landuse codes and limiting the use of complex qualifiers in routine mapping.
  - Training should emphasize bryophyte and grass identification, and broader field characteristics to distinguish closely related taxa.

## Recommendations for Data Management and Future Surveys

- Recommendation 1: Retain lichens in general surveys, with training samples and habitat information to aid recognition.
- Recommendation 2: Conduct QA as close as practical to the time of the initial survey.
- Recommendation 3: Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to the relevant plot; include distances to nearby features and compass bearings on sketches.
- Recommendation 4: Use metal marker plates to mark X plots wherever possible in enclosed land; boats relocation benefits in challenging areas may require additional manpower.
- Recommendation 5: Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a survey tape, orient them NS, and place at the SE corner; improve orientation consistency.
- Recommendation 6: Acknowledge the manpower and time demands of relocation in upland areas and consider allocating additional resources for relocation efforts.
- Recommendation 7: Enhance methods for quadrat positioning in the field, especially for Y plots; ensure photographs clearly show the location with nearby distinguishing features.
- Recommendation 8: Sub-divide upland grassland (landclass 102) into upland improved meadow/pasture and upland grassland to improve code clarity; refine definitions for moorland/shrub heath vs blanket bog.
- Recommendation 9: Introduce a distinct lowland rush pasture code to improve landuse mapping accuracy.
- Recommendation 10: Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with its own primary code to reduce misclassification.
- Recommendation 11: Restrict the primary boundary code to hedge status and cover its composition with qualifying codes to reduce mis-matches.
- Recommendation 12: Limit vegetation mapping to recording the two most prevalent species at a point to improve reproducibility; reduce reliance on detailed cover of less prevalent species.
- Recommendation 13 (implicit): Improve handling and definitions of forb cover codes (138–140) which were not well defined in the handbook at the time.
- Recommendation 14 (implicit): Increase case-specific testing and training for bryophyte and key grasses to reduce mis-identifications.

## Conclusions and Implications for Data Leaders

- Photographic and sketch-based relocation dramatically improves data quality and field reproducibility.
- Maintaining year- and season-consistent QA is critical to minimize climate- or management-driven variation in ecological datasets.
- Clear, consistent mapping codes and a focus on the most informative variables (primary landuse codes, dominant species) greatly enhance data comparability across survey rounds.
- Training programs should emphasize identification of challenging taxa (grasses, bryophytes) and standardize cover recording to maximize cross-survey comparability.
- The QA framework presented provides a robust approach for assessing and improving data quality in large-scale ecological surveys, with actionable recommendations to strengthen data governance, metadata, and downstream analyses.

## Notes on Data Quality and Integrity (Supplementary Observations)
- A substantial portion of variation arises from plot relocation errors, mis-identifications, and seasonal/annual changes in species composition rather than true ecological shifts.
- Mapping consistency is generally strong for major landuse categories but more variable for boundary and descriptive qualifiers; refining codes and reducing reliance on complex qualifiers can improve reproducibility.
- The study supports the continued use of photographic aids and standardized field procedures as critical components of data quality assurance in ecological monitoring programs.
