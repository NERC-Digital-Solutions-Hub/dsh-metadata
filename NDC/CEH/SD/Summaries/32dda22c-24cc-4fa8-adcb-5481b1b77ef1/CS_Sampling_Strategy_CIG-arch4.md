# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest in a 30-year series of methodological developments of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Aims to explain how the sampling framework was derived, and why it remains tied to its predecessors for time-series change detection.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representativeness and minimize bias.
  - Stratification built from the ITE Land Classification, which groups land into classes based on environmental attributes.
  - Use of a sampling frame that links land classes to sample units (squares) to enable national estimates of habitat areas.

- ITE Land Classification and its evolution
  - Origins (mid-1970s): classification of land into discrete classes using environmental variables (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and initial use of Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) at 1 km squares.
  - 1978 (initial survey): 1 km squares classified into 32 Land Classes; sampling used the centre square plus surrounding squares to create a representative frame (6039 km squares classified; 256 squares surveyed across eight per class).
  - 1984: sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total) to reflect land-use and habitat mapping changes; still based on the 32-class framework.
  - 1990 CS1990: Land Classification extended to include every square in GB with a conservative revision; 508 squares surveyed; land-cover mapping linked via the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 2000 CS2000: necessitated adjustments for regional reporting (England with Wales, Scotland); classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata created; additional squares allocated to ensure representation; uplands module added to improve habitat estimates in upland England and Wales.
  - 2007 CS2007: Welsh-only reporting required; classes subdivided further into Wales-specific versions (five new sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; England adjustments accounted for the removal of Welsh squares; Wales became the most intensively sampled country in terms of strata representation.

- Sampling framework and samples by year
  - 1978: 8 squares per Land Class; total of 256 squares; national estimates derived from mean habitat area per square within each class times class area.
  - 1984: 12 squares per class; total 384 squares; continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990: 508 squares surveyed; all GB squares classified; national estimates based on the revised Land Classification.
  - 2000: expansion to accommodate separate country estimates; 40 strata; additional squares to ensure adequate representation by country; dedicated upland habitat module added.
  - 2007: Wales-specific structure with 45 strata; 43 extra Welsh squares; overall framework adjusted to preserve Wales reporting fidelity; English substrata slightly reduced in per-class sample counts in two classes (still considered adequate for reporting).

- National estimates and data consistency
  - The creation of national estimates depends on the Land Classification in use; transitions across classifications can affect comparability and stock estimates.
  - CS2000 and CS2007 explicitly addressed country-specific reporting needs (England with Wales, Scotland; later Wales-only reporting) to align with devolved policy contexts.
  - For cross-survey consistency, the report notes the trade-off between using the latest classification versus maintaining a stable historical classification.

- Data architecture and workflow
  - Hierarchical structure: Land Classes -> Strata -> Sample Squares -> Field Surveys.
  - Field data collection focused on habitat areas and landscape features, with later integration of land-cover data.
  - Outputs include maps and tables illustrating the sampling framework and per-class/sample distributions.

- Upland and country-specific modules
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
  - CS2007 introduced Wales-only reporting with country-unit sub-divisions of Land Classes and targeted increases in Welsh sampling to meet policy and legislative needs.

- Implications for data management and leadership
  - Illustrates the importance of evolving data stratification to meet policy needs while preserving longitudinal comparability.
  - Demonstrates how to handle devolution-driven reporting (England, Scotland, Wales) through country-specific classifications and targeted sampling intensification.
  - Highlights the need for explicit metadata about classification versions, sample allocations, and country-specific adjustments to enable proper data governance and reuse.
  - Emphasizes balancing representativeness (stratified design) with practical constraints (computing, sampling costs) and the risk of under-representation for certain classes.

- Notable methodological notes
  - Original use of 1 km squares centered within larger 15x15 km grids; 4 surrounding squares aligned to classification keys to form a full sample.
  - 32 Land Classes initially, expanding to 40 (1990) and 45 (2007) classes, with subdivisions to reflect country-specific reporting requirements.
  - Use of both ground survey data and satellite-derived land-cover information linked to the survey for enhanced habitat assessment.
