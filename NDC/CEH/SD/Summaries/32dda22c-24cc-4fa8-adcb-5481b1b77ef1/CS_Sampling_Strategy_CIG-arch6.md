# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification evolved and how it underpins the sampling framework.
  - Emphasises the link between sampling design, data collection, and national estimates of habitat features.

- Core ideas for data support
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of Britain’s countryside and to minimize bias.
  - Use of environmental stratification (ITE Land Classification) to structure sample selection and enable robust national/regional estimates.
  - Development of data products (maps, class proportions, sample locations) to support analysis and reporting at multiple geographic scales (England, Wales, Scotland).

- Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework
  - 1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 Land Classes derived from environmental attributes using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA).
    - Center squares of a 15 × 15 km grid were classified (1228 squares); surrounding four squares allocated to classes, giving 6039 classified squares in total.
    - Sampling: eight 1 km × 1 km squares per class (256 total).
    - Outputs used to estimate national habitat areas from mean habitat area per square multiplied by land-class area.
  - 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
    - Framework retained; sampling increased to 12 squares per class (384 total) to improve precision; 50% more squares overall.
  - 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify every 1 km square in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
    - First Land Cover Map of GB linked to this program; all previously recorded features repeated for 1984 baselines.
  - 1998 (Revised Land Classification for CS1990; 4th Field Survey)
    - Land Classification extended to allow Scotland-only reporting; number of classes increased to 40.
    - Resulted in some mis-match with the original 1228-class framework; most changes remained within neighboring classes, but affected national estimates.
  - 2000 (Countryside Survey 2000; CS2000)
    - Addressed need for separate England/Wales and Scotland estimates; introduced country-unit versions of land classes (40 strata).
    - Additional samples added (19 extra squares) to ensure adequate representation of new classes; further 11 extra squares to balance England vs Wales sampling rates.
    - Special upland module added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - 2007 (Countryside Survey 2007; CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting required due to devolved policy needs.
    - Welsh sub-divisions created: five new country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
    - 43 additional Welsh squares allocated; minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes (5e, 15e) drop to 4 squares per class to maintain overall precision.
    - England, Scotland sampling maps updated accordingly; Isle of Man samples replaced to ensure country-unit consistency.

- Country-specific reporting and sample design
  - Post-2000, estimates are produced for England with Wales and for Scotland as separate country units.
  - Classifications are subdivided by country where needed, and minor aggregations performed when representation within a country would otherwise be too sparse.
  - Isle of Man samples are replaced to maintain country-unit integrity.

- Uplands module
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands-focused sampling module (30 additional squares in upland/marginal upland classes).
  - Improves precision of upland habitat estimates for England and Wales within country-unit reporting.

- Sample counts and structure (highlights)
  - 1978: 256 squares across 32 classes.
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - 1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified).
  - 2000: expanded to about 40 strata; substantial growth to enable country-specific reporting; uplands module added.
  - 2007: 45 strata for Wales/England split; additional Welsh squares to ensure Wales-specific precision; some English classes reduced to 4 squares to preserve overall balance.

- How national estimates are derived
  - For each Land Class, multiply the mean habitat area per square by the total area of that class, then aggregate across classes.
  - When classifications change across surveys, national estimates can be computed using the latest classification (preferred for country-specific estimates) or the original 1990 classification (for cross-survey consistency).
  - Tables and figures (e.g., class maps and sampling distributions) illustrate the spatial distribution and sampling intensity by class and country unit.

- Outputs and usage
  - Produces habitat-area estimates and change statistics for the countryside at multiple geographic scales (GB-wide and country units).
  - Provides a framework for reporting Wales-only and Scotland-only habitat status and change information.
  - Supports data-driven policy and ecological reporting, with publicly shareable maps and class-based statistics.
