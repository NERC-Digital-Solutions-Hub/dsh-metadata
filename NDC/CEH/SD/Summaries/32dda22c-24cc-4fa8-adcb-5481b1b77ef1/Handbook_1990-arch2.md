COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

- Purpose and scope
  - Establishes a standardized, long-term framework to monitor changes in land use, vegetation, habitat types, and landscape features across Britain.
  - Aims to provide current datasets for scientific evaluation of ecological systems and to track trends and processes in the countryside.
  - Seeks to link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing (satellite imagery) to enable robust monitoring and policy evaluation over time.
  - Emphasizes data quality, consistency among observers, and transparent documentation to facilitate scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance.

- Study design and sampling framework
  - A two-tier, repeatable sampling design across GB with 512 sites planned for 1990, divided into six groups managed by six ITE Research Stations; each station covers about 85 squares.
  - Each square survey targets both habitat mapping and vegetation sampling, enabling comparison with earlier surveys (1977/78 and 1984) and providing a baseline for 1990 resurvey.
  - Sample structure per square:
    - Large vegetation plots: five 200 m2 quadrats (centered on representative habitats).
    - Additional plots: five 4 m2 quadrats (and/or adjustments for field conditions).
    - Five small quadrats of 2 m x 2 m placed in distinct semi-natural or natural land cover types within the square.
    - Optional linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides) to capture habitat continuums and edge effects.
  - Permanent markers and detailed documentation planned to enable precise relocation of plots in future surveys.

- Data collection, recording, and outputs (FAB and codes)
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) used to consolidate mapping, quadrat data, ownership, and vegetation records.
  - Comprehensive coding system for mapping and vegetation, with primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, boundaries, boundaries’ condition, and species composition.
  - API (aerial photograph interpretation) supports identification of features not visible on ground and helps delineate boundaries between semi-natural vegetation types; field decisions remain ground-truth.
  - For vegetation: standardized template lists around 200 common species; nested quadrats (from inner 4 m2 to full 200 m2) to capture species presence and percent cover in 5% intervals; allowance for unlisted species and bryophytes/lichens.
  - Output focus includes detailed maps, FABs, and data suitable for integration with satellite-derived land cover maps and national land classification systems.

- Standardization, quality control, and documentation
  - Acknowledges variation in field recording as a major source of statistical uncertainty; quality control to ensure consistency across observers.
  - Clear guidance on completing FABs neatly, including square numbers, ownership, and recording conventions.
  - Emphasizes field-based decision-making to avoid post-hoc coding discrepancies; exceptions require notes or comments.
  - Provides training materials and a field handbook to standardize procedures across all survey teams.

- Permissions, access, and field operations
  - Permissions from landowners/farmers are required for full square access; prior contact, and courtesy introductions are recommended to minimize refusals and delays.
  - Procedures in cases of partial or full access denial: abandon the square, or survey as much as possible, or relocate to a new square; maintain records for coordination with station coordinators.
  - Emphasizes engaging with landowners for background information and to facilitate data recording.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood includes FABs, aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, marking tools, sampling gear, and navigation aids.
  - Local ITE stations supply site location maps, additional field tools, and personal gear; surveyors provide personal waterproof clothing and other necessities.
  - Emphasizes the use of metal marker plates for permanent plot marking and standardized field protocols for recording and sketching plot locations.

- Mapping, boundaries, and field procedures
  - Mapping component focuses on annotating enlarged 1:10,000 maps with structured data codes; careful coding to reflect dominant land-use and boundaries.
  - Boundaries (e.g., fences, walls, hedgerows) must be mapped and coded; mark boundaries that no longer exist with a specific code.
  - API guidelines for interpreting boundaries and features (e.g., dashed lines for API-identified boundaries, crosses for isolate features).
  - Aerial imagery is used but ground-truthing remains essential; API data are guidance and should be overridden by in-ground evidence when necessary.

- Plot types, layout, and relocation rules
  - Quadrats: five large 200 m2 quadrats, plus smaller quadrats for finer resolution; fixed layout and permanent marking to enable relocation in future cycles.
  - Boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside linear plots: specified widths and orientations; placement rules ensure plots sample representative features while avoiding overlap.
  - Relocation rules cover 1978-era plots and new squares; if a feature no longer exists, relocate to the nearest permissible boundary or habitat type while documenting changes.

- Vegetation sampling methodology
  - Standardized recording sheets for vegetation plots (including ground cover, species, and percentage cover per species in 5% bands).
  - Nested quadrat procedure (progressively larger/outer plots) to build a complete vegetation census; permit for unlisted species and bryophytes/lichens with limited coding.
  - Permanent markers and field sketches accompany each plot’s data; photographs to document plots and surrounding landmarks.

- Species identification and data integrity
  - Species-level recording is expected, but there are sanctioned combinations for difficult taxa to maintain consistency with past surveys.
  - Bryophytes and lichens are recorded using a restricted list; preparation (collection) recommended for uncertain identifications.
  - Age, canopy, and cover metrics are integrated for trees and woodland features to capture structure and composition.

- Special sampling components
  - 7 Sampling: freshwater biota sampling (two streams per square, including flowing and standing waters) and additional NELUP freshwater biota sampling, focusing on water beetles and related biota.
  - Locations for aquatic sampling marked on plots; sampling protocols emphasize minimal disturbance and rapid transport of samples to Merlewood.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - All vegetation plots photographed to document general appearance and key landmarks; plot numbers displayed on boards for visibility.
  - End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.

- Timing, revisions, and governance
  - The handbook documents groundwork for a resurvey date around 1990 with enhancements in data capture, information-collection detail, and collaboration.
  - Revised in 1991 to refine procedures and ensure consistency with prior surveys and updated scientific objectives.

- Key outputs for analysts
  - A consistent, expandible dataset linking field-level observations with satellite-derived land cover maps.
  - Rich, standardized metadata on land use, vegetation, boundaries, ownership, and site context to evaluate environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Mechanisms for data quality assurance, accessibility, and integration into environmental monitoring programs.
