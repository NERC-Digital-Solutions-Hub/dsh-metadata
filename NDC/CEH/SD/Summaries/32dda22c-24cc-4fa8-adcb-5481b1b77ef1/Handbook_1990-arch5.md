# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Large-scale, multi-site ecological data collection across Great Britain to monitor land use, vegetation, and landscape features.
- Repeats earlier ITE surveys (1977/78 and 1984) with expanded sampling (512 sites) and enhanced data capture for trend analysis and model development.
- Emphasizes standardisation, data governance, metadata, and repeatability for scientific evaluation and policy-relevant insights.

## Data collection framework and governance
- Sampling design: six groups of squares; six ITE Research Stations; about 85 squares per group; 512 total squares; 128 new squares for 1990; 128 squares previously not surveyed to extend time-series.
- Teams and planning: flexible scheduling, travel-based logistics, no initial overtime; emphasis on minimizing site revisits; cost-conscious provisioning.
- Permissions and liaison: formal permissions for access to land and background information from farmers/landowners; deux types of landholders (old vs new to 1990 sample); procedures for refusals (abandon square or partial survey with documented alternatives).
- Data provenance and ownership: explicit recording of land ownership/tenure per square; farmer/landowner information collection; contact details and co-operation ratings to facilitate future surveys.

## Data capture, standards, and documentation
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): central data capture container combining mapping, quadrat data, and sampling information; paired with 6" (1:10,000) maps; designed for neat, unambiguous entry and later analysis.
- Coding framework: use of primary and secondary data codes; alpha codes to compress multiple numeric codes; universal codes (X universal codes; 888/999) for cross-referencing and long-term mapping.
- Documentation and quality control: accompanying definitions and field handbooks; standardised procedures to minimise observer variation; emphasis on complete, legible FABs; field judgments to be justified on the spot; post-survey checks to minimize omissions.
- Data products and archival: FABs, maps, aerial photographs, and field notes collected and transported to ITE stations (Merlewood) for consolidation; photographs and samples documented and linked to FAB entries.

## Field methods and data structure
- Mapping and plot types: major emphasis on mapping land cover and landscape features; use of large 200 m² quadrats, five small 2 m × 2 m quadrats, and multiple linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides, and boundary plots).
- Data capture targets: ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water/coastal features, vegetation cover types, species lists (with supported combinations for difficult identifications), and woodland attributes.
- Vegetation sampling and recording: detailed standard procedure for recording species presence and percent cover (with 5% intervals), aided by nested quadrats, boundary decisions, and permanent plot markers for repeatability.
- Permanent marking and relocation: metal plates and markers to locate quadrats; relocation rules for previously sampled sites; explicit procedures for repositioning in response to land-use change.
- Special components: aerial photograph interpretation (API) for identifying features not on OS maps; photography of plots for context and landmarking.
- 6.2 vegetation recording: systematic template for vegetation plots, including header attributes, species list (with many common GB taxa), woody plant and bryophyte/lichen components, and associated notes to support future re-identification.

## Data quality, standardization, and reproducibility
- Standardisation emphasis: 1990 survey stresses consistency across observers and years; quality control to maintain uniform approaches; standard templates for data entry and plot layout.
- Reproducibility mechanisms: permanent markers, fixed plot layouts, and relocation procedures to enable future resampling and comparability over time.
- Decision discipline: field-based decisions to avoid over-reliance on post-hoc lab interpretations; clear guidance on when to add notes or comments to recordings.

## Permissions, ethics, and stakeholder engagement
- Justification for permissions: legal access, farmer/landowner goodwill, and ability to obtain background information to improve data recording.
- Engagement approach: letters to owners; on-site verification by survey teams; escalation procedures if access is refused; courtesy contacts with known landowners and other stakeholders (e.g., anglers).
- Contingency handling: if access is denied to part or all of a square, predefined protocols determine whether to abandon or partially survey and how to document the changes.

## Data storage, management, and sharing
- Data storage: field data captured on FABs alongside maps, related photographs, and collected samples; physical storage at ITE stations with a systematic archive.
- Data management: central consolidation of FABs and associated materials; preparation of data for eventual upload to portals and catalogue-based data holdings (consistent with Data Steward aims).
- Data sharing and reuse: the handbook supports downstream data sharing by ensuring consistent metadata, code lists, and documentation to enable discoverability and reuse.

## Data lineage, metadata, and code culture
- Metadata strength: square identifiers, ownership, location context, and field conditions embedded in FABs; detailed definitions and code lists accompany data items.
- Coding discipline: extensive code lists for land cover, boundary types, vegetation, and woodland attributes; emphasis on primary codes with clear rules for dominant would-be classifications.
- Data interoperability: universal and standardized codes intended to support aggregation, trend analysis, and cross-year comparisons.

## Key challenges and mitigations
- Incomplete user/landholder picture: mitigated by proactive owner information and follow-up permissions; formal procedures to engage stakeholders.
- Timely data access: addressed through planning and flexible field arrangements; documentation to support future retrieval if access is limited.
- Heterogeneous systems/formats: addressed via standard FAB structure, coding conventions, and field handbooks to harmonize data capture.
- Large and complex data: mitigated by structured data entry, primary/secondary code separation, and careful field documentation to support analysis.
- Field recording variation: acknowledged as a major source of error; mitigated by rigorous quality control and standardized training.

## Endnotes and context
- Document produced by Colin Barr; revised February 1991; part of the Countryside Survey 1990 workflow and long-term ecological monitoring program.
- Core aim: deliver current, well-documented, and comparable land-use, vegetation, and landscape data to support scientific understanding and monitoring of countryside change.
