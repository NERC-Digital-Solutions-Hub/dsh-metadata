# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Aim and Context
- Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/78, 1984, 1988) to monitor changes in land use, vegetation, and landscape features.
- Combines ground-based field data with satellite/remote-sensing approaches to create current land cover maps.
- A two-tier approach: ground-truth field survey linked to bottom-up data and top-down remote sensing for comprehensive monitoring.
- Aims to update land use databases, assess ecological changes, identify trends, and inform policy/research.

## Survey Design and Scope
- Total of 512 squares to be surveyed in 1990; 128 new squares, 128 re-surveyed from 1988/previous years, and 256 continuing sites.
- Sample squares split into six groups, each with about 85 squares, covered by six ITE Research Stations.
- Each square planned to take roughly three survey days, with scheduling flexibility to minimize travel and maximize efficiency.
- Data collection designed to standardize recording across observers and ensure comparability with past surveys.

## Equipment and Field Materials
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) and various maps.
- Aerial photographs, weatherproof clipboards, coloured pens, survey poles, marker plates, measurement tools, and basic field gear.
- Station-provided resources (maps, reference materials) and surveyor-provided items (clothing, camera, etc.).

## General Field Survey Procedure
- Upon arrival, assess site conditions and potential access problems; seek permission for full square access before starting.
- Choose routes that allow full, detailed examination and ensure complete coverage; review records for consistency.
- Allow time to read back over recorded data to check for omissions and clarity.

## Permissions
- Securing access is essential for legal coverage and to maintain good relations with landowners/farmers.
- Prior contact via letters to known owners; coordination with occupiers where relevant.
- If permission is refused for all or part of a square, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon the square or modify data collection (replace or relocate) and how to record partial access.
- When access is granted, survey teams should record ownership details and maintain courteous engagement with landowners.

## Data Recording (Filling in the FAB)
- The Countryside Survey 1990 comprises three elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- Data recording is done on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) bound to 6" maps, using a standardized coding system (primary and secondary codes) to annotate features.
- Alpha codes (A, B, etc.) represent combinations of numeric codes to save space while preserving detail; use of uppercase letters is required; avoid ambiguous characters.
- Codes cover vegetation, boundaries, ownership, physiography, inland waters, land use, bracken and mosses/lichens, buildings, roads, verges, hedges, fences, and more.
- API (Aerial Photograph Interpretation) provides guidance for identifying features not readily visible on OS maps, with careful ground-truthing priority.
- FABs must be completed neatly; every page must include square number; careful recording of ownership, farm/landowner interactions, and spatial references to facilitate relocation.
- A detailed FAB includes sections for ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland waters, ground cover, tree/woodland, boundaries, buildings/communications, and designated/non-designated recreation areas, with explicit instructions on how to record and code each feature.

## Plot Types and Layout
- Quadrats (large): five 200 m2 quadrats placed in major vegetation types; nested quadrats within each to capture fine-scale variation; persistent marking and relocation planned for future surveys.
- Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed in natural or semi-natural land cover types in each square, located after mapping land cover types and within the available habitat spectrum.
- Linear plots: up to five 1 m-wide plots for hedgerows, streamsides, and roadsides; designed to capture vegetation along linear features with careful relocation rules.
- Boundary plots: positioned at the boundary of linear features, with location determined by dominant vertical feature (hedge/fence/ditch/etc.).
- Verge plots: additional plots placed along road verges to capture variations across road types (A/B roads, yellow-tarmac roads, construction tracks).
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots are referenced for consistency where applicable.

## Vegetation Recording and Identification
- Detailed vegetation recording using a standard form with a list of about 200 common species; additional unlisted species recorded as needed.
- Species are recorded to the species level when possible; certain difficult groups may be recorded as scientifically accepted combinations to maintain consistency with prior surveys.
- Cover is estimated in 5% bands; multiple layers may yield total cover above 100%.
- Mosses and lichens are recorded with a restricted list; bryophyte and lichen data are captured where feasible.
- Sketches accompany FABs to document plot layout, measurements, angles, and marker locations; permanent markers (metal plates) are used to facilitate future relocation.
- If a plot cannot be clearly categorized, notes and color-coding are used to convey complexity; large mosaics may require dominant code prioritization.

## Aerial Imagery and API
- API is used to aid feature identification not readily visible on OS maps; decisions on field interpretation follow ground-truthing and a hierarchy of evidence.
- API decisions should be reconciled with on-ground observations; ignore API guidance if clearly contradicted by field evidence.

## Freshwater Biota and Sampling (Section 7)
- Two freshwater biota samples per square: flowing-water biota (IFE) and standing-water biota (NELUP).
- Flowing-water sampling is described in a separate handbook; standing-water sampling (water beetles) is coordinated with Newcastle University’s NELUP program.
- Sampling locations are chosen to reflect the square’s characteristic water habitats (lakes, ponds, ditches, flushes, bogs, etc.) and are marked on the same map as the IFE point.
- Each sample is preserved (formalin or appropriate preservative) and labeled with square number, date, and surveyor initials; samples transported to the Merlewood station for processing.

## Photography and Documentation
- Photography of every vegetation plot is required to capture general appearance and key landscape features.
- Plot numbers are clearly displayed in photos, with positions of marker plates evidenced.

## Procedures Following Survey
- End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid post-hoc transposition unless data integrity is severely compromised.
- FABs and samples are transported to the ITE stations promptly for processing and analysis.

## Data Management, Quality Control, and Relocation
- Emphasis on standardization across observers to minimize recording variation and improve statistical accuracy of change data.
- Quality control implemented through a structured field handbook, accompanying definitions, and explicit relocation protocols for plots across survey years.
- Permanent markers and precise relocation guidelines enable repeated measurements over time to monitor long-term ecological changes.

## Logistics and Staffing
- Six ITE Research Stations coordinate the six groups; flexible travel planning and scheduling to manage costs and time.
- Permissions, landowner engagement, and field logistics are integral to successful data collection across the wide countryside.

## Endnotes and Contacts
- The 1990 (revised 1991) Countryside Survey handbook references Merlewood Research Station and Colin Barr as contributors; contact points for background information and data management are noted in the document.
