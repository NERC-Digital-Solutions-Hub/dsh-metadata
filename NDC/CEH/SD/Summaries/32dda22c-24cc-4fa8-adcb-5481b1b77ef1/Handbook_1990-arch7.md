# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

## Overview
- Aims to update land-use databases, monitor ecological changes, and link ground surveys with satellite imagery for broader analysis.
- Two-tier approach: ground-based field data plus satellite imagery; resurvey of GB land cover and landscape features.
- 512 squares planned; 128 new sites and 128 revisited sites to enhance data for national land-cover mapping and pattern detection.
- Emphasis on standardized field recording to enable robust scientific evaluation and trend detection.

## Data Capture Framework
- Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (the latter covered in Section 7).
- Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) consolidate data and maps; 1:10,000 scale (6") maps used for annotation.
- Codes are central: primary and secondary data codes; alpha codes compress multiple numeric codes; codes should reflect logical data order (e.g., boundary after a land-use code).
- Two types of coding: primary (required) and secondary; use uppercase alpha codes; avoid ambiguous symbols (e.g., X, 0, 1 as numerals).
- Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) supports boundary identification, updates to semi-natural vegetation boundaries, and no attempt to categorize land cover types from API alone.
- Entire square must be surveyed; if boundaries no longer exist, mark 999 (no longer present) and adjust mapping accordingly.
- Permanent plot markers (metal plates) and careful relocation procedures ensure repeatability.

## Mapping and Coding Standards
- Maps: primary geographic work uses enlarged 6" maps at 1:10,000 with standardized data boxes and codes.
- Boundaries: clearly delineated on maps; if boundaries have changed, annotate with appropriate codes and notes.
- Minimum mapping units: 1/25 hectare; minimum mappable length: 20 meters; Crosses mark point features (e.g., single trees, wells).
- Complex mosaics may require multiple codes; dominant primary code determines the main land cover category when necessary.
- For vegetation mapping, the field decision is final; avoid deferring critical coding to the lab.

## Plot Types and Recording Procedures
- Quadrats (large): five 200 m2 quadrats per square; nested 4 m2 quadrats within to capture detailed vegetation; five small 2 m x 2 m quadrats placed across diverse land-cover types.
- Linear plots: up to five per category (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides); 1 m wide; positioned near boundaries or dominant linear features; include location relocation rules.
- Boundary plots: placed at hedges, walls, fences; ensure plots are >10 m from each other when multiple linear types exist; orientation and placement relative to landmarks documented.
- Roadsides and verges: multiple verge plots across road categories (A/B roads, yellow roads, construction tracks); record verge lengths and determine which side of the road is sampled.
- Hydrology plots: stream/ditch/river plots, including extra wet plots to capture diversity of watercourses within a square; distance constraints enforced (no two plots within 10 m in many cases).
- Boundary and linear plotting guidelines include relocation rules if hedges/ditches disappear or change; the aim is to preserve representative sampling across habitat types.

## Data Coding System and Field Forms
- FAB (Field Assessment Booklet): integrates map annotations, quadrat data, ownership, farmer information, physiography, and vegetation coding.
- Codes are grouped by section (e.g., Boundaries, Buildings/Structures/Communications, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Woodlands, etc.).
- Primary vs. secondary codes: primary codes must accompany features; use dominant code first when mosaics occur.
- Alpha-numeric coding: long alpha sequences (A, B, AA, AB, etc.) used to condense multiple numeric codes; all alpha codes in upper case; no X or 0 in codes to avoid confusion.
- Buildings/Curtilages: differentiate between urban-curtilage and rural landscape; map-based groupings of gardens/grounds with trees if 10% or more cover.
- Universal and boundary codes: 6.2.x sections define standard categories for walls, fences, hedges, banks, verges, tracks, and more; 999 indicates “no longer on map.”

## Vegetation Recording and Species Identification
- 6.2.2 Vegetation recording uses standardized plot types with a uniform recording form.
- Species list includes around 200 common species; unlisted species can be added with lower priority after consultation.
- Cover estimates are recorded in 5% increments; total can exceed 100% due to layering; bare ground includes leaf litter and rock.
- Bryophytes and lichens are recorded from a restricted list; some species require collection for later identification.
- A sketch of each plot is mandatory; permanent markers and precise plotting coordinates support future resampling.

## Sampling and Freshwater Biota
- Section 7 covers sampling, including freshwater biota from flowing waters and standing waters.
- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP) involves two samples per square from standing waters (vegetated ponds, lakes, ditches, calcareous/acid flushes, bogs, etc.).
- Sampling methods emphasize clarity of site descriptions and careful handling of specimens (preserved in formalin for transport).

## Photography and Documentation
- Print photography required for every vegetation plot to document general appearance and landscape context.
- Plot numbers must be visible on a board placed at plot edge; photographs accompany FABs and maps.

## Procedures Subsequentsurvey and Logistics
- End-of-day checks to ensure no features are omitted; avoid post-hoc transcriptions unless necessary.
- FABs and samples should be returned to ITE stations promptly for processing.
- Travel and field-work logistics emphasize minimizing non-productive travel; flexible scheduling for field teams.
- Permissions: letters sent to landowners; keep owner/cooperation ratings to guide outreach; if access is refused, predefined procedures determine whether to abandon or relocate the square.

## Permissions and Ownership
- Documentation includes ownership details, contact information, and a rating scale for owner cooperation.
- If access is denied entirely or partially, follow predefined steps to either abandon or relocate the square, or adjust survey scope accordingly.
- Special notes on engaging farmers for background information and ensuring courteous, proactive outreach.

## Outputs and Applications
- The program aims to deliver a Britain-wide land-cover map by integrating ground-based field data with satellite imagery and remote sensing.
- The standardized FAB and coding framework enables long-term monitoring and comparability with earlier surveys (1977/78 and 1984) and future resurvey efforts.
- Data quality control emphasizes observer consistency, standardized field handbooks, and explicit documentation of uncertainties and changes.
