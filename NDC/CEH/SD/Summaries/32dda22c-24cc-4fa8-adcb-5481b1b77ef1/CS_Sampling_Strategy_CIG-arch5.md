# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

## Purpose andScope
- Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, and how sampling links to earlier surveys (1978–2000) to detect change over time.
- Emphasizes the need for representativeness and comparability across time while accommodating policy-relevant reporting (country-specific estimates).

## Core Concepts for Data Stewardship
- ITE Land Classification as sampling framework:
  - Stratifies Great Britain into land classes based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and their surrogates.
  - Original system produced 32 classes; later expanded to 40 (CS1990) and further to 45 (CS2007) with country-unit subdivisions for England, Wales, and Scotland.
- Sampling units and design:
  - Primary unit: 1 km x 1 km squares; a center square plus surrounding squares are classified to assign the class.
  - Early strategy used stratified random sampling within land classes to avoid bias.
- Time-series sampling:
  - CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007 datasets and reports underpin change detection and trend analysis.

## Evolution of the Land Classification and Sampling
- 1978 (First framework):
  - 32 ITE Land Classes derived from 1228 central 1 km squares; eight samples per class (256 total) for national estimates.
- 1984:
  - Increased sample size to 12 squares per class (384 total); national estimates still based on the original 1978 classification.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification):
  - Revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed; added linkage to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - National estimates calculated from the expanded 1 km square framework; some reclassification occurred.
- 2000 (New Land Classification and separate country estimates):
  - Major revision to allow England & Wales and Scotland reporting as separate country units.
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit variants; total strata increased to 40; additional samples allocated to ensure representation.
  - Included an uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland England/Wales.
- 2007 (Welsh reporting adjustments and further refinements):
  - Wales receives more tailored treatment to enable Wales-only reporting.
  - Five new Welsh sub-classes created; 43 additional Welsh squares added; England adjustments minimal but some classes remain with fewer squares.
  - Final framework for CS2007 comprised 45 strata with updated country-specific sampling.

## Data Structure and Documentation
- Class and geographic mapping:
  - Tables and figures (Figures 4–7 in the document) illustrate revised land-class maps and sampling frameworks for England with Wales and Scotland, and for the sample squares by country.
- Sample allocation and counts:
  - Detailed tables (e.g., Table 2 and Table 3) document the number of squares per class, per survey year, and per country; these figures underpin national and country-based estimates.
- National estimates and consistency:
  - Note that switching land-class schemes between surveys affects the consistency of stock estimates; the report recommends using the latest classification for GB-wide estimates, while acknowledging older classifications for cross-survey comparability.

## Data Quality, Limitations, and Challenges
- Representation gaps and corrections:
  - Some land classes were under-represented in Wales, prompting additional Welsh samples to ensure robust Welsh-class estimates.
   - Distributional shifts occurred when updating classifications; some non-matching squares fell into neighboring classes, preserving class means but altering representation.
- Historical constraints:
  - Early computing power limited exhaustive classification; practical sampling used center squares and surrogate classifications.
- Policy and reporting implications:
  - Requirements for country-specific environmental policy reporting drove the England/Wales/Scotland separation and the Wales-only adjustments in 2007.

## Practical Implications for Data Management
- Provenance and versioning:
  - The Land Classification evolved across CS1978–CS2007; data stewards must track classification versions to ensure correct interpretation of estimates by year and country.
- Metadata and documentation:
  - Rich methodological documentation, acknowledgements, and references accompany the sampling strategy to support reuse and transparency.
- Data access and dissemination:
  - Public-facing outputs include main survey reports (CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and associated maps and tables; methodology documents underpin data provenance and reproducibility.
