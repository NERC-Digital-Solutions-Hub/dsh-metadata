# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Aimed at updating land-use and ecological data to support monitoring of countryside changes and to link bottom-up field data with top-down remote sensing.
  - Built on a two-tier approach: comprehensive ground-truth field surveys plus satellite imagery/land-cover mapping to create current, linkable datasets.
  - Emphasizes standardised, high-quality data collection to enable robust trend analysis and modelling of ecological systems.

- Study design and sampling
  - 512 squares surveyed in 1990, with 128 new squares and 128 previously recorded; aim to capture changes in land cover, vegetation, and landscape pattern.
  - Fieldwork organized into six groups, with six stations responsible for about 85 squares each.
  - A two-tier sampling framework:
    - Large vegetation quadrats (200 m2) plus nested smaller quadrats for detailed vegetation recording.
    - Five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) in natural/semi-natural land cover types per square.
    - Up to five linear plots (boundary, hedgerow, streamside, roadside) per square to capture edge and linear vegetation patterns.
  - Permanent markers and repeatable plot locations to enable precise relocation in future surveys.

- Data governance, standards, and quality
  - Central goal: standardise field recording across observers to ensure data comparability over time.
  - Field Handbook defines guidelines; observers must qualify ambiguous classifications; explicit emphasis on quality control and consistent methodology.
  - Data recorded using Field Assessment Books (FABs) with structured codes; emphasis on:
    - Distinguishing primary vs secondary codes.
    - Using dominant/most representative primary code first when multiple apply.
    - Avoiding ambiguous symbols (e.g., no use of X or 0 as codes); uppercase alpha codes preferred.
    - Logical coding order (e.g., boundary type codes linked to surrounding land-use codes).
  - Mapping and documentation rules ensure traceability, with clear guidance for boundaries, plots, and feature classifications.
  - Aerial Photograph Interpretation (API) used to assist feature identification and boundary delimitation, but ground truth governs final coding.

- Data collection components and workflow
  - Data collection elements
    - Mapping (6" maps at 1:10,000) with coded annotations for land use, vegetation, boundaries, and other landscape features.
    - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) compiling maps, quadrat data, ownership, and description sheets.
    - Vegetation data from plots including species inventories, cover estimates (in 5% bands), and, where necessary, collection of unidentified specimens.
    - Sample collection for restricted taxa (Bryophytes and Lichens) and a predefined list of common plant species to record.
    - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE) from flowing waters and NELUP sampling from standing waters, with standardized labeling and preservation procedures.
  - Plot types and layout
    - Large Quadrats: 200 m2, with nested quadrats for detailed cover and species data; permanent markers installed for relocation.
    - Small Quadrats: 2 m x 2 m, used within diverse habitats to capture fine-scale variation.
    - Linear plots: Hedge/Boundary, Streamsides, Roadsides; 1 m wide strips recorded along the dominant linear feature, with additional plots where verges are wide enough.
    - Verges and roads: additional plots across road categories to capture road-associated vegetation mosaics.
  - Data capture specifics
    - Comprehensive identity and ownership sheets to document landowners, tenants, and accessibility permissions.
    - Field sketches and photographs to accompany FAB entries.
    - Permanent marking of quadrats with metal plates or field-boundary references to aid future relocation.
    - Detailed procedures for relocating 1978 plots; rules for moving or omitting plots when hedges or access have changed.

- Permissions and field ethics
  - Emphasises obtaining permissions to access all parts of a square to avoid wasted field effort and to maintain good relations with landowners.
  - A structured process for contacting landowners and farmers, with steps to handle refusals (abandon square, or survey remaining accessible portions where possible).
  - Documented ownership and contact information to support ongoing engagement and potential future participation.

- Data products and outputs
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) as the core data capture artifact, containing:
    - Map-based data, ownership, and land-use attributes.
    - Vegetation coding across multiple plots with nested species inventories and cover estimates.
    - Notes on changes, boundary alterations, and observations from field visits.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation outputs to support feature identification and boundary delineation.
  - Freshwater biota samples and standardised metadata for lab processing and linkage to field data.

- Practical challenges and considerations
  - Variation in field recording can drive statistical uncertainty; standardisation and quality control are critical.
  - Data gaps due to access restrictions or paywalls/permissions can impact sampling balance; explicit procedures exist to mitigate or document such cases.
  - The handbook provides extensive conventions for coding, recording, and resolving ambiguous situations in the field to ensure consistent long-term data comparability.

- End-of-survey procedures
  - Daily data checks to ensure completeness and avoid omissions.
  - Timely transport of FABs and samples to ITE stations for processing.
  - Documentation of any post-hoc map corrections or data transpositions only in exceptional damage scenarios.

- Reference and context
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/78 and 1984) and aligns field data with satellite-era land-cover mapping.
  - The project foregrounds long-term monitoring through repeatable plots, standardized protocols, and integrated data management to support ecological change analysis.
