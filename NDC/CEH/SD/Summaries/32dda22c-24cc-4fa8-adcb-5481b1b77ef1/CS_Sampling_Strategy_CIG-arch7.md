# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the sampling strategy for the Countryside Survey field element, linked to the evolution of the ITE Land Classification over 30 years.
  - Emphasizes stratified, representative sampling to detect change in Britain’s countryside; essential for time-series analyses and policy-relevant estimates.

- The ITE Land Classification: foundation for sampling
  - Developed from stratified ecological classification work (1960s–1970s) using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to define land classes.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to cluster 1 km squares into distinct land classes; early approach classified a subset of squares due to computing limits, with surrounding squares also allocated to classes.
  - Over time, the classification expanded and was adjusted to support national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

- Sampling framework across Countryside Survey cycles
  - 1978 CS (Initial Land Classification)
    - 32 land classes from 1 km squares; eight samples per class; total of 256 squares surveyed.
    - Center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid used; surrounding four squares added for each centre; classification covered about 6039 km squares.
  - 1984 CS (Second land use survey)
    - Maintained the same framework but expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384); eight squares per class from 1978 were retained.
  - 1990 CS (All Squares Land Classification)
    - Classified all 1 km squares in GB using an expanded, more consistent framework; 508 squares surveyed; added a repeat vegetation quadrat survey and landscape features.
    - Linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite imagery.
  - 1990 CS adjustments and methods
    - Greater regional/local relevance; some squares changed class; national estimates based on the revised classification.
  - 2000 CS (Developments for CS2000)
    - Recognized need for separate country estimates (England & Wales vs Scotland) and better upland habitat estimates.
    - Land Classes subdivided into country units; total strata increased to 40; 19 additional squares added to ensure adequate representation; some reallocation to maintain representation across country units.
    - Introduction of an upland module to improve statistical accuracy for uplands in England and Wales.
  - 2007 CS (Developments for CS2007)
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven changes after devolution.
    - Sub-divided Land Classes into dedicated Wales/England variants (five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); 45 strata (up from 40).
    - Added 43 Welsh squares to achieve minimum representation in new Welsh classes; England adjustments did not require additional squares in most cases, though two English classes (5e, 15e) have only four squares each.
    - Wales received focused sampling; England and Scotland adjusted accordingly.
  - Summary numbers (highlights)
    - CS2000 total GB sample: 569 squares; Wales and England-specific redistribution implemented to enable country-specific estimates.
    - CS2007 total GB sample: 591 squares; refined country-unit stratification to support Wales, England, and Scotland reporting.

- Country-level reporting and upland focus
  - Separate country estimates introduced to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-specific results, reflecting policy and legislative needs.
  - Wales required additional Welsh-class representation and Wales-only reporting capabilities; upland habitat sampling expanded to improve accuracy in upland regions.

- Outputs and data representation for GIS use
  - Land Classification maps (e.g., original and revised maps for England with Wales and Scotland) used as spatial stratification layers.
  - Tables and figures documenting the number of squares per class and per country (e.g., Tables 2–4, Figures 4–7, and Table 3 summarizing CS2007 square counts).
  - For cross-era consistency, national estimates may use the latest classification within each survey, though direct comparability can be affected by classification changes.

- Key considerations for GIS specialists
  - Stratified sampling informs map-based data products; ensure alignment of land-class codes across survey years when comparing time series.
  - When producing country-specific outputs, apply the appropriate country-unit Land Class subdivisions and account for any reallocation or aggregation in underrepresented classes.
  - Consider upland modules and their added sampling when modeling habitat extents and changes in England and Wales.
  - Be mindful that changing the underlying Land Classification can affect the consistency of stock estimates between surveys; use the most current/class-consistent classification for national estimates per survey cycle.
