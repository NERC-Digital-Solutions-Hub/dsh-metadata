# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990 SITES

## Overview and Aims
- Document describes the Countryside Survey 1990 field methodology for sampling land use, land cover, vegetation, and landscape features across Great Britain.
- Objectives include updating land-use databases, monitoring ecological changes, linking ground-truth data with satellite imagery, and enabling modelling of ecological processes.
- Builds on earlier ITE surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1988) and plans a two-tier approach to ground-truth and remote sensing integration.
- Emphasises standardised field recording, data quality control, and making datasets discoverable with metadata.

## Study Design and Sampling
- Survey area: GB countryside; focus on rural environment; aims to detect ongoing landscape changes.
- Sample structure: 512 squares planned for 1990, divided into six groups of roughly 85 squares each, with six ITE Research Stations coordinating.
- Coverage: 128 squares new to 1990; 128 previously recorded; relocated or replaced where land use changed.
- Sampling rationale: proportional sampling across land-cover types; randomization used when sites change or become unsuitable; flexible scheduling to fit access and logistics.
- Timing and deliverables: 1990 resurvey with enhanced detail; permanent markers planned for plot relocation and long-term monitoring; data designed to be combined with top-down remote sensing.

## Data Collection Framework (FAB) and Recording
- Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling; sampling expanded to vegetation plots and linear features.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): consolidated data recording package including large maps, codes, ownership, farmer information, and physical features.
- Mapping scale: 1:10,000 enlarged maps; data coded using primary/secondary codes to allow complex feature descriptions.
- Data quality and consistency: standardised recording handbook; emphasis on observer consistency; multiple quality-control checks planned during 1990 survey.
- Data provenance and accessibility: datasets created and uploaded with metadata to ensure discoverability and usability.

## Permissions and Access
- Permissions required to access all parts of survey squares; governance to maintain good relations with landowners and to obtain background information.
- Procedures for refusals: abandon the square, replace with a random new square, or adapt surveying to available accessible parts; emphasis on prior contact and courtesy.

## Equipment and Field Logistics
- Equipment provided by Merlewood and local ITE Stations; includes FABs, aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, markers, sampling gear, navigation, and safety gear.
- Local landowner engagement materials and field handbooks supplied to survey teams.
- Travel and scheduling: local travel preferred; no overtime initially; time-off-in-lieu for substantial overtime; cost efficiency favours day trips rather than overnight stays.

## General Field Survey Procedure
- On arrival: assess access and problems; obtain permission for full square access when possible.
- Route planning: choose a route enabling full, detailed examination; aim for complete coverage of the square.
- Post-survey checks: review records for omissions and ensure clear presentation.

## Data Recording and Coding System
- FAB and data sheets use a hierarchical coding approach with primary and secondary codes to describe land cover, boundaries, and features.
- Codes cover a wide range: land use, physiography, boundaries (fences, walls, hedges), buildings/communications, and vegetation types.
- Alpha codes: used to compress multi-code information on maps; capital letters preferred; avoid ambiguous characters; when necessary, double-letter combinations are used.
- Universal and project-specific codes: universal codes (X) cover common features; project-specific lists enumerate detailed vegetation, boundary types, boundary conditions, and woodland categories.
- Boundaries and features: specific rules for marking actual vs. interpreted boundaries; “no longer present” boundaries coded as 999.
- Vegetation and flora: 200 common plant species targeted; bryophytes and lichens documented; 5% cover categories used to estimate abundance; combinations permitted where species are not easily distinguishable.
- Woodland and trees: use woodland codes from the woodland sheet; separate coding for canopy structure, age, height, and management status; double-coding of mixed environments where necessary.
- X Universal codes: include categories like 888 (new to map) and 999 (no longer on map).

## Mapping and Aerial Photography Interpretation (API)
- API supports identification of features not on OS maps (isolated trees, boundary demarcations); boundaries identified via API may be adjusted on-ground.
- API conventions involve removing non-essential map details, using dashed lines for interpreted boundaries, and marking isolated features with crosses.
- Final API data serve as guidance; field judgment overrides API where ground evidence contradicts.

## Field Sampling Design and Plot Types
- Large quadrats: 200 m2 (with nested 4 m2 plots) to capture vegetation mosaics; positioned to represent habitat types; marked on maps with fixed permanent markers.
- Small quadrats: five 2 m x 2 m quadrats per square placed in natural or semi-natural land-cover types not already represented by large quadrats.
- Linear plots: up to five linear plots along hedgerows, streamsides, or roadsides; defined 1 m wide strips adjacent to dominant linear feature; location choices guided by 1978 rules for locating linear plots.
- Boundary, hedgerow, streamside, and roadside plots: location rules ensure plots reflect the dominant feature and avoid overlap; permanent marking with metal plates; distances and bearings sketched.
- Relocation rules: for squares surveyed in 1978, relocate old plots as closely as possible; when hedges or streams have changed, move plots to reflect current landscape while maintaining comparability.
- 1978 rules for locating linear plots: standardized methods for hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides; ensures cross-square comparability.

## Vegetation Sampling Methodology
- Plot establishment: quadrats oriented to north-south and east-west; nested plots systematically record species in each sub-quadrat; final 200 m2 quadrat provides overall cover estimates in 5% increments.
- Permanent markers: metal plates or boundary references ensure repeatability for future surveys; precise location documented on FABs.
- Data capture within plots: all vascular plants recorded; restricted lists for bryophytes/lichens; sketch maps accompany recording forms; unlisted species documented separately.
- Freshwater biota sampling (IFE and NELUP): two samples per square from standing waters; detailed sampling protocol maintained separately; local sample transport to Merlewood.

## Photography
- All vegetation plots photographed to capture general appearance and landmark context; plot number displayed on a board at the plot edge.

## Procedure Subsequent to Survey
- End-of-day checks to ensure data completeness; avoid post-hoc transcription unless necessary due to damage.
- Prompt transport of FABs and samples back to ITE stations for processing.

## Data Output and Impact
- The survey is designed to yield robust, standardised datasets suitable for statistical analysis, trend detection, and modelling.
- Emphasises data provenance, reproducibility, and discoverability through descriptive metadata and open data practices.
- Includes a structured framework for integrating field data with satellite-derived land-cover maps and other remote-sensing products to support downscaling to local levels and higher-level ecological interpretation.
