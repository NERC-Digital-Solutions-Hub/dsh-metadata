THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Introduction and aim
  - The field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007 is the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification, originated in 1978.
  - Purpose: provide a representative, stratified framework to detect change in Britain’s countryside and to support national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
  - Core approach: stratified, random sampling using the ITE Land Classification to divide land into homogeneous strata.

- The importance of stratification
  - Pure random sampling risks bias by chance extremes; stratification ensures all parts of the population are represented.
  - Ecological stratification mirrors variation in land types, elevations, vegetation, and land use; multiple factors create multiple strata for robust inference.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification
  - 1970s: Early work by Bunce and Shaw, using quadrats and environmental attributes to classify land into vegetation/land-use groups via a multivariate approach (Indicator Species Analysis, ISA).
  - 1 km square sampling unit chosen for national survey feasibility; a central square plus surrounding squares were classified to build the initial stratification.
  - 32 Land Classes described by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, rainfall, etc.) to capture the variation across Great Britain.
  - This classification underpinned the sampling framework for subsequent surveys and national estimates.

- The sampling framework across surveys
  - 1978 (CS1978) – Initial field survey
    - Use of 32 Land Classes; 1228 centre squares (15 x 15 km grid) classified; 4 surrounding squares per centre classified.
    - Final classification covered 6039 km squares; 8 km squares per class surveyed (total 256).
    - National habitat area estimates calculated as mean area per square within a class times the land area of that class.
  - 1984 (CS1984) – Second field survey
    - Employed the same Land Classification; increased sampling to 12 squares per class (total 384).
    - Results published later; national estimates continued to rely on the 1978 classification for consistency.
  - 1990 (CS1990) – All Squares Land Classification and third field survey
    - Shift to a complete GB-wide Land Classification using data from all 1 km squares; urban and sea corrections included.
    - 508 squares surveyed; retained the features from 1984 plus a repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats.
    - Results published with the new, comprehensive classification.
  - 2000 (CS2000) – Developments and broader representation
    - Land Classification extended to classify every 1 km square; the best-performing multivariate approach produced a revised classification.
    - Issues noted: some classes underrepresented; need separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and the need for reliable upland habitat estimates.
    - Changes to framework:
      - Class sub-division into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata rather than 32).
      - Class aggregation where necessary to maintain representation within countries.
      - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes (minimum 6 squares per new class); extra allocation to balance between England and Wales; Wales-specific refinement for Land Class 17.
      - Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England squares.
    - Upland module introduced to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
  - 2007 (CS2007) – Wales-focused reporting and further refinement
    - Wales-only reporting requirements driven by devolved policy needs led to further Wales-specific adjustments.
    - Welsh-class sub-divisions created (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w), increasing strata to 45.
    - Additional Wales squares added (43 more in Wales, minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); England classes adjusted with some reductions (some classes in England remain with 4 squares but deemed acceptable for precision).
    - England, Wales, and Scotland distributions updated; revised class maps provided for the England-with-Wales and Scotland framework; Wales-specific sampling expanded to support country-unit estimates.

- Separate country estimates and upland sampling
  - The CS2000 framework introduced separate country estimates (England with Wales and Scotland) using country-specific squares rather than a GB-wide mix.
  - Additional country-unit subdivisions and aggregations created to ensure robust estimates within each country.
  - An uplands module (CS2000) added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland Land Classes to improve habitat estimates for uplands in England and Wales.

- Data usage and national estimates
  - National estimates are derived from the mean characteristics of squares within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - The Land Classification framework has evolved to balance consistency and relevance across time, enabling country-specific and regional reporting while maintaining a link to historical time-series data.

- Note on classification changes and comparability
  - The 2006 scoping study cautions that changing the basic Land Classification affects the consistency of national estimates.
  - For CS2007, the preferred approach is to use the latest classification to maintain internal consistency, even though cross-survey comparability may be impacted.
  - Table 4 in the document illustrates sample sizes per class under the original 1990 classification for historical comparability.

- Summary
  - Countryside Survey has evolved from a 32-class GB-wide stratification to a nuanced, country-specific framework with up to 45 Land Classes.
  - The sampling strategy consistently uses stratified random sampling anchored in the ITE Land Classification to produce robust, reproducible estimates at GB, country, and upland levels.
  - Adaptations over time (country units, Wales-focused adjustments, upland modules) reflect policy needs and the desire for more precise, localised habitat status information.
