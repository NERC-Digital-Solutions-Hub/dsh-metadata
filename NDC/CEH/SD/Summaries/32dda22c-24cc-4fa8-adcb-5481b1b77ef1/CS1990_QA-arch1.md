# 1990 Countryside Survey: Quality Assurance Exercise

- Aims of QA: quantify accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, explain differences in recording, relate conclusions to previous work, and recommend methodology changes to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics.
- Context: large teams of recorders introduce variation; QA examined observer error, seasonal effects, plot relocation, plate/location relocation, and mapping accuracy.

## Methods and approach

- Two QA phases:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 original survey squares; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: expanded QA using one 1 km square from each of the 32 terrain classes; included photographs of plots to aid relocation; additional self-assessment of squares.
- Plot types sampled within squares (six major types):
  - Quadrats: 200 m2 (X-plots) and 4 m2 (Y-plots)
  - Linear plots (1x0 m) including road verges, hedges along streamsides, boundaries, etc.
- Relocation and data collection:
  - Buried metal plates marking quadrat corners were relocated where possible.
  - In 1991, photographs aided re-establishment of plot positions.
  - Nine predetermined points per quarter-square to record landcover and boundary features; standard Countryside Survey 1990 procedures used.
- Data comparisons and metrics:
  - Species concordance between time 1 (T1; original survey) and time 2 (T2; QA) using multiple indices (overall % agreement, agreement, etc.).
  - Distinctions made between observer error, seasonal effects, and genuine ecological change.
  - Mapping and land-use codes evaluated for concordance between original survey and QA.

## Key findings

- Overall survey agreement and accuracy:
  - Initial QA (Autumn 1990): % agreement around 45% for species lists; later analyses suggested overall agreement around 60–61%.
  - Full 1991 QA: overall percentage agreement for species between T1 and T2 improved to about 60.9%.
  - Initial efficiency of recording (1990) averaged about 74% after accounting for time- and location-related variations.
- Change in species numbers and reliability:
  - 1991 QA showed a highly significant increase in mean species number per plot for all plots combined (1990 mean ≈ 20.7 vs 1991 ≈ 23.4; p ≈ 0.009).
  - In upland plots, increases were less pronounced; in lowland arable plots (LC), accuracy tended to be lower, while other land classes (LG, MA, UP) showed different patterns.
  - Some observed changes attributed to real ecological changes (e.g., certain weed increases) and some to seasonal or management changes (e.g., crop shifts, herbicide use).
- Plot relocation and plate findings:
  - Plate relocation success in autumn 1990 was 71% within a five-minute search.
  - In 1991, relocation outcomes varied by plot type, with higher relative success for some types when photographs were used.
  - Overall, relocation of small plots (e.g., Y-plots) was particularly challenging; metal plates aided relocation rates in enclosed land, but upland unenclosed areas were time-consuming.
- Effects of seasonal and year-to-year variation:
  - Drought year (1990) vs comparatively normal year (1991) contributed to differences in species presence/absence and counts, especially in arable and marginal lands.
  - Some species showed genuine population changes (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Lapsana communis, Alliaria petiolata), while others appeared to be under-recorded in the initial survey.
- Cover estimates:
  - Visual cover estimates for species observed at both times showed limited consistent differences; most notable differences occurred for a small subset of species.
  - Wilcoxon tests indicated some significant differences for several common species, but overall patterns suggested modest changes in cover between times for many species.
- Land-use mapping and boundary coding:
  - Primary land-use codes (e.g., arable, lowland grassland) were recorded with high concordance between original and QA.
  - Boundary codes showed slightly lower concordance; concordance for mapping qualifiers and boundary-related codes was generally good but more variable.
  - Overall mapping codes showed strong consistency, but more interpretation in boundary coding than in land-use classification.
- Species groups and ecological gradients:
  - Group-level analyses (aggregating 10–15 representative species per plot type) showed no significant difference in cumulative frequency between the original survey and the 1991 QA.
  - DECORANA analysis indicated changes along the first axis reflecting ecological gradients; upland moor vegetation remained relatively stable, while lowland areas showed a shift toward more nutrient-rich end of the gradient, consistent with broader land-use changes and year-to-year variation.
- Mapping of species cover at points:
  - Concordance for dominant species at mapped points was higher than for co-dominants; a vegetation unit with multiple dominant species had substantially lower exact concordance.
  - Recommendation: record only the two most prevalent species for mapping to improve reproducibility.

## Main sources of variation and interpretation

- Categories of variation:
  - A Mis-identification
  - B Species overlooked in the original survey
  - C Seasonal/management-driven changes
  - D/E/F/G/H I2 variations related to relocation and timing
  - J Mysteries (unexplained discrepancies)
- Overall, a substantial portion of mismatches arose from relocation issues, seasonal effects, and mis-recording in the initial survey. Some apparent mis-recordings were due to genuine seasonal or management changes rather than errors in transcription.
- The study emphasized caution when comparing change statistics across land-use types and seasons; best interpreted when restricted to similar land uses and times.

## Conclusions and implications for future surveys

- Photographic aids:
  - Photographs are valuable for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed areas; better practice includes annotating photos with distances to identifiable features.
- Plot relocation and ground-truthing:
  - Metal marker plates were useful for square plots but relocation is time-consuming in upland, unenclosed terrain; additional manpower may be required for large or remote areas.
  - For Y plots, improved quadrat positioning techniques and clear photographic coverage are recommended.
- Recording of species and bryophytes:
  - Training should emphasize field characteristics to distinguish similar taxa, with particular attention to grasses and bryophytes, which caused notable mis-recordings.
  - Recommend maintaining bryophyte inclusion but expanding the reference material and habitat-specific lists as needed.
- Timing of QA:
  - QA should be conducted as close as possible to the initial survey to minimize seasonal and annual variation confounding results.
- Land-use coding and mapping:
  - Recommend refining land-use codes to reduce ambiguity (e.g., subdividing upland grassland into more precise categories; adding marsh and bog distinctions) and simplifying mapping codes to enhance reproducibility.
  - Recommendation to map only the two most prevalent species at a point to improve repeatability, while enhancing the documentation of boundary features with clearer codes.
- Marshes, bogs, and wetland habitats:
  - Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type and assign appropriate primary codes; ensure consistent coding across surveys.
- Boundary and hedgerow coding:
  - Primary boundary codes should be limited to hedge presence; hedge composition can be captured via qualifying codes.
- Seasonal consistency:
  - When possible, QA and surveys should occur within the same season and year to minimize seasonal differences in species detection.
- Generalizability and training:
  - Training courses should incorporate an explicit focus on distinguishing closely related taxa, interpreting cover values, and using the updated codes; include reference specimens or habitat-specific guides.
- Data usability:
  - Results support maintaining consistent data quality controls, with explicit recommendations to improve relocation, mapping, and species recording practices for future countryside surveys.

## Summary of practical recommendations (selected)

- 1) Retain lichens in general surveys with minor modifications; include habitat context in training.
- 2) Conduct QA as near as practical to the initial survey time.
- 3) Surveyors should annotate photographs and relate them to plot locations; include distances to nearby features.
- 4) Use metal marker plates to mark X plots where feasible (enclosed land).
- 5) Define 4 m2 (Y) plots with a tape; orient the side (not diagonal) north–south and place at the southeast corner.
- 6) Photographs should clearly show the location area; ensure consistent relocation aids.
- 7) Consider additional bryophyte species in field lists where appropriate; provide training materials and habitat-specific bryophyte references.
- 8) Sub-divide upland grassland (102) into more precise categories (e.g., upland improved meadow/pasture vs. upland grassland with bracken).
- 9) Introduce a code for lowland rush pasture.
- 10) Recognize wet heath as a distinct vegetation type with a primary code.
- 11) Restrict primary boundary codes to hedge presence; use qualifying codes for species composition.
- 12) For mapping vegetation cover, record only the two most prevalent species to improve reproducibility; focus on land-use primary codes and boundary features with clearer definitions.
