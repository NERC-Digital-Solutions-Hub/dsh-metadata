# 1990 COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY: QUALITY ASSURANCE EXERCISE

- Purpose of QA: quantify the accuracy of field recording in the 1990 Countryside Survey, understand observer and temporal effects on data, relate findings to previous work, and recommend methodology improvements for future surveys.

## Overview and Context

- Large, multi-observer field programme inherently produces variation despite training and supervision.
- QA evaluated consistency and reliability across major field components, noting carpenters of plot relocation, species recording, and land-use mapping.
- Two QA series were conducted: Autumn 1990 (initial assessment using sketch maps) and 1991 (enhanced with photographs; included self-assessment squares).

## Aims (Summary)

- (a) Quantify accuracy of field recording and changes statistics.
- (b) Explain differences due to observer error, time of year, plot location, and other factors (drought, region).
- (c) Relate conclusions to previous ITE survey work.
- (d) Recommend methodological modifications to improve accuracy and confidence of statistics for future surveys.

## Methods (Summary)

- QA series:
  - Autumn 1990: 21 of the original survey squares assessed; relied on original sketch maps for plot relocation; two independent assessors.
  - 1991: Included photographs of plots; expanded to 1 km squares representing 32 terrain classes; assessed 28 of 32 squares by one assessor; included self-assessment squares.
- Plots and plot types:
  - Six plot types within a square: X-quadrat (200 m2), Y-quadrat (4 m2), and several linear/edge plots (roadverges, hedges, streamsides, boundaries).
  - A quarter of each square resurveyed to include all plot types; relocation of buried metal plates used as a relocation anchor.
- Data and comparisons:
  - Species concordance metrics across time (various indices of agreement/accuracy).
  - Cover estimates for selected species; comparison between T1 (original survey) and T2 (QA).
  - Mapping of land-use and boundaries using primary and secondary codes; assessment of code agreement and mis-match sources.
  - DECORANA ordination to relate axis scores for changes in vegetation composition.
- Annexes/illustrations:
  - Annexes detailing methods forms, plots, and accuracy tests; Annexes B–D provide additional procedural and species-cover data.

## Key Findings

- Plate and plot relocation
  - Plate relocation success varied; Autumn 1990: 71% recovery with a five-minute search.
  - 1991 phase showed improved relocation; plate and plot relocation rates indicated better accuracy when photographs were used.
  - Some plots (notably small Y plots) remained difficult to relocate precisely; photographs and ground markers helped but were not a panacea.

- Species concordance and changes
  - Initial mean species per plot around 20–22; 1991 reassessment showed higher means (about 23–24), with highly significant increases across all plot types when comparing 1990 vs 1991.
  - About 13% of observed species differences between years attributed to real ecological changes in plots; ~27% attributed to increased recording efficiency by assessors; remainder due to seasonal and management factors (e.g., drought).
  - Seasonal/annual effects were substantial, especially for drought-affected lowland squares and for bryophytes/lichen groups in moist habitats.
  - A number of species changes likely reflect genuine population shifts (e.g., Taraxacum agg., Alliaria petiolata) versus under-recording or seasonal differences for other species (Lolium perenne, Poa trivialis).

- Sources and nature of errors
  - Major error categories: mis-identifications, overlooked species, over-zealous recording, and wrong plot/location/place of recording.
  - Seasonal timing and crop/management changes blurred T1 vs T2 comparisons.
  - Relocation errors (plot mis-location or mis-orientation) contributed notably to mismatches.

- Land-use mapping and boundary codes
  - Primary land-use codes were highly reliable (roughly 88–95% concordance overall across test cases).
  - Boundary codes showed slightly lower concordance; higher when the same assessors re-surveyed (autumn 1990 vs summer 1991).
  - Common code issues: marsh/wetland distinctions, upland grassland subtypes, moorland vs blanket bog distinctions, and boundary code distinctions (hedges vs mixed boundaries).
  - Recommendations to refine codes (expand certain categories, clarify definitions, and reduce ambiguous distinctions).

- Mapping of species cover
  - Concordance between cover values at two survey times varied by species; first-dominant species showed higher concordance (e.g., Holcus lanatus, Urtica dioica).
  - Co-dominants showed much lower concordance; three-way or more dominance scenarios rarely matched across times.
  - Recommendation: simplify mapping to emphasize the two most prevalent species per vegetation unit; improve guidance on recording cover; annotate plots with more precise location data.

- Plot types and landclass effects
  - No significant difference in % accuracy across plot types overall, but significant differences across landclass aggregates:
    - Lowland arable (LC) showed notably lower accuracy.
    - Other landclasses (lowland grassland, marginal, upland) performed more consistently.
  - DECORANA analysis indicated an overall ecological gradient shift consistent with prior ECOLUC project trends, with upland vs lowland separation and some year-to-year perturbations (likely climate-driven).

- Time-series and cross-era comparison
  - 1978–1990–1991 comparisons show that general directional changes were in line with longer-term trends, though 1990–1991 year-to-year variation could reflect drought and other annual fluctuations.

## Recommendations (Key Points)

- Training and species focus
  - Maintain lichens as part of general surveys with habitat notes; include species samples and habitat information in training.
  - Increase emphasis on bryophyte recording and vegetative grasses in training to improve accuracy for moist habitats.
- Timing and QA execution
  - Conduct QA as close as possible to the original survey; avoid large seasonal offsets between QA and survey.
  - Prefer same-year QA to minimize climate/phenology-driven differences.
- Relocation and documentation
  - Photographs are critical for plot relocation, especially in unenclosed areas; annotate photos with distances and compass bearings when possible.
  - Mark X-plot locations with metal plates; consider additional manpower in unenclosed uplands due to relocation time.
  - Improve quadrat positioning methods for small plots (Y plots); ensure clear visibility of delineations on photos and sketches.
- Mapping codes and data recording
  - Simplify land-use coding: increase emphasis on primary land-use codes and reduce reliance on fine-grained cover codes where reproducibility is low.
  - Develop distinct codes for key habitat types (e.g., upland rush pasture, wet heath) and subdivide upland grassland codes as recommended.
  - Restrict boundary coding to hedge presence and core species composition captured by qualifying codes.
  - Record only the two most prevalent species for land-use mapping to improve reproducibility.
- Vegetation cover and species lists
  - Map dominant species primarily; limit detailed cover values to the most prevalent species.
  - Provide explicit guidelines for cover coding and its use in subsequent analyses.
- Data quality and longitudinal interpretation
  - Use simple, robust codes and anchoring features to minimize relocation errors.
  - Ensure consistent interpretation rules for cover values and for distinguishing similar taxa (e.g., grasses with similar vegetative features).
  - Continue to use DECORANA-type analyses to monitor long-term ecological gradients and validate survey consistency over time.

## Conclusions

- Photographic aids significantly improve plot relocation, especially in unenclosed land; sketches and photos were broadly effective for the 1990 survey.
- Seasonal and yearly climatic variation strongly influences species recording; QA should be conducted in the same season and ideally the same year as the original survey to minimize spurious differences.
- Land-use mapping codes are generally robust, but several codes require refinement to improve consistency and reduce mis-classifications.
- Overall, the 1990 QA demonstrated substantial progress in understanding and quantifying the sources of error and suggested concrete, actionable improvements to enhance the accuracy and interpretability of environmental monitoring data in future Countryside Surveys.
