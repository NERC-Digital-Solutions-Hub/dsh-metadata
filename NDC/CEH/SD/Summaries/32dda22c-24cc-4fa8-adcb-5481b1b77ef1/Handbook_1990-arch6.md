# COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY 1990

- Purpose and scope
  - Document defines guidelines for large-scale land-use and vegetation surveys in Britain, aiming to update land-use databases, monitor changes, and support ecological and landscape studies.
  - Data collected support cross-year comparisons, linking ground-truth field data with satellite imagery, and forming a basis for modelling rural environments.

- Survey design and outputs
  - 512 squares sampled in 1990, split into six groups; six teams (one per ITE Research Station) each handling about 85 squares.
  - Each square expected to require around three survey days; travel logistics optimized to minimize overnight stays and overtime.
  - Permanent marking and relocation planned to enable consistent re-survey; use of field handbooks, maps, and aerial photographs to support repeatability.

- Data collection framework
  - Three core elements: mapping, recording quadrats, and sampling (with additional emphasis on vegetation sampling and biota).
  - Vegetation data collected through a two-tier quadrat system:
    - Large quadrats: 200 m2 for broad habitat mapping.
    - Nested smaller quadrats: five 4 m2 units within or adjacent to large quadrats for detailed composition.
  - Supplementary five small quadrats (2 m x 2 m) placed in natural/semi-natural land cover types per square.
  - Linear plots (hedgerows, streamsides, roadsides): up to five per square to capture vegetation along linear features.
  - Special attention to site selection, relocation rules, and treatment of changed land use between survey years.

- Data capture and standards
  - All data recorded on Field Assessment Books (FABs) and summarized on 1:10,000 maps; data coded using primary and secondary codes with alpha-numeric combinations to maximize information density.
  - Codes cover a wide range of themes: land use, physiography, boundaries, buildings/structures, vegetation types, forestry, boundaries, and roadsides.
  - Aerial photograph interpretation (API) is a guided supplementary tool to identify features not on OS maps; API results are guidance and subject to ground-truthing.
  - A comprehensive, hierarchical coding system requires:
    - Use of dominant primary codes when mosaics occur.
    - Use of up to three cover codes per area when describing mosaics.
    - Clear documentation of ownership, permissions, and plot-level metadata (e.g., square ownership, contact details).
  - Special attention to ecological species lists (with a long-form list of common species) and predefined combinations for difficult identifications to preserve cross-survey consistency.

- Permissions, ownership, and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions to access land are essential; teams obtain consent ahead of surveys to avoid wasted effort.
  - Documentation includes landowner/tenant information, contact details, and a cooperative/interest rating to guide engagement.
  - Procedures for restricted access (partial or full denials) are outlined with replacement-square rules and reporting.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, aerial photos, maps, weatherproof clipboards, navigation tools, etc.).
  - Local station contributions include maps, basic tools, field references, cameras, and safety gear.
  - Procedures emphasize neat, legible FAB completion, use of pencil where possible, and accurate geolocation and labeling of plots.

- Data quality, standardization, and validation
  - Acknowledges that observer variation can impair statistical accuracy; standardization and quality control are integral.
  - Emphasizes the need for a clear Field Handbook, consistent recording, and documentation of uncertainties or doubtful classifications.
  - Permanent markers, repeatable relocation protocols, and standardized plotting procedures aid repeatability across years.

- Procedures and workflow during survey
  - On arrival: assess site, seek permission for full square access, plan route to enable complete coverage.
  - After recording: review for omissions; ensure clarity and completeness of presentation.
  - Post-survey: rotate back to stations for data transfer; FABs and samples transported to ITE stations promptly.

- Data products and potential use
  - Data and outputs enable self-serve exploration (dashboards, pivot-like views, and maps) and support broader policy and ecological analyses.
  - Outputs include detailed maps, FAB sheets, species lists, boundary delineations, and land-use classifications.
  - Long-term aim to standardize data for trend detection, landscape pattern analysis, and cross-year comparisons.

- Sub-survey components and sampling specifics
  - Freshwater biota sampling (IFE): conducted in flowing waters; described in a separate handbook; field staff collect and preserve specimens for later analysis.
  - NELUP sampling (Newcastle University): freshwater biota from standing waters; emphasis on aquatic invertebrates (water beetles) across multiple habitat types within each square.
  - Two to five standing-water sampling points per square to reflect characteristic square habitats (lakes/lochs, ponds, dried pools, flushes, sphagnum bogs, etc.).

- Photography and documentation
  - Photographs captured for each vegetation plot to document appearance and key landmarks; plot number clearly displayed on a board at plot edge.

- Post-survey implications
  - The survey protocol supports ongoing monitoring with the aim of detecting changes in land cover, vegetation patterns, and habitat types.
  - Data workflow is designed to be reproducible for future resurvey efforts and to facilitate cross-year analyses and integration with remote sensing data.

- Appendices and reference material
  - Contains long lists of species (crops, grasses, forbs/woody species, ferns, mosses/lichens) and a detailed coding framework for vegetation, boundaries, and built features.
  - Provides examples of how to record mixed vegetation, age classes, canopy proportions, and multi-code descriptions for complex habitats.

- Central message for Data Support
  - The Countryside Survey 1990 defines a rigorous, codified, and repeatable data collection framework that combines ground-truth vegetation data with mapping and sampling to enable robust, longitudinal analysis.
  - Success hinges on standardization, careful data capture (FABs and maps), robust metadata (ownership and permissions), reliable plot relocation, and systematic sampling across diverse habitat types.
