# Ebullition dataset (5 files), details as follows:

- Overview
  - A dataset of methane flux measurements from two lowland floodplain fens (Sutton and Strumpshaw) collected in 2013.
  - Includes ebullition flux, chamber flux, controlling factors, and environmental variables to support analysis of methane emissions and their drivers.
  - Data are organized across 4 Excel spreadsheets, with the dataset described as 5 files in the title.

- Data files and structure
  - Ebullition flux
    - Methane ebullition fluxes (mg CH4 m-2 h-1)
    - Methane concentration in bubbles (ppmv)
    - Bubble volume flux (ml m-2 h-1)
    - Calculated using ebullition funnels
  - Chamber flux
    - Chamber methane fluxes (mg CH4 m-2 h-1) measured with static chambers
  - Controlling factors
    - Mean, standard deviation, and slope of water level (cm) during funnel deployment
    - Mean and standard deviation of net radiation (W m-2)
    - Mean and standard deviation of soil temperature (°C)
    - Mean, standard deviation, and slope of air pressure (cm)
    - Vascular Green Area (dimensionless)
  - Environmental variables
    - Hourly measurements of soil temperature (°C), air pressure (cm), and water table depth relative to ground surface (cm)

- Timeframe and locations
  - Sites: Strumpshaw and Sutton Fens
  - Timeframe: 2013 (ebullition and environmental data span defined Julian Day ranges; specific ranges per dataset)

- Fieldwork methods and QA
  - Protocols adapted from Defra project SP1210 (Lowland Peatland Systems in England and Wales)
  - Ebullition measurements: twelve inverted glass funnels per site
  - Chamber measurements: six tall static chambers per site
  - Sampling area: 0.04 km2 per site; vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis
  - Weather and water level monitoring: automatic weather station (MiniMet) and six Levelogger pressure transducers in dipwells; monthly calibration of transducers
  - Vascular Green Area monitored non-destructively near chamber collars (Wilson et al., 2007 method)
  - Data quality and calibration: methane and CO2 measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector; instrument calibration with certified gases; precision (relative standard deviation) ~6% for CO2 and ~7% for CH4
