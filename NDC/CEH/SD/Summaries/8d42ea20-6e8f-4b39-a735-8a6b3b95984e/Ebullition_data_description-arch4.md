# Ebullition dataset (5 files), details as follows:

- Overview
  - Dataset comprises methane flux data from two lowland floodplain fens (Sutton and Strumpshaw) recorded in 2013, with a total of 5 files including 4 MS Excel spreadsheets and supporting materials.
  - Data cover ebullition flux, chamber flux, controlling factors, and environmental variables relevant to methane exchange.
  - Spatial scope: Strumpshaw (1°27′E 52°36′N) and Sutton (1°30′E 52°45′N) Fens; measurement area of 0.04 km².

- Data content and structure
  - Ebullition flux spreadsheet: methane ebullition flux measurements (mg CH4 m⁻² h⁻¹) plus components needed to calculate flux (methane concentration in bubbles in ppmv and bubble volume flux in ml m⁻² h⁻¹).
  - Chamber flux spreadsheet: chamber methane fluxes (mg CH4 m⁻² h⁻¹) measured with static chambers; indicates NA where a measurement was not taken.
  - Controlling factors spreadsheet: summarizes key potential controls, including mean, standard deviation, and slope of water level during funnel deployment; net radiation; soil temperature; air pressure; and Vascular Green Area adjacent to deployment quadrats.
  - Environmental variables spreadsheet: hourly measurements of soil temperature (°C), air pressure (cm), and water table depth relative to ground surface (cm) from an automatic weather station and dipwells.
  - Data units and definitions are provided to support interpretation and reuse.

- Fieldwork, instrumentation, and quality assurance
  - Protocols follow Defra project SP1210 for Lowland Peatland Systems.
  - Measurements:
    - Ebullition: twelve inverted glass funnels per site.
    - Chamber fluxes: six tall static chambers per site.
    - Study area: vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis.
  - Instrumentation:
    - Automatic weather station (MiniMet, Skye Instruments) for meteorological variables.
    - Six Levelogger Gold pressure transducers per site in dipwells to measure water level; monthly calibration with manual dips.
    - Vascular Green Area monitored non-destructively within each chamber collar (method from Wilson et al. 2007).
  - Analytical methods and QA:
    - Methane and carbon dioxide measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector; instrument calibration with certified gases.
    - Precision: relative standard deviation of 6% for CO2 and 7% for CH4.

- Governance and usage notes for data leaders
  - Emphasizes end-to-end data lifecycle: clear data structure, metadata, and documentation to support discoverability, interpretation, and reuse.
  - Highlights data quality considerations (calibration, instrument precision, and QA procedures) and explicit unit definitions.
  - Provides a documented pathway for data provenance and potential integration with models of peatland greenhouse gas exchange.
