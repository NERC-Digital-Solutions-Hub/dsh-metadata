# Ebullition dataset

## Overview
- A 2013 methane flux study from two lowland floodplain fens (Strumpshaw and Sutton) describing ebullition, chamber fluxes, and environmental context.
- Described as five files in total, structured into four Excel spreadsheets; covers methane fluxes, controlling factors, and environmental variables.
- Provides data to support monitoring environmental methane fluxes and their drivers over time, aligned with standardized field protocols.

## Data content and variables
- Ebullition flux: methane ebullition fluxes (mg CH4 m^-2 h^-1), methane concentration in bubbles (ppmv), bubble volume flux (ml m^-2 h^-1).
- Chamber flux: methane fluxes (mg CH4 m^-2 h^-1) measured with static chambers.
- Controlling factors: statistics (mean, standard deviation, and slope) of water level relative to ground during funnel deployment; mean and std of net radiation (W m^-2); mean, std, and slope of air pressure (cm); Vascular Green Area (%).
- Environmental variables: hourly soil temperature (°C), air pressure (cm), and water table depth relative to ground surface (cm).
- Locations: Strumpshaw and Sutton Fens (with precise coordinates).

## Field methods and QA
- Protocols based on Defra project SP1210 (Lowland Peatland Systems in England and Wales).
- Measurement tools: twelve inverted glass funnels for ebullition fluxes; six tall static chambers for chamber fluxes; area of study ~0.04 km^2 per site; vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis.
- Data collection: automatic weather station (MiniMet) for meteorological variables; six dipwells with Levelogger Gold pressure transducers near each chamber collar for water level (calibrated monthly with manual dips).
- Non-destructive Vascular Green Area monitoring within chamber collars (Wilson et al., 2007).

## Measurement details and calibration
- Gas analyses: methane and carbon dioxide measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector; calibration with certified gases per run.
- Precision: relative standard deviation ~6% for CO2 and ~7% for CH4.

## Temporal and spatial coverage
- Timeframe: data collected during 2013.
- Ebullition funnel and environmental measurements span specific Julian day ranges (e.g., Ebullition flux Julian Day 72–245; Chamber flux Julian Day 17–313; Controlling factors Julian Day 17–213; Environmental variables Julian Day 91–243).
- Sites: Strumpshaw (1°27′E 52°36′N) and Sutton (1°30′E 52°45′N).

## Data structure and provenance
- Data organized into four Excel spreadsheets covering methane fluxes, controlling factors, and environmental context for both fens.
- NA values indicate missing measurements.
- Full instrumentation and field method details are documented; related methodological references and a data provenance link are provided.

## Potential uses for environmental monitoring and policy
- Enables standardized, comparable reporting of methane fluxes and drivers across sites and time.
- Supports integration with other environmental datasets to enhance understanding of peatland gas exchange and climate-relevant processes.
- Helps ensure data quality, reproducibility, and availability for monitoring environmental health and policy performance.
