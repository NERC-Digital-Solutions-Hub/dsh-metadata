# Ebullition dataset (5 files), details as follows:

## Scope and purpose
- Methane flux data collected in two lowland floodplain fens (Sutton and Strumpshaw) in 2013.
- Data types include ebullition flux, chamber methane fluxes, controlling factors, and environmental variables to support understanding of methane emissions from peatland fens.

## Data files and structure
- 4 Excel spreadsheets, comprising:
  - Ebullition flux: methane ebullition fluxes (mg CH4 m-2 h-1), methane concentration (ppmv), and bubble volume flux (ml m-2 h-1) from ebullition funnels.
  - Chamber flux: chamber methane fluxes (mg CH4 m-2 h-1) from static chambers (NA indicates missing data).
  - Controlling factors: mean, standard deviation, and slope for water level, net radiation, soil temperature, air pressure, and Vascular Green Area.
  - Environmental variables: hourly soil temperature, air pressure, and water table depth.
- Locations: Strumpshaw and Sutton Fens; dataset spans Julian Day 17–245 (ebullition), 17–313 (chamber), 17–213 (controlling factors), and 91–243 (environmental variables) in 2013.
- Data structure note: four spreadsheets capture flux measurements, supporting calculations, and contextual measurements.

## Methods and quality assurance
- Field protocols follow Defra project SP1210 for Lowland Peatland Systems.
- Measurements:
  - Ebullition: 12 inverted glass funnels per site.
  - Chamber fluxes: 6 tall static chambers per site.
  - Survey area: 0.04 km2 per site, vegetation dominated by Phragmites australis.
- Instrumentation:
  - Automatic weather station (MiniMet) for meteorological data.
  - Six Levelogger transducers in dipwells near each chamber for water level; monthly calibration with manual dips.
  - Vascular Green Area monitored non-destructively within chamber collars (Wilson et al. 2007 method).
- Documentation and provenance:
  - Full instrumentation details in Stanley (2015) PhD thesis.
  - Methane and CO2 measured by gas chromatography with flame ionization detector; regular calibration with certified gases.
  - Precision: CO2 ~6% RSD; CH4 ~7% RSD.

## Metadata and provenance
- Data describe measurements taken at Strumpshaw and Sutton Fens (coordinates provided in the dataset descriptions).
- Clear linkage between flux measurements, their contributing factors, and environmental context.

## Access, contact, and data lineage
- Data queries should be directed to Kate Heppell (c.m.heppell@qmul.ac.uk).

## Data governance and standards alignment
- Adheres to Defra SP1210 field protocols for data collection and QA.
- Uses consistent units and clearly defined variables across all spreadsheets to aid interoperability and reuse.
- Documentation includes methodological references and calibration procedures to support data quality and traceability.
