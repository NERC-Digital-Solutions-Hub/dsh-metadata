- Usage considerations for data leaders
  - Metadata clarity supports discoverability and proper interpretation across teams.
  - Limited temporal scope (only two periods) may affect trend analyses or long-term assessments.
  - Small watershed (~1 km²) and single station may limit generalizability; ensure alignment with broader datasets if integrating into wider data systems.
  - Standardized column naming and explicit units/format aids data quality, verification, and reuse across projects.
