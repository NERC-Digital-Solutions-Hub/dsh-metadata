- Data governance and stewardship considerations (implications for data stewards)
  - Ensure complete metadata (site location, coordinates, elevation, watershed area, time zone)
  - Maintain consistent units and formats across the dataset
  - Validate data quality (accuracy of temperature, height, and discharge measurements)
  - Manage data availability, updating procedures, and potential embargoes or proprietary issues
  - Document data provenance and processing steps (e.g., any cleaning or transformations)
  - Facilitate sharing and discovery by uploading to relevant portals and catalogues, with appropriate documentation of work performed
