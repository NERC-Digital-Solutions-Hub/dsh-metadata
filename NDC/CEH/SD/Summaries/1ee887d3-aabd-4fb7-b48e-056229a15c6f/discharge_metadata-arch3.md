# discharge_data.csv

## Overview
- Sub-hourly discharge data from Station S2, Siksik stream, North West Territories, Canada.
- Records include sampling date/time, water temperature, stream height, and discharge.
- Data covers September 2009 and March 2010.
- Site metadata includes precise location, elevation, and watershed context.

## Location and Site Metadata
- Site: Siksik stream, Station S2
- Country: Canada; Territory/State: North West Territories
- Coordinates: Longitude 133°26'26" W, Latitude 68°44'17" N
- Elevation: 85 m
- Watershed area: approximately 1 km²
- Time zone: Mountain Standard Time

## Data Structure and Variables
- Date_and_Time: Sampling date and time, format dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm (24-hour)
- Temp_degC: Water temperature, Degrees Celsius (°C)
- Mean_Stream_height_S2m: Stream height, metres [m]
- Discharge_S2_cumsecs: Discharge, cubic metres per second [m³/s]

## Methods
- Data collection: Sub-hourly discharge measurements at Station S2, Siksik stream
- Location details reiterated: Siksik stream, NWT, Canada
- Timeframe: September 2009 and March 2010
- Measurements recorded: sampling date/time, water temperature, stream height, discharge

## Data Quality and Governance Considerations
- Metadata included: precise location, elevation, watershed area, and time zone (facilitates data verification and reuse)
- Data gaps: limited temporal coverage (only Sep 2009 and Mar 2010) may affect trend analysis
- Metadata completeness and format: clear column definitions and units/formats (supports interoperability)
- Data sharing considerations: not explicitly stated; in broader monitoring contexts, sharing underlying data can be a governance and accessibility challenge
- Data transformation: no explicit transformations noted beyond field definitions; standard units provided

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks and Policy
- Provides a structured, time-stamped hydrological dataset suitable for environmental health monitoring and policy evaluation
- Enables analysis of hydrology (discharge), hydrometeorology (temperature), and hydraulic response (stream height)
- Supports development of dashboards, reports, and inform decision-making related to water resources and ecosystem health in the region

## Access and Availability
- Data described as discharge_data.csv with defined fields; explicit access method not provided, but implies a dataset format ready for use in analysis and reporting
