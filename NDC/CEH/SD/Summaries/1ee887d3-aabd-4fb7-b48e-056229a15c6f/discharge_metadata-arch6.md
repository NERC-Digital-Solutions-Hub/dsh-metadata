# discharge_data.csv

## Overview
- Sub-hourly discharge data collected from Station S2, Siksik stream, North West Territories, Canada.
- Variables included: sampling date and time, water temperature (°C), mean stream height (m), and discharge (m³/s).

## Site metadata
- Location: Siksik stream, North West Territories, Canada.
- Coordinates: Longitude 133°26'26"W, Latitude 68°44'17"N.
- Elevation: 85 m.
- Watershed area: approximately 1 km².
- Time zone: Mountain Standard Time.

## Data structure and variables
- discharge_data.csv provides a data sheet with:
  - Date_and_Time: Sampling date and time (dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm, 24-hour format).
  - Temp_degC: Water temperature (°C).
  - Mean_Stream_height_S2m: Stream height (m).
  - Discharge_S2_cumsecs: Discharge (m³/s).

## Collection details and time frame
- Data are sub-hourly measurements from Station S2, Siksik stream.
- Records cover two periods: September 2009 and March 2010.
- Data formatting aligns with the header explanations and units described in the data sheet.

## Data formatting and units
- Date and time: dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm (24-hour format).
- Temperature: Degrees Centigrade [°C].
- Stream height: metres [m].
- Discharge: metres cubed per second [m³/s].

## Usage and data products
- Enables end users to explore hydrological conditions by:
  - Self-serve analysis of discharge, temperature, and stream height over time.
  - Creating dashboards, pivot tables, and charts to compare variables.
- Metadata supports integration with other datasets (e.g., for broader water-resource analyses).

## Quality and challenges
- Data span two separate time periods ( Sept 2009 and Mar 2010 ), which may imply gaps between sets.
- The sheet includes explicit metadata mapping (Column_heading vs Units/Format) to aid correct interpretation.
- Potential considerations for data support: ensuring consistent units across two site entries and communicating any data gaps or formatting nuances to end users.
