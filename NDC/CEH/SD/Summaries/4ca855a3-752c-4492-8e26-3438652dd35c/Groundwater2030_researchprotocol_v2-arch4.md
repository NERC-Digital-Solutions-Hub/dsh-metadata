# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Objective and scope
- Follow-up study to the 2002–2004 Kisumu groundwater survey to assess current groundwater safety, use, and quality.
- Two-component design: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing; interviews with well owners and, where water is sold, neighboring customers.
- Expanded sampling to additional Kisumu neighborhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; total of 73 groundwater sources tested (up from 51).

## Study design and data assets
- Data assets collected:
  - Sanitary risk observations at each well site.
  - Water quality measurements (electro-conductivity on-site; laboratory analysis of microbiological indicators and chemical contaminants).
  - Groundwater source attributes (location, depth, ownership, usage, handling).
  - Owner questionnaires (assets, services, water use, other sources of water; demographic and poverty proxies).
  - Customer questionnaires (consumption patterns, handling, alternative water sources; assets/services).
  - GIS data (GPS coordinates; map-based references from prior studies).
  - Photographs of groundwater sources.
- Instruments archived for reuse:
  - Groundwater survey pro-forma.
  - Owner interview questionnaire.
  - Customer interview questionnaire.

## Sampling and participants
- Sampling approach:
  - Random geographic sampling within each neighborhood; boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction license records.
  - No formal power calculations; the expanded neighborhoods function as a pilot rather than a fully powered survey.
  - 73 sources tested in total (from 51 in the earlier study, plus additions).
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners and adult consumers (18+ years) in Kisumu’s peri-urban neighborhoods.
  - Some participants were part of the 2002–2004 study; others newly recruited due to ownership changes.
  - For wells selling water, nearby customers were interviewed (137 customers total).

## Procedures and timeline
- September 2013: Start-up stakeholder workshop with well owners and community groups.
- December 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in consent and questionnaire administration.
- February–March 2014: Fieldwork to identify owners, obtain consent, collect GPS data, photos, depth measurements; conduct sanitary risk inspections; collect water samples for laboratory analysis.
- Owner interviews: collected usage, handling, and asset/service data; capture water abstraction rates and alternative water sources.
- Customer interviews: collected consumption patterns and water handling data; participant responses linked to wells selling water.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with stakeholders.

## Data collection, quality, and management
- Data collection methods:
  - Sanitary risk inspections at well heads and surroundings.
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement; laboratory analysis for thermotolerant coliforms and chemical contaminants.
  - GPS-based location tagging; photographic documentation; depth measurement where feasible.
  - Structured owner and customer questionnaires with standardized content (and elements from the Kenyan DHS framework and poverty instruments).
- Data handling and governance:
  - Consent obtained from all participating well owners; if an owner declined or a well ceased to exist, a nearby well was approached.
  - Data processed by VIRED International and University of Surrey; laboratory analyses conducted at VIRED and partner institutions.
  - Use of maps and prior study data to contextualize current findings; notes on any changes to groundwater sources over the decade.

## Ethics, consent, and participant considerations
- Informed consent procedures implemented for owners; information sheets provided and consent documented.
- Replacement sampling ensured when owners declined or wells were non-functional.
- Adult participants (owners and customers) prioritized; recruitment occurred through visits and, when possible, from customers arriving to purchase water.

## Outputs, dissemination, and implications
- Stakeholder engagement and dissemination:
  - Start-up and final workshops organized to raise awareness and share findings with well owners, community groups, and partners.
- Potential implications:
  - Provides updated, geolocated groundwater safety data to inform risk management and policy.
  - Builds on prior regional work to assess changes in water quality, usage, and sanitary risks over a decade.
  - Generates data to support community-level decision-making and potential improvements in groundwater governance and public health interventions.
