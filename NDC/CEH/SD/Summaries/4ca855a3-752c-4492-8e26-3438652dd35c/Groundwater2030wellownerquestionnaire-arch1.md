# Well owner questionnaire

## Purpose and scope
- Collect data on groundwater use, water safety practices, storage, and access to alternative water sources.
- Gather household socio-economic and living-condition indicators (sanitation, assets, cooking fuels, housing materials, diet, food security, and stock levels) to support analyses of water access, public health, and related outcomes.
- Data are intended to support correlations, reporting, and predictive insights for decision-making.

## Structure and key sections

- Participant verification
  - Confirm the well owner’s willingness to participate and capture location details (area and Well ID).

- Part 1: Groundwater use
  - Q1: Yesterday’s total groundwater collection (in 20 L jerrycans; include all collectors).
  - Q2: Do you sell groundwater to others? (Yes/No/Don't know)
  - Q3: If not selling, how much water was sold yesterday (in jerrycans; include all collectors; Don’t know option available)
  - Q4: Land ownership status of the well site (own, rent/lease, no rent with consent, no rent squatting)
  - Q5: Do you take any steps to make groundwater safer to drink? (Yes/No/Don't know)
  - Q6: What actions are used to make groundwater safer? (Boil, chlorine/bleach, cloth-strain, water filter, solar disinfection, settle, other)
  - Q7: Post-collection storage method (uncovered small container, covered small container, covered large container/tank, uncovered large container/tank, other; Don’t know)
  - Q8: Availability of other water sources besides the well (e.g., piped water, rainwater, vendors, surface water, tanker trucks, bottled water; select all that apply)
  - Q9–Q13: For each water source, indicate its use by purpose (drinking, cooking, washing, etc.) with reasons for source choice (codes provided next to each purpose). Includes multiple sources per purpose and per source, plus a cross-tabbed set of purposes for all listed sources (e.g., piped water, borehole, dug well, spring, rainwater, tanker truck, water from vendor, surface water, bottled water).
  - Groundwater2030: “Why use source” section with codes explaining reasons (e.g., cost, water quality, reliability, ease of access, quantity, taste/color, other).

- Part 2: Household facilities and living conditions
  - Q1: Type of toilet facility used by the household (flush, pit latrine, composting, bucket, hanging, none, other)
  - Q2: Ownership/availability of certain household amenities (clock/watch, electricity, television, non-mobile telephone, refrigerator) with Yes/No/Don't know
  - Q3: Primary cooking fuel type (electric, LPG/natural gas, biogas, kerosene, coal, charcoal, wood, straw/shrub/grass, agricultural crop, animal dung, no cooking in-house, other)
  - Q4–Q5: Cooking location (in-house, separate building, outdoors) and whether a separate kitchen exists
  - Q6: Vehicle ownership (car/truck)
  - Q7: Main wall material (observed) from a listed set (e.g., dirt, mud, cane/palm, bamboo, bricks, cement, wood, etc.)
  - Q8: Dietary intake over the last seven days for key items (meat, rice, wheat products) and number of days
  - Q9: Days in the last seven that cassava was the main meal
  - Q10: Days in the last 30 days with enough to eat (or not)
  - Q11: Months in the last 12 months with at least one day without enough to eat
  - Q12: Frequency of purchasing staple items (maize, maize meal, potatoes) with standard frequencies (daily, twice a week, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, less frequent)
  - Q13: Weeks in the past 12 months with stock of maize, maize meal, or potatoes

## Data coding and collection notes

- Many items use simple binary coding when applicable (e.g., Yes = 1, No = 0, Don’t know = 9).
- Some questions require selecting multiple options (e.g., Q8 across numerous water sources and Q12 purchase frequencies).
- Open-ended fields exist for specifying other options (e.g., other storage methods, other kitchen/fuel types, other reasons for source choice).
- Observed characteristics (e.g., wall materials) are recorded as a checked category.
- The instrument combines groundwater use data with household socio-economic indicators to enable multi-variable analyses and cross-source comparisons.

## Notable variables for analysis

- Groundwater use and access
  - Daily collection volume (by jerrycans)
  - Sale of groundwater and volumes sold
  - Land ownership at the well site
  - Water safety practices and treatment methods
  - Storage method and potential contamination risk
  - Reliance on alternative water sources and the purpose-specific use of each source
  - Motivations for source choice (cost, quality, reliability, access, quantity, taste/color, other)

- Household amenities and living conditions
  - Sanitation facility type
  - Household assets (clock, electricity, TV, telephone, refrigerator)
  - Cooking fuel and location
  - Kitchen facilities
  - Transport access
  - Housing construction materials
  - Food security indicators (dietary diversity, days without enough to eat, stock of staples)

- Dietary and stock indicators
  - Frequency and days of meat, staple foods, cassava
  - Recent food shortage events (30 days, 12 months)
  - Stock presence for staples (maize, maize meal, potatoes)

## Potential analyses and uses

- Correlations between groundwater access/safety practices and household food security or diet diversity.
- Relationships between storage/sharing of groundwater and the availability of alternative water sources.
- Spatial comparisons by area (Manyatta, Migosi, etc.) and their association with water source usage and sanitation facilities.
- Predictive modeling of water source choice based on cost, reliability, and accessibility codes.
- Policy-relevant insights into how water access intersects with housing quality, energy use, and nutrition.

## Practical considerations for analysts

- Be mindful of missing data and DK responses; plan imputation or sensitivity analyses as appropriate.
- Standardize variable naming across households and potential multi-source matrices (e.g., water source by purpose).
- Ensure consistent interpretation of observed house materials and storage methods, given potential observer biases.
- Link groundwater data with socio-economic indicators to explore equity in water access and related outcomes.
