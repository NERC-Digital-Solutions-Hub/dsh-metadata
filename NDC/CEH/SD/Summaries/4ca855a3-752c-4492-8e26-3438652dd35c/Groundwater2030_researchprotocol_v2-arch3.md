Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- A follow-up monitoring study in Kisumu, Kenya, designed to assess groundwater safety and inform policy decisions.
- Builds on a 2002–2004 baseline study by the University of Surrey and VIRED International.
- Two-component design: repeat sanitary risk inspections with water quality testing, plus owner- and neighbor-user questionnaires; expanded to additional neighborhoods and boreholes.

## Monitoring Framework Design and Aims
- Purpose: identify environmental health measures to scrutinise and evaluate policy and guide future decisions on groundwater management.
- Emphasis on useful indicators, stakeholder engagement, and avoiding data duplication.
- Commitment to data quality, openness, and governance, with outputs disseminated to stakeholders through reports, charts, and dashboards as appropriate.

## Data, Indicators, and Tools
- Indicators include:
  - Water quality metrics: microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
  - Sanitary risk at well head and surroundings (observational checklist).
  - Physical parameters: conductivity and depth measurements.
  - Usage and exposure: ownership, water handling, and purchasing patterns; alternative water sources (piped, rainwater); number of customers.
  - Asset and service access, and basic welfare indicators (food poverty instrument).
- Measurement tools and forms archived:
  - Pro-forma for surveying groundwater sources.
  - Questionnaires for well owners and for well customers.

## Methodology and Data Collection
- Study design: longitudinal follow-up of the same wells, with additional sites.
- Sampling frame and facilities:
  - Revisit 2002–2004 sources in Manyatta and Migosi; extend to Nyalenda, Bandani, and boreholes.
  - Sampling by random point in each neighborhood; boreholes selected from groundwater abstraction license records.
  - Total sources tested: 73 (up from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners and adult consumers (groundwater customers).
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed; adults aged 18+; recruitment via home visits and, when applicable, via customers who arrived to purchase water.
- Procedure timeline:
  - September 2013: stakeholder workshop.
  - December 2013: sample selection and translation of instruments.
  - January 2014: training on consent and administration of questionnaires.
  - February–March 2014: field data collection, consent procedures, GPS location, photographic documentation, depth measurement, sanitary risk inspection, and collection of water samples.
  - February–March 2014: owner and, where applicable, customer interviews using structured questionnaires.
  - July 2014: final dissemination workshop.

## Data Handling, Governance, and Ethics
- Consent processes: informed consent obtained from all participants; adherence to ethical practices for field research.
- Data management: on-site data collection with quality checks, subsequent laboratory analysis of water samples.
- Data sharing and openness: outputs disseminated to stakeholders; underlying data intended to be shared where appropriate; mindful of potential barriers to data sharing.
- Metadata and standardization: use of standardized instruments and reference to prior studies (including Wright et al. 2012; Wright et al. 2013) to ensure comparability.

## Sampling and Power Considerations
- No formal power calculations performed for the expanded sample; the study is anchored to the prior baseline data and treated as a pilot/extension for new neighborhoods.
- Rough power estimates (based on Dr. Wright’s calculations) suggest adequate power (>0.9) to detect a 0.5 log change in faecal coliform levels, given similar variability to the baseline, but not designed as a fully powered main survey for new sites.

## Outputs and Relevance
- Produces paired water quality and sanitary risk data over time, integrated with socio-economic usage information.
- Aims to inform groundwater management policy and interventions in peri-urban settings, with findings disseminated to local stakeholders and decision-makers.
- References to relevant analyses and instruments support replicability and comparability with earlier work.
