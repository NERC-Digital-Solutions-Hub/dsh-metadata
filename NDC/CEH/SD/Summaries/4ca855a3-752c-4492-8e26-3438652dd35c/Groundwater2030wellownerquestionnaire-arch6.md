# Well owner questionnaire

## Purpose and scope
- A field survey instrument designed to collect detailed information from well owners about groundwater use, water sources and safety practices, water storage, and household characteristics.
- Also captures aspects of sanitation, housing quality, assets, cooking fuel, and food security to support broader analyses and data products for stakeholders (e.g., local councils, private organizations).

## Survey structure and flow
- Surveyor details and consent: collects surveyor name, date, area, well ID, owner name, and confirmation of continued willingness to participate.
- Part 1: Groundwater Use
  - Q1: Amount of water collected yesterday (in 20 L jerrycans) from the well/borehole; includes water collected by all household members.
  - Q2: Whether water from the well is sold to others (with follow-up if yes).
  - Q3: If water is sold, quantity sold yesterday and identification of neighboring buyers (randomly selected).
  - Q4: Land ownership status of the well site (owner, rent/lease, various non-owner arrangements).
  - Q5–Q6: Water safety practices at the point of collection; how water is made safe (e.g., boiling, chlorine/bleach, filtration, solar disinfection, settling) and storage practices (storage container type and guarding against contamination).
  - Q7: Availability of other water sources besides the well (e.g., piped water, other wells, rainwater, tanker trucks, vendors, surface water, bottled water) and the context for their use.
  - Q8: Source-by-source usage by purpose (drinking, cooking, washing, livestock, etc.) across all listed water sources; includes why each source is used (coded reasons).
  - Groundwater2030: Follow-up section to capture the reasons for using each water source, with codes (1 cost/price; 2 water quality/safety; 3 continuous supply; 4 ease of access; 5 quantity; 6 taste/color; 7 other).
- Sanitation, housing, and assets (embedded in the questionnaire)
  - Toilet facilities used by the household.
  - Household assets (clock, electricity, TV, landline/mobile phone, refrigerator) and ownership status.
  - Cooking fuel type and fuel-related practices (whether cooking occurs inside, in a separate building, or outdoors; presence of a separate kitchen).
  - Vehicle ownership.
  - Main wall materials (observed) for building quality and housing type.
- Food security and diet (breadth of nutrition-related data)
  - Q8: For the last seven days, number of days certain foods were served as part of a main meal (meat, rice, wheat products).
  - Q9: For the last seven days, number of days cassava was the main meal.
  - Q10: In the last 30 days, number of days with not having enough to eat.
  - Q11: In the last 12 months, number of months with at least one day without enough to eat.
  - Q12: Frequency of purchasing key staple items (maize, maize meal, potatoes) with a defined set of intervals.
  - Q13: Weeks in the past 12 months with stock of staple foods (maize, maize meal, potatoes).

## Key data domains and indicators
- Water use and access
  - Total daily groundwater extraction; reliance on groundwater vs. other sources; sale of water and potential revenue.
  - Water safety practices and storage to assess potential contamination risk.
  - Source diversity and dependency on multiple sources (with usage by purpose).
- Water quality and safety decisions
  - Treatment methods and why choices are made (cost, safety, reliability, convenience, taste, etc.).
- Sanitation and housing
  - Toilet type, basic household assets, and indicators of living standards.
  - Cooking fuel mix and indoor/outdoor cooking practices; kitchen setup.
  - Building materials as a proxy for housing quality.
- Food security and nutrition
  - Dietary diversity and frequency of consuming meat, staples, and cassava.
  - Incidence of not having enough to eat, both short-term (30 days) and more chronic (12 months).
  - Fresh stock and purchasing patterns for staples (maize, maize meal, potatoes).

## Data collection logistics and quality considerations
- Consent and willingness to participate are checked upfront.
- Some questions require observation (e.g., wall materials) or random sampling (identifying a neighbor buyer to interview).
- Multi-item, multi-source data with a mix of:
  - Numeric counts (e.g., days/weeks, numbers of jerrycans).
  - Categorical responses (Yes/No/Don't know), including coding schemes.
  - Open-ended options (e.g.,Other specify) to capture additional details.
- Structured sequencing with skip logic (e.g., if not selling water, skip Q3; if no food cooked at home, proceed to question 6 in some sections).

## What data support outputs can enable
- Cross-tabulations of water source use with safety practices and storage methods.
- Trends on water access and potential informal water markets (sales of water from wells).
- Correlations between housing/asset indicators and reliance on different water sources.
- Nutrition and food security profiles aligned with water access and household characteristics.
- Dashboards and reports for local authorities and partners to identify gaps in water safety, access, and resilience.
- Data quality controls through consent checks, observed building materials, and explicit skip patterns.
