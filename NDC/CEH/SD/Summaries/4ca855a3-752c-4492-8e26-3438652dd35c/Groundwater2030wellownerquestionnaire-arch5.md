# Well owner questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Collects detailed information on groundwater use, water sources, water safety practices, storage, land ownership, housing characteristics, and household food security.
  - Designed for well owners in areas such as Manyatta and Migosi, with data to support groundwater management and governance.
- Respondent and consent
  - Fields capture surveyor name, date, area, and Well ID.
  - A key step: confirm the well owner is still willing to participate before proceeding.

- Instrument structure and flow
  - Part 1: Groundwater Use
    - Q1: Total water collected yesterday (in 20-litre jerrycans; include all users).
    - Q2-Q3: Whether water is sold; if yes, quantity sold yesterday and identify a random neighboring buyer.
    - Q4: Land ownership status of the well site.
    - Q5-Q6: Water safety practices and methods used to make water safer to drink; storage method for stored water.
    - Q7: Availability of alternative water sources besides the well (e.g., piped water, boreholes, rainwater, vendors, surface water, bottled water, etc.).
    - Q8: For each water source, which purposes it is used for (drinking, cooking, washing, etc.) and reasons for source choices (with coding).
    - Groundwater2030: Additional prompt for reasons for source choice (code-based).
  - Groundwater2030 (socio-economic and housing context)
    - Q1: Type of household toilet facility.
    - Q2: Household ownership of assets (clock, electricity, TV, landline/mobile phone, refrigerator).
    - Q3: Main cooking fuel.
    - Q4-Q5: Cooking location and presence of a separate kitchen.
    - Q6: Vehicle ownership.
    - Q7: Main wall material (observed).
    - Q8-Q13: Food security and consumption indicators
      - Meat, rice, and wheat consumption in last 7 days (days served).
      - Cassava-only meals in last 7 days.
      - Hunger/adequacy: days not enough to eat in last 30 days; months with at least one day without enough to eat in last 12 months.
      - Purchasing frequency for maize, maize meal, and potatoes.
      - Weeks with stock of maize/maize meal/potatoes in past 12 months.
- Data elements and coding
  - Responses are typically coded numerically (e.g., YES-1, NO-0, DK-9) with explicit options for DK/Don't Know.
  - Includes a broad range of categorical and numeric fields, some with extensive skip patterns and conditional logic.
  - Several open-ended placeholders (e.g., OTHER) and observational fields (wall materials) to be documented.
- Data quality and interoperability considerations
  - Conditional branching requires careful data capture and validation (e.g., Q2 affects Q3; Q5/Q6 influence Q6; Q8 matrix requires per-source, per-purpose entries).
  - Standardization of units (water in jerrycans, daily/weekly/monthly timeframes) and consistent coding across all questions.
  - Handling of missing or Don’t Know responses (DK-9) and potential need for imputation guidelines.
- Governance and privacy considerations for data stewards
  - Consent and participation confirmation are essential; owner identifiers (Well ID, owner name) require appropriate privacy controls.
  - Metadata needs to document instrument version, date, area, coding schemes, and recall periods (yesterday, last 7 days, last 30 days, last 12 months).
  - Data storage and access controls should protection-sensitive information; consider anonymization or separation of personally identifiable information for sharing beyond the survey team.
- Practical challenges for implementation
  - High complexity due to the extensive water-source usage matrix (Q8) and numerous conditional questions.
  - Potential data quality issues from recall bias (yesterday, last 7/30/12 months) and respondent interpretation of “food not enough” or “days of stock.”
  - Need for thorough enumerator training to ensure consistent observation (Q7 wallMaterial) and accurate coding of responses.
- Relevance to data stewardship goals
  - The dataset will support analysis of groundwater reliance, water safety practices, access to multiple water sources, and household socio-economic status.
  - Requires robust data governance to ensure discoverability, comparability, and reusability across datasets and projects.
