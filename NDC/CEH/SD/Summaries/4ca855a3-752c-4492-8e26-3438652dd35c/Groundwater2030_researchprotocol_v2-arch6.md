# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- Follow-up survey to the 2002–2004 baseline study of groundwater sources in Kisumu, Kenya.
- International collaboration among University of Southampton, VIRED International, JOOUST, and University of Surrey.
- Two-component study: repeat sanitary risk inspections with water quality testing, plus questionnaire interviews with well owners and, where groundwater is sold, with customers.
- Expanded sampling to additional Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda and Bandani) and boreholes; aims to describe groundwater use patterns and current conditions.

## Data collected and data sources
- Groundwater source data:
  - Location (GPS), identification of wells, photos, depth measurement where feasible.
  - Sanitary risk assessment (observation checklist at well head/ surroundings).
  - Water quality tests: on-site conductivity and laboratory analyses for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Interview data:
  - Well owner questionnaire (usage, abstraction rates, water handling, assets/services, other water sources).
  - Well customer questionnaire (if groundwater is sold, usage and handling by customers; other water sources; assets/services; food poverty proxy).
- Ancillary data:
  - Prior study data used for site re-visits; documentation of changes since 2004.
  - Data archived in instruments and forms (survey pro-forma, owner and customer questionnaires).

## Study design and sampling
- Sampling frame:
  - Revisited wells from the 2002–2004 study in Manyatta and Migosi.
  - Expanded to new neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.
- Sampling approach:
  - Random point within each neighbourhood to select the nearest groundwater source.
  - Boreholes selected based on Water Resource Management Authority license records.
- Sample size and power:
  - No formal power calculations; size determined by the prior follow-up framework.
  - Rough power estimates suggest >0.9 power to detect a 0.5 log change in faecal coliforms between baseline and follow-up, under similar conditions.
  - Total: 73 groundwater sources tested (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants:
  - Adults (18+) who are groundwater source owners or consumers (including customers who purchase water).

## Fieldwork procedures and instruments
- Timeline and activities:
  - Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and outline objectives.
  - Dec 2013: Sample selection; translation of questionnaires into Luo and Kiswahili.
  - Jan 2014: JOOUST students trained for informed consent and questionnaire administration.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Field visits to wells; owner identification; consent process; GPS logging; photography; depth measurement; sanitary risk inspection.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Owner interviews; questions on water use, other sources, and assets/services; asset and food poverty indicators included.
  - If water is sold to neighbours: recruit one or more customers for interviews; if a customer declines, replace with another neighbour’s customer.
  - Lab processing: two samples per well (conductivity on-site; other sample for laboratory analysis of microbiological and chemical contaminants).
  - July 2014: Final dissemination workshop with well owners’ associations and community groups.
- Quality and ethics:
  - Informed consent obtained from all consenting participants; if a well owner declines, substitution with an adjacent source.
  - Data collection supported by maps from earlier studies and trained field teams from VIRED International, JOOUST, University of Surrey, and Southampton.

## Data management, ethics, and governance
- Data and instruments archived for future use:
  - Pro-forma surveys, owner questionnaires, and customer questionnaires stored as part of the study materials.
- Ethical considerations:
  - Consent processes, language translation, and participant recruitment conducted with attention to local norms and participation fairness.
- Data stewardship:
  - Coordination and data handling involve VIRED International, JOOUST, and University of Surrey (with on-site data capture and laboratory analyses).

## Timeline and dissemination
- Start-up and planning through 2013; field data collection in early 2014.
- Final dissemination workshop planned for July 2014.
- Outputs intended to inform understanding of groundwater safety, usage patterns, and changes since the 2002–2004 baseline.

## Relevance for data support
- Integrates spatial, environmental, and social data to map groundwater safety and usage.
- Enables cross-dataset analyses: sanitary risk, water quality, well attributes, and human consumption patterns.
- Provides a framework and archived instruments for future data product development (e.g., integrated reports, maps, and summaries for policymakers and community stakeholders).
