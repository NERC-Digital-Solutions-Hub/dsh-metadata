# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

## Overview
- An international, multi-institutional study led by University of Southampton, with VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey.
- Funded by Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.
- Follow-up survey to a 2002-2004 baseline study in Kisumu, Kenya, assessing groundwater quality, well integrity, and usage patterns.
- Two-component design: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing plus interviews with well owners and, where water is sold, their customers.

## Datasets and data types
- Groundwater source data: location, sanitary risk observations, and well characteristics.
- Water quality results: microbiological indicator bacteria (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants; on-site conductivity measurements.
- Questionnaire data: groundwater source owners and groundwater customers (consumers), plus related assets/services and food poverty indicators.
- Geospatial data: GPS coordinates, photos of sources, and depth measurements where feasible.
- Temporal data: follow-up data comparing to baseline (2002-04); field data collected around Feb–Mar 2014; ongoing dissemination in 2014–2015.

## Data collection instruments and metadata
- Pro-forma for surveying a groundwater source.
- Owner questionnaire for groundwater source owners.
- Customer questionnaire for those who buy groundwater.
- Questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili; consent processes documented.
- Metadata capture includes source identity, owner consent, and changes since 2004 (if applicable).

## Sampling and participants
- Sampling frame: revisiting sources from 2002-04; expansion to additional neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and to include boreholes.
- Sampling approach: random point in each neighbourhood to select the nearest groundwater source; boreholes selected via groundwater abstraction licence records.
- Sample size: 73 groundwater sources tested (expansion from 51 in the earlier study).
- Participants: groundwater source owners and customers; 137 groundwater customers interviewed; all participants adults (18+).
- Inclusion criteria: adults resident in selected neighbourhoods; either owners or consumers of groundwater sources.

## Procedures and data handling
- Timeline: startup stakeholder workshop (Sept 2013); sampling and translations (Dec 2013); JOOUST training (Jan 2014); fieldwork and data collection (Feb–Mar 2014); final dissemination workshop (July 2014).
- Field procedures: obtain informed consent; GPS location; photograph source; record depth; perform sanitary risk inspection; collect two water samples (on-site EC and lab analysis).
- Laboratory analyses: microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants conducted at VIRED International and University of Surrey laboratories.
- Owner and customer interviews: structured questionnaires with follow-up questions on water usage, other water sources, and assets/services; in cases where customers were present, they were recruited on-site or via neighbors.

## Ethics, consent, and governance
- Stakeholder engagement and community involvement through workshops.
- Informed consent obtained from all well owners; participant information sheets provided in local languages.
- Data collection teams trained in consent procedures and instrument administration.
- PII and consent procedures documented; data collected from owners and customers with attention to confidentiality and voluntary participation.

## Data archiving, provenance, and dissemination
- Measurement tools and questionnaires archived alongside the protocol for transparency and reuse.
- Data provenance includes versioned materials and cross-referencing to the baseline study and prior publications.
- Dissemination activities included final workshops to share findings with well owners and community groups.

## Data sharing, access, and stewardship considerations
- Data are tied to specific communities and individuals (owners and customers); governance relies on consent and ethical handling.
- Geospatial and ownership data imply sensitivity; stewardship requires clear consent, responsible storage, and potential restriction/aggregation for sharing.
- The protocol emphasizes usability of data for describing groundwater use, contamination patterns, and management implications, supporting downstream data reuse and policy guidance.

## Key data stewardship challenges and considerations
- Coordinating across multiple institutions and data formats (field checklists, questionnaires, lab results).
- Ensuring data quality and consistency between field observations and laboratory results.
- Managing timely data collection while expanding to additional neighbourhoods as a pilot.
- Handling geospatial data responsibly, including potential de-identification for sharing.
- Ensuring robust metadata and archiving to support future discovery and reuse.
