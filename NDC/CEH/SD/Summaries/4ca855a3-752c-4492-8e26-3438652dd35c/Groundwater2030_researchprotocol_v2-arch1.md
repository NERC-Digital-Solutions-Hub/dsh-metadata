# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- A follow-up groundwater quality and well integrity study in Kisumu, Kenya, linking to a 2002–2004 baseline survey.
- Collaboration among University of Southampton (coordinator), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey; funded by NERC/DFID.

## Aim and scope

- Revisit and extend earlier sampling to reassess groundwater sources for quality, sanitary risk, and use patterns.
- Include owner interviews and, where groundwater is sold, interviews with customers to describe patterns of groundwater use.
- Expand sampling to additional Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and include boreholes, building a broader peri-urban assessment.

## Study design

- Two-part methodology:
  - Repeat sanitary risk inspection of wells and water quality testing (same wells as 2002–04 where possible).
  - Questionnaire interviews with well owners and, where applicable, customers who buy groundwater.
- Sampled wells in Manyatta and Migosi (original sites) plus new neighbourhoods; total of 73 groundwater sources tested.

## Materials and tools

- Pro-forma survey instrument for groundwater sources.
- Questionnaires:
  - Groundwater source owner questionnaire.
  - Groundwater customer questionnaire (for those who buy water from the wells).
- Additional instruments drawing on Kenyan Demographic and Health Survey formats and prior poverty/asset assessment tools (e.g., Zeller et al., 2003).

## Sampling and participants

- Sampling approach:
  - Groundwater sources re-visited from the 2002–04 study in Manyatta and Migosi.
  - Random selection within neighborhoods by random point proximity; boreholes selected from Water Resource Management Authority records.
  - Expanded to include Nyalenda and Bandani neighbourhoods and boreholes, totaling 73 sources.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater source owners (adults 18+).
  - Consumers of groundwater, including those from neighbouring households who purchase water.
  - 137 groundwater customers interviewed in total.
- Inclusion criteria:
  - Age 18+, resident in selected neighbourhoods, either owner of a groundwater source or a consumer of groundwater.

## Procedures and fieldwork timeline

- September 13, 2013: Stakeholder workshop with well owners’ association and community groups.
- December 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated to Luo and Kiswahili.
- January 2014: JOOUST students trained in informed consent and administering instruments.
- February–March 2014: Field teams (VIRED/Surrey) located wells, identified owners, obtained consent, geolocated wells with GPS, photographed sources, and measured depth where feasible. Conducted sanitary risk assessments and collected two water samples per well (one for on-site electro-conductivity, one for laboratory analysis).
- Concurrently (February–March 2014): JOOUST-led teams conducted owner interviews (well usage, water abstraction, other water sources, assets/services, and food poverty indicators) and invited customers to participate; customers asked about usage, handling, and other water sources, plus assets/services.
- 28 April 2015: Version 3 of the protocol.
- July 2014: Final dissemination workshop organized by VIRED International.

## Data collection and analysis

- Water quality testing:
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement.
  - Laboratory analyses for microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants.
- Sanitary risk inspection:
  - Observational checklist documenting contamination hazards at well heads and immediate surroundings; on-spot remediation advice offered when hazards were straightforward to fix (e.g., missing covers).
- Owner and customer questionnaires:
  - Detailed questions on water use, handling, abstraction rates, alternative water sources, and asset/services access.
  - Inclusion of food poverty/household asset questions aligned with prior Kenyan survey instruments.
- Data handling:
  - Field teams recorded precise locations (GPS), captured photos, and noted any changes since 2004.
  - Study emphasizes trackable data sources and integration of observational and self-reported data.

## Power, scope, and data context

- No formal power calculations for the final sample size; the study is a follow-up with pre-determined samples from the earlier study and targeted pilots in new neighbourhoods.
- Rough post-hoc power considerations suggested adequate power (>0.9 in a paired T-test) to detect substantial changes in faecal coliform levels, assuming similar variation to the baseline, but this was not the primary design aim.

## Outputs and accessibility

- Main outputs include: sanitary risk assessments, water quality data (microbiological and chemical), and owner/customer questionnaire results.
- Materials archived with the study (survey pro-forma and questionnaires) to support transparency and reproducibility.
- Final workshop in July 2014 disseminated findings to stakeholders, including well owners and community groups.
