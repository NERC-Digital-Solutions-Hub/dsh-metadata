# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Aim
  - Conduct a follow-up assessment to evaluate groundwater safety in Kisumu, Kenya, using standardized data to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Compare current findings with the 2002–2004 baseline to assess changes in water quality and sanitary risk.

- Study design and rationale
  - Two-component study: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing of previously studied wells, plus questionnaire-based interviews with well owners and, where water is sold, with neighboring customers.
  - Expansion beyond the baseline sites to include additional Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes; aims to pilot data collection in new areas while maintaining comparability with baseline data.

- Collaborating institutions and materials
  - Coordinating institution: University of Southampton; collaborators: VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), University of Surrey.
  - Archived measurement tools: 
    - Pro-forma for surveying groundwater sources
    - Owner interview questionnaire
    - Customer interview questionnaire

- Sampling approach
  - Sampling frame: based on the 2002–2004 study, extended to new neighbourhoods; boreholes included via groundwater abstraction licensing records.
  - Sample size: 73 groundwater sources tested (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
  - Selection method: random point generation within each neighbourhood to identify sources closest to the point; boreholes selected from licensing records.
  - Participants: adults (18+) who are groundwater source owners or customers; some participants from the earlier study may have re-participated.

- Participants and data collection scope
  - Groundwater source owners: consented to participate; information on abstraction rates, use, and assets/services collected.
  - Groundwater customers: interviewed when water was sold to neighbours; information on consumption, handling, and alternative water sources collected.
  - Total customers interviewed: 137.

- Procedure and fieldwork timeline
  - Sept 2013: Stakeholder workshop to raise awareness and secure buy-in.
  - Dec 2013: Sample selection; questionnaires translated to Luo and Kiswahili.
  - Jan 2014: JOOUST trained in informed consent and questionnaire administration.
  - Feb–Mar 2014: Fieldwork to re-identify wells (matching 2002–2004 sites), verify ownership, obtain consent, record GPS coordinates, photograph sources, and measure depth where feasible.
  - Sanitary risk inspection: on-site checklist to identify hazards at the well head and surrounding area; provide simple remediation advice where hazards are fixable (e.g., missing covers).
  - Water sampling: two samples per well—one for on-site conductivity, one for laboratory analysis of microbiological indicators and chemical contaminants.
  - Laboratory analysis: microbiological indicators (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical contaminants analyzed at VIRED International and University of Surrey laboratories.
  - Owner interviews (Feb–Mar 2014): well usage patterns, alternative water sources, and assets/services (including a food-poverty instrument adapted from Kenyan DHS and prior tools).
  - Customer interviews (Feb–Mar 2014): water use, handling, and access to assets/services; recruitment of customers from the surrounding neighbourhoods when possible.
  - July 2014: Final dissemination workshop to share findings with well owners, community groups, and stakeholders.

- Data handling, quality and outputs
  - Standardised data collection methods (checklists, questionnaires) designed to enable cross-time comparability with the 2002–2004 baseline.
  - On-site measurements (conductivity) paired with laboratory analyses for indicator bacteria and chemicals.
  - Data processing and storage conducted by VIRED International and University of Surrey; outputs intended for reporting, maps, and charts, with consideration for uploading datasets to appropriate portals.

- Ethics, training and dissemination
  - Informed consent procedures implemented; translations ensured; JOOUST students trained under supervision.
  - Stakeholder engagement through start-up and final dissemination workshops; findings shared with well owners, local groups, and policy/research partners.

- Expected outputs and relevance
  - Updated assessment of groundwater safety in Kisumu peri-urban areas, including changes in sanitary risk and water quality since 2002–2004.
  - Rich dataset linking well conditions, usage patterns, and customer practices to water quality outcomes.
  - Practical guidance for owners on remediation and for policymakers on peri-urban groundwater management and safety interventions.
