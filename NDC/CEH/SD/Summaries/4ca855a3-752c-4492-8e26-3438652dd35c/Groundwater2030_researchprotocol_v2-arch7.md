# Groundwater2030: Sustaining groundwater safety in peri-urban areas

- Objective: Conduct a follow-up survey to the 2002–04 study in Kisumu, Kenya, combining sanitary risk inspections, water quality testing, and interviews with groundwater owners and customers to understand patterns of groundwater use and potential contamination over time.
- Context: Collaboration among University of Southampton (coordination), VIRED International, JOOUST (Kenya), and University of Surrey; funded by Natural Environment Research Council / Department for International Development.

## Study design and geospatial focus

- Two-component study: repeat sanitary risk inspections and water quality testing; plus questionnaires with well owners and, where water is sold, customers.
- Geospatial elements:
  - Use of GPS to record well locations; photographic documentation; where feasible, depth measurements.
  - Maps generated from earlier studies to relocate sites; assessment of changes since 2004.
  - Spatial sampling framework extended to additional Kisumu neighbourhoods (Nyalenda, Bandani) and boreholes.
  - Random spatial sampling: select a random point in each neighbourhood and choose the nearest groundwater source; boreholes chosen from groundwater abstraction licence records.

## Sampling and participants

- Sample size: 73 groundwater sources tested (expanded from 51 in the earlier study).
- Neighbourhoods: Manyatta, Migosi (core), with additions from Nyalenda and Bandani.
- Participants:
  - Groundwater owners (adults 18+), and
  - Groundwater customers (adults 18+ who purchase water from the sources).
- Recruitment: In areas where well ownership changed since 2004, or wells no longer existed, nearest neighbouring source selected; customers recruited from households that purchase water, or from customers encountered on-site.

## Data collection instruments and data types

- Tools archived for this protocol:
  - Groundwater source survey pro-forma (field observations).
  - Owner questionnaire (ownership, use, handling, assets/services).
  - Customer questionnaire (water use, handling, other sources).
- Measurements and observations:
  - Sanitary risk assessment at well head and surroundings.
  - On-site electro-conductivity measurement; samples sent to lab for microbiological (thermotolerant coliforms) and chemical analyses.
  - Depth measurements where feasible; photographic records; note changes since 2004.
- Additional data:
  - Information on water abstraction volume, usage patterns, alternative water sources (piped, rainwater).
  - Demographic and asset-related questions aligned with prior surveys (e.g., DHS-style questions, food poverty indicators).

## Procedure and timeline highlights

- 2013 September: Start-up stakeholder workshop with well owners’ associations and community groups.
- 2013 December: Sample selection; questionnaires translated into Luo and Kiswahili.
- 2014 January–March: JOOUST-led training on consent and questionnaire administration.
- 2014 February–March: Fieldwork to re-survey 2002–04 wells, interview owners and, where applicable, customers; collect location data, photographs, depth, and water samples; administer owner and customer questionnaires; document water use patterns and access to services.
- 2014–2015: Data processing and reporting; final dissemination workshop in July 2014.
- Outputs include spatially-referenced groundwater source data, water quality results, and socio-economic/use-pattern information to inform groundwater safety in peri-urban Kisumu.

## GIS-relevant implications and potential uses

- Integration of multi-temporal spatial data (2004 baseline and 2013–14 follow-up) to map changes in well locations, depths, and sanitary risks.
- Linking geolocated groundwater sources with water quality results and owner/customer survey data for risk analysis and visualization.
- Potential GIS products:
  - Point layers for groundwater sources with attributes (ownership, usage, depth, sanitary risk score, water quality metrics).
  - Change detection maps showing alterations in well characteristics over a decade.
  - Spatial dashboards integrating contamination indicators with proximity to hazards or land-use features.

## Considerations and data quality notes

- The study acknowledges lack of formal power calculations for sample size, with the expanded sampling acting as a pilot for new neighbourhoods.
- Data quality relies on precise GPS logging, consistent sanitary risk scoring, and standardized questionnaire administration across sites and languages.
- Data standards and harmonization are important for merging historic (2002–04) data with 2013–14 findings across multiple datasets (owner, customer, laboratory results).
