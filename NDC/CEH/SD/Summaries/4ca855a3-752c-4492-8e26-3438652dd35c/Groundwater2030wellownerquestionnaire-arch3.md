# Well owner questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - A field instrument designed to collect data on groundwater use, water safety practices, storage, and livelihoods to inform monitoring, policy evaluation, and future decisions.
  - Also gathers household socio-economic indicators to contextualize water use and well management.

- Consent and administration
  - Begins with confirming the well owner’s willingness to participate.
  - Captures respondent and location details (surveyor name, date, area, well ID, owner name).

## Part 1: Groundwater Use

- Water use and sales
  - Q1: Daily total water collected from the well/borehole in 20-litre jerrycans (including all people’s collection; options for DK).
  - Q2: Whether the household sells well water to others (Yes/No/DK).
  - Q3: If selling, daily quantity sold and identifying one random neighbor buyer; includes DK option.

- Land ownership and water safety practices
  - Q4: Land ownership status of the well (ownership, rent/lease, use with owner’s consent, squatting).
  - Q5: Whether any treatment is done to make water safer to drink (Yes/No/DK).
  - Q6: Practices used to make water safer (boil, chlorine/bleach, cloth straining, water filters, solar disinfection, settling, other; plus storage method preferences for the greatest amount stored).

- Access to alternative water sources and usage by source
  - Q7: Other household water sources available (various options listed; aggregate “Yes/No” to proceed).
  - Q8: For each water source (Piped, Borehole, Dug well, Water from spring, Rainwater, Tanker truck, Water from vendor, Surface water, Bottled water), indicate usage for multiple purposes (drinking, cooking, washing, etc.) and capture reason for source choice (codes: cost, safety, reliability, accessibility, quantity, taste/odor/color, other).

- Source selection rationale (Why use a given source)
  - Groundwater2030: Provide rationale codes for why a particular source is preferred (1-cost, 2-safety, 3-reliability, 4-accessibility, 5-quantity, 6-taste/odor/color, 7-other).

## Part 2: Socio-economic and Living Conditions (Groundwater2030)

- Sanitation and facilities
  - Q1: Type of toilet facility typically used (flush/pond/ventilated etc., with other options).

- Household assets
  - Q2: Ownership of a clock, electricity, television, non-mobile telephone, and refrigerator (Yes/No/DK for each).

- Cooking and housing context
  - Q3: Primary cooking fuel type (electricity, LPG/natural gas, biogas, kerosene, coal, charcoal, wood, straw/shrubs/grasses, agricultural crop, animal dung, no cooking, other).
  - Q4: Where cooking typically occurs (in-house, separate building, outdoors).
  - Q5: Existence of a separate kitchen room (Yes/No/DK).
  - Q6: Ownership of a car or truck (Yes/No/DK).

- Housing materials and structure
  - Q7: Main material of the walls (observed) from a list including no walls, cane/palm, dirt, thatch/mud, stone/mud, adobe, plywood, cardboard, reused wood, cement, brick, cement blocks, covered adobe, wood planks/shingles, other.

- Diet and food security indicators
  - Q8: Over the last seven days, number of days a main meal included meat, rice, and wheat products (three separate items with days recorded).
  - Q9: Over the last seven days, number of days a main meal consisted of cassava only.
  - Q10: In the last 30 days, number of days with not enough to eat.
  - Q11: In the last 12 months, number of months with at least one day without enough to eat.

- Food procurement and stock
  - Q12: Frequency of purchases for staples (maize for grinding, maize meal, potatoes) with standard frequency categories (daily, twice a week, weekly, fortnightly, monthly, less frequent).
  - Q13: Weeks in the past 12 months with stock of staples (maize, maize meal, potatoes).

- Data context and structure notes
  - Many items use simple Yes/No/Don’t know or coded response formats (1/0/9) to support straightforward aggregation.
  - Several questions link to household livelihood indicators, asset ownership, housing quality, and food security, enabling correlation with water access and groundwater management outcomes.

## Data use and monitoring relevance

- Potential indicators for environmental health monitoring
  - Groundwater reliance and withdrawal patterns (Q1, Q2, Q3).
  - Household water safety practices and treatment adoption (Q5–Q6).
  - Access to alternative water sources and multipurpose use (Q7–Q8).
  - Water source reliability and preferences (Why use source codes in Groundwater2030).
  - Sanitation facilities and privacy of water storage practices (toilet facility, storage methods).
  - Household socio-economic context related to resilience (assets, housing materials).
  - Food security and livelihood indicators (meals with meat/rice/wheat, cassava days, days without enough to eat, months without enough).
  - Food procurement patterns and stock levels as proxies for economic resilience.

- Data governance and quality considerations
  - The instrument anticipates consent (verify willingness to participate) and public sharing of underlying data, which has implications for metadata completeness and data openness.
  - Observational questions (e.g., main wall material) rely on field observation, which requires consistent training to reduce observer bias.
  - The mix of quantitative counts (days/weeks, jerrycans) and categorical Yes/No/DK responses supports both rapid screening and more detailed trend analysis.
