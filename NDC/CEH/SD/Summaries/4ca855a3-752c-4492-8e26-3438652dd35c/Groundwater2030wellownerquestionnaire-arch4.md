# Well owner questionnaire

## Purpose and scope
- A field survey instrument to collect household-level data on groundwater use, water sources, sanitation, housing, assets, cooking fuels, diet, food security, and water-related practices.
- Designed to inform understanding of water access, usage patterns, safety measures, and household resilience.

## Data collected (domains and key variables)
- Identification and consent
  - Surveyor name, date, area (Manyatta / Migosi / Other), Well ID, well owner name
  - Ensure well owner is willing to participate before proceeding
- Groundwater use and water quantities
  - Total water collected yesterday from well/borehole (in 20-litre jerrycans)
  - Sale of well water to others (yes/no) and, if yes, amount sold yesterday (in jerrycans)
  - Identify neighbor buyers (randomly select a buyer for follow-up)
  - Land ownership status of the well site (own, rent/lease, etc.)
  - Water safety practices to make water drinkable (yes/no) and methods used (boil, chlorine, cloth strain, filters, solar disinfection, settling, other)
  - Water storage method (largest quantity stored in a specific type of container)
  - Other household water sources besides the well (e.g., piped water, boreholes, rainwater, vendors, surface water)
  - Source usage by purpose for each source (drinking, cooking, washing, etc.) and reasons for source choice (coded)
- Groundwater2030 section (source-use justification)
  - Coded reasons for choosing each water source (options like cost, safety, reliability, accessibility, quantity, taste/odor, other)
- Sanitation and basic facilities
  - Type of toilet facility used by household
- Household assets
  - Ownership of clock/watch, electricity, television, non-mobile phone, refrigerator (yes/no)
- Cooking and energy use
  - Primary cooking fuel type (electricity, LPG/natural gas, biogas, kerosene, coal, charcoal, wood, crop/ dung, etc.)
  - Cooking location (in-house, separate building, outdoors)
  - Presence of a separate kitchen room (yes/no)
- Housing construction
  - Main wall material observed (e.g., mud, cane/palm, dirt, adobe, bricks, cement, etc.)
- Diet and food security
  - Days in the last seven days main meals included meat; days with rice; days with wheat products
  - Days in the last 30 days with not enough to eat
  - Months in the last 12 months with at least one day without enough to eat
- Staple purchases and stock
  - Frequency of purchasing maize, maize meal, potatoes
  - Weeks in the past 12 months with stock of maize, maize meal, or potatoes

## Instrument structure and flow
- Part 1: Groundwater use and related practices (Q1–Q7 and Q8–Q13 topics)
- Mid-section: Groundwater2030 – rationale for water-source choices with coded reasons
- Subsequent sections cover sanitation, assets, cooking, housing, diet, food security, and staple stock
- Some questions allow multi-response (e.g., multiple water sources and purposes), with “Other (specify)” options
- Several questions include “DON'T KNOW” or numeric coding (e.g., 0/1/9) to handle non-responses

## Coding, data quality, and metadata considerations
- Use standardized codes for responses (e.g., source types, purposes, and reasons for source use)
- Include handling for “DON'T KNOW” and missing data (e.g., 9 codes)
- Ensure consistent unit interpretation (e.g., jerrycans, daily/weekly/monthly frequencies)
- Maintain interviewer notes for open-ended responses (e.g., other source types or safety practices)
- Random neighbor selection for buyers should be documented to preserve sampling integrity

## Data governance and usability implications for Data Leaders
- Data scope supports understanding of water access, usage, safety, and resilience at the household level
- Rich, multi-domain data enable cross-analysis of water sources, sanitation, housing quality, energy use, and food security
- Requires clear data dictionary and metadata to ensure consistent interpretation across teams and networks
- Potential data gaps due to self-reported measures or non-response; plan for imputation strategies and validation where possible
- Privacy and consent considerations are essential given household-level data on livelihoods and assets

## How this supports data strategy for Data Leaders
- Provides a holistic view of the water system at the household level, supporting system-wide data-thinking and cross-sector insights
- Enables tracking of user (household) needs and behaviors, aligning with co-ownership of data products and iterative improvement
- Offers visibility into data availability, gaps (e.g., storage practices, multiple sources, and food security indicators), and opportunities for standardization
- Supports data quality, discoverability, and metadata practices by outlining structured response types and potential gaps in data collection
