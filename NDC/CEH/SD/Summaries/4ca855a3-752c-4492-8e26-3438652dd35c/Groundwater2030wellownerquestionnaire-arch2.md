# Well owner questionnaire

- Purpose and scope
  - Collect standardized, monitorable data on groundwater use, water safety practices, access to water, and related household factors to assess environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Targeted to well owners in areas such as Manyatta, Migosi, or other specified locations; participation requires consent.

- Respondent and location details
  - Fields include surveyor name, date, area, Well ID, and Well owner name.
  - Emphasis on confirming ongoing willingness to participate before proceeding.

- Data collection sections

  - Part 1: Groundwater Use
    - Q1: Amount of water collected from the well yesterday, counted in 20-litre jerrycans (including water collected by anyone, not just the household).
    - Q2: Whether the household sells well water to others; if yes, proceed to Q3.
    - Q3: If selling, amount sold yesterday (in jerrycans) and identify neighboring households that buy water (select one random to approach).
    - Q4: Land ownership around the well (own / rent or use with owner consent / no rent, etc.).
    - Q5–Q6: Water safety actions and treatment used to make water drinkable; Q6 lists specific treatment methods (boiling, chlorine, cloth filtration, various filters, solar disinfection, settling, etc.) and storage method (uncovered vs covered containers, large/small, etc.).
    - Q7: Other household water sources besides the well (e.g., piped water, boreholes, rainwater, vendors, surface water, bottled water) and their availability.
    - Q8: Allocation of water sources by purpose (drinking, cooking, washing, etc.) for each source; includes a prompt to record reasons for source choice using codes (see Groundwater2030).
    - Groundwater2030: Reason for choosing a water source with codes (1–7) covering cost, safety/quality, reliability, ease of access, quantity, taste/odor/color, and other details.
    - Q1 (under Groundwater2030) through Q13: Additional questions include food security-related purchasing and stock practices (e.g., maize, maize meal, potatoes), and the frequency/recency of purchases and stock maintenance (weeks with stock, days with insufficient food).

  - Part 2: Sanitation, housing, assets, and food security
    - Q1: Household toilet facility type (flush, pit latrine, composting, bucket, hanging toilet, none, etc.).
    - Q2: Ownership of household items (clock/watch, electricity, television, non-mobile phone, refrigerator) with yes/no/don’t know responses.
    - Q3: Primary cooking fuel (electricity, gas, biogas, kerosene, coal, charcoal, wood, crop/ dung, etc.); if “no food cooked in the household,” proceed accordingly.
    - Q4–Q5: Cooking location (in-house, separate building, outdoors) and presence of a separate kitchen.
    - Q6: Vehicle ownership (car/truck).
    - Q7: Main wall material of the dwelling (e.g., dirt, cane/palm, mud, adobe, brick, cement, wood, etc.).
    - Q8–Q12: Dietary and food security indicators
      - Last 7 days: days meat, rice, and wheat products were included in main meals.
      - Last 7 days or 30 days: days cassava was the main meal; days without enough to eat in the last 30 days; months with at least one day without enough to eat in the last 12 months.
      - Food purchases: frequency of purchasing maize, maize meal, and potatoes.
      - Stock continuity: weeks in the past 12 months with stock of maize, maize meal, or potatoes.

- Key variables and measurement conventions
  - Standardized response formats (numbers, yes/no, specific codes for don’t know).
  - Quantities expressed in tangible units (e.g., jerrycans of water; weeks/months/days for consumption and shortages).
  - Optional fields to capture “don’t know” or “other (specify)” for a complete, queryable dataset.
  - Area and site identifiers (Manyatta / Migosi / Other) enable spatial aggregation.

- Data quality, standardization, and field practice
  - Instructions to verify consent and re-confirm willingness prior to proceeding.
  - Structured sequencing to ensure consistent data capture across sites (groundwater use followed by household assets and food security).
  - Provisions to identify a neighboring water buyer for sampling and cross-household data linkage.
  - “Record all mentioned” prompts to capture unlisted safety practices or storage methods.

- Data management, sharing, and integration
  - Emphasis on storing collected datasets and uploading to appropriate portals for central access.
  - Designed to align with standard environmental monitoring practices: data verification, cleaning, and transformation to outputs suitable for reports, maps, and charts.
  - The multi-domain nature (water use, safety, housing, and food security) supports integration with other environmental datasets for richer analysis and policy evaluation.

- How this supports environmental health monitoring
  - Provides time-series-ready variables on groundwater extraction, safety practices, and alternative water sources.
  - Captures household vulnerability indicators (sanitation, housing quality, and food security) that influence environmental health outcomes.
  - Enables analysis of how water source choices relate to cost, safety, reliability, and supply, informing policy performance over time.
  - Facilitates data linkage with other environmental and socio-economic datasets to enhance monitoring value and decision-making.

- Practical notes for analysts
  - Key data points include: daily water collected and sold, source safety actions, storage practices, alternative water sources, and usage by purpose.
  - Important variables for cross-analysis: land ownership around wells, household assets, cooking fuel and location, dwelling materials, and food security indicators.
  - Groundwater2030 codes provide a standardized basis for assessing drivers behind source selection and potential policy levers.
