# SUMMARY

## Background and aims
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at Sourhope (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders).
- Primary aims: understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, while monitoring above-ground plant productivity, composition, and diversity to inform policy and future decisions.

## Monitoring framework and site design
- Experimental site: Rigg Foot at Sourhope with 5 replicate blocks along downslope gradients; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots.
- Treatments allocated at random across plots; 0.5 m x 0.5 m cells used for multi-group sampling.
- Management tasks (yearly since 1999): monthly mowing to ~6 cm; application of insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) on insecticide plots; nitrogen and/or lime additions on designated plots.
- Data collection methods:
  - Automated weather station on-site; weather data since Feb 1999.
  - Above-ground biomass via 0.5 m2 sub-plot sampling before each mow; drying and weighing.
  - Baseline vegetation survey in 1998 (0.5 m2 quadrats) and annual 0.5 m2 point analysis surveys (2000, 2001, 2002) with a 100-hole frame and pin-to-plant touches.
  - Soil samples for pH (since 1998) and soil moisture (theta probe added in 2002).
  - Additional small-scale botanical surveys and biomass sampling across subsets of plots.
- Research activity: Phase I projects largely finished by 2002; Phase II fieldwork included 13CO2 pulse experiments and trace-gas measurements with CEH mobile labs.

## Key results and interpretation

### Productivity and treatment effects
- Biomass productivity increased over time across all treatments since 1999, with nitrogen and lime together giving the strongest boost.
- 2002 biomass fell relative to 2001 across several treatments; declines ranged from 13.7% (N+L plots) to 31.2% (Control 2 plots). A slope effect showed lower productivity at the steeper Block 5.
- The most productive plots are those receiving nitrogen and lime together; Control 2 plots generally underperformed, indicating potential site or treatment interactions.

### Soil chemistry and its links to productivity
- Lime dramatically increased soil pH to around 7 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect.
- A strong negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68).
- Overall, higher pH correlated with higher biomass across treatments; however, within plots receiving nitrogen or lime alone, the positive relationship weakened, and in plots with both nitrogen and lime, the relationship could be negative, suggesting non-linear dynamics at higher pH and different moisture regimes.

### Plant diversity and community structure
- Point analyses showed increased abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis in fertilised plots (N and/or lime), particularly in nitrogen and lime plots, and reduced abundance of Agrostis spp.
- Bryophytes expanded across the site, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, contributing up to ~20% of total bryophyte hits in 2002, especially in unimproved plots.
- Shannon Diversity Indices: 2002 values fell by about 15% in nitrogen-and-lime plots relative to baseline, while other treatments showed diversity increases (up to ~29% in some insecticide-treated plots).
- Functional groups (CSR framework: Competitiveness C, Stress-tolerance S, Ruderal R):
  - Across years, the site shows three dominant functional groups (S, C-S-R, SR/C-S-R) accounting for the majority of vascular plant hits.
  - By 2002, C-S-R species expanded markedly in nitrogen-and-lime plots; stress-tolerant species benefited in unimproved plots.
  - Bryophytes and ruderals increased with reductions in disturbance (grazing exclusion) and nutrient-poor conditions.

### Species composition and community dynamics
- Point analysis and PCA show clear differentiation between improved (fertilised/limed) and unimproved plots; lime-treated plots cluster together, with some nitrogen-treated samples aligning with limed plots.
- Dominant vascular species shifted: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined by over 40% since 2000; Festuca rubra expanded in fertile plots.
- Bryophyte communities increasingly prominent, particularly in unimproved plots; litter and dicot components also altered over time.
- Species richness and total biomass trends indicate complex interactions between mowing, disturbance, nutrient status, and soil chemistry.

### Insecticide and trampling effects
- Insecticide (Dursban) plots show diversity patterns consistent with some prior insect-plant interaction literature, but direct causality remains uncertain due to limited control data and varying insect pressure.
- The C2 plots, added for 2002 sampling, experienced a pronounced drop in productivity likely due to trampling during intensive sampling and 13CO2 pulse activities.

## Data quality, challenges, and governance
- Data coverage is extensive (biomass, soil chemistry, moisture, biodiversity surveys, bryophyte taxa, litter, PCA, etc.), enabling multi-faceted monitoring.
- Challenges noted:
  - Data gaps: missing weather data periods in 2002 due to a station malfunction (late July–Nov); some datasets require careful interpolation or substitution.
  - Metadata gaps and documentation complexity; bryophyte identifications improved in 2002.
  - Slope-related spatial heterogeneity and plot-level variability (block effects) complicate attribution to treatments.
- Data sharing and governance:
  - Outputs issued as reports and figures; underlying data are generated and stored for transparency.
  - The study emphasizes clear data presentation and the potential need for robust data governance and metadata to facilitate reuse and public sharing.

## Implications for monitoring and future decisions
- Mowing and disturbance regime:
  - Regular mowing without grazing tends to favour stress-tolerant and bryophytic expansion; consider adjusting mowing height/frequency to manage bryophyte proliferation and species balance.
- Fertilisation strategy:
  - Nitrogen and lime together markedly boost productivity but can reduce diversity; monitor soil moisture and pH thresholds to avoid moisture stress and chlorosis observed in high-lime plots.
  - The CSR shift toward competitive-stress types under nutrient enrichment suggests longer-term changes in functional composition; sustainable management may require balancing nutrients to preserve diversity while maintaining productivity.
- Insecticide use:
  - Potentially positive effects on diversity in some contexts, but evidence is not conclusive; require targeted studies on herbivore pressures and plant responses before broad policy changes.
- Long-term monitoring value:
  - Longitudinal data reveal clear treatment-by-year interactions; continued monitoring is essential to separate transient from persistent changes and to inform land-use and biodiversity policies.
- Data accessibility and governance:
  - To maximise policy relevance, ensure open sharing of underlying datasets with complete metadata, facilitate replication, and maintain transparent data-management standards.

## Conclusion
- The Sourhope Soil Biodiversity monitoring programme demonstrates how long-term, multi-factor field experiments can reveal how mowing, nutrient amendments, and insecticide use drive productivity, species composition, and functional-group dynamics in grassland ecosystems.
- The study highlights the importance of integrating above- and below-ground processes, managing disturbance regimes, and maintaining robust data governance to translate monitoring into informed decision-making.
