# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme; an intensive field experiment at Sourhope to provide broad contextual data for multiple studies.
  - Experimental design includes plots with treatments: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, and Biocide across blocks; data collected to enable cross-year comparisons and links to other research.
  - 2001 site-management disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions and a change of site officer; management activities largely continued under a formal plan.

- Data assets and collection timeline
  - Measurements and dates documented (Table 1 reference in the report):
    - Above-ground biomass across five summer cuts (May–Sept) per plot/sub-plot.
    - Soil pH sampling (0–5 cm depth) and lime/nitrogen treatment effects.
    - Botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys (July 2001; same protocol as 2000).
    - Weather data from Automatic Weather Station (headlines for 1999–2001).
  - Data handling notes
    - Biomass data normalized to a common reference plot (C1) due to changes in cutting method from 2000 to 2001 (manual vs mechanical).
    - Inter-surveyor reliability checked for 2001 point-quadrat surveys; no significant difference between surveyors.

- Weather and site conditions (2001)
  - 2001 rainfall and radiation near long-term averages; total rainfall 839 mm; average temperatures slightly lower than previous years; soil moisture relatively higher than prior year.
  - Weather conditions contextualize biomass and plant community responses to treatments.

- Plant productivity and treatments (biomass)
  - Clear hierarchy in biomass across treatments throughout the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
  - 2001 biomass increased notably relative to 2000, likely due to:
    - Change in personnel and a switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Treating with nitrogen and/or lime (N, L, or N+L) produced the strongest biomass responses; biomass differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots were statistically significant.
  - Year-by-treatment interaction significant, indicating treatment effects varied across years.

- Soil chemistry (pH)
  - Lime addition continued to raise soil pH; October 2001 pH averaged 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in Nitrogen & Lime plots.
  - Nitrogen addition alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
  - Control plots remained close to baseline pH established in August 1998.

- Botanical composition and diversity (2001)
  - Point Quadrat surveys: 24 species identified in unimproved plots (Control and Biocide) vs 18 species in Nitrogen & Lime plots, suggesting diversity reduction in more fertile plots.
  - Species shifts (2001 vs 2000):
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments; remained most abundant only in Control and Limed plots.
    - Festuca spp. increased across treatments; most frequent in Nitrogen and Biocide (F. ovina) and Nitrogen & Lime (F. rubra) plots.
    - Improved plots showed higher presence of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, and Holcus mollis; unimproved plots associated with less fertile taxa (e.g., Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
  - Biomass correlation with species abundance:
    - Positive correlation between biomass and Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
    - Negative correlation between biomass and Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus).
    - Increased litter in nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.
  - Multivariate pattern (PCA):
    - Clear separation of nitrogen and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots.
    - Improved plots show more extreme positions in PCA space; strong association of F. rubra with biomass.
  - 2001 species abundance and biomass relationships (visuals in figures/tables show broader trends across plots and treatments).

- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Observed spatial heterogeneity in surface pH and plant communities across columns; right-hand side columns tended toward more acidic profiles, especially among N and/or Lime plots.
  - Biomass variation across plots showed central plots generally higher in biomass; a strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
  - No significant differences in biomass between blocks, suggesting localized spatial effects rather than block-wide patterns.

- Data interpretation and management implications (for data leaders)
  - Data richness: multi-year, multi-factor experimental data (biomass, soil chemistry, plant communities, weather) across several treatments and plots, enabling cross-study analyses and community-level inferences.
  - Quality and comparability considerations:
    - Method change from manual to mechanical cutting in 2001 necessitated normalization to a common reference plot (C1) to maintain comparability across years.
    - Inter-surveyor reliability confirmed for botanical surveys; standardization important for data quality.
  - Metadata and provenance:
    - Document management events (FMD restrictions, officer change) and their potential impact on data collection cadence and treatment application.
    - Acknowledge site heterogeneity and spatial structure (columns, plots, blocks) in analysis and data schemas.
  - Data gaps and cautions:
    - First biocide application in 2001 missed due to FMD restrictions; potential effect on treatment comparisons.
    - Spatial heterogeneity indicates the value of capturing geospatial coordinates or zone-based analyses for deeper data integration.
  - Reuse opportunities:
    - Align biomass, pH, and species composition data with other related projects to study nutrient amendments, soil chemistry shifts, and plant community responses.
    - Use PCA and other multivariate approaches to examine shifts in plant communities under different fertility and disturbance regimes.

- Key sections and findings (reference points)
  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station: 2001 weather broadly unremarkable; rainfall near long-term average; lower temperatures; higher soil moisture.
  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass: treatment hierarchy; 2001 biomass up vs 2000; N and/or Lime most effective; significant treatment effects and year interaction.
  - 2.3 Soil pH: liming and N+L raise pH; control unchanged since baseline.
  - 2.4 Botanical composition: diversity reductions with fertility; species-specific shifts; correlations between biomass and key grasses; litter turnover linked to fertility.
  - 3.1 Site heterogeneity: spatial pH variation; columns differ; implications for site-wide data aggregation.
  - 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass: central plots tend to have higher biomass; strong pH-biomass relationship.
