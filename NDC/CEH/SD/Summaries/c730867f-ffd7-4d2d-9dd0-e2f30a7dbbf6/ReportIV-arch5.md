# Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Annual Report 2002

## Overview and Aims
- Four years into the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme at the Sourhope site (Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Sourhope, Scottish Borders).
- Aims: understand soil biodiversity and ecosystem processes, with links to above-ground plant communities; monitor productivity (above-ground biomass), species composition, and diversity; relate changes to management practices.

## Experimental Design and Treatments
- Rigg Foot Experimental Site at Sourhope: 5 replicate blocks along an environmental gradient; each block contains 6 main plots subdivided into 10 sub-plots; randomised treatment allocation.
- Treatments (plot level): 
  - Control 1 (no treatment)
  - Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime (L)
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA; previously Biocide)
- Site management:
  - Monthly mowing May–Sept to about 6 cm height
  - Insecticide applied after mowing on insecticide plots
  - Nitrogen and/or lime applied in spring each year
- Data collection framework:
  - 0.5 m2 cell used for biomass sampling within sub-plots S, T, U, V; samples dried and weighed
  - Baseline botanical survey in 1998; repeated point analysis surveys in 2000–2002
  - 5 cm depth soil pH measurements; soil moisture (theta probe) used in 2002
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station
  - 11621 soil samples collected since start of the experiment

## Data Collected and Methods
- Above-ground biomass: annual biomass estimates from five summer cuts (1999–2002)
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Baseline 1998 25-point quadrat; subsequent 0.5 m2 point analysis (100-hole frame; 25 holes touched by a pin)
  - Bryophyte identification expanded to species level in 2002
- Soil measurements:
  - Soil pH (5 cm depth); March and July/August 2002 measurements
  - Soil moisture content in 2002 (theta probe) at plot-cell corners
- Species data:
  - Full vascular plant and bryophyte species lists; Appendix 3 provides species codes
  - Biomass samples sorted by species (2000 and 2002)
- Data scope/timing:
  - 1998 baseline; 1999–2002 ongoing measurements; Population functional groups (CSR framework) used to classify species
- Data quality notes:
  - 2002 weather station malfunction caused missing data (July–Nov); Konza weather data substituted for missing periods
  - Some years had limited or no surveys for certain plots (Control 2 not surveyed in 2000–2001)

## 2002 Highlights and Trends
- Biomass and productivity:
  - Despite continued treatment differences, 2002 saw a general drop in monthly productivity across several treatments vs 2001
  - Long-term trend: biomass increased from 1999 to 2002 across most treatments
  - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L) plots were the most productive; Control 2 plots consistently less productive
  - Slope effect: Block location along downslope gradient influenced productivity; Block 1 (lower) and Block 5 showed notable declines
- Fertilisation effects:
  - Nitrogen and/or lime increase above-ground productivity; lime raised soil pH toward 7.0 in 2002
  - Higher pH and lower moisture in fertilised plots may contribute to stress or chlorosis in some cases
  - In N&L plots, C-S-R (competitive-stress ruderal) species expanded; stress-tolerant (S) species expanded in unfertilised plots
- Functional groups and diversity:
  - Point Analysis and PCA show shifts in functional group composition by treatment:
    - N&L plots: dominance shifts to C-S-R species
    - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant species benefited most
  - Shannon Diversity Index: 2002 declines by 15% in N&L plots relative to baseline; other treatments show 2–29% increases
  - Bryophytes (mosses) increased across treatments, more pronounced in unimproved plots
- Plant community composition:
  - Festuca rubra expanded especially in fertile plots; Festuca ovina declined; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined across 2000–2002
  - Point Analysis indicates improved plots have higher hits of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis, while unimproved plots show more bryophyte dominance
  - Two dominant grass groups (Festuca spp. vs Agrostis spp.) shifted across treatments; bryophyte hits rose from 6–11% (2000) to ~20% in 2002
- Soil-plant relationships:
  - Strong positive relationship between soil pH and biomass in the overall dataset; relationships vary by treatment (less positive when N or L applied alone)
  - Negative correlation between soil moisture and pH; drier, lime-affected plots support higher biomass but can experience chlorosis under high pH
- Trampling and lab activities:
  - 2002 C2 plots experienced reduced productivity, attributed to trampling during 13CO2 pulse experiments

## Data Governance and Stewardship Considerations
- Data provenance and traceability:
  - Longitudinal design with baseline (1998) and multi-year measurements (1999–2002)
  - Clear mapping of treatments to plots; replication blocks and sub-plots; 0.5 m2 sampling cells
- Data types and documentation:
  - Datasets include biomass by plot, species lists, point-analysis hits, bryophyte records, soil pH, soil moisture, weather data
  - Appendices provide detailed treatment maps, species lists, and activity timelines
- Data quality and limitations:
  - Notable data gaps in 2002 due to weather station failure; data substitution applied for missing periods
  - Some plots lack complete annual surveys (e.g., Control 2 in 2000–2001)
- Reproducibility and reuse:
  - Rich metadata on treatment design, sampling methods, and measurement protocols supports cross-study reuse
  - Potential data portal deposition would require:
    - Dataset-level metadata (treatment mapping, units, sampling dates)
    - Data dictionaries for species codes and CSR classifications
    - Versioning and clear data lineage from 1998 baseline to 2002 results
- Practical takeaways for data management:
  - Preserve and publish comprehensive datasets (biomass, species, soil, weather) with clear lineage
  - Include metadata on missing data periods and data-imputation approaches
  - Ensure accessibility of Appendix data (treatment maps, species lists, biomass tallies) for downstream analyses

## Practical Implications for Data Stewards
- The study demonstrates the value of multi-factor, long-term ecological datasets linked to explicit management actions.
- For data governance:
  - Maintain rigorous metadata standards to enable cross-study comparisons (treatment definitions, sampling schemes, units)
  - Track data quality incidents (e.g., sensor failures) and their impact on analyses
  - Provide clear data dictionaries for species codes and functional type classifications (CSR system)
- Data enabling reuse:
  - The data support analyses of management impacts on productivity, diversity, and functional composition
  - Recommend publishing datasets with DOIs and ensuring alignment with community data standards for ecological metadata
