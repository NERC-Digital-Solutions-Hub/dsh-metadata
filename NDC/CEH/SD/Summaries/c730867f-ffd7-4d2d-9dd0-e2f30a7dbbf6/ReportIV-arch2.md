# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Purpose: Four-year monitoring at Sourhope to understand how above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity respond to management (mowing, fertilisation, insecticide) and to provide standardized outputs for assessing environmental health and policy performance over time.

## Site, Management, and Data Collection

- Location: Rigg Foot Experimental Site, Sourhope, Scottish Borders.
- Experimental design: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block with randomized treatments, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; five site-level and plot-level treatments.
- Treatments (1999–2002): 
  - Control 1 and Control 2 (no treatment)
  - Nitrogen (N)
  - Lime
  - Nitrogen + Lime (N&L)
  - Insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA)
- Site management: monthly mowing to ~6 cm (May–September); insecticide applied after mowing; spring applications of N and/or lime; 1999–2002 data collection ongoing.
- Data collected:
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station (since 1999)
  - Above-ground biomass from 0.5 m2 samples per sub-plot, dried and weighed (1999–2002)
  - Baseline vegetation survey (1998) and annual point analyses (2000–2002) using 0.5 m2 cells and a 100-point grid
  - Soil pH (0–5 cm) and soil moisture (theta probe) measurements
  - Additional botanical surveys, bryophyte identification, and species lists (Appendices)
- Scale of data: 11,621 soil samples collected to date; extensive biomass, vegetation, and bryophyte data across treatments and years.

## Key Findings

### Biomass and Productivity
- Long-term trend: biomass production increased across all treatments from 1999 to 2002, despite a decline in 2002 relative to 2001 in several plots.
- Fertilisation effect: plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime showed higher productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime (N&L) were the most productive overall.
- Relative productivity: Control 2 plots underperformed compared with Control 1; productivity declined with elevation up the slope ( Block 5 lowest, Block 1 highest decline in 2002).
- 2002 specific: significant differences between treatments persisted; overall biomass in 2002 fell in several treatments compared with 2001.

### Soil Chemistry and Water
- Lime raised soil pH significantly, approaching pH ~7 in limed treatments; nitrogen raised pH modestly.
- Soil moisture and pH: negative correlation (higher pH associated with lower moisture); positive relationship between higher pH and biomass when considering all plots, but this relationship varied by treatment (positive overall; weaker or reverse in N-only or N&L plots).

### Plant Community and Functional Groups
- Functional shift (CSR framework): 
  - In unfertilised/unimproved plots, stress-tolerant (S) species increased.
  - In fertilised plots (especially N&L), competitive-stress-ruderal (CSR) and SR/CSR groups expanded.
  - Lime and combined N&L treatments particularly favoured CSR and SR/CSR over stress-tolerant types.
- Mowing effect: cessation of grazing and mowing height (~6 cm) favored expansion of stress-tolerant species and bryophytes; Agrostis capillaris and A. vinealis declined across most treatments, suggesting mowing-related homogenisation or competitive exclusion.
- Insecticide effect: highest Shannon diversity index observed in insecticide plots; possible link to reduced herbivory freeing more palatable, diverse plant species, though direct causality not confirmed.
- Trampling effect: 2002 biomass reductions in C2 (insecticide plots, with trampling during labelled 13CO2 pulses) suggest trampling suppressed vegetation growth in some plots.

### Species Composition and Diversity
- Point analysis (2002): increased abundance of Festuca rubra and decreased Festuca ovina and Agrostis spp. relative to earlier years; bryophyte hits (notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) increased across treatments (19.9% of hits in 2002, up from 10.8% in 2001).
- Improved vs unimproved plots: PCA of point analyses clearly separated plots by treatment; limed plots form a distinct cluster; some N-treated plots share characteristics with limed plots.
- Bryophytes: widespread increase across treatments; greatest in unimproved plots; reduction in bryophyte hits in plots heavily fertilised with nitrogen and/or lime.
- Shannon Diversity Index: baseline similar across plots; from 2000 onward, diversity differences emerged and intensified; 2002 shows a 15% overall decline in diversity in N&L plots relative to baseline, while other treatments show increases (up to 29% in some insecticide plots).

### Species Groups and Abundance Patterns (Key Examples)
- Dominant taxa: Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined; Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- or fertiliser-rich plots.
- Key grasses linked to fertility: Poa pratensis and Festuca rubra increased in abundance in fertilised plots.
- Bryophytes: Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus and related mosses increasingly present; higher bryophyte contribution to biomass in unimproved plots.

## Discussion and Implications for Monitoring

- Mowing and disturbance reduction (grazing exclusion) shifts communities toward stress-tolerant and mossy communities, with potential long-term reductions in certain species typical of improved pastures.
- Fertilisation (N and lime) consistently boosts productivity, but very high lime application drives high pH that, together with moisture balance, may eventually limit productivity; nitrogen can exacerbate water stress in dry periods.
- Insecticide use may enhance plant diversity by altering herbivory pressure, enabling palatable species to persist, though evidence is circumstantial.
- Trampling during intensive manipulations can suppress growth in trampling-prone plots (C2), highlighting the importance of management footprint in monitoring outcomes.
- Across years, a clear data-driven narrative emerges: management choices produce measurable, differential impacts on productivity, species composition, functional types, and bryophyte dynamics, reinforcing the value of standardized, repeatable monitoring outputs (biomass, diversity indices, functional-group composition) for policy scrutiny.

## Data Value and Accessibility for Monitoring

- The Sourhope site provides a robust, long-running data stream linking above-ground productivity, plant community structure, and soil chemistry to specific management actions.
- Datasets include steady, transparently documented methods, with datasets archived across multiple appends (Appendices) and available to researchers through project PIs and the Soil Biodiversity programme.
- The program emphasizes making the underlying data accessible for others to reuse in multi-source environmental health and policy evaluations.

## Conclusion

- Four years of integrated monitoring at Sourhope show clear, treatment-specific influences on productivity, species composition, and functional group structure.
- Fertilisation, mowing disturbance, and insecticide use each steer plant communities along distinct trajectories, often mediating trade-offs between productivity and biodiversity.
- The programme demonstrates how standardized environmental monitoring can yield interpretable, policy-relevant insights over time, while highlighting data-rich opportunities to integrate with other datasets to enhance environmental health assessments.
