NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme: Sourhope Site Summary

- Overview
  - Four years of intensive field study at Sourhope to understand how above-ground productivity, species composition, and diversity respond to management practices and how soil biodiversity interacts with plant communities.

- Site, Treatments, and Data Collection
  - Location: Sourhope, Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders; 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; plots subdivided for multiple research groups.
  - Management treatments (five main plot-level options): Control 1 (no treatment), Control 2 (no treatment), Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime; plus Insecticide treatment (Dursban) applied after mowing.
  - Site management: mowing monthly May–Sept to about 6 cm; lime and/or nitrogen applied in spring; insecticide applied after mowing when weather permits.
  - Sampling and data: 
    - Above-ground biomass: regular 0.5 m2 samples per plot, oven-dried and weighed.
    - Point-analysis surveys: annual 0.5 m2 cells within sub-plots, 100-point grid with 25-point drops per plot, repeated 2000–2002; bryophytes identified to greater detail in 2002.
    - Bryophyte and vascular plant species lists; species abundance and functional group classification (CSR system).
    - Soil measures: soil pH at ~5 cm depth, moisture content (theta probe), and supplementary soil sampling.
    - Weather: on-site Automatic Weather Station data (rainfall, temperature, radiation, moisture).
  - Activity: Phase I projects largely completed by 2002; Phase II fieldwork with 13CO2 pulses and trace-gas measurements conducted in 2002; data totals include over 11,600 soil samples since start.

- Key Findings: Biomass, Productivity, and Trends
  - Long-term pattern: biomass productivity generally increased from 1999 to 2002 across all treatments, but 2002 showed a relative decline in biomass within many treatments compared to 2001.
  - Fertilisation effect: plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime maintained higher productivity; plots with both nitrogen and lime (N&L) remained the most productive, though signs suggested productivity might have peaked in these highly fertilised plots (associated with soil pH near 7.0 and lower soil moisture).
  - 2002 specifics: total biomass per plot decreased 13.7% (N&L) to 31.2% (Control 2) relative to 2001; slope position mattered, with lower plots showing larger relative changes.
  - Nitrogen and lime interactions: plots fertilised with nitrogen (N) or lime (L) influenced biomass differently; combined N&L yielded the strongest growth, while single additions showed more variable responses.

- Plant Community Composition and Functional Groups
  - Mowing effects: consistent decline in Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis across treatments by 40% since 2000, suggesting mowing (uniform height) reduces these species; Festuca rubra expanded, especially in lime- or nitrogen-amended plots.
  - Insecticide effect: Shannon diversity was highest in insecticide-treated plots in 2002; overall, diversity differences among treatments became pronounced from 2000 onward.
  - Fertilisation shifts: fertilised plots showed a functional shift from stress-tolerant (S) towards more competitive (C) species; N&L plots supported a higher prevalence of CSR (competitive-stress-ruderal) types.
  - Unfertilised plots: stress-tolerant species benefited most from reduced disturbance (i.e., mowing without nutrient additions and nutrient losses from clipping).
  - Trampling effects: first year in C2 plots (with heavy 13CO2 pulse activity) linked to reduced productivity, attributed to trampling during pulses.
  - Bryophytes: mosses expanded site-wide, particularly Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus; bryophyte hits increased from 2000–2002, especially in unimproved plots; bryophytes contributed up to ~20% of total hits in 2002.

- Biodiversity Metrics and Species-Level Changes
  - Point-Analysis diversity: Shannon indices declined in fertilised N&L plots relative to baseline, while lime- and insecticide-related plots showed increases; overall, diversity differences among treatments became statistically significant by 2000–2002.
  - Species composition shifts: two grasses associated with improved pastures (Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis) were abundant in fertilised plots; Festuca ovina and Anthoxanthum odoratum persisted in unimproved plots; Agrostis capillaris and Agrostis vinealis declined across years.
  - Functional group distribution (CSR): Stress-tolerators (S), C-S-R, and SR/C-S-R groups accounted for 69–95% of live vascular plant hits per plot; by 2002 CS-R and SR/C-S-R groups were notably reduced in lime- and insecticide-treated plots and expanded in nutrient-poor, unimproved plots.

- Soil-Plant Interactions and Environmental Context
  - Soil pH: limed plots achieved higher pH (near 7.0) in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had smaller positive effects on pH.
  - Soil moisture: higher pH correlated with lower moisture; a strong negative relationship between soil moisture and pH (r ≈ -0.68).
  - Biomass-pH relationship: positive association between soil pH and biomass across treatments; within individual treatments, the relationship varied (positive with N or L alone; negative or weaker with N+L).
  - Overall, productivity tended to correlate with more favourable (less acidic, adequately moist) conditions, but the interaction with lime and nitrogen suggested more complex dynamics.

- Methods in Focus: Data Quality and Analysis
  - Experimental design: 5 blocks, 6 main plots per block, 10 sub-plots per main plot; cells allocated to research groups with a 0.5 m x 0.5 m unit.
  - Data processing: biomass weights log-transformed for ANOVA; PCA applied to 2002 point-analysis data with treatment-based weighting to separate improved vs. unimproved plots.
  - Key statistical signals: significant effects of Treatment, Year, and their interaction on shoot biomass; significant treatment effects on diversity metrics and functional-group composition by 2000–2002.

- Implications and Interpretations for Analysts
  - Mowing (disturbance regime) shapes plant community structure, favoring stress-tolerant and bryophyte-dominated assemblages in the absence of grazing.
  - Fertilisation enhances productivity but may reduce diversity and shift functional composition toward competitive species; high lime input raises pH, potentially limiting moisture and affecting stress responses.
  - Insecticide effects on diversity are context-dependent; observed increases in Shannon diversity in 2002 may relate to altered herbivory and plant-palate dynamics, but causality remains to be clarified.
  - Trampling from intensive interventions can depress productivity in affected plots, highlighting the importance of disturbance timing and intensity.
  - Bryophyte expansion under regular mowing and reduced grazing suggests a potential switch toward moss-rich swards in long-term unmanaged or low-nutrient conditions.

- Takeaway for Data-Driven Decision-Making
  - If aiming for high productivity with managed diversity, consider combined nitrogen and lime applications but monitor soil pH, moisture, and potential chlorosis.
  - To preserve or enhance diversity, avoid uniform, high-intensity disturbance and consider maintaining grazing to prevent bryophyte-dominated, less diverse conditions.
  - Use point-analysis and CSR functional-group framing to anticipate shifts in community strategies under different management scenarios.
  - Leverage multi-year biomass data and environmental covariates (pH, moisture, rainfall) to develop predictive models of productivity and community composition under given management regimes.
