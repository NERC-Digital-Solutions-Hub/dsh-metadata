# RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- The report documents the Sourhope field experiment (NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme) at Sourhope Farm, describing baseline monitoring to provide context for related studies and enable year-to-year comparisons. The period covered is 1999–2001, with management and site events affecting data collection in 2001.

## Data collected and measurements

- Automatic Weather Station
  - 2001 headline weather data near long-term norms: rainfall close to average; radiation similar to prior years; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture modestly higher than in previous years.
- Above-ground biomass
  - Consistent treatment hierarchy of biomass across the sampling period; peak biomass in July/August each year.
  - 2001 showed a substantial biomass increase vs. 2000, likely due to staff changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
  - Biomass data were normalized against the C1 control within each year to assess treatment effects; ANOVA indicated significant differences between improved (N and/or L) and non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effects.
- Soil pH
  - Liming raised surface soil pH (upper 5 cm): October 2001 averages 6.19 in limed plots and 6.38 in N&L plots; nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent; control plots showed no significant change since baseline (1998).
- Botanical composition (Point Analysis)
  - July 2001 survey replicated the 2000 protocol; no significant difference between surveyors.
  - Total hits in 2001 were 58% higher than in 2000 across treatments, suggesting greater sward density, possibly from grazing removal in 1998.
  - Clear treatment shifts in species abundance: Agrostis capillaris declined across treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased and dominated in fertilized/improved plots; Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis more common in fertilised plots, while Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta favored untreated plots.
  - 24 species observed in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen & Lime plots, indicating a potential decline in diversity with the main fertilization/lime enhancements.
  - Principal Components Analysis (PCA) showed improved plots (N and/or L) separated from unimproved ones; litter increased in nitrogen and/or lime plots, reflecting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.
  - Biomass correlated with species composition: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis positively correlated with biomass; Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes tended to decline as biomass increased.
  - Relative species hits per plot and biomass demonstrated directional shifts; the major taxa tied to higher productivity were grasses associated with improved pastures.

## Analysis approaches

- Data processing and analysis
  - Biomass data were log-transformed for ANOVA to stabilize variance.
  - Outputs were compared across years (1999–2001) and treatments (Control, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Biocide).
  - Point Quadrat botanical data used PCA and correlation analyses to relate species composition to biomass.
- Data quality and consistency
  - Inter-surveyor reliability tested; no significant difference between surveyors in 2001.
  - Consistent measurement protocols (e.g., mowing, biomass collection, and quadrat surveys) across years, with notes on occasional removals or equipment issues.

## Main findings by data type

- Biomass and treatments
  - Nitrogen and/or Lime treatments consistently boosted above-ground biomass relative to controls.
  - The combination of Nitrogen and Lime produced the strongest biomass response.
  - 2001 biomass higher than 2000 across treatments, partly due to procedural changes (mechanical cutting) and personnel changes.
- Soil chemistry
  - Liming effectively increased soil pH; nitrogen addition similarly increased pH but to a lesser extent.
  - The control plots remained near baseline pH values.
- Plant community composition
  - Fertilised/improved plots showed greater abundance of Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; unimproved plots remained more dominated by species like Agrostis capillaris and bryophytes.
  - Species diversity appeared to decline in the nitrogen+lime plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in improved plots).
  - Biomass increases were associated with shifts toward species typical of more productive swards; increased litter was associated with higher fertility plots.
- Site heterogeneity and spatial patterns
  - Spatial heterogeneity observed across columns; columns E and F showed comparatively more acidic conditions, particularly under nitrogen and/or lime treatments.
  - Biomass tended to be higher in plots located more centrally on the site; a positive pH-biomass relationship was evident.
  - No significant differences in biomass between experimental blocks overall.

## Site management and data collection caveats

- 2001 management disruptions due to Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions: limited site access Feb–May; subsequent sampling conducted under veterinary-protocol guidelines.
- Change of site officer in 2001; temporary shift in site activity and oversight.
- A shift from manual cutting to mechanical shears in 2001 influenced biomass measurements; measurement normalization against C1 helped maintain year-to-year comparability.

## Data quality, reuse considerations, and outputs

- Data types documented include weather, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical composition via Point Quadrat surveys; all data aligned with baseline data from 1998.
- The report includes detailed tables and figures illustrating year-by-year and treatment-by-treatment patterns, enabling cross-year comparisons and integration with related studies.
- For reuse, the data support analyses of treatment effects on productivity, plant-community shifts with fertilization and liming, and the influence of site heterogeneity on productivity.
