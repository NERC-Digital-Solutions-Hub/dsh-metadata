# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Presents soil profile, auger, chemical analyses, and vegetation surveys for Rigg Foot, Sourhope field site (Blocks 4 and 5) with ECOTRON plots.
- Part of long-term Sourhope soil biodiversity program within the UK Environmental Change Network (ECN); includes Micronet/ECN context and data management practices.
- Data collected across multiple horizons, depths, plots, and subplots, coordinating soil chemistry, soil physicals, and plant community composition.

## BLOCK 4: SOIL PROFILE AND ANALYSES
- Soil profile description for BLOCK 4, Rigg Foot:
  - Horizons and depths: LF 0–1 cm, FH 1–4 cm, H 4–8 cm, Ah 8–29 cm, Abg 29–40 cm, B sg 40–61 cm, C gx 61–95 cm.
  - Characteristics: progression from fibrous, root-rich surface to dark Ah, mottled and angular blocky B horizons, then a C horizon with varied stones.
  - Notable features: abundant fine fibrous roots; presence of igneous stones (andesite) in deeper horizons; boundary transitions described (sharp/smooth/wavy).
- Soil analysis (BLOCK 4 PROFILE):
  - Parameters by horizon: weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Key values show horizons with varying N and C contents, C:N ratios around 12–20, exchangeable Ca/Mg/K, moisture loss, LOI, and pH around acidic to mildly acidic.
- Auger samples (BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES):
  - Six sub-samples (4A–4F) with measured wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Data indicate small but variable nutrient contents and soil acidity across auger sub-samples.

## BLOCK 4: VEGETATION SURVEY
- Plot-level vegetation data (PLOT 4A–4F) across subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Pe, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc.
- Summary indicators:
  - Species occurrences and dominance per plot; species totals by subplot.
  - Notable species indicated across plots include a mix of grasses, forbs, and moss-like indicators; presence/absence data enable assessment of community composition under microtopographic variation and depth-related soil differences.

## BLOCK 5: SITE DETAILS, SOIL PROFILES, AUGER SAMPLES, VEGETATION
- Site details (BLOCK 5):
  - Grid reference: NT8544019520; Altitude 315 m; Slope 5°; Soil drainage: imperfect.
  - Major soil subgroup: Brown forest soil with gleying; Parent material: undifferentiated intermediate igneous andesite.
- BLOCK 5: SOIL PROFILE
  - Horizons: LF 0–1 cm, FH 1–5 cm, H 5–7 cm, Ah 7–25 cm, AB 25–35 cm, Bg 35–49 cm, BCg 49–70 cm, Cg 70–100 cm.
  - Descriptions: includes fibrous to semi-fibrous textures, dark Ah, mottled AB/Bg horizons, abundant igneous stones, and well-developed horizon differentiation.
- BLOCK 5: SOIL ANALYSIS (PROFILE)
  - Data by horizon (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) for weight, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Observations show variable nutrient content and acidity, with relatively higher C in upper horizons and substantial LOI indicating organic matter content in surface horizons.
- AUGER SAMPLES (BLOCK 5):
  - Sub-samples 5A–5F with Wt, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %LOI, pH H2O, pH CaCl2.
  - Data illustrate heterogeneity across auger samples, with fluctuations in N and C and pH values among sub-samples.
- BLOCK 5: VEGETATION SURVEY
  - PLOT 5A–5F with subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, Pp, Pt, Ra, Rr, Rs, Tr, Vc.
  - Species totals per subplot show diverse plant communities, with per-plot totals indicating richness and distribution across micro-sites.
- ECOTRON PLOT: ECOTRON SOIL SITE
  - Soil analysis (ECOTRON PLOT 1): Wt 6.089 mg, %N 0.59, %C 8.22, C:N 13.83, Ca 2.76, Na 0.15, K 0.62, Mg 1.7, %Moisture loss 4.79, %LOI 17.42, pH H2O 4.79, pH CaCl2 3.82.
  - ECOTRON VEGETATION SURVEY: plots A–F with Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm, Je, Lm, Lzm, Mc, Ns, Pe, P, Totals per plot (species totals and counts).
- Data management and accessibility
  - Data organized by block, horizon, and plot; barcodes and archiving references (MLURI barcodes) for traceability.
  - Data formats include tabular outputs for soil and vegetation data, enabling cross-block comparisons and long-term analyses.

## ECOTRON CONTEXT
- The Sourhope site functions as an ECN long-term environmental monitoring site, with the Micronet project (1998–2002) linking soil microbial communities to plant communities across grassland types, enabling cross-site microbial-plant interaction studies.

## Key Points for Data Support and Use
- Rich, multi-layer dataset enabling cross-scale analysis (horizon-level soil chemistry, plot-level vegetation, and management-related context).
- Robust experimental framework with horizons described in detail and horizon-specific chemical data supporting soil-vegetation relationship analyses.
- Notable block-to-block variability and horizon-level differences; interpret data with attention to spatial gradients and lithology (igneous constituents) across blocks.
- ECOTRON plots provide a controlled subset for integrated soil-plant microbial interaction studies.
- Outputs support a range of analyses including soil chemistry-vegetation correlations, horizon-level nutrient dynamics, and long-term ecological change assessments.
