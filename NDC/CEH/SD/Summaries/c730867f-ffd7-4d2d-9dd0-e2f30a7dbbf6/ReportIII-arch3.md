# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Purpose and scope
  - Large, intensive field experiment at Sourhope Farm (Scottish Borders) under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
  - Aimed at providing context for diverse groups and enabling comparisons with their data; prescribed broad monitoring across years.
  - Main data types and measurement dates summarized to facilitate linkage with other studies.

- Monitoring design and data types
  - Measurements tracked (as in Table 1): automatic weather data, above-ground biomass, soil pH, and botanical (point quadrat) surveys; ongoing management and sampling schedules recorded.
  - Experimental setup: multiple plots with treatments including nitrogen, lime, nitrogen+lime, and a biocide control; replication across blocks.
  - Data collection tools and protocols: Automatic Weather Station on site; standardized mowing, biomass collection, and point quadrat surveys; botanical surveys conducted with fixed protocols and cross-checks between surveyors.
  - Data handling: biomass data log-transformed for analysis; Genstat 5 used for split-plot ANOVA and PCA; weather data downloaded regularly and managed by a dedicated data manager.

- Data collection, management, and governance context
  - Data management embedded in MLURI/CEH collaboration; weather data fed to a Data Manager (Sourhope/CEH Merlewood).
  - 2001 site-management events affecting monitoring:
    - Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) restrictions limited site access from Feb–May 2001; sampling proceeded under a controlled protocol.
    - Change of Officer in Charge (and associated staff changes) during 2001.
  - Documentation of measurement timelines, site activities, and sampling windows to support transparency and reproducibility.

- Key findings (midpoint to end of the study period)

  - 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
    - 2001 weather data broadly typical relative to recent years.
    - 2001 rainfall around 839 mm; radiation ~3473 MJ/m2; temperatures slightly down; soil moisture modestly higher than prior years.

  - 2.2 Above-ground biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with peak biomass in July/August each year.
    - 2001 biomass higher overall than previous years; attributed to personnel change and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Normalization to a reference (C1) showed nitrogen and lime (N, L, or N+L) had the strongest biomass-promoting effects; nitrogen+lime often most effective.
    - ANOVA indicates significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved plots; year-treatments interaction significant; no significant block differences.

  - 2.3 Soil pH
    - Lime addition continued to raise surface soil pH (5 cm depth): ~6.19 in limed plots; ~6.38 in N+L plots.
    - Nitrogen alone also raised pH, though to a lesser extent; control plots remained near baseline pH.

  - 2.4 Botanical composition
    - July 2001 surveys mirrored 2000 protocol; no significant inter-surveyor bias.
    - 2001 total species hits were 58% higher than 2000, suggesting greater sward density, possibly from grazing stock removal in 1998.
    - Treatment effects on species composition:
      - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001; Festuca spp. increased and were most frequent in N+L and N plots.
      - Improved plots (N and/or L) favored Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis, Poa trivialis, Holcus mollis; unimproved plots remained more associated with species linked to poorer fertility (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta).
      - Species richness: 24 species in unimproved treatments vs 18 in Nitrogen+Lime, suggesting possible diversity decline with stronger fertility improvements.
    - Multivariate patterns:
      - PCA largely separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from controls/biocide plots.
      - Biomass is positively correlated with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance; negative associations with Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes.
      - Increased litter observed in plots with nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher fertility.

- Site heterogeneity and spatial context
  - 3.1 Chemical and vegetational variability: columns E and F exhibited comparatively more acidic conditions, suggesting underlying spatial heterogeneity across the site influencing pH and community composition.
  - 3.2 Biomass variation: outlier plots generally exhibited lower biomass; central plots tended to have higher biomass, indicating spatial structure.
  - Positive relationship observed between surface soil pH and biomass, with no significant block-level biomass differences.

- Methodological notes and data quality considerations
  - Biomass data were analyzed after log transformation; a split-plot ANOVA framework was used to parse effects of Block, Plot, and Treatment over years.
  - Point Quadrat botanical surveys showed high reproducibility between surveyors; PCA helped identify broad treatment-associated shifts in community composition.
  - Documentation of management changes, sampling gaps (e.g., during FMD), and instrumentation/method changes (e.g., mowing approach) essential for interpreting temporal trends and ensuring data quality.

- Implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates the value of a broad, documented monitoring suite (climate, productivity, soil chemistry, and vegetation) to contextualize process-based studies and policy-relevant evaluations.
  - Highlights the importance of metadata, cross-year comparability, and explicit accounting for site heterogeneity in environmental monitoring.
  - Underlines how operational changes (staffing, equipment, access restrictions) can influence measured outcomes and should be captured in governance and data QA processes.
  - Provides evidence on how fertilizer and liming strategies affect productivity, soil chemistry, and plant community dynamics, informing policy decisions on land management and biodiversity under fertility management.
