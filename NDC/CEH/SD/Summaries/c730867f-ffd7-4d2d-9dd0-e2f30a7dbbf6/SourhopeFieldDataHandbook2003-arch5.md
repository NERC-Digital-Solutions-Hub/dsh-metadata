# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Long-term site for soil biodiversity research in upland grasslands.
- Data types include vegetation surveys and soil sampling with archival storage to support discovery, reuse, and governance.

## Data architecture and structure
- Experimental design
  - Five blocks, 30 plots total, each main plot subdivided into fifteen 4 x 4 m subplots; an Ecotron plot for controlled environment studies.
  - Treatments include Control, Lime, Nitrogen, Lime+Nitrogen, Biocide (one planned but omitted).
  - Grazing historically managed; plots fenced and periodically cut to simulate grazing pressure.
- Data elements and formats
  - Vegetation: 50 x 50 cm point quadrats; random selection of five subplots per main plot; presence/absence (and potential abundance) recorded at 25 points per subplot.
  - Soils: 0–30 cm auger cores (30 cores per plot) and 1 m profile pits with horizon descriptions; archived samples stored at -80°C.
  - Horizon nomenclature and codes (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth ranges.
  - Analyses include %N, %C, C:N, exchangeable Ca/Na/K/Mg, moisture content, loss on ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2), among others.
- Data provenance and linkage
  - Data captured by MLURI and linked to ECN; barcoded samples linked to block/plot/horizon identifiers; archive at CEH Merlewood.

## Block 4 and Block 5 and Ecotron details (illustrative data scope)
- Block 4 and Block 5 soil profiles include multiple horizons with detailed descriptive text (colour, texture, structure), depth intervals, and associated soil chemistry (e.g., %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Moisature loss, pH).
- Auger samples and analysis provide horizon- and plot-level variability across blocks, with structured metadata (MLURI barcodes, weight, concentrations, pH, etc.).
- Vegetation data accompany soil data on a per-plot basis, including species totals and indicator species patterns, documenting edge vs interior patterns and community associations.

## Data quality, limitations, and stewardship considerations
- Coverage gaps
  - Vegetation sampling covers only five of fifteen subplots per main plot; baseline indicators rather than exhaustive site coverage.
  - Year-one data provide a baseline; grazing history and seasonality may affect interpretation.
- Variability and anomalies
  - Block- and horizon-level anomalies in chemical/physical properties; normalization may be required for cross-block comparisons.
  - Edge-interior vegetation patterns influence interpretation of treatment effects.
- Data stewardship requirements
  - Consistent metadata: units (e.g., g kg-1, meq/100 g), horizon naming, plot/treatment codes.
  - Preserve provenance: maintain links between vegetation and soil datasets and their block/plot/horizon identifiers and appendices.
  - Archival integrity: track barcodes, storage locations, and archival procedures; maintain connections to ECN and MLURI datasets.
  - Facilitate reuse: provide data dictionaries, metadata notes, analysis scripts (e.g., Twinspan, association analyses) and references to reports.

## Data management, documentation, and access
- Roles and storage
  - Data collected by MLURI; linked to ECN; organized by blocks, plots, subplots, and horizons.
  - Samples barcoded; archival storage at -80°C; linked to ECN and MLURI datasets.
- Documentation and references
  - Supporting materials include Twinspan.doc, Association.xls; Appendix A with block-level soil/vegetation data; site-wide summary tables.
- Governance and discovery
  - Baseline site data with long-term longitudinal value for ecological monitoring and climate-change research.
  - Metadata, measurement methods, sampling schemas, horizon nomenclature essential for discovery and reuse.

## Summary for discovery and use
- The Sourhope Field Data Handbook 2003 documents a robust, multi-layered dataset spanning vegetation surveys and soil chemistry/physics across a stratified experimental design (5 blocks, plots, subplots, Ecotron) with six treatments (one omitted) and integrated grazing management.
- Data support long-term ecological and environmental-change research, with explicit methods, horizon-level soil analyses, and comprehensive documentation to aid discovery, reuse, and governance by data stewards.
