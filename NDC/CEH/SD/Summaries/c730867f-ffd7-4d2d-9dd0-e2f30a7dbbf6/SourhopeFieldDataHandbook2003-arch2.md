# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

- Long-term environmental monitoring framework at Sourhope Field site, integrating soil, vegetation, and perturbation treatments to assess environmental health and policy-relevant outcomes over time.
- Part of broader ECN/Micronet activities; standardized, repeatable methodologies for data collection, management, and sharing.

## Site, context, and monitoring framework

- Location and structure:
  - Sourhope Experimental Farm, Bowmont valley, Cheviot Hills, Scotland; Block 4, Block 5 and ECOTRON plots included in the presented data.
- Monitoring focus:
  - Soil chemistry and moisture, organic matter, and vegetation communities; assessment under controlled perturbations (e.g., lime, nitrogen, biocides) and natural variability.
- Data stewardship:
  - Standardized field and lab protocols; data stored on MLURI systems; long-term archives (e.g., -80°C) for soil samples; underlying data linked to ECN/Micronet portals for cross-dataset access.

## Data collection methods

- Soil sampling
  - Core sampling: 0–30 cm auger cores per plot (W-pattern); 30 cores per plot bulked for analysis.
  - Profile pits: dug to 1 m in pathways to describe horizons; horizon-specific sampling.
  - Auger samples labeled with MLURI barcodes; additional analyses archived.
- Vegetation sampling
  - 50 × 50 cm quadrats within randomly selected subplots.
  - 25 points per quadrat, recording presence/absence with potential abundance inference.
  - Subplots per main plot (A–F) used for treatment and replication.
- Data scope in the provided sections
  - Block 4: Auger samples (A–F) with measurements of N, C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
  - Block 5: Full soil profile analysis (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) plus vegetation data by subplots (A–F) across plots 5A–5F.
  - ECOTRON PLOT: Soil and vegetation data for Ecotron subplots as part of the larger monitoring network.

## Key variables and analytical focus

- Soil chemistry and properties
  - Nitrogen (%N), Carbon (%C), C:N ratio
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca, Mg, Na, K (meq/100 g)
  - Moisture-related measures: %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition (LOI)
  - Acidity indicators: pH in water (H2O), pH in CaCl2
- Soil horizons and profiles (Block 5)
  - Horizon-layer descriptions (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) with depth intervals and color/structure notes
  - Horizon-specific ranges for %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, pH
- Vegetation metrics
  - Species presence/absence per subplot, total species counts per plot
  - Species totals by plotted areas (e.g., Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc. across subplots)
  - Indication of dominant taxa and potential associations with soil horizons and block-level variation

## Block-specific highlights (illustrative)

- Block 4
  - 4A–4F subplots show variable nutrient and chemical profiles across subplots with modest to high LOI in some horizons; pH values typically in the acidic range (approx. 4.4–4.9).
  - Vegetation totals and species indicators vary by subplot, reflecting micro-site differences within the block.
- Block 5
  - Detailed soil profile data across horizons FH to Cg with horizon-specific %N (0.04–2.17), %C (roughly 0.7–33.8 across horizons), C:N ratios (approx. 10–16), Ca, Mg, K, Na, moisture loss, LOI, and pH values (H2O 4.34–5.20; CaCl2 ~3.5–4.4).
  - Depth progression shows strong vertical gradients: near-surface horizons richer in organic matter and nutrients, deeper horizons more mineral-dominated with lower nutrient availability.
  - Vegetation surveys per plot (5A–5F) show diverse species totals and distributions, with clear plot-to-plot variation in species composition.
- ECOTRON PLOT
  - Soil: %N 0.59, %C 8.22, C:N 13.83, Ca 2.76 meq/100 g, pH H2O 4.79, pH CaCl2 3.82.
  - Vegetation: subplots show species presence/absence and totals, consistent with ongoing multiyear ecosystem experiments.

## Data management and accessibility

- Data standardization
  - Uniform field sampling, lab analyses, and plot-level recording across blocks and plots.
- Storage and archiving
  - Datasets stored on MLURI systems; soil samples archived, including -80°C storage for long-term preservation.
- Data integration and portals
  - ECN/Micronet involvement to enable cross-dataset integration; emphasis on making underlying data usable by external analysts and stakeholders.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and policy

- Provides a rigorous, long-term baseline for upland soil-vegetation dynamics under variable management and perturbations.
- Enables evaluation of lime, nitrogen, and biocide impacts on soil chemistry, carbon dynamics, moisture patterns, and biodiversity.
- Demonstrates standardized methodologies suitable for tracking environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Highlights the importance of data accessibility and underlying-data sharing to support independent scrutiny and policy-relevant analyses.

## Key takeaways

- Sourhope represents a rigorously designed, long-term environmental monitoring site combining controlled treatments with natural variability to study soil-vegetation interactions.
- Block 4 and Block 5 detail extensive soil chemistry and horizon-specific analyses, showing strong vertical gradients and block-level variability.
- ECOTRON plots add a controlled-environment dimension to the monitoring framework.
- The data infrastructure supports robust, comparable analyses over time and across datasets, informing sustainable land management and policy decisions.
