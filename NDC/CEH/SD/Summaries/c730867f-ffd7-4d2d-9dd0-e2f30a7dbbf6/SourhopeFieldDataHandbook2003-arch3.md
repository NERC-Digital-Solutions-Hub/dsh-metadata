# SOURHOPE FIELD DATA HANDBOOK 2003

## Overview
- Provides detailed soil profiles, chemical analyses, and vegetation surveys for Sourhope’s Rigg Foot sites, focusing on Blocks 4 and 5, plus Ecotron plots.
- Part of an integrated monitoring framework combining soil health metrics with vegetation data to evaluate environmental change and policy relevance.
- Documentation includes horizon descriptions, lab analyses, auger samples, and per-plot vegetation counts, with accompanying data management details.

## Block 4: Soil Profile and Description
- Block 4 profile (Depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–4 cm; H 4–8 cm; Ah 8–29 cm; Abg 29–40 cm; Bsg 40–61 cm; Cgx 61–95 cm).
- Horizons described as fibrous, moist soils with minimal mineral grains in surface layers; Ah and Abg show sandy silt loam with fine roots; mineral horizons become more defined with depth and include andesitic stones.
- Notable horizon features: A sharp boundary between LH/organic-rich layers; presence of igneous stones (andesite) and variable boundary types (sharp smooth, sharp wavy).

## Block 4: Soil Analysis
- Core profile analyses include: %N, %C, C:N ratio, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Example highlights: %N ranges around 0.42–2.14 across horizons; %C in surface horizons high (up to ~38% in FH); C:N ratios generally between ~12–20; Ca and Mg notable across horizons with block-specific variation; pH typically acidic (pH(H2O) ~4.5–5.0; pH(CaCl2) ~3.6–4.1).
- Moisture and LOI values show higher organic content near the surface and decrease with depth; significant variability between horizons and within the block.

## Block 4: Auger Samples (Block 4)
- Auger samples (4A–4F) provide localized measurements: %N (~0.5–0.6%), %C (~6–8%), C:N ratios (~12–14), Ca/Mg/K/Mg meq/100 g, moisture loss, LOI, pH.
- Illustrates within-plot micro-scale variation in soil chemistry, complementing horizon-level profiles.

## Block 4: Vegetation Survey
- Plot-level vegetation data recorded for plots 4A–4F, with species presence/absence across subplots and totals per species.
- Dominant species indicated in records include various grasses and indicators of upland heath/grassland communities.
- Data show species totals and indicator species patterns, contributing to community classification analyses.

## Block 5: Soil Profile and Description
- Block 5 soil profile (Depths: LF 0–1 cm; FH 1–5 cm; H 5–7 cm; Ah 7–25 cm; AB 25–35 cm; Bg 35–49 cm; BCg 49–70 cm; Cg 70–100 cm).
- Horizons include very similar sequence to Block 4 with Ah and AB horizons, and Bg/BCg deeper horizons; presence of medium to fine angular blocky structures; abundant igneous stones (andesite) at several depths.
- Soil drainage classified as Imperfect; parent material and soil subgroups align with Brown forest soils with gleying.

## Block 5: Soil Analysis
- Analyses across horizons (FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg) include %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100 g), %Moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Notable results: pH(H2O) typically around 4.5–5.0; pH(CaCl2) in the 3.5–4.5 range; %N often ~0.5–2.5% with Ah horizons showing higher values; %C high in surface horizons with a decline in deeper horizons; Ca and Mg vary by horizon and sub-block, with some horizons showing elevated Ca in shallow layers.
- Moisture and LOI patterns indicate substantial organic content in surface horizons and varying moisture with depth.

## Block 5: Auger Samples
- Auger sample measurements (5A–5F) cover %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, moisture loss, LOI, pH(H2O), pH(CaCl2).
- Results show modest variability between auger cores within the block, contributing to scale-mro data for spatial heterogeneity assessment.

## Block 5: Vegetation Survey
- Vegetation data for plots 5A, 5B, 5C, 5D, 5E, 5F include subplots Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, and species totals.
- Documented species totals and per-subplot counts indicate community structure across block 5 plots, complementing soil data for habitat assessment.

## Ecotron Soil Site
- Ecotron plot soil analysis (single profile) shows: Wt ~6.1 mg; %N ~0.59; %C ~8.22; C:N ~13.83; Ca ~2.76 meq/100 g; Mg ~1.7 meq/100 g; pH(H2O) ~4.79; pH(CaCl2) ~3.82.
- Vegetation survey (Ecotron) records presence/absence and counts across Ac/Ao/At/Fr/etc., contributing controlled-environment data to the monitoring framework.

## Data Management and Dissemination
- Data are organized with barcodes (MLURI), per-block and horizon-level records, and detailed appendices.
- Emphasis on archiving soil and vegetation data, cross-site collaboration (ECN, Micronet), data provenance, and openness, while acknowledging metadata and data-format challenges.
- The material demonstrates an integrated data pipeline: field sampling, laboratory analysis, horizon-specific descriptions, plot-level vegetation inventories, and long-term data storage.

## Relevance for Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates an integrated, replicated design for monitoring soil health and vegetation in upland grassland/gleys environments.
- Combines qualitative horizon descriptions with quantitative soil chemistry and vegetation data to assess environmental health.
- Highlights data governance needs: robust metadata, standardized measurements, data archiving, and accessibility across institutions.
- Provides a concrete example of long-term environmental health monitoring, with potential for policy scrutiny, evaluation of management practices, and informing future decisions.
