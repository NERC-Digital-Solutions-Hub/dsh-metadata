# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

## Overview
- Large-scale field experiment on Sourhope farm (Scottish Borders) within the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme.
- Baseline data collected since 1998; broad monitoring to contextualize detailed studies.
- Treatments: Control, Nitrogen (N), Lime (L), Nitrogen + Lime (N&L), Biocide.
- 2001 site disruptions: Foot and Mouth Disease restrictions reduced access (Feb–May); change of Officer in Charge; one biocide application missed; shift from manual cutting to mechanical mowing noted.
- Data focus: above-ground biomass, soil pH, botanical composition (point analysis), weather data; inter-year comparisons.

## Results

### 2.1 Automatic Weather Station
- 2001 headline weather generally unremarkable.
- Rainfall near long-term average after a very wet prior year.
- Total radiation similar to previous years; average temperatures slightly lower.
- Soil moisture content modestly higher than in earlier years.

### 2.2 Above-ground biomass
- Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments with peak biomass in July/August each year.
- 2001 biomass higher than 1999–2000, attributed to site management changes and switch to mechanical cutting.
- Biomass analyses normalized to C1 to compare treatments; nitrogen and lime effects most pronounced.
- Statistical findings: significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs unimproved; significant interaction between treatment and year; no significant block effect.

### 2.3 Soil pH
- Lime application raised surface soil pH (0–5 cm): October 2001 averages 6.19 in limed plots, 6.38 in N&L plots.
- Nitrogen alone also raised pH but to a lesser extent.
- Control plots showed no significant pH change since August 1998 baseline.

### 2.4 Botanical composition
- July 2001 Point Analysis largely consistent with 2000; surveyors' results not statistically different.
- 2001 hits were 58% higher than 2000, indicating greater sward density, possibly due to reduced grazing since 1998.
- Species responses by treatment:
  - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments (except remaining abundant in Control1 and Limed plots).
  - Festuca spp. (ovina, rubra) increased across treatments; most frequent in N and Biocide (Festuca ovina) and N&L (Festuca rubra).
  - Improved plots (fertilized or limed) showed more Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis; less fertile-associated species (Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta) more common in unimproved plots.
- Diversity indicated by hits: unimproved plots maintained 24 species; N&L plots had 18 species, suggesting potential early diversity decline with fertilization/liming.
- Principal Components Analysis (PCA) separated improved vs unimproved plots; robust association of N and/or L with more Festuca rubra and related species.
- Biomass correlations with species:
  - Positive: Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis tied to higher biomass.
  - Negative: Anthoxanthum odoratum, Nardus stricta, bryophytes (e.g., Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus) tended to decline as biomass increased.
- Litter abundance increased in plots receiving nitrogen and/or lime, indicating faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

## Site Heterogeneity

### 3.1 Variation in surface soil pH and plant community composition
- Spatial heterogeneity observed: columns E and F exhibited more acidic conditions.
- Underlying heterogeneity linked to a bias in treatment distribution (more Control/Biocide plots in those columns) and actual pH differences in nitrogen and/or lime plots in these columns.

### 3.2 Variation in vegetation biomass
- Outlier plots with low biomass contrasted with central plots showing higher biomass.
- Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass.
- No significant biomass differences detected between blocks.

## Key Data Insights for Analysis
- Nitrogen and lime fertilization jointly promote above-ground biomass and shift plant communities toward species associated with improved pastures.
- Liming substantially elevates soil pH, reinforcing biomass gains and altering species composition.
- 2001 disruptions (FMD, personnel changes) influenced measurement consistency, including a switch to mechanical mowing and one missed biocide application; cross-year comparisons should account for these factors.
- Vegetation biomass correlates with higher soil pH, and community composition shifts align with biomass increases (e.g., rise of Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis; decline of Agrostis capillaris in treated plots).
- Spatial heterogeneity across the site affects pH and biomass distributions, underscoring the need to control for location effects in analyses.

## Implications for Further Analysis
- Maintain year-by-year normalization (e.g., against C1) to isolate treatment effects from management changes.
- Use PCA and species-biomass correlations to interpret how treatments drive community structure over time.
- Accounting for site heterogeneity (column/lineage effects) is essential in modeling biomass and species composition.
- Consider data quality and completeness from 2001 (FMD-related access limits) when predicting long-term trends.
