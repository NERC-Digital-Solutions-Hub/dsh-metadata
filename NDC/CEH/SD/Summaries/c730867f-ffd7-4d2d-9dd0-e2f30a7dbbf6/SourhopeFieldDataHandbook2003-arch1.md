# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

## Overview
- Multi-block field data from Sourhope’s Rigg Foot site, focusing on soil profiles, soil chemistry/physical properties, and vegetation surveys (Blocks 4 and 5) plus an Ecotron plot.
- Provides horizon-by-horizon descriptions, texture, color, structure, roots, and boundaries, together with lab analyses (N, C, C:N, Ca, Mg, K, Na, LOI, moisture loss, pH) and surface vegetation data.
- Data are organized to enable cross-horizon, cross-plot, and cross-dataset analysis of soil–plant relationships under managed perturbations.

  - Moisture and organic matter: %Moisture loss ~4.8–10.1; LOI values high in surface horizons (e.g., FH ~73.3% LOI in Block 4; H ~63.99%).
  - pH: pH(H2O) ~4.76–4.94; pH(CaCl2) ~3.88–4.19 (acidic surface conditions).
- Auger samples (Block 4, 4A–4F):
  - Depths and horizon-specific results show increasing C and N with surface horizons, variable Ca/Mg/K across horizons, and similar acidic patterns.
  - pH values on auger samples generally in acid range (H2O ~4.8–4.9; CaCl2 ~3.9–4.1).
- Vegetation context:
  - Dominant grasses across plots: Agrostis capillaris, Festuca rubra, Nardus stricta; occasional Anthoxanthum odoratum.
  - Total species richness ~25 across plots; higher richness downslope.
  - Community classification aligns with upland NVC grassland types; edge plots show different indicator species than interior plots.
  - Indicator/association species include Deschampsia flexuosa, D. cespitosa, Agrostis canina, Holcus mollis, Ranunculus repens, Carex binervis, Juncus effusus.
- Vegetation survey data (Plot-level observations):
  - Block 4 plots show varied species totals and distributions across subplots; edge vs interior gradients influence species presence.

## BLOCK 5: SOIL PROFILE AND ANALYSES
- Soil profile description (depths and horizons):
  - LF: 0–1 cm; fibrous, moist; no stones.
  - FH: 1–5 cm; semi-fibrous; abundant very fine roots.
  - H: 5–7 cm; black; semi-fibrous; moist; weak blocky structure.
  - Ah: 7–25 cm; very dark brown; sandy silt loam; moist; friable; abundant fine roots; many medium subangular andesite stones.
  - AB: 25–35 cm; grey with red-yellow mottling; coarse sandy silt loam; moist; friable; abundant fine roots.
  - Bg: 35–49 cm; reddish brown; yellowish red mottling; clay loam; moist; firm; many very fine fibrous roots.
  - BCg: 49–70 cm; reddish brown to yellow-red mottling; clay loam; massive to weak blocky; moist; firm; very fine roots.
  - Cg: 70–100 cm; light reddish brown; clay loam; massive; moist; firm; no roots.
- Key soil metrics (Block 5 representative ranges):
  - %N: 0.65–2.17; %C: 6.41–33.81; C:N: 10.20–16.46 across horizons.
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca ranges broadly (0.35–11.91 meq/100 g); Mg (0.58–5.92); K (0.58–0.83; some horizons up to ~0.83–0.83); Na generally very low.
  - LOI and organic matter: LOI values high in surface horizons (Ah around ~19–67% depending on horizon; FH/H values variable; highest LOI often in Ah/ FH); %Moisture loss ~4.3–9.4; pH H2O ~4.34–5.20; pH CaCl2 ~3.53–4.41.
- Auger samples (Block 5 augers 5A–5F):
  - Horizon-specific data show similar patterns of N, C, and C:N; Ca, Mg, K values vary by horizon; moisture loss and LOI indicate substantial organic content in upper horizons with decline downslope.
  - pH values remain in the acidic range (H2O ~4.34–5.20; CaCl2 ~3.53–4.41).
- Vegetation context:
  - Block 5 plots exhibit substantial local diversity with species totals per subplot ranging widely (examples show totals up to ~54 species in some plots), indicating heterogeneous grassland–forb assemblages across the block.
  - Plant composition across plots includes grasses and forbs with variable richness, consistent with upland habitat mosaics.

## BLOCK 5: VEGETATION SURVEY
- Plot-level data indicate mixed communities across subplots with varying species counts (e.g., totals per subplot range from singletons to over 50 species in some plots), reflecting heterogeneity in microhabitats and soil properties.
- Overall, Block 5 shows diverse assemblages typical of upland grassland systems, with varying dominance patterns among grasses and forbs across plots.

## ECOTRON SOIL SITE

  - Wt: 6.089 mg; %N 0.59; %C 8.22; C:N 13.83; Ca 2.76 meq/100 g; Mg 1.7 meq/100 g; K 0.62; Na 0.15; moisture loss 4.79%; LOI 17.42%; pH H2O 4.79; pH CaCl2 3.82.
- Vegetation (Ecotron plot):
  - Data indicate a small but representative vegetation survey across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, etc., with various species tallies by subplot, showing a modest but diverse assemblage within the Ecotron setting.

## Data structure, accessibility, and context for analysts
- The datasets comprise horizon-by-horizon soil descriptions, core chemistry (N, C, C:N), and exchangeable cation measurements (Ca, Mg, K, Na) alongside LOI, moisture loss, and pH (H2O and CaCl2) for multiple horizons within blocks and augers, plus plot-level vegetation inventories.
- Appendices and site details (including grid references, altitudes, horizon descriptions, and soil classifications) accompany the data, supporting cross-block comparisons and reuse.
- The data are designed for discovery and reuse with metadata, enabling cross-dataset analyses of soil conditions and plant communities, as part of long-term monitoring and broader environmental-change research contexts.
