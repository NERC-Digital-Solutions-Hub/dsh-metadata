# NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme

## Overview
- Four-year summary of the Sourhope field experiment at Macaulay Land Use Research Institute, Scottish Borders.
- Aims: understand soil biodiversity and its functional roles, linking below-ground processes to above-ground plant communities.
- Long-running, multi-project framework with 16 Phase I projects and 8 Phase II projects; extensive botanical and soil monitoring alongside below-ground studies.
- Site management includes fencing to exclude grazing and a regular mowing regime; five plot-level treatments (and two control plots) studied across five blocks.

## Experimental design and data scope
- Rigg Foot Experimental Site: 5 replicate blocks on a downslope gradient; 6 main plots per block, subdivided into 10 sub-plots; random treatment allocation.
- Treatments at plot level: Control 1, Control 2, Nitrogen, Lime, Nitrogen & Lime, Insecticide (Dursban 4). Each year, plots receive site-wide mowing plus targeted plot treatments.
- Data collection modalities (1998–2002): 
  - Weather data from on-site Automatic Weather Station.
  - Above-ground biomass: regular 0.5 m^2 vegetation samples weighed after drying; five summer cuts per year.
  - Botanical surveys: baseline 1998, then annual July/August point analysis using 0.5 m^2 cells and 100-point grids.
  - Bryophyte identification (2002 enhanced to species level).
  - Soil chemistry and moisture: soil pH (5 cm depth) and soil moisture (theta probe) measurements.
  - Additional small-scale surveys and biomass sort-and-weigh activities across years and plots.
- Scale: 11621 soil samples collected since project start; substantial data across treatments, blocks, and years; detailed data archived in multiple appendices.

## Treatments and management details
- Site-wide management: monthly mowing May–Sept to ~6 cm; insecticide (Dursban 4 OPA) applied after mowing on insecticide plots; spring application of nitrogen and/or lime where designated.
- Plot-level treatments (examples):
  - Nitrogen: NH4NO3 fertilizer, annual total N 24 g/m^2, split applications.
  - Lime: CaCO3 lime, annual application ~600 g/m^2.
  - Nitrogen & Lime: combined application as above.
  - Insecticide: Dursban 4 OPA applied five times per year in treated plots.
- Data collection schedule and methods documented in Appendices, including dates for mowing, fertiliser applications, and insecticide treatments.

## Key findings (data-focused perspectives)

### Productivity and biomass
- Long-term trend: biomass productivity increased across most treatments from 1999 onward; 2002 biomass generally lower than 2001 in several treatments, with Fertiliser plots (N and/or Lime) remaining most productive.
- Greatest gain in plots receiving both nitrogen and lime; Control 2 plots consistently less productive than Control 1 in certain years.
- Spatial pattern: slope position influenced productivity, with lower-blocked areas showing larger declines.

### Soil chemistry and moisture
- Lime dramatically raised soil pH toward ~7.0 in the upper soil profile; nitrogen had a smaller positive effect on pH.
- Clear negative correlation between soil moisture and pH (drier, higher pH plots vs wetter, acidic plots).
- Overall positive relationship between soil pH and above-ground biomass when considering all plots; treatment-level nuances show positive or negative pH–biomass relationships depending on zoomed-in treatment categories (e.g., nitrogen-only, lime-only, or combined).

### Plant diversity and community composition
- Fertilised plots (N and/or Lime) showed shifts toward grass species associated with improved pastures (e.g., Festuca rubra, Poa pratensis) in point-analysis, with these species comprising larger shares of hits in fertilised plots vs unimproved plots.
- Unimproved plots increasingly dominated by stress-tolerant species; mowing plus nutrient removal of clippings likely reduces nutrient retention, favoring stress-tolerant taxa and bryophytes.
- Bryophyte abundance rose across the site, notably Rhytidiadelphus squarrosus, with mosses contributing a growing share of total hits, especially in unimproved plots.
- Shannon diversity index generally declined in the nitrogen & lime plots by 2002 relative to baseline, while diversity in other treatments rose; insecticide-treated plots showed notable increases in diversity over time.
- Functional-group analysis (CSR framework): 
  - C-S-R (competitive-stress-ruderal) species expanded in nitrogen+lime plots.
  - Stress-tolerators (S) benefited in unimproved plots.
  - SR/CSR groups reduced in lime-treated (with and without nitrogen) and insecticide-treated plots.
- Point-analysis PCA separated improved vs unimproved plots; lime-treated plots formed a distinct cluster; some nitrogen-treated samples aligned with limed plots, suggesting fertilisation effects on vegetation structure.

### Plant–insect dynamics and trampling
- Insecticide effects on diversity are complex and not straightforwardly linked to measured diversity; possible indirect effects via reduced herbivory enabling certain palatable species.
- Trampling (notably in 2002 C2 plots during 13CO2 pulses) likely contributed to reduced productivity in those plots, illustrating the impact of incidental disturbance on measured outputs.

## Data quality, gaps, and governance considerations
- 2002 weather-station outage: July–November data missing; Konza weather station data substituted for those periods; other data remain intact.
- Rich, multi-dimensional datasets spanning years, treatments, plots, and species; extensive appendices catalog datasets, species lists, and biomass metrics.
- Data accessibility: detailed project data and datasets are available via the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH, enabling cross-project analysis and data reuse.
- Taxonomic refinement (e.g., bryophyte identification) improved mid-study, highlighting the importance of consistent metadata and taxonomic standards for longitudinal analyses.
- The CSR functional-type framework is employed to interpret community responses, suggesting a need for standardized functional-group data definitions across long-term experiments.

## Implications for data strategy and governance (Data Leaders perspective)
- Value of long-term, multi-factor experimental data for systemic data strategy: comprehensive datasets across management regimes, environmental gradients, and biological scales.
- Importance of robust metadata and data standards:
  - Clear documentation of treatments, mowing schedules, fertiliser rates, insecticide regimens, and sampling geometry (0.5 m^2 cells, 25-point baselines, 100-point point analyses).
  - Consistent species coding and functional-type classification (CSR) to enable cross-year and cross-plot comparisons.
- Data discoverability and sharing:
  - Centralized access through the Soil Biodiversity website and CEH channels enhances cross-project collaboration and data reuse.
  - Appendices and supplementary datasets (biomass, biomass rankings, species rank abundance, bryophyte lists) provide essential data previews for aggregation and meta-analysis.
- Data quality and resilience:
  - Document and plan for data gaps (e.g., weather station outages) and establish data substitutions with transparent provenance.
  - Maintain standardized protocols for bryophyte identification, plant identification, and functional classification to enable consistent longitudinal analyses.
- Practical governance recommendations:
  - Create a data dictionary and data provenance trace for all datasets (plots, treatments, years, sampling methods).
  - Implement versioning and change logs for taxonomic refinements and measurement protocols.
  - Ensure ongoing accessibility of data across years and projects, with clear licensing and citation guidance.
  - Leverage the CSR framework and other functional classifications to harmonize cross-year analyses of community responses to management.
