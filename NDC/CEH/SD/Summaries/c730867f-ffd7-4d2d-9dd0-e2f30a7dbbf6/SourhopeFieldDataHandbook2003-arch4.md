# SOIL PROFILE OF RIGG Foot, Sourhope

- A detailed documentation of soil profiles, laboratory analyses, and vegetation data for Sourhope field site, focusing on BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, with additional ECOTRON plot data. Includes soil profile descriptions, horizon-by-horizon analyses, auger samples, vegetation surveys by plot/subplot, and site metadata.

## Scope and components

- Soil profiles and analyses for BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5, including horizon-by-horizon descriptions, depth ranges, color/structure notes, and presence of roots or stones.
- Auger sample analyses (AUGER SAMPLES) across horizons, capturing %N, %C, C:N, major cations (Ca, Na, K, Mg), moisture-related metrics, LOI, and pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Vegetation surveys associated with each plot and subplot, providing species totals and counts per plot/subplot.
- ECOTRON PLOT data for soil and vegetation, offering a controlled-environment reference within the Sourhope site.
- Site metadata for BLOCK 5 (grid reference, altitude, slope, drainage, soil series and subgroups, and parent material).

## Data structure and identifiers

- Horizon nomenclature and depth ranges (e.g., LF, FH, H, Ah, AB, Bg, BCg, Cg; depth intervals vary by block).
- Sample identifiers and storage: MLURI Barcodes accompany each horizon and auger sample, with weight measurements in mg listed per horizon or sample.
- Depth-specific analyses include:
  - Basic soil properties: %N, %C, C:N ratio, pH (H2O and CaCl2), moisture loss, LOI.
  - Exchangeable cations: Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g).
  - Additional soil properties: %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, and pH values across horizons.
- Block-specific organization:
  - BLOCK 4: Horizon sequence from surface LF to C gx (0–95 cm range), with detailed notes on color, texture, structure, and rooting.
  - BLOCK 5: Horizon sequence from surface LF to Cg (0–100 cm range), with similar descriptive detail and comprehensive analytical data.
- Vegetation data are organized by PLOT (e.g., 4A, 4B, 4C, 4D, 4E, 4F; 5A, 5B, etc.) and include per-subplot species totals.

## Key data types and measurements

- Soil profile descriptions:
  - Visual and textural descriptions (color matrix, structure, moisture, roots, stones).
  - Depth boundaries and boundary descriptions (sharp/soft, boundary type).
- Laboratory analyses by horizon (BLOCK 4 and BLOCK 5):
  - %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg (meq/100g).
  - %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition.
  - pH (H2O) and pH (CaCl2).
  - Weight (mg) associated with each horizon.
- Auger samples (5A–5F for BLOCK 5; several points for BLOCK 4 AUGER SAMPLES):
  - %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH (H2O and CaCl2).
- Vegetation surveys:
  - Species totals per plot/subplot; counts across Ac, Ao, At, Br, Cp, Cxp, Dc, Df, Fo, Fr, Gs Hm Je Lm Lzm Mc Ns Pe Pp Pt Ra Rr Rs Tr Vc, etc.
- ECOTRON PLOT:
  - Soil analysis (Wt mg, %N, %C, C:N, Ca, Na, K, Mg, %Moisture loss, %Loss on Ignition, pH H2O, pH CaCl2).
  - Vegetation survey with per-plot/species totals.

## Notable data characteristics and quality notes

- Rich, multi-year-like data structure enabling cross-horizon and cross-block comparisons (surface to deeper horizons).
- Data density varies by horizon and block; some Na data are missing in several BLOCK 4 horizons; some blocks show incomplete or sparse data in certain variables.
- Consistent use of horizon codes and block IDs supports cross-site comparability and reusability within pedological and ecological analyses.
- Sample metadata are well-documented via MLURI Barcodes, enabling traceability from horizon/sample to analysis results and to vegetation data.
- Soil pedology context provided (parent materials, major subgroups, drainage) supports interpretation of chemical and physical gradients across depths and plots.

## Metadata, accessibility, and reuse

- Site and sample metadata include grid references, altitude, slope, drainage status, soil series, major soil subgroup, and parent material for BLOCK 5.
- Horizon descriptions, boundaries, and depth intervals are standardized within each block, facilitating reproducibility and cross-study integration.
- Data are linked to archiveable sample storage and linked to broader ECN/Micronet and field-plot frameworks, enabling integration with related datasets and longitudinal analyses.

## Data-leadership implications (summarized)

- Emphasize consistent, hierarchical data organization (horizon-based data with rigorous depth and boundary definitions) to support interoperability.
- Maintain robust metadata and unique identifiers (MLURI Barcodes) for traceability from field samples to laboratory results and vegetation data.
- Prioritize data completeness and documentation of gaps (noting missing Na values or incomplete entries) to improve data quality assessments and future analyses.
- Leverage the integrated structure (soil profiles, auger samples, vegetation surveys, ecotron data) to enable cross-domain analyses (soil-vegetation interactions, depth-resolved nutrient dynamics, and site comparisons).
- Ensure archival storage and clear data provenance to support long-term reuse and cross-network synthesis.
