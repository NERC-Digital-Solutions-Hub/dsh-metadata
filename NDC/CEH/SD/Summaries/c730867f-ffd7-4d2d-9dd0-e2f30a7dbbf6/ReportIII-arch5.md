# REPORT III RESULTS FROM THE SOURHOPE FIELD EXPERIMENT: 1999-2001

- Overview
  - Detailed results from the Sourhope field experiment under the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme, conducted at Sourhope Farm, Scottish Borders.
  - Aimed at providing context and linkages for related studies, with data designed to be comparable across years (1999–2001) and to inform data users about measurement types, timing, and management changes.
  - Key management and access notes: 2001 site operations affected by Foot and Mouth restrictions (Feb–May); officer in charge change in May 2001; routine management (liming, nitrogen, pH measurements, biomass collection, vegetation cutting, Point Analysis) largely continued under a defined management plan.

- Data Collected and Measurement Schedule
  - Weather data from Automatic Weather Station (rainfall, radiation, soil moisture, air and soil temperatures at multiple depths).
  - Above-ground biomass measurements across the summer growing season (five cuts per year; 1999–2001); biomass reports normalized to a reference plot (C1) for year-to-year comparison.
  - Soil pH measurements at the upper 5 cm (baseline 1998; follow-up 2001) to assess effects of lime and nitrogen.
  - Botanical composition using Point Quadrat surveys in July 2001 (and comparison to 2000); species hits recorded per plot; data include 24 species in unimproved plots vs 18 species in improved plots.
  - Vegetation structure and turnover analyses, including litter frequency and correlations with biomass.
  - Site heterogeneity indicators: spatial variation in pH and biomass across columns and plots; biomass distribution and its relation to pH.

- Experimental Design and Treatments
  - Field plots arranged with replicates across blocks and subplots, subjected to six treatments:
    - Control 1 (C1) and Control 2 (C2)
    - Nitrogen (N)
    - Lime (L)
    - Nitrogen and Lime (N&L)
    - Biocide (B)
  - Treatments analyzed for impacts on biomass, pH, and botanical composition; monitoring included annual and inter-year comparisons (1999–2001).

- Key Datasets and Methods
  - Biomass data: five summer harvests per year; dried weight combined for annual biomass; natural log transformation applied for ANOVA.
  - pH data: soil pH measured in 0–5 cm depth; lime increased pH over time, with N also elevating pH to a lesser extent.
  - Botanical data: Point Quadrat surveys using 100-cell grids; 25 cells per survey cell; two surveyors (no significant inter-surveyor difference detected).
  - Species-level analyses: percentage hits per species by treatment; PCA to explore community composition differences; correlation analyses between species abundance and biomass.
  - Data processing notes: extensive use of Genstat 5 for ANOVA and PCA; biomass and species data linked to year-specific measurements and mowing schedules.

- Results Highlights (by dataset)

  - Automatic Weather Station (2001)
    - 2001 rainfall near long-term average following an unusually wet prior year.
    - Radiation changes minimal; average temperatures slightly lower; soil moisture moderately higher than previous years.

  - Above-ground Biomass
    - Clear hierarchy of biomass across treatments, with nitrogen and/or lime additions increasing biomass relative to unimproved plots.
    - Peak biomass consistently in July/August each year.
    - 2001 showed substantial biomass increases versus 2000, likely due to personnel changes and switch from manual cutting to mechanical shears.
    - Statistical analyses indicate significant differences between improved (N and/or L) vs non-improved plots; significant year-by-treatment interaction; no significant block effect.

  - Soil pH
    - Lime application raised surface soil pH to about 6.19 (limed plots) and 6.38 (N&L plots) by Oct 2001.
    - Nitrogen application alone also raised soil pH but to a lesser extent.
    - Control plots showed no significant pH change since baseline (Aug 1998).

  - Botanical Composition
    - 2001 Point Quadrat results show shifts in dominant species by treatment.
    - Agrostis capillaris declined across all treatments in 2001, while Festuca species increased; Fertilized plots favored Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis.
    - Species diversity appeared to decline in the most improved plots (24 species in unimproved vs 18 in N&L).
    - PCA separated nitrogen- and/or lime-treated plots from control/biocide plots; enhanced plots associated with Festuca rubra and related species.
    - Biomass correlated positively with Festuca rubra and Poa pratensis abundance; abundance of species like Anthoxanthum odoratum and Nardus stricta declined with increasing biomass.
    - Increased litter frequency observed in plots treated with nitrogen and/or lime, suggesting faster vegetation turnover with higher soil fertility.

- Site Heterogeneity
  - Spatial variation observed across the site, with columns E and F showing comparatively more acidic plots (likely influenced by treatment distribution and plot composition).
  - Biomass distribution showed outlying plots with lower biomass across treatments, while central plots tended to have higher biomass.
  - Strong positive correlation between surface soil pH and biomass; no significant differences in biomass between blocks.

- Data Governance and Access
  - Weather data streamed to the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager at CEH, Merlewood; ongoing data management and quality control support noted.
  - Baseline and yearly data published to enable cross-year comparisons and linkage with other research groups’ data (as described in Baseline Data Survey, 1998).
  - Access constraints occurred during FMD outbreak (Feb–May 2001) with protocol-based resumption of sampling under veterinary oversight.
  - Documentation and site management records maintained by MLURI Sourhope staff; documentation of personnel changes and procedural changes (e.g., mowing method) acknowledged for data interpretation.

- Data Quality and Processing
  - Inter-surveyor reliability tested for Point Quadrat surveys; no significant differences detected in 2001.
  - Data analyses include ANOVA (split-plot designs), year-by-treatment interactions, and PCA to explore community composition shifts.
  - Appendix 1 provides annual biomass values for all plots, enabling longitudinal analyses.

- Practical Considerations and Limitations for Data Stewards
  - Equipment and method changes (manual vs mechanical mowing) may influence biomass measurements; proper metadata needed for cross-year comparability.
  - Site management events (FMD restrictions) affected sampling windows and observer access; record these events in data provenance.
  - Spatial heterogeneity within the site should be preserved in geospatial metadata to support future analyses of pH-biomass relationships.
  - Ensure consistent linkage between datasets (biomass, pH, botanical surveys, weather) with common plot identifiers and year stamps.

- References and Data Availability
  - The report builds on the Baseline Data Survey (November 1998) and references the 1999–2001 data collection program.
  - Primary data streams designed to be uploaded to relevant data portals; ongoing curation by the Soil Biodiversity Data Manager and MLURI/Sourhope staff.
