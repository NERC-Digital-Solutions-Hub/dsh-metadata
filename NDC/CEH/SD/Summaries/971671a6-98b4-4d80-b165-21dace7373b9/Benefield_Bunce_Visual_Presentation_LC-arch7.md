# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

## Overview
- Merlewood Research and Development Paper No 91 presents a visual interpretation of Britain’s land classes to supplement existing quantitative descriptions.
- Builds on a GB land classification system identifying 32 land classes, with field surveys detailing vegetation, soils, and land uses.
- Aims to support landscape understanding and aid future land-use change assessments, including wood-energy plantation planning.

## Aims and Scope
- Provide an objective framework to describe the range of British landscapes using land classes that share fundamental land-form characteristics.
- Translate descriptive, quantitative land-class data into visual landscape representations to better convey composition and potential changes.
- Supplement Merlewood’s preliminary textual descriptions with visual impressions to help stakeholders understand landscape character.

## Methods
- Grounded in a long-standing landscape evaluation literature, comparing objective methods (e.g., Linton, Tandy, Coventry-Solihull-Warwickshire approaches) with judgement-based practices.
- Land classification developed by Bunce et al. (1981) to assist site selection for field sampling; 32 land classes identified with known area and distribution.
- Data sources:
  - Map analysis to identify primary and subsidiary trends.
  - Field surveys to enrich descriptions with vegetation, soils, and land-use details.
- Visual representations:
  - Transition from photographs to a collage approach to depict typical features of each land class.
  - Uses two main information sources per class: three representative photographs and mean values/descriptions from Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86.
  - Rough sketches are iteratively refined to avoid overemphasizing any single feature; acknowledges some classes, especially highly variable ones, are difficult to represent accurately.

## Visual Representation Approach
- Collages combine representative features to express landscape character for each land class.
- Intended to convey the “average” landscape of a class and its composition, rather than depicting a specific location.
- Recognizes limitations where some classes can be wholly forested or wholly open; such variability is highlighted as a challenge.

## Applications and Uses
- Provides an objective framework to describe British landscapes, aligning with prior descriptive and quantitative methods.
- Supports County-level ecological and land-use characterizations, facilitating more detailed surveys and productivity assessments.
- Enables monitoring and prediction of land-use changes, including impacts of proposed developments.
- Used to develop scenarios of different intensities of land exploitation (e.g., wood-energy plantations) using the six basic landscapes as starting points.
- Copies of the land-class visuals and descriptions are available on request from the authors.

## Key Concepts and Context
- The land-class approach complements earlier authoritative landscape evaluations (e.g., Robinson et al. 1976) and builds on a history of objective vs. subjective assessment in landscape work.
- Land classes can serve as a descriptive framework for landscape types, capturing common features across regions.
- The paper links descriptive land-class information with practical visualization to aid interpretation and decision-making.

## Examples of Land Classes (Illustrative)
- Land Class 7: Coastal – variable coastal morphology; mainly pasture; estuarine influences; associated soils and vegetation described.
- Land Class 13: Somewhat Variable Land Forms – heterogeneous grade and use; includes mixed arable and grassland; variable soils.
- Land Class 26: Fertile Lowlands – typically mixed lowland landscapes; arable emphasis with good grassland; frequently impacted by urban development.
- Coastal, lowland, upland, moorland, and river valley classes are represented with detailed geographic scopes (e.g., England, Wales, Scotland), land-form types, topography, landscape characteristics, land use, soils, and vegetation.
- The document acknowledges a broad spectrum of landscape types across Great Britain, from flat arable plains to high mountain moorlands.

## Limitations and Considerations
- Some land classes exhibit significant internal variability, making idealized visual representations challenging.
- Visual outputs may over- or under-emphasize certain features in some classes.
- The approach relies on three photographs per class plus quantitative descriptions; some features may still be underrepresented.

## References and Background
- Landscape evaluation literature and methodologies cited include: Linton (1968), Gilg (1974, 1975), Duffield & Owen (1970), Owen et al. (1973, 1974), Penning-Rowsell (1973), Robinson et al. (1976), Tandy (1971), and Liddle (1976).
- Prior consolidation: Bunce et al. (1981, 1982) on an integrated land-classification system for Great Britain and preliminary descriptions for users.
- Related studies and government-led landscape classifications cited (e.g., Countryside Commission, Scotland, and UK Department of the Environment).
- The work aligns with Merlewood’s broader program, including land-use planning and wood-energy expansion analyses (e.g., wood-energy plantation scenarios).
