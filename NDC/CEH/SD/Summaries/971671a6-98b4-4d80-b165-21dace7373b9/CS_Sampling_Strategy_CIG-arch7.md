# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Document the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, tying together the evolving ITE Land Classification with nationwide ecological sampling and reporting.

- Core concept: Use a stratified sampling framework based on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative, map-based data on Britain's countryside for habitat, land use, and ecological change.

- Key data product flow: Land Classification informs the sampling frame (1 km squares) → field surveys collect habitat/land-use data → national estimates are produced and linked to maps and land-class maps.

- Temporal scope: Traces the development from 1978 (initial survey) through 1984, 1990, 2000, to 2007 (with Wales-specific reporting and upland modules).

- Geographic and reporting emphasis:
  - Early work covered Great Britain with a single, broad classification.
  - Later work introduced country-specific reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) and Welsh-specific classes.
  - An uplands module was added to improve habitat estimates in upland areas.
  - Isle of Man adjustments were made to ensure consistent country-unit reporting.

- Data structure and classification concepts:
  - Stratification to reduce bias and improve representativeness, using landform, climate, geology, and other environmental attributes.
  - ITE Land Classification: started with 32 classes in the 1970s, developed from centre squares of a 15x15 km grid, then extended to include surrounding squares for robust classification.
  - Class evolution: 32 classes (1978) → 40 classes (1990) → 45 classes (2000, with Wales-specific subdivisions) → 45/46+ classes (2007 with Wales-specific sub-classes and additional country-unit subdivisions).

- Sampling mechanics across the surveys:
  - 1978: 256 field squares (8 per class) across 32 classes; national estimates derived by multiplying mean habitat area per square by the land-class area.
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class); framework extended to incorporate updated data; emphasis on land use and habitat mapping.
  - 1990: All GB 1 km squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; addition of Land Cover Map linked to the classification.
  - 2000: Separate country estimates introduced; land classes subdivided into country-unit versions; 40 strata; additional squares added to ensure representation; uplands module planned.
  - 2007: Wales-only reporting enhanced; five Welsh sub-classes created (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; 43 additional Welsh squares added; some English classes reduced to maintain representation; revised maps published; England, Wales, Scotland sampling frames shown in updated figures.

- Country-unit estimates and adjustments:
  - Framework adjustments to support England with Wales and Scotland-only reporting.
  - Class subdivision and aggregation used to ensure adequate representation within each country unit.
  - Replacement and reallocation of squares (e.g., Isle of Man adjustments) to maintain country-specific estimates.

- Uplands module (CS2000+C2007):
  - Added 30 squares focusing on uplands and marginal uplands in England and Wales.
  - Improves statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates within country-based reporting.

- Data interpretation and estimation notes:
  - National estimates can be produced using either the latest classification (preferred for internal consistency) or the original 1990 classification (more consistent across surveys).
  - Changing land classifications affects stock estimates; the document discusses trade-offs between internal consistency and cross-survey comparability.

- Repositories and outputs:
  - Land Classification maps and updated sampling framework maps (for England with Wales, Scotland; and later Wales-specific and Wales-England subdivisions) accompany the survey results.
  - Table and figure references document the class descriptions, sample allocations, and sampling rates by year.

- Historical progression and references:
  - The strategy builds on iterative refinement of the ITE Land Classification and its application to Countryside Survey field surveys (1978–2007).
