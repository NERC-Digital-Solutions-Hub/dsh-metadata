# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) is the culmination of 30 years of developing the ITE Land Classification and its use as the sampling framework for national ecological surveys in Great Britain.
- The methodology remains tightly linked to its predecessors; understanding earlier iterations is essential to interpreting current and historic time-series data.

## Overview

- Purpose: To stratify a national field survey sample so that it is representative of Great Britain’s landscape and ecological variation.
- Approach: Stratified, random sampling built on the ITE Land Classification to ensure samples capture the range of land types and ecological conditions.
- Central idea: Use land classes to allocate sampling effort, enabling national and country-level estimates of habitat features and land uses.

## Key Concepts

- Stratification: Dividing land into discreet strata (land classes) to reduce sampling bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
- Sampling unit: 1 km square, chosen because it balances field survey feasibility with ecological differentiation.
- Land Classification: A multivariate scheme based on environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) to classify GB into distinct land classes.
- Time-series continuity: Each survey stage builds on the previous Land Classification framework to preserve comparability over time.

## Development Timeline

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification): First full GB classification using Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) on 1 km squares; 32 land classes created from centralized environmental data; 8 sample squares per class (total 256) surveyed for vegetation and habitat mapping.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey): Sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (total 384); continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification & 3rd Field Survey): Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; integration of the first Land Cover Map of GB from satellite data; was still largely based on the earlier framework for reporting.
- 1998–2000 (Revised Land Classification & CS2000): Further refinement to classify all GB squares with major surrogates for climatic, geological, and physiographic factors; introduced separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) with class subdivisions and aggregations to achieve 40 strata; added 19 new squares to better represent new classes and ensure balanced country representation; an upland habitat module was added to improve upland estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007 – Wales-focused reporting): Wales-specific needs led to further subdivision of Land Classes into country-unit versions (creating 45 strata total); added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation; adjustments in England to maintain comparability; continued emphasis on country-specific environmental reporting and policy needs.

## Sampling Framework and Classifications

- Land Class Structure: Evolved from 32 original classes (1978) to 40 (1990) and then to 45 (2000/2007) with country-unit subdivisions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w for Wales).
- Sample Allocation: CS1990 used a fixed number of samples per class; CS2000/CS2007 refined allocations to support separate country estimates and improved precision, including the addition of upland-focused sampling.
- Wales and Scotland: Scotland and Wales received dedicated sampling adjustments to produce robust country-level estimates; Isle of Man is not used for country-unit estimates but replaced in some revisions to preserve country-specific sampling balance.
- Separate Country Estimates: Framework evolved to provide England with Wales, and Scotland-specific estimates, aligning sampling with policy and reporting needs.

## Separate Country Estimates and Wales/Upland Modules

- England & Wales vs Scotland: CS2000 introduced country-unit variants of Land Classes, creating 40 strata; Wales received additional class subdivisions and extra sample squares to achieve minimum representation per class.
- Wales-specific Changes (CS2007): Implemented five new Welsh country-unit classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); increased Welsh sampling to ensure six squares per Welsh class; overall Wales became the most intensively sampled country unit.
- Uplands Module (CS2000): Added 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in upland regions, reflecting policy needs and representation.

## Data Outputs and Access

- Outputs: Time-series data on habitat areas and land-use features derived from stratified samples; land class maps and periodic national and country-level estimates.
- Publications: Main reports and country-focused summaries produced (e.g., Countryside Survey 1990, Countryside Survey UK Results from 2007) with detailed methodologies and classifications.
- Data Considerations: The choice of Land Classification affects national consistency across surveys; for cross-survey consistency, different approaches may be used (latest country-specific vs original unified classifications).

## Challenges and Considerations

- Representativeness vs practicality: Balancing a representative stratification with feasible field sampling across the country.
- Changing classifications: Revisions to the Land Classification across surveys can affect comparability and the interpretation of trend data; 2006 scoping notes emphasized potential inconsistencies when switching classifications.
- Country-specific reporting: Devolution and policy needs drove Wales and Scotland to require independent estimates, prompting adjustments to sample allocation and class definitions.
- Ensuring use and sharing: Outputs and country-specific results are intended to inform policy and public reporting, with ongoing attention to data sharing and re-use within and beyond the surveying bodies.
