# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

- A shapefile-based dataset defining 40 Land Class areas across Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope. Used within Countryside Survey work to characterise environmental conditions.

## Data specifics

- Format: Shapefile
- Coverage: Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Projection/Coordinate system: OSGB36 / British National Grid (Transverse Mercator)
- Columns:
  - LC1998: ITE Land Class Number (1998)
  - LC1998_COD: ITE Land Class Code (1998)

## Land Class content

- England/Wales and Scotland are represented with a numbered scheme describing distinct land-form and environmental contexts (e.g., flood plains, low calcareous hills, flat/undulating plains, estuarine/coastal areas, upland valleys, mountain-related classes, etc.).
- England/Wales classes range from 1e to 25e (with additional phrasings for 17w, 15e, etc.).
- Scotland classes are listed with corresponding 25–40 series (e.g., coastal plains/soft coasts, upland valleys, high mountain summits, etc.).

## Provenance and references

- Source: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology
- Supporting documentation and related references include sampling strategies and land classification studies (e.g., Barr 1998; Bunce et al. 1996a, 1996b; Howard et al. 1998; Clarke et al. 2006).

## How this dataset supports environmental monitoring

- Provides a standardized, fixed set of land-class categories for GB, enabling consistent temporal comparisons and policy performance assessments.
- Facilitates: 
  - Verification and quality assurance of environmental classifications
  - Cleaning and transforming environmental data into comparable land-class outputs
  - Generation of clear outputs (maps, charts) for monitoring environmental health against standards
  - Storage and dissemination of the dataset in appropriate data portals

## Practical considerations for analysts

- Temporal relevance: 1998 classification; consider harmonisation or alignment with newer land-cover classifications for time-series analyses.
- Integration: suitable for combining with other environmental indicators to increase dataset value beyond single-use applications.
- Accessibility: underlying data and related documentation are available for transparency and re-use.
