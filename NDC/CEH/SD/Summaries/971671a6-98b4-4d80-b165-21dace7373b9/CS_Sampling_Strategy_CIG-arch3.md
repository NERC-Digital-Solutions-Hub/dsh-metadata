# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

## Overview
- Describes the field sampling strategy for Countryside Survey up to 2007, the latest in a 30-year lineage of the ITE Land Classification-based approach.
- Aims to provide representative, stratified ecological sampling across Great Britain to monitor habitat, land use, and landscape change for policy and decision-making.
- Emphasises the linkage between the sampling framework and its predecessors to understand change and maintain continuity.

## Core concept: stratified sampling via the ITE Land Classification
- Stratification divides land into discrete classes (land classes) to ensure sampling captures regional and ecological variability.
- Use of objective, typically random, sample selection within each class to avoid bias and ensure samples are representative of the whole population.
- Early adoption of the 1 km square sampling unit, allowing manageable field surveys within a national framework.
- The Land Classification translates environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) into class structure to guide sampling and national estimations.

## Historical development of the ITE Land Classification and sampling

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and 1st Field Survey)
  - Indicator Species Analysis used to classify habitat into 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of 15 × 15 km grid; 1228 squares classified; surrounding squares also allocated).
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) for national estimates of habitat area.

- 1984 (2nd Field Survey)
  - Emphasis shifted to land use and habitat mapping; 12 squares per land class (384 total) surveyed.
  - National estimates still grounded in the 1978 Land Classification framework.

- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey)
  - Land Classification revised to classify all GB squares; urban/sea corrections incorporated.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat of 1978 quadrats; linkage to first Land Cover Map of GB.

- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey)
  - Classification extended to allow Scotland-only reporting; number of land classes increased to 40.

- 2000 (CS2000; 5th Field Survey)
  - To support policy needs, England, Scotland, and Wales were separable for country-specific estimates.
  - Sub-division of classes into country-unit versions; increased overall strata to 40; additional samples allocated to ensure representation in each country.
  - Introduction of upland/marginal upland sampling module planned to improve habitat estimates in uplands.

- 2007 (CS2007; 6th Field Survey)
  - Wales-only reporting recognised; Wales samples expanded and class sub-divisions refined to allow Wales-specific estimates (new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - Total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares (43) added to ensure minimum representation.
  - England adjustments maintained; Welsh sampling enhancements led to higher density of Welsh class representation.
  - Wales became the most intensively sampled country in the framework.

## Sampling framework and country-specific adjustments

- Stratification framework
  - GB-wide land classes defined by environmental attributes; sampling allocated across 32–45 classes over time.
  - Each class serves as a stratum; the number of sample squares per class determined to balance precision and logistical feasibility.

- Separate country estimates
  - CS1990 used class-based estimates across England, Scotland, and Wales; country-specific estimates were later refined.
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit versions of land classes and aggregations to ensure robust England & Wales and Scotland estimates; added squares to maintain adequacy of representation per country.
  - Further Wales-focused adjustments in CS2007 to support Wales-only environmental policy reporting.

- Upland module
  - An additional module in CS2000 added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland land classes to improve accuracy of upland habitat estimates for England and Wales.

## Data interpretation and national estimates

- Note on consistency across surveys
  - Changing Land Classification affects comparability of national estimates between surveys.
  - For within-survey consistency, the latest classification is preferred; for cross-survey consistency, a standardized approach is discussed (see accompanying notes and tables).
