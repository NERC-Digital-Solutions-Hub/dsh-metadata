# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

## Overview
- Shapefile dataset containing 40 Land Classes for Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude and slope.
- Each area in the dataset is a Land Class; used as the basis for land classification in related countryside surveys and ecological studies.

## Dataset details
- Format: Shapefile
- Content: 40 Land Classes (LC1998), with corresponding LC1998_COD (1998 code)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36)
- Projection: Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain

## Geographic coverage and coding
- England/Wales: Land Classes 1–24, described by landscape types (e.g., flood plains/shallow valleys, flat plains, coastal plains, upland valleys, etc.).
- Scotland: Land Classes 25–40, with supplementary notations (e.g., 25e, 25s, 26s, etc.) indicating regional adaptations of the classification (coasts, upland areas, mountain contexts).
- The document provides a complete mapping of land class numbers to descriptive landscape categories; full details are listed in the data file and accompanying documentation.

## Related methodologies and usage
- Grounded in prior and contemporary work on land classification for Britain.
- Used for Countryside Survey sampling and land-cover estimation across GB; includes references to sampling strategies and validation studies.

## Practical notes for analysts
- The dataset provides a consistent 1 km gridded land-class layer across GB, suitable for linking to environmental variables and for stratified analyses in landscape ecology and management.
- Documentation and supporting literature offer methodological context, validation, and sampling implications for cross-country comparisons (England/Wales vs. Scotland).
