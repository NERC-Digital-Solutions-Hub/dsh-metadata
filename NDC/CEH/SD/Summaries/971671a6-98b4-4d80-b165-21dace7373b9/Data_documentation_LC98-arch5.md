# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

## Overview
- Shapefile dataset classifying Great Britain into 40 land classes, created from Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology.
- Land classes are stratified by environmental characteristics (e.g., climate, altitude, slope) to provide a 1 km resolution GB-wide land classification.

## Data Content and Structure
- Format: Shapefile
- Extent: Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / Projection: British National Grid (OSGB1936), Transverse Mercator
- Columns:
  - LC1998: ITE Land Class Number (1998)
  - LC1998_COD: ITE Land Class Code (1998)
- Land Class Count: 40 distinct areas

## Land Class Definitions
- Descriptions correspond to 40 Land Class categories (England/Wales and Scotland mappings).
- England/Wales entries numbered 1–24 with designations such as flood plains, flat plains, coastal plains, upland valleys, etc.
- Scotland entries structured with cross-references (e.g., 25–40 with subcodes 1 and 2) to capture regional variations (e.g., coastal/mixed, upland, mountain-related classes).

## Provenance and Documentation
- Source: Countryside Survey data, ITE Land Classification (1998)

  - Barr (1998) Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey
  - Wood (2011) Revised sampling strategy up to 2007
  - Prior visual presentations and classifications (Bunce et al. 1982; 1991; 1996a; 1996b)
  - Validity studies and cross-regional considerations (Howard et al. 1998; Clarke et al. 2006)
- Additional documentation provides context for sampling, classification, and applicability to broader ecological estimates.

## Data Stewardship Considerations
- Governance and metadata:
  - Clear definition of 40 Land Class codes and their 1998 designations; ensure consistent use and mapping across systems.
  - Include comprehensive metadata (definitions, resolution, extent, projection, and lineage) for discoverability and reuse.
- Standards and interoperability:
  - Shapefile format with OSGB36/British National Grid projection; consider providing alternative projections or interoperability mappings if needed.
  - Maintain linkage to the LC1998 and LC1998_COD columns for reproducibility.
- Data quality and timeliness:
  - Dataset reflects 1998 classifications; assess timeliness and consider crosswalks if integrating with newer land cover datasets.
  - Review supporting methodology documents to understand classification rules and potential limitations.
- Updates and governance:
  - If newer classifications exist, document versioning and provide guidance for translating analyses across versions.
  - Ensure license terms are respected and that provenance is preserved in any redistributions.
- Usage considerations for researchers and planners:
  - Suitable for historical landscape analyses, ecological modeling, and regional planning where 1 km resolution classifications are appropriate.
  - Use the provided Land Class codes (LC1998) and descriptive mappings to interpret results accurately.
