# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

## Overview
- A GB-wide land classification dataset produced for the Countryside Survey, restricting to 40 Land Classes defined by environmental characteristics (climate, altitude, slope).
- Source: Countryside Survey data © NERC - Centre for Ecology & Hydrology; Classifications and supporting documentation referenced in accompanying literature.

## Data Format and Structure
- Format: Shapefile.
- Extent: Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland).
- Spatial resolution: 1 km.
- Coordinate system: British National Grid (OSGB36); Projection: Transverse Mercator.
- Attribute columns:
  - LC1998: ITE Land Class Number (1998)
  - LC1998_COD: ITE Land Class Code (1998)
- The dataset comprises 40 land-class areas, each corresponding to distinct environmental strata.

## Land Class Descriptions
- The 40 Land Classes cover a range of landform and terrain types, such as:
  - Flood plains/shallow valleys (e.g., 1e)
  - Low calcareous hills/variable lowlands (e.g., 25e)
  - Flat/gently undulating plains, various regions (e.g., England/Wales classifications)
  - Coastal, estuarine, upland, and mountain-related classes
- Scotland-specific mappings are included, detailing how GB classes correspond to Scotland’s landscape (e.g., 25–40 range with Scotland-specific notes).

## Spatial Details and Metadata
- Extent: Great Britain, suitable for national-scale to regional analyses.
- Coverage designed to support stratified ecological and environmental assessments.
- The document lists extensive supporting literature and documentation related to sampling strategy and land classification methodology.

## Implications for Data Leaders (Data Strategy and Use)
- Data asset utility:
  - Provides a standardized GB-wide land-class framework useful for policy analysis, ecological planning, and landscape-level reporting.
  - Facilitates co-ownership and shared understanding of land-class-based products across teams and partners.
- Data quality and discoverability:
  - Clear schema (LC1998 and LC1998_COD) and 1 km resolution support reproducibility and integration with other GB environmental datasets.
  - Rich provenance through multiple supporting documents enhances credibility and traceability.
- Gaps and considerations:
  - Dataset dates to 1998; consider currency and alignment with newer classifications or more recent remote-sensing products.
  - Documentation of metadata, data standards, and cross-sector coordination may be needed to ensure easy reuse by diverse user groups.
  - Cross-border consistency (England, Wales, Scotland) benefits from Scotland-specific mappings noted in the documentation.
