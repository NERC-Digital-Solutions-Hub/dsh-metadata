# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

- Purpose and context
  - Addresses the desire to understand landscape and distinguish natural units; situates within the history of landscape evaluation and the need for objective approaches.
  - Seeks to translate existing land classifications into visual landscapes to aid understanding, presentation, and assessment of future land-use changes.

- Data and classification framework
  - Builds on a land classification system developed by Bunce et al. (1981) that identifies 32 land classes for Great Britain.
  - Each land class is defined by primary and subsidiary trends across maps and field surveys, enabling description via measurable features (vegetation, soils, land use, etc.).
  - Uses field sampling to refine class characteristics and to estimate area and distribution of features (e.g., plant species, soils, land uses).

- Sources and methods for the visual presentation
  - Aims to convey landscape character visually, complementing quantitative descriptions (R&D Paper No. 86).
  - Visuals created as collage-style representations rather than single photographs to express typical features of a class.
  - Two main information sources for each class:
    - Three representative photographs.
    - Mean values and descriptions from Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86.
  - Process involves generating rough sketches, then refining to avoid over-emphasizing unique features; acknowledges difficulty in representing highly variable classes (e.g., wholly forested vs. wholly open).

- Key findings and considerations
  - The land classes provide an objective framework for describing British landscapes and for planning and monitoring changes in land use.
  - Some classes are challenging to represent accurately due to variability (and some may be inadequately represented).
  - The approach supports broader applications such as assessing potential productivity, informing more detailed surveys, and predicting landscape change.

- Applications and potential uses
  - Information for counties or geographic regions to describe current ecological and land-use characteristics.
  - Basis for more detailed surveys and for monitoring/predicting changes in land use.
  - Used in scenarios related to wood-energy plantation planning and other land-management evaluations.

- Context within the literature and methodology
  - Positioning within landscape evaluation work from Linton, Gilg, Liddle, Robinson et al., and Tandy; highlights a shift toward objective methods while recognizing reliance on expert judgement in many studies.
  - Emphasizes the integration of objective data with descriptive and visual presentation methods to improve communication and decision-making.

- Access, governance, and limitations
  - Copies of the land classes and related materials are available from the authors on request.
  - Acknowledges potential biases and limitations in data sources (maps, field surveys) and the ongoing need for standardization and coordination across sectors.

- Relationship to broader Merlewood outputs
  - Serves as a visual supplement to Merlewood Research and Development Paper No. 86, strengthening the descriptive framework for land classes.
  - Aligns with ongoing efforts to translate landscape classifications into practical, shareable visuals for policy and planning contexts.
