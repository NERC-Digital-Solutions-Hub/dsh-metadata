# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

## Overview
- File format: Shapefile
- Content: 40 areas (Land Classes) across Great Britain, stratified by environmental characteristics such as climate, altitude, and slope
- Resolution: 1 km
- Extent: Great Britain
- Geospatial reference: British National Grid (OSGB1936), Projection: Transverse Mercator

## Data Structure and Key Fields
- LC1998: ITE Land Class Number (1998)
- LC1998_COD: ITE Land Class Code (1998)
- The 40 Land Classes cover GB landscapes with region-specific labeling for England/Wales and Scotland

## Regional Classification (England/Wales and Scotland)
- England/Wales: Land Classes 1–25e, representing a range of landforms from flood plains and flat plains to coastal and upland valley types
- Scotland: Land Classes 25–40, including hard/mixed coasts, coastal plains, isolated hills, upland valleys, and high mountain features

## Practical Use for Data Support
- Enables creation of landscape-based data products (e.g., maps, dashboards) for broad policy, planning, and ecological analyses
- Facilitates self-serve analysis by allowing overlay with other datasets (land cover, climate, soils)
- Supports exploration and communication of landscape classifications across GB

## Documentation and References
- Supplementary readings and historical documentation related to Countryside Survey and land classification methodologies are provided for context and validation

## Considerations and Limitations
- Temporal scope: Represents 1998 land-classifications; may not reflect recent landscape changes
- Spatial resolution: 1 km; suitable for regional/national analyses, less ideal for high-resolution planning
- Format considerations: Shapefile-based; ensure GIS software compatibility and alignment of coordinate reference systems with other datasets
