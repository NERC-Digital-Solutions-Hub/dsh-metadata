# ITE LAND CLASSIFICATION: CLASSIFICATION OF ALL SQUARES IN GB

- Objective and scope
  - Classify every 1 km square in Great Britain into land classes.
  - Preserve the original ISA (Merlewood) classifications while enabling automated, scalable classification.
  - Use machine-readable data and comprehensive datasets covering all squares.
  - Maintain historical databases and the relative distribution of sample squares across classes.

- Data and datasets
  - Data requirements: any used feature could be drawn from existing datasets or recorded automatically.
  - Data types used (structured as data sources for classification)
    - COASTAL: coastal cliff, rock, sand, mud, shingle, tidal
    - ALTITUDE: height-related metrics, distance to hills/valleys, aspect, slope
    - MAPDATA: OS-derived layers (sea, woodland, villages, roads, canals, water, towns, railways, rivers, etc.)
    - DISTANCE: distance to south and west coasts
    - ISLAND: island status
    - CLIMATE: sunshine hours, snow days, mean January temp
    - GEOLOGY: detailed rock types
    - DRIFT: drift types (e.g., alluvium, moraines, sands, gravels, etc.)
  - Spatial and data scale
    - Initial approach aimed at reproducing the original ISA at 1 km square scale.
    - Data collection and processing considered over 15 months with various datasets and refinements.
  - Sample and attributes
    - Original ISA based on 1212 squares with 282 attributes.
    - Expanded with an additional 4800 squares identified by 76 key attributes.
    - 1 km squares used as the primary unit of analysis across GB.

- Methods tested and evaluated
  - Overview of approaches
    - Original ISA-based classification (baseline)
    - Discriminant Function analysis
    - Logistic Regression (with discriminant-style integration)
    - Other multivariate techniques (e.g., SIM ordination-based simulations)
  - Evaluation criteria used
    - Geographical distribution and dispersion of land classes
    - Allocation consistency for original 1212 squares
    - Proportional representation of classes across GB
    - Relationship to the principal environmental gradient and variability
    - Proportion of field-sampled squares over time
    - Relationship to vegetation composition and environmental/ecological data
  - Key findings from method comparisons
    - Discriminant Function alone:
      - Failed to identify coastal classes 7 and 8 in southern Britain, implying redefinition of coastal classes or regional misallocations.
      - Midlands/North–South distributions shifted, with some regions extending into areas outside original ranges.
      - Showed better alignment with vegetation gradients in some respects but problematic coastal classifications.
    - Logistic Regression (LR) and LR combined with Discriminant (Logistic/Discriminant, LR-DF):
      - Higher correspondence with the original 1212-squares classification than some alternatives, though not uniformly superior across all measures.
      - Produced tighter, more coherent clusters in many classes but diverged for a few coastal/non-coastal classes.
      - Balanced sampling (closer to proportional to stratum size) and lower standard errors in many comparisons.
      - Better overall dispersion properties and improved predictability for land cover estimation in 1978 data.
  - Environmental gradient and vegetation correlation
    - Gradient analysis showed a south/east lowland to north/west upland axis as a robust environmental gradient for evaluating classifications.
    - Correlations with vegetation gradients (based on limited quadrats) were:
      - Original classification: 0.827
      - Discriminant Function: 0.845
      - Logistic Regression: 0.813
    - Indicates Discriminant Function aligned slightly better with vegetation gradient in this specific comparison, but LR-DF offered other practical advantages.

- Results and conclusions
  - Primary conclusion
    - The Logistic/Discriminant approach is recommended as the preferred method for GB land classification.
  - Reasons for recommending LR/DF
    - Discriminant Function alone failed to identify certain coastal classes, risking redefinition of coastal classes and regional misclassifications.
    - LR/DF provides a balance closer to proportional sampling across strata and GB-wide class distributions.
    - LR/DF (and LR-DF) generally showed lower standard errors and reduced dispersion compared with the original ISA, aiding policy development and large-scale applications.
    - When compared to simulations based on indicator attributes for broader square coverage, LR/DF showed substantial improvements over the patterns produced by those alternative expansions.
  - Additional supporting observations
    - The LR and LR-DF approaches improved sample representation and yielded more stable dispersion patterns than the original, while preserving much of the original classification structure.
    - A number of outputs and datasets (e.g., various map versions and training schemes) are available for further analysis and validation.

- Outputs, maps, and data accessibility
  - Distribution maps for GB derived from the LR/DF method are produced and analyzed.
  - Additional outputs available on request from ITE Merlewood include:
    - Original 32-class ISA derived from 1212 squares with 282 attributes
    - Original 1212 squares plus 4800 squares identified via 76 attributes
    - Fully trained LR classification for all squares based on the original 1212 squares
  - Tables and figures include environmental means, standard errors, cross-tabulations, and correlations with vegetation and land cover indicators.

- Practical implications and recommendations
  - Adopt the Logistic/Discriminant approach for national-scale land classification in GB due to better balance, lower error terms, and more reliable dispersion characteristics.
  - Maintain and leverage the existing ISA-derived data and the expanded 4800-square set to enhance model robustness.
  - Continue to validate classifications against environmental gradients and vegetation data to ensure ecological coherence.
  - Provide accessible datasets and metadata to facilitate discoverability and reuse, with emphasis on documenting data sources, scales, and methods used.
