# A PRELIMINARY VISUAL PRESENTATION OF LAND CLASSES IN BRITAIN

## Aim and context
- Develop an objective framework for describing British landscapes by classifying land into relatively homogeneous units (land classes) and presenting them visually.
- Build on prior land classification work to supplement quantitative descriptions with visual representations of landscape character.
- Provide a basis for more detailed surveys, assessment of productivity, monitoring, and prediction of land-use changes; support work on land availability for purposes such as wood-energy plantations.

## Data and land classes
- Britain-wide land classification identifies 32 land classes with known area and distribution.
- Data sources include map analysis and field surveys to define primary and subsidiary trends across climate, geology, physiography, landform, soils, vegetation, and land use.
- Field sampling of each class yields detailed characteristics (vegetation types, soils, land uses) to enrich classifications.

## Methods
- Landscape is continuous; boundaries between types are not crisp. Land class definitions are built from trends rather than hard borders.
- Objective data and criteria are used to describe landscape components; this framework can describe landscape types and their typical features.
- Prior works and methodologies are reviewed (e.g., Linton, Tandy, Coventry-Solihull-Warwickshire studies; Robinson et al. landscape evaluation project) to situate the approach within broader landscape-evaluation techniques.

## Visual presentation method
- Aims to translate descriptions into visual form (landscapes) beyond photographs, avoiding overemphasis on unique local features.
- Visual representation for each land class is created as a collage of typical features, conveying an impression of the class’s composition.
- Two main inputs for each class:
  - Three representative photographs.
  - Mean values and descriptions from Merlewood Research and Development Paper No. 86.
- Process:
  - Develop rough sketches first and iteratively adjust to prevent feature bias.
  - Acknowledge difficulties with highly variable classes (some may be wholly forested or wholly open).

## Outputs and applications
- Provides an objective framework for describing British landscapes, complementing quantitative descriptions.
- Useful for informing more detailed county or regional surveys, assessing potential productivity, and monitoring/predicting land-use changes.
- Visual interpretations accompany prior descriptive material (R&D Paper No. 86) to convey landscape character.
- Land-class visuals have been used in scenarios of varying intensities of exploitation (e.g., wood-energy plantation studies); copies are available on request.

## Comparison with other approaches
- Discusses significant objective approaches to landscape evaluation previously used in the UK (and their limitations).
- Highlights the balance between judgement-based (e.g., consensus or descriptive maps) and objective statistical methods, noting that objective methods have been less widely adopted in practice.

## Challenges and limitations
- Distinguishing between “what is there” and “what is liked” remains a key dilemma between objective data and subjective response.
- Some land classes are highly variable, making representative visualisation difficult; some can be wholly forested or wholly open.
- Translating complex, multi-dimensional landscape data into a single, representative visual form risks under-representation of certain features.

## Data availability and references
- The land classes’ area and distribution are established; outputs include visual representations and descriptive statistics.
- Preliminary descriptions of land classes in Britain were provided in Merlewood R&D Paper No. 86; this Visual Presentation supplements those quantitative descriptions.
- The approach has informed and been informed by broader landscape-evaluation literature and government study programs; references to multiple related works and studies are listed in the document.
