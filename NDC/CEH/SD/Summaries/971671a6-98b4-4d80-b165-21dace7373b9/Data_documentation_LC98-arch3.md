# ITE Land Classification of Great Britain (1998)

## Overview
- A GIS shapefile dataset containing 40 Land Classes across Great Britain, designed to stratify environmental characteristics (e.g., climate, altitude, slope) for countryside surveying and monitoring.
- Part of Countryside Survey data produced by NERC – Centre for Ecology & Hydrology (CEH).

## Data format and contents
- Format: Shapefile
- Structure: 40 land classes covering Great Britain; each unit is a Land Class
- Columns: LC1998 (ITE Land Class Number, 1998), LC1998_COD (ITE Land Class Code, 1998)
- Resolution: 1 km
- Coordinate system / projection: British National Grid (OSGB36), Transverse Mercator
- Extent: Great Britain
- Country-specific mappings: England/Wales and Scotland are represented with class descriptions and codings corresponding to regional landform/habitat types
- Land Class descriptions: 40 categories describing a range of landforms from coastal to upland and valley systems (e.g., flood plains, plains and hills, sea cliffs, estuarine/coastal types, upland valleys, mountain tops)

## Geographic scope and resolution
- Extent: Great Britain (England, Wales, Scotland)
- Classified at 1 km resolution, enabling integration with other GB-scale spatial data for monitoring and reporting

## Classification system and usage context
- Land Classes are based on environmental characteristics (climate, altitude, slope) to delineate distinct landscape types
- Used to support countryside surveys and related sampling strategies
- England/Wales and Scotland have country-specific class mappings and descriptive labels
- Core literature and supporting documentation associated with the dataset include:
  - Barr, C.J. (1998) Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey
  - Wood, C.M. (2011) The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)
  - Bunce, R.G.H. and colleagues (1991, 1996a, 1996b) foundational land classification work
  - Howard, D.C., Barr, C.J. & Scott, W.A. (1998) Validity of CS data for Scotland
  - Clarke, R.T., Howard, D.C. & Scott, W.A. (2006) Countryside Survey: Sampling for Wales-only Reporting
- Related to ongoing methodological developments and validation of Countryside Survey sampling approaches

## Provenance and governance
- Data originates from Countryside Survey (ITE/CEH) and is presented with references to supporting and methodological documentation
- Document version: 1 (7-9-2012); originally developed for 1998 land classification schema

## Practical considerations for monitoring frameworks
- Provides a stable, 1 km-resolution land-form classification suitable for stratifying environmental health monitoring programs and for baselining change over time
- Facilitates integration with other datasets (e.g., habitat, biodiversity, land-use) for evaluating policy impacts and informing future decisions
- Rich supporting literature offers validation context, sampling strategy guidance, and methodological foundations for applying the classification in GB-wide monitoring

## Limitations and considerations
- The primary classification dates from 1998; users should assess temporal relevance and consider updating or complementing with newer land-cover data when monitoring recent trends
- Metadata availability and data provenance are essential for robust reuse; the dataset is accompanied by substantial supporting documentation and methodological references
- Some users may need to transform or reconcile the classification with other classification schemes or coordinate systems
