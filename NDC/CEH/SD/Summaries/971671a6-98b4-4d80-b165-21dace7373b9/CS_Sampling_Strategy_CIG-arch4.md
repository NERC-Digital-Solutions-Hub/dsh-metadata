# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Overview
  - Describes the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) 2007, the culmination of 30 years of development of the ITE Land Classification.
  - Explains how the sampling framework has evolved to provide representative national estimates and country-specific estimates (England, Wales, Scotland) of habitat features.
  - Emphasizes the linkage between the Land Classification, sample design, and time-series change detection.

- The ITE Land Classification: origins and evolution
  - Stratified, objective classification system developed to partition Great Britain into land types with distinct ecological characteristics.
  - Early work (1970s) used environmental attributes to classify 1 km squares, enabling stratified sampling across GB.
  - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) was used to group quadrats into vegetation types; methodology scaled to 1 km squares for national sampling.
  - The classification evolved from 32 initial classes (1978) to broader or more detailed schemes across subsequent surveys, balancing computational feasibility with representation.

- Sampling framework and survey history
  - 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
    - ISA-based 32 land classes derived from 1228 central 1 km squares (plus surrounding squares) for a total of 6,039 classified squares.
    - Field survey: 8 squares per land class (256 total) surveying vegetation quadrats and soils; habitat areas estimated per class.
  - 1984 – Second GB Land Use Survey
    - Used the 1978 classification; sample size increased by 50% to 12 squares per class (384 total).
    - Focus shifted to land use and habitat mapping; 1984 results published later.
  - 1990 – Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and All Squares Land Classification
    - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all GB 1 km squares; urban/sea corrections added.
    - Field survey: 508 squares; repeat of 1978 vegetation quadrats plus new data; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) and new Land Classification
    - Recognized need for regional estimates and better country-specific reporting; classification extended to ensure all GB squares could be classified at an appropriate level.
    - Separate country estimates introduced: England with Wales, Scotland; 40 strata created by subdividing classes and aggregating rump classes where necessary.
    - Additional samples (including upland habitats) added to improve country- and upland-specific precision.
  - 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) adjustments for Wales and broader reporting
    - Wales required Wales-only reporting; Welsh class sub-divisions added, creating five new country-unit classes and 45 strata.
    - Additional Welsh squares (43) added to ensure adequate representation; English classes adjusted accordingly.
    - Revised Land Class maps for England with Wales and Scotland produced; Wales obtained more substantial sampling than England to support Wales-only estimates.
    - Survey results tabulated to reflect country-unit sampling, with detailed class-level and country-level sample counts.

- Data outputs and estimation approach
  - National estimates are calculated as the mean area of habitat per square within a land class multiplied by the land class area, aggregated across all classes.
  - Country-unit estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) use the country-specific subset of squares and subdivided classes to produce comparable regional statistics.
  - Tables and figures (e.g., CS sample counts by class and survey year; maps of land classifications) illustrate the distribution and changes over time.
  - The development notes caution on consistency: changing the basic classification used for national estimates affects cross-survey comparability; the 1990 classification serves as a stable basis for comparing across surveys, while the latest classification yields internally consistent estimates for a given survey.

- Key methodological concepts and data governance
  - Stratified random sampling to ensure representative coverage across ecological variation; strata defined by the ITE Land Classes.
  - 1 km square sampling unit, with surrounding squares classified to reflect local context.
  - Progressive refinement of classification to support regional and country-specific analyses, while preserving the time-series integrity of CS data.
  - Documentation and transparency around classification changes, sampling allocations, and the rationale for country-specific stratification to enable reproducibility and informed interpretation of trend estimates.

- Challenges, gaps, and lessons for data leaders
  - Ensuring representative coverage for Wales (and later England) to support country-specific reporting; balancing sampling intensity across countries.
  - Managing classification updates over time while preserving comparability of time-series data.
  - Addressing potential under-representation of certain land classes in particular countries and the need for additional sampling to improve precision.
  - Metadata, alignment of classifications across surveys, and clear guidance on which classification to use for national versus country-level reporting.
