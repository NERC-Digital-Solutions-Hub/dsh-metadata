# THE SAMPLING STRATEGY FOR COUNTRYSIDE SURVEY

- Purpose and core approach
  - Uses the ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework for GB field surveys.
  - Aims to ensure representative sampling across ecological land types and support national, regional, and country-specific estimates.
  - Combines stratified random sampling with a coherent historical time series linked to previous surveys.

- The importance of stratification
  - Avoids bias from purely random sampling by ensuring all parts of the population (land types) are sampled.
  - Strata reflect ecological variation (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) and are refined to capture regional differences in land use and vegetation.

- Development of the ITE Land Classification (historical context)
  - Originated from Quadrat-based vegetation classification (Indicator Species Analysis) in the Lake District, scaled up to land areas using environmental attributes.
  - Early GB classification was built around 1 km squares, enabling national ecological sampling with a manageable, stratified design.
  - Initial practical constraints (computing power) led to using center squares of larger grids and surrounding squares to form a robust classified framework.

- The CS 1978 framework
  - Sample unit: 1 km squares classified into 32 ITE land classes.
  - Sampling: eight samples per class selected at random from a classified grid, yielding 256 total squares.
  - National estimates were derived by multiplying the average habitat area per square by the land class area, then aggregating across classes.
  - Field survey focused on vegetation quadrats, soils, and habitat mapping.

- The CS 1984 framework
  - Expanded sampling to 12 squares per land class (384 total) to improve precision.
  - Continued use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.

- The CS 1990 framework (All Squares Land Classification)
  - Transition to a Land Classification that incorporated data from all GB squares (a conservative, broad revision).
  - Field survey totaled 508 squares, with the 1984 features repeated and urban/sea corrections applied.
  - Led to the Countryside Survey 1990 main report and associated outputs, including the first land-cover mapping linked to the classification.

- Developments to the Land Classification post-1990
  - Recognition that GB-wide estimates required a classification that could be applied to every square, not just the sampled ones.
  - A new classification approach tested multiple procedures; while some squares shifted class, most remained in neighboring classes with preserved class characteristics.
  - Resulted in distortion effects on class distribution, influencing subsequent sampling design and national estimates.

- Developments for Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs for regional (England, Scotland, Wales) estimates and upland habitat reliability.
  - Implemented separate country estimates by subdividing Land Classes into country-specific versions (England with Wales, Scotland) and aggregating rump classes within each country when necessary.
  - Expanded to 40 strata (later refined to 45) and added 19 extra squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes, plus 11 additional squares to balance England and Wales sampling.
  - Introduced a dedicated uplands module to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Wales-focused and Wales-only reporting adjustments (CS2007)
  - Wales required Wales-only results post-devolution, prompting further adjustments.
  - Created country-unit sub-divisions within Land Classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to better capture Wales-specific habitat status and change information.
  - Increased Welsh sampling to a minimum of 6 squares per new Welsh class; some English classes in 2007 retained lower sampling (e.g., 4 squares) due to precision considerations.
  - Resulting framework produced revised England-with-Wales and Scotland Land Class maps and updated sampling distributions.

- Summary of CS2007 sampling
  - Updates to class structure and country-specific sampling increased the granularity for Wales and maintained representative design across the three constituent countries.
  - Tables and figures in the document illustrate the distribution of squares across Land Classes and country units, and maps show the revised sampling framework.

- Output considerations and notes for national estimates
  - Changing the basic Land Classification used for national estimates affects comparability across survey years.
  - There is a trade-off between maintaining cross-survey consistency (1990 classification) and using the latest classification for country-specific estimates.
  - Detailed tables show how different classifications influence the number of squares and strata used in each survey iteration.

- Practical implications for analysts
  - The Sampling Strategy underpins how data were gathered, structured, and interpreted across multiple survey years.
  - It explains the rationale for stratification, sample size decisions, and country-specific reporting—critical for understanding trends, regional differences, and the comparability of estimates over time.
  - The strategy highlights data governance considerations, including how classifications drive estimates and the importance of metadata and documentation for reproducibility.
