# A brief description overview of the data being described

- Purpose and scope
  - Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England.
  - Timeframe: model development and data coverage across 2005–2014 (data described 2008–2014).
  - Outputs: hourly Aspergillus fumigatus concentrations at postcode-weighted centroids within 4 km of open composting facilities (217 sites).
  - Objective: estimate likely exposure near outdoor composting sites; designed for a small-area epidemiological context.

- Data custodians and collaboration
  - Collected and modelled by the Air Quality Management Resource Centre (University of the West of England) and the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (Imperial College London).

- Collation and model design
  - Aim: produce first population exposure estimates using a dispersion model for 217 facilities (2005–2014) with parameters automatically generated by the model once files are uploaded.
  - Modelling platform: ADMS 5; input parameters drive automated model setup.

- ADMS source parameters
  - Source height: 3 m; pollutant exit velocity: 2.95 m/s; pollutant temperature: 29°C.
  - Emissions treated as area sources for composting facilities.

- ADMS pollutant parameters
  - Proxy pollutant: PM2.5; bioaerosol concentrations represented by converting CFU/m³ to g/m³ (1 CFU/m³ = 1 g/m³).
  - Time-varying emission factors (TVEF) to reflect daily/seasonal variability.
  - Daily operational emissions: 9 × 10^6 g m⁻² s⁻¹ during 8:00–17:00, Monday–Friday.
  - Dormant emissions: 1.1 × 10^4 g m⁻² s⁻¹ for non-operational hours.
  - Seasonal variation: monthly adjustments using Defra compost tonnage data, offset by one month.

- ADMS meteorological inputs
  - Meteorological data from nine stations (proximity-assigned to each facility) using SCAIL-Agriculture approach due to lack of on-site data: Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam.
  - Data source: Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) MIDAS UK Hourly Weather Observation Data (SYNOP format).
  - Surface roughness: urban 1 m; rural 0.3 m.

- ADMS pollutant prediction area
  - Concentrations modelled at residential postcodes (average ~12 households per postcode) within 4 km of a facility.
  - Postcode coordinates from ONS; yearly checks 2005–2014 to account for possible coordinate changes; duplicates removed.
  - Geographic processing: ArcMap 10.2; crop to 4 km around the 217 facilities.

- ADMS model outputs
  - Outputs are short-term hourly concentrations; allows calculation of daily A. fumigatus concentrations (g/m³) at each included postcode.
  - Users generate results by uploading the model file and running the model.

- Details of data structure
  - Data files provided as .APL files, named by the nearest meteorological station.
  - Uploading these files into ADMS automatically populates input parameters for execution.
