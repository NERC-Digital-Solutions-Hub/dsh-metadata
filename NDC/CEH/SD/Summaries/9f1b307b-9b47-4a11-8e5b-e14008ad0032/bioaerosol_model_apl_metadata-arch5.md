# A brief description overview of the data being described

## Overview and purpose
- Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England (2008–2014).
- Models provide hourly Aspergillus fumigatus concentrations at postcode-weighted centroids within 4 km of open composting sites.
- Data generated to understand likely exposure near outdoor composting facilities; prepared to run in ADMS 5.

## Data scope and content
- Study covers 217 large-scale outdoor composting facilities (data period 2005–2014).
- Outputs are short-term hourly concentrations; aggregated to daily estimates at postcode level (average ~12 households per postcode).
- Data are organized as model input/output files and linked to meteorological data for each facility.

## Data structure and formats
- Data files are in .APL format, named by the nearest meteorological station.
- Model inputs and parameters are automatically populated when a model file is uploaded.
- Postcode coordinates are used (from ONS) and re-extracted yearly to reflect any changes in coordinates; duplicates removed; cropped to 4 km around facilities.
- Outputs provide hourly concentration estimates (g/m3) for each included postcode.

## Data provenance and collaborators
- Collected and designed by the Air Quality Management Resource Centre (University of the West of England) and The Small Area Health Statistics Unit (Imperial College London).
- Model parameters and references draw on prior studies and guidance (e.g., ADMS 5 user guide; SCAIL-Agriculture; related dispersion and bioaerosol literature).

## Modelling inputs and parameters
- Emission source parameters (ADMS):
  - Source height: 3 m; exit velocity: 2.95 m/s; temperature: 29°C; emissions as area sources.
- Pollutant modelling:
  - PM2.5 used as a proxy; CFU/m3 (bioaerosols) converted to g/m3 with 1 CFU/m3 = 1 g/m3.
  - Time-varying emission factors to reflect daily/seasonal variability.
    - Operational hours (Mon–Fri, roughly 08:00–17:00): 9×10^6 g m^-2 s^-1.
    - Dormant hours: 1.1×10^4 g m^-2 s^-1.
  - Seasonal variation linked to monthly composting tonnage (Defra data), offset by one month.
- Meteorological inputs:
  - Data from nine nearby stations (Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam).
  - Data sourced from MIDAS (CEDA) in SYNOP format; used to represent area weather where on-site data are unavailable.
  - Surface roughness: urban 1 m; rural 0.3 m.
- Spatial and temporal resolution:
  - Residential postcodes within 4 km of facilities; postcode centroids used as exposure points.
  - Temporal coverage: hourly data across 2005–2014 for model runs.

## Data availability, access, and prerequisites
- Model outputs require ADMS 5 to run (data users must have access to the software).
- Postcode-level exposure data are aligned with a small-area epidemiological study design.

## Data quality, transformation, and QA
- Data include quality assurance steps such as conversion of CFU/m3 to g/m3, alignment of emission factors with activity, and yearly coordinate updates to maintain accuracy.
- Duplicates removed and spatial clipping performed to ensure consistent 4 km facility proximity.
- Documentation and bibliographic references accompany the dataset for methodological transparency.

## Limitations and considerations for use
- Model-based exposure estimates carry uncertainties inherent to dispersion modelling and the chosen proxy (PM2.5 as a stand-in for bioaerosols).
- Representativeness depends on station proximity and the assumptions in ADMS parameterization.
- Results are provided at postcode level, which may limit fine-grained exposure interpretation for individuals.

## Governance, updates, and stewardship implications
- Collaborative data curation by UWE and Imperial College London; data are structured to support reuse in epidemiological analyses.
- Updates are feasible on an annual basis given postcodes and meteorological data re-extraction; model outputs are regenerated by running the ADMS workflow with the relevant templates.
- Clear data provenance, methodology, and references are provided to support reproducibility and governance.
- Accessibility hinges on availability of ADMS 5 and the associated model templates; documentation references ensure users can reproduce the workflow.
