# A brief description overview of the data being described

## Purpose and scope
- Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England.
- Time window: data cover 2008–2014 (and broader study context mentions 2005–2014 for population exposure estimates).
- Output: hourly Aspergillus fumigatus concentration estimates at postcode-weighted centroids within 4 km of open composting facilities (217 facilities).
- Objective: assess likely exposure near outdoor composting sites across England.
- Modelling platform: ADMS 5 (Atmospheric Dispersion Modelling System); templates require ADMS 5 to run.

## Modelling framework and inputs
- Emissions represented as area sources in ADMS.
- Source parameters (per facility):
  - Source height: 3 m
  - Exit velocity: 2.95 m/s
  - Temperature: 29 °C
- Pollutant parameter:
  - PM2.5 proxy used for modelling bioaerosols
  - CFU/m3 to g/m3 conversion applied (1 CFU/m3 = 1 g/m3)
- Emission factors (time-varying):
  - Operational hours (approx. 8:00–17:00, Mon–Fri): 9 × 10^6 g m^-2 s^-1
  - Dormant hours: 1.1 × 10^4 g m^-2 s^-1
  - Seasonal variation: monthly adjustments based on Defra composting tonnage (offset by one month)
- Data inputs automatically generated by model once files are uploaded.

## Meteorology and data sources
- Meteorological data from nine nearby stations (selected to represent facility area) using SCAIL-Agriculture approach:
  - Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam
- Daily meteorological data sourced from the Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) MIDAS, in SYNOP format.
- Surface roughness assigned by land use:
  - Urban: 1.0 m
  - Rural: 0.3 m
- Data handling follows SCAIL-Agriculture methodology for representative weather selection.

## Spatial coverage and timing
- Postcodes used are those within 4 km of the 217 composting facilities.
- Data structured to provide residential postcode-level exposure estimates (average roughly 12 households per postcode).
- Yearly data extraction to account for potential changes in postcode coordinates over time; duplicates removed.
- Outputs are produced hourly to enable daily exposure estimates.

## Data outputs and structure
- Outputs: short-term hourly concentrations (g m^-3) per postcode.
- File format: .APL files; each file named after the nearest meteorological station.
- Workflow: upload the relevant model file to ADMS and run to generate concentration estimates.

## Data management and organisations
- Collaboration between:
  - Air Quality Management Resource Centre, University of the West of England (UWE)
  - The Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Imperial College London
- References and bibliographic context provided to support model parameters and methodology.

## Limitations and considerations
- Conversion assumption: 1 CFU/m^3 is equated to 1 g/m^3 for modelling, which is a simplification.
- Emission factors are time- and season-variant approximations based on prior studies.
- Spatial resolution is postcode-centroid based rather than fine-grained household or address-level estimates.
