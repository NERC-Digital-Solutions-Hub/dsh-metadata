# A brief description overview of the data being described

- Purpose and scope
  - Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England (2008–2014).
  - Model outputs hourly concentrations for each available data point, at postcode-weighted centroids within 4 km of open composting sites (217 facilities).
  - Data generated to understand likely exposure near outdoor composting sites; prepared to run in ADMS 5.

- Collaboration and data producers
  - Collected and modelled by the Air Quality Management Resource Centre, University of the West of England, and The Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Imperial College London.

- Modelling approach and design
  - Aim: produce the first population exposure estimates near all operating large-scale outdoor composting facilities in England (217 facilities) for 2005–2014 using established A. fumigatus modelling parameters.
  - Model parameters are automatically generated by ADMS 5 upon file upload.

- ADMS input parameters
  - Source characteristics
    - Source height: 3 m
    - Emission exit velocity: 2.95 m/s
    - Emission temperature: 29°C
    - Emissions represented as area sources
  - Pollutant and measurement
    - PM2.5 used as a proxy for bioaerosols
    - Bioaerosol concentrations converted from CFU/m³ to g/m³ using 1 CFU/m³ = 1 g/m³
  - Time-varying emissions (TVEF)
    - Daily/directional variability: 9×10^6 g m⁻² s⁻¹ during operational periods (8:00–17:00, Mon–Fri)
    - Dormant hours: 11×10^3 g m⁻² s⁻¹
    - Seasonal variability: monthly factors based on Defra composting tonnage, offset by one month

- Meteorological inputs
  - Nine meteorological stations across England assigned to facilities using SCAIL-Agriculture approach
  - Stations: Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam
  - Data source: Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) MIDAS, SYNOP format
  - Surface roughness: urban 1 m; rural 0.3 m
  - Met data used to produce daily inputs for each facility

- Spatial and data coverage
  - Exposure area: postcodes within 4 km of the 217 composting facilities
  - Postcode data: centroid coordinates (X, Y) from ONS; about 12 households per postcode
  - Time handling: yearly data extractions to account for possible changes in postcode coordinates; duplicates removed
  - GIS processing: ArcMap 10.2 used to crop postcodes to the study area

- Outputs and data structure
  - ADMS outputs: short-term hourly bioaerosol concentrations; converted to daily A. fumigatus concentrations at each postcode (g/m³)
  - Access format: model files (.APL) named by nearest meteorological station; uploaded to ADMS to run
  - Spatial granularity: postcode-level exposure estimates, suitable for small-area epidemiological studies

- Data organization and use
  - Model files are organized and named by met station; inputs auto-populate when run
  - Outputs designed to enable evaluation of exposure near composting facilities and to support exploratory public health analyses
  - Emphasis on collaboration between data providers and researchers to inform exposure assessment
