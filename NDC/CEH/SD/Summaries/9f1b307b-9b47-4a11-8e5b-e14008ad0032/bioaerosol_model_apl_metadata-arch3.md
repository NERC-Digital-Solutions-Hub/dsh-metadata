# A brief description overview of the data being described

- Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England, 2008–2014.
- Model outputs: hourly Aspergillus fumigatus concentrations for every hour data are available, at postcode weighted centroid level, for postcodes within 4 km of open composting sites (217 facilities).
- Purpose: to understand likely exposure near outdoor composting facilities; to support population exposure estimates for a small-area epidemiological study.
- Modelling platform: ADMS 5; templates prepared to run within ADMS 5.
- Collaborating institutions: Air Quality Management Resource Centre (University of the West of England) and Small Area Health Statistics Unit (Imperial College London).

## Modelling framework and inputs

- Objective: produce population exposure estimates near all operating large-scale outdoor composting facilities in England (217 facilities) for 2005–2014 using existing A. fumigatus modelling parameters.
- ADMS source parameters:
  - Source height: 3 m; exit velocity: 2.95 m/s; temperature: 29°C.
  - Emissions from facilities modelled as area sources.
- ADMS pollutant parameters:
  - PM2.5 used as a proxy for bioaerosols.
  - Conversion: 1 CFU/m3 ≈ 1 g/m3 due to modelling limitations.
  - Time-varying emission factors (TVEF) to reflect daily/seasonal variability.
  - Daily emission rates: operational hours (9×10^6 g m^-2 s^-1, approx. 8 am–5 pm, Mon–Fri); dormant hours: 1.1×10^4 g m^-2 s^-1.
  - Seasonal variations: monthly recycling tonnage from Defra, offset by one month.
- ADMS meteorological inputs:
  - Minimum data: wind speed, wind direction, Julian day, time of day, cloud cover.
  - Data sources: nine meteorological stations chosen by proximity; SCAIL-Agriculture method used to select representative data due to absence of on-site stations.
  - Stations: Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam.
  - Meteorological data: from MIDAS (CEDA) in surface synoptic observations (SYNOP) format.
  - Surface roughness: urban 1 m; rural 0.3 m.
- Model configuration approach:
  - ADMS setup designed to produce concentrations at residential postcodes within 4 km of facilities; postcode-level exposure assessment intended for small-area epidemiology.
  - Postcodes identified from ONS coordinates; year-by-year extraction to maintain consistent X,Y coordinates.

## Data sources and proxies

- Meteorological data: Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) MIDAS, UK Hourly Weather Observation Data, SYNOP format.
- Meteorological representativeness: SCAIL-Agriculture methodology to select area-representative data in the absence of on-site stations.
- Emission/activity data: facility operation schedules used to define daily vs. dormant emission rates; Defra monthly recycling statistics for seasonal adjustments.
- Spatial basis: postcodes (average ~12 households per postcode) used as exposure units; X,Y coordinates extracted from ONS and aligned yearly.

## Data structure and outputs

- Output format: model results presented as short-term hourly sequential concentrations.
- Target variable: daily A. fumigatus concentration in g/m3 per postcode.
- Data files: .APL templates; file names correspond to the nearest meteorological station and must be uploaded to ADMS.
- Workflow: upload template files, parameter auto-population occurs, run ADMS to generate outputs.
- Geographic scope: postcodes within 4 km of the 217 included composting facilities; data cropped in GIS (ArcMap 10.2) to the 4 km buffer.

## Temporal and spatial scope

- Temporal coverage:
  - Modelling period: 2005–2014 for exposure estimates; hourly model outputs provided for 2008–2014.
- Spatial coverage:
  - 217 large-scale outdoor composting facilities across England.
  - Postcode-level exposure estimates for areas within 4 km of facilities.

## Governance, quality, and reproducibility considerations

- Standardization and reproducibility:
  - Parameters are automatically generated by the model once templates are uploaded, ensuring consistent configuration across facilities.
  - Use of established literature and prior validation studies to justify parameter choices (e.g., source height, temperature, emission factors).
  - Clear data structure and naming conventions (station-based .APL files) to support repeat runs and auditability.
- Data accessibility and transparency considerations:
  - Outputs are model-generated estimates (not direct measurements); transparency relies on documentation of methods, data sources, and assumptions.
  - Data governance implications include reliance on third-party meteorological data and the need to manage metadata and versioning across yearly extractions.

## Implications for monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates a model-based approach to deriving population exposure estimates where direct measurements are lacking or impractical.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Transparent documentation of model parameters, proxies, and data sources.
  - Access to representative meteorological data and the methods used to select them (SCAIL-Agriculture) to avoid data silos and ensure comparability.
  - Clear data structure, file naming, and run procedures to enable reproducibility and governance.
  - Regular updates and alignment with seasonal and daily activity patterns to preserve data relevance.
- Relevance to policy and decision-making:
  - Provides a replicable framework to estimate spatially-resolved exposure near emission sources for regulatory review, risk assessment, and public health planning.
  - Emphasizes the need to balance modeling assumptions (e.g., using PM2.5 as a bioaerosol proxy, CFU/m3 to g/m3 conversion) with data quality and metadata to support robust policy evaluation.

## Limitations and caveats

- Proxy and conversion assumptions:
  - Using PM2.5 as a proxy and converting CFU/m3 to g/m3 introduces uncertainties in exposure estimates.
- Data representativeness:
  - Reliance on nine meteorological stations and SCAIL-Agriculture selection may not perfectly capture local microclimates for all facilities.
- Temporal alignment:
  - Seasonal extensions and one-month offsets may affect alignment between waste processing activity and meteorological conditions.
- Accessibility and sharing:
  - Model outputs are tied to ADMS 5 and specific templates; broader sharing of underlying inputs and metadata may be constrained by software, licensing, or data governance policies.
