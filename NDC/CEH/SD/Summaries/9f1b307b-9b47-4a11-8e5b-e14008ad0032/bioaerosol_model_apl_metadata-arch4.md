# A brief description overview of the data being described

## Overview
- Import templates for dispersion modelling of Aspergillus fumigatus from outdoor composting sites across England.
- Timeframe: 2008–2014 (data prepared to cover 2005–2014 in aims).
- Outputs: hourly bioaerosol concentrations ( Aspergillus fumigatus ) at postcode-weighted centroids within 4 km of open composting sites.
- Tool: ADMS 5; templates created to run with ADMS 5.
- Project collaborators: Air Quality Management Resource Centre, University of the West of England; Small Area Health Statistics Unit, Imperial College London.

## Aim and scope
- First population exposure estimates near all operating large-scale outdoor composting facilities in England (217 facilities).
- Focus: exposure assessment using dispersion modelling to inform potential health impact over 2005–2014 (study period; templates reference 2008–2014 data availability).
- Outputs designed for a small-area epidemiological study at postcode level.

## Modelling approach and parameters

- ADMS source parameters
  - Source height: 3 m; exit velocity: 2.95 m/s; temperature: 29°C.
  - Emissions from facilities treated as area sources.

- ADMS pollutant parameters
  - Proxy pollutant: PM2.5 chosen for modelling bioaerosols.
  - Bioaerosol concentrations converted to g/m³ (1 CFU/m³ ≈ 1 g/m³) for compatibility with ADMS.
  - Time-varying emission factors (TVEF) capture daily/seasonal variability.
  - Daily emissions: 9×10^6 g/m²/s for operational hours (assumed 8:00–17:00, Mon–Fri).
  - Dormant hours: 11×10^3 g/m²/s for other times.
  - Monthly seasonal variation derived from Defra recycling statistics, offset by one month.

- ADMS meteorological inputs
  - Nine meteorological stations used to represent area weather (no on-site stations).
  - Stations: Boulmer, Church Fenton, Coleshill, Crosby, Heathrow, Isle of Portland, Lyneham, Marham, Spadeadam.
  - Data source: Centre for Environmental Data Archival (CEDA) MIDAS; SYNOP format.
  - Surface roughness: urban 1 m; rural 0.3 m (based on land use in ADMS).

- ADMS pollutant prediction area
  - Residential postcodes within 4 km of any of the 217 facilities.
  - Postcodes approximate exposure with average ~12 households per postcode.
  - Postcode centroids obtained from ONS; yearly data extraction (2005–2014) to account for changes in coordinates.
  - Spatial handling: ArcMap 10.2 to crop postcodes to the 4 km buffer around facilities.

- ADMS model outputs and data structure
  - Outputs: hourly short-term bioaerosol concentration estimates (g/m³) per postcode.
  - File format: .APL input/output files; file names correspond to the nearest meteorological station.
  - Procedure: upload model files into ADMS, which auto-populates inputs, then run to generate results.

## Data inputs and governance

- Data sources
  - Meteorological data: nine stations from CEDA MIDAS (SYNOP format).
  - Emission and activity parameters: based on dispersion modelling literature and prior studies (e.g., Douglas et al., Taha et al., Defra tonnage data).
- Data management
  - Data organized by met station; yearly catchment ensures consistency over time.
  - Metadata include station associations, postcodes within 4 km, and the ADMS configuration used for each run.

## Considerations for data use

- Applicability
  - Designed for a small-area epidemiological study focusing on postcode-level exposure.
- Limitations and uncertainties
  - Conversion of CFU/m³ to g/m³ is a simplification; modelling relies on proxy PM2.5 surrogate.
  - Use of nine meteorological stations introduces potential representativeness issues for individual facilities.
  - Emission factors and seasonal scaling inherit uncertainties from the underlying literature and Defra statistics.
- Access and reproducibility
  - Requires ADMS 5 to run; data provided as import templates (.APL files) named by met station.
  - Outputs are generated by executing the templates; designed for replication and validation across facilities and time periods.
