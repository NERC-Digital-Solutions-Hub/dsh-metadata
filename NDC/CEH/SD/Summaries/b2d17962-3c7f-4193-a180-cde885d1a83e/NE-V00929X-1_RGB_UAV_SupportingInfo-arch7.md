- Data type and resolution:
  - Ortho mosaics: 8-bit unsigned integers (0–255), ~3 cm pixel size.
  - DEMs: meters above sea level, ~10 cm pixel size.
- Coordinate Reference System (CRS): WGS 84 / UTM zone 32N (meters).
- Data provision and access: mosaicked images provided by NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility; underlying data requests should be directed to fsf@nerc.ac.uk.
- Notes on data quality: QA performed by NERC FSF prior to mosaic creation.

## Quality Control
- QA conducted by NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility before creation of the mosaicked images.
