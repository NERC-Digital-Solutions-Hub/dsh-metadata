# IM Protocol

## Overview
- Purpose: Collect and identify daily macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap, leveraging the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) methodology.
- Rationale: Lepidoptera are effective indicators of environmental change; the protocol builds on a long-running national database (25+ years) to analyse population trends.
- Context: Grounded in RIS background and related literature to support long-term ecological monitoring and data-driven insights.

## Equipment and Location
- Equipment: Standard RIS light trap (Williams 1948) requiring continuous mains power; a 200-watt clear tungsten lamp; automatic clock/timers; Residual Current Device (RCD) for safety.
- Location: Near the trap’s operational base (preferably near the TSS) with access from laboratories, homes, or farms; sheltered by vegetation; ideally >20 m from artificial light sources.

## Sampling and Data Management
- Sampling cadence: Ideally daily throughout the year; if not possible, samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends).
- Submission and storage: Samples sent to Rothamsted for identification; data stored in the RIS database and the ECN database.
- Site coverage: Larger sites may use more than one trap if operators are available.
- Data standards: Detailed data transfer and dataset formats are defined in ECN data documentation; four key identifiers required for each sample.

## Procedure (Daily Operations)
- General routine (summary):
  1. Verify RCD is on; troubleshoot and replace fuse if necessary.
  2. Ensure clock is correct for GMT; do not adjust for local time changes.
  3. Confirm lamp functioning; replace bulb if needed.
  4. Collect sample using a jar dosed with ~5 ml tetrachloroethane; cap securely.
  5. In a ventilated area, transfer sample to tissue-lined boxes; re-dose jar for next day.
  6. Label boxes with site name and the correct date range; note if sampling spans multiple nights.
- Daily time investment: Approximately five minutes per trap for sample collection.

## Safety and Chemical Handling
- Tetrachloroethane: Used to rapidly immobilize insects; toxic by inhalation and skin/eye contact.
- Precautions: Work outside or in a well-ventilated area; wear safety equipment; handle spills by evaporation or absorption with proper PPE; avoid skin contact.
- Electricity safety: Always disconnect power before bulb replacement; consult an electrician for exposed circuitry; regular RCD testing.

## Data Recording Conventions
- Core data requirements: ECN Site data systems require:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC for a core measurement)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/Time (including time element when sampling is more frequent than daily)
- Core measurement: Invertebrates - moths (IM Protocol)
  - Fields include: Site ID, Core Code, Location, Date trap set, Sampling date; followed by species code, species name, and count (units as RIS code).
- Data formats and forms: Refer to RIS and ECN data transfer documentation; Heslop (1964) coding system used for species.
- Notes on data capture:
  - Record the Sampling Date as the date the catch is collected after overnight recording.
  - Report any nights when the trap did not operate (e.g., lamp failure) with the corresponding date.
  - Adhere to the Heslop 1964 numeric coding for consistency.
