# IM Protocol

- Purpose and rationale
  - Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard light trap.
  - Lepidoptera serve as a good indicator group for environmental change due to their ecology and long-standing study history.
  - Builds on the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) light trap network and extensive 25-year national database for trend analysis.

- Data collection and lifecycle
  - Data are gathered from the RIS light traps and stored in RIS and ECN databases.
  - Historical and ongoing data provide a basis for analyzing population trends over time.
  - The protocol supports long-term data continuity and comparability across sites.

- Equipment and site considerations
  - Standard RIS light trap: approx. 1.2 m tall stand, 200 W clear tungsten lamp, mains electricity, and automatic controls.
  - Safety and power requirements: continuous power; Residual Current Device (RCD) for safety.
  - Trap should be placed near the Test Site Site (TSS) or accessible sites (labs, houses, farms) with potential local support; sheltered by vegetation if possible; ideally >20 m from artificial lighting.

- Sampling and data flow
  - Sampling frequency: ideally daily, year-round; if not feasible, samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends) and posted to RIS for identification.
  - For large sites, more than one trap is recommended if capable operators are available.
  - Data handling: samples identifiable and deliverable to RIS; data lodged in RIS and ECN databases.
  - Time commitment: approximately 40 minutes per trap per week for emptying, plus travel time; identification time up to 15 days per site per year for highly experienced staff.

- Procedure and daily operation
  - Detailed daily tasks include: verifying RCD status, clock settings (GMT), lamp function checks, collecting and dosing samples with tetrachloroethane, properly labeling and dating samples, and preparing jars for subsequent nights.
  - Date coding: correct interpretation of sampling dates based on trap set and trap emptied dates; handling multi-night sampling with split boxes (e.g., 1/2 label).

- Safety and hazardous materials
  - Tetrachloroethane is used to rapidly kill and preserve specimens but is toxic; safety precautions include ventilation, eye protection, and proper handling.
  - Electricity safety: disconnect power before bulb changes; avoid exposed wiring; regular RCD testing.

- Data specification and recording conventions
  - Core data fields (essential for all ECN sampling records):
    - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
    - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC for invertebrates – moths)
    - Location Code (e.g., 01)
    - Sampling Date/time
  - Core content fields for each sample:
    - Species code, species name, number caught (RIS code)
  - Data standards and formats:
    - Follow Heslop (1964) coding system; data formats aligned with ECN dataset documentation (ECNCCU data transfer documentation).
  - Data handling notes:
    - If the trap did not operate on certain nights, those dates must be reported.
    - Data entries should reflect trap set versus trap emptied dates, especially for multi-night sampling.

- Appendix highlights
  - The RIS light trap description and daily operation procedures (Appendix I) provide the equipment specifics, sample handling steps, and date labeling conventions.
  - The protocol includes safety sections for tetrachloroethane use and electrical safety best practices.

- Relevance for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates long-term, standardized data collection supporting environmental monitoring and trend analysis.
  - Emphasizes data governance essentials: standardized data models, unique identifiers, consistent dating, and explicit metadata (site, location, core measurement, sampling date).
  - Highlights data discoverability and accessibility through centralized RIS and ECN databases, with clear data transfer documentation.
  - Underlines importance of data quality, consistency, and documentation to enable reuse across networks and over decades.
  - Points to considerations for coordinating data collection efforts across multiple sites and operators to maintain data comparability and reduce duplication.
