# IM Protocol

## Aim
- Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (large moths) using a standard Rothamsted Insect Survey light trap.
- Use the RIS methodology to provide a long-term, comparable dataset for analysing environmental change, leveraging an established national database.

## Rationale
- Lepidoptera are well-suited as environmental indicators due to their biology and documentation.
- The protocol builds on 25 years of RIS experience and underpins long-term trend analysis through a centralized data framework (RIS and ECN databases).

## Method

### Equipment
- Standard Rothamsted light trap (RIS), 200 W tungsten lamp, mains power, protected by RCD.
- Trap stand ~1.2 m high; overall trap ~1.5 m tall, ~0.6 m wide/deep.
- Collecting jar lined with plaster and dosed with ~5 ml tetrachloroethane for rapid immobilization.

### Location
- Near the TSS when possible; adjacent to laboratories, houses, or farms if needed for access to power.
- Shelter from vegetation; ideally >20 m from artificial light sources.

### Sampling
- Ideally daily year-round; if not, accumulate samples (e.g., weekends).
- Samples postal-delivered to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise exists.
- Data stored in RIS and ECN databases; consider multiple traps for large sites.

### Routine and timing
- Trap emptied ~40 minutes per trap per week, plus travel time.
- Identification by experienced staff; up to ~15 days/site/year for experienced identifiers.

## Appendix I: Light trap description and daily operation procedure
- Trap details, light source, and safety features (RCD, proper bulb type).
- Daily tasks: verify power, clock, lamp function, collect and reseal sample jars, re-dose with tetrachloroethane, label boxes with site/date, and report any non-operation days.
- Date handling: record the exact date range the trap covered; if multiple jars are used, indicate 1/2 on each box and note dates of non-operation.

## Safety

### Tetrachloroethane
- Used for rapid insect kill and sample preservation but is toxic; precautions include:
  - Avoid inhalation and skin/eye contact; work outside when possible; wear safety spectacles during handling.
  - Ventilate areas; manage spills by evaporation or absorbent material with PPE.
  - Remove contaminated clothing and wash skin if contact occurs.

### Electricity
- Disconnect power before changing bulbs; do not expose circuits; periodically test RCDs.

## Specification of results and recording conventions

### Core data and site metadata
- Data submitted to ECN Site with standardized fields; key initial parameters (4) required for each sample:
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time

### Core measurement: invertebrates - moths (IM Protocol)
- Data shape includes: Site ID, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Date trap set, Sampling date, then
  - Species code, Species name, Number caught (units = RIS code)
  - Optionally, genus/species, count, with recording precision

### Data formats and transfer
- Refer to the ECN dataset formats and accompanying Data Transfer documentation (restricted access Site Managers' extranet).
- For access, contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk.
- Coding follows Heslop (1964) systems used by the Rothamsted Insect Survey.

## Recording forms and notes

### Recording forms
- Use forms and conventions established by the Rothamsted Insect Survey and the Institute of Arable Crops Research (RIS/IICR).

### Notes
- The Sampling Date reflects the catch collected after overnight recording; report any non-operating nights.
- Follow Heslop (1964) coding for data entries.
