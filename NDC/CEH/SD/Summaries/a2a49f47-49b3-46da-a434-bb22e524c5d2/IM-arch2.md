# IM Protocol

## Purpose and Context
- MOTHS aims to collect and identify daily macrolepidoptera (butterflies and moths) using a standard Rothamsted light trap.
- Lepidoptera are used as an indicator group for environmental change; the protocol leverages the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) expertise and a 25-year national database to analyze population trends.
- Data are stored in RIS and ECN databases to support long-term monitoring and trend analysis.

## Sampling Methodology
- Sampling follows the Rothamsted Insect Survey light-trap methodology; daily empties preferred, but samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends) if needed.
- Specimens are posted to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
- For large sites, multiple traps are desirable if operators are available.
- Time commitments: trap emptying about 40 minutes per trap per week plus travel; identification up to 15 days per site per year for highly experienced identifiers.

## Equipment and Site Setup
- Equipment: standard RIS light trap (approx. 1.2 m stand; 200 W tungsten lamp; mains electricity; RCD). Lamp operates from dusk to dawn with an automatic timer adjusted for daylength.
- Collection method: insects are collected in a jar treated with approximately 5 ml tetrachloroethane to immobilize specimens for transfer to storage boxes.
- Site requirements: trap near the TSS when possible, near laboratories/homes/farms for access, sheltered by vegetation, and ideally more than 20 m from artificial light.

## Operational Procedure
- Daily routine (RIS staff): verify RCD, ensure clock/time is correct (GMT), confirm lamp works, collect sample using a tetrachloroethane-dosed jar, transfer insects to tissue-lined boxes, re-dose jar for next use, label boxes with site name and date.
- Date conventions: the date should reflect the period the trap was set to the period it was emptied; if samples span multiple nights, use the appropriate multi-night date range (e.g., 27/30 January 1995); if using two boxes, annotate 1/2 accordingly.
- Non-operation reporting: document any dates when the trap did not operate (e.g., lamp failure).

## Safety and Compliance
- Tetrachloroethane: effective for rapid killing and 24+ hour persistence but toxic; precautions include avoiding vapour inhalation, skin/eye contact, ventilation, PPE, and proper spill handling.
- Electricity safety: operate on mains power with power-off procedures before bulb changes; consult a electrician for exposed circuits; regular RCD testing per manufacturer guidance.

## Data Recording, Formats, and Storage
- Core data fields (must be included in all datasets):
  - Site Identification Code (e.g., T05)
  - Core Measurement Code (e.g., PC)
  - Location Code (e.g., 01)
  - Sampling Date/time (including time if sampling frequency exceeds daily)
- Core measurement: invertebrates – moths (IM Protocol).
- Sample data fields per entry:
  - Site Identification Code
  - Core Measurement Code
  - Location Code
  - Date trap set
  - Sampling date
  - Species code
  - Species name
  - Number caught (RIS code)
- Data handling: data submitted to ECNCCU with formats defined in ECN dataset documentation; Heslop (1964) numbering system used for coding; samples are stored in RIS and ECN databases.
- Access and documentation: data transfer documentation available on the restricted Site Managers' extranet; contact ecnccu@ceh.ac.uk for access.

## Appendix I: Light Trap Description and Daily Operation
- Trap specifications: RIS light trap with a 200 W clear tungsten lamp; mains power; automatic dusk-dawn timer; safety trip switch/RCD.
- Sample handling steps: details for removing and re-dosing tetrachloroethane, transferring specimens to pill boxes, labeling with dates, and reporting any non-operation dates.
- Date stamping guidance: precise examples to ensure correct representation of sampling intervals and multi-box samples.

## Notes and References
- Sampling date conventions clarify how to record dates when sampling spans multiple nights.
- Coding conventions follow Heslop (1964) used by the Rothamsted Insect Survey.
- Core references detailing the RIS background and the protocol's scientific basis are provided (e.g., Taylor 1986; Woiwod et al. multiple works).
