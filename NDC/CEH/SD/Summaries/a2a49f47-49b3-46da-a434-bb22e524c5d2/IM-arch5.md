# IM Protocol

- Purpose and context
  - Collect and identify daily collections of macrolepidoptera (butterflies and moths) using a standard light trap, following the Rothamsted Insect Survey (RIS) methodology.
  - Provides a long-running, expert-backed dataset to analyse environmental change and population trends (background references cited).

- Rationale for data management
  - Data are gathered with a well-established protocol to ensure consistency, enabling reliable long-term analyses.
  - Uses RIS and ECN databases for data storage; data are expandable with multiple traps at large sites; supports data sharing through standardized formats and documentation.

- Equipment and setup
  - Standard RIS light trap (200 W clear tungsten lamp) powered by mains electricity; safety via RCD.
  - Auto-adjusting clock/timer; trap height ~1.5 m; located near the TSS when possible, near laboratories, houses, or farms; sheltered by vegetation; ideally >20 m from artificial light.
  - Collection jar dosed with ~5 ml tetrachloroethane to immobilise insects.

- Sampling procedure and cadence
  - Traps ideally emptied daily; if not possible, samples can be accumulated (e.g., weekends).
  - Samples sent to Rothamsted for identification unless local expertise is available.
  - Data are stored in RIS and ECN databases; for large sites, more than one trap is recommended when operators are available.
  - Typical time commitment: emptying 40 minutes per trap per week plus travel; up to 15 days per site/year for experienced identifiers.

- Data recording, standards, and formats
  - Core dataset fields (first four) required to identify a sample: Site Identification Code, Core Measurement Code, Location Code, Sampling Date/Time.
  - Core measurement: invertebrates - moths (IM Protocol); data include: species code, species name, number caught (units coded via RIS).
  - Additional fields: trap set date; sampling date (the catch date after overnight recording); notes for nights when the trap was not operating.
  - Coding follows Heslop (1964) conventions used by RIS; data formats align with ECN dataset specifications and accompanying Data Transfer documentation (restricted access on ECN extranet).
  - Data provenance: captured data are stored in RIS and ECN databases; documentation and forms referenced from the Rothamsted/Insect Survey materials.

- Appendices and operational details
  - Appendix I describes the light trap hardware, daily operation, and safety checks (RCD status, clock correct time, lamp functionality, jar handling, labeling, and re-dosing with tetrachloroethane).
  - Step-by-step procedure for transferring samples from trap to storage boxes, maintaining proper dating (including how to date multi-night sampling).

- Safety and risk management
  - Tetrachloroethane hazards: toxic by inhalation, skin/eye contact; precautions include working in well-ventilated areas, wearing safety spectacles, and proper spill handling.
  - Electrical safety: ensure power is disconnected before servicing; RCD tested regularly; avoid exposed circuitry; use appropriate safety equipment.

- Data governance implications for data stewards
  - Ensure consistent application of RIS IM protocol across sites to maintain data interoperability.
  - Maintain metadata completeness: site, core measurement, location, trap set date, sampling date, species codes/names, counts, and unit conventions.
  - Track non-operational nights and sampling gaps; document data provenance and any deviations from protocol.
  - Manage data transfer and access: coordinate with ECNCCU for data formats, and preserve linkage to source documentation and appendices.

- References and background
  - Key literature and historical background on RIS light trap networks and moth ecology cited to support methodological context and long-term usage.
