# Groundwater temperatures and levels from a field experiment in the Conwy Valley, North Wales, UK (2013 - 2015)

## Overview
- Describes a field experiment collecting groundwater temperature and water level data, along with metadata, for Conwy Valley, UK (2013–2015).

## Experimental design and sampling regime
- Three transects, each 75 metres long and 20 metres apart, across a hillslope perpendicular to the River Hiraethlyn.
- On each transect, four boreholes drilled to bedrock; some locations include a second borehole (labeled 'new'); 'new' and 'old' boreholes do not differ.
- Borehole locations are documented in Plot_locations.csv.

## Collection methods
- A pressure transducer with an integrated data logger installed in each borehole; data periodically retrieved and read into a laptop.

## Fieldwork and instrumentation
- Boreholes drilled with a Cobra percussion hammer corer (Van Walt Ltd).
- Transducers used: Diver (Schlumberger Water Services) or Level Troll 500 (In-Situ).

## Calibration and data processing
- Barometric pressure corrections applied; transducer values converted to depths to water table using standard calibrations.

## Data and units
- Temperature: degrees Celsius; Water level: metres above Ordnance Datum Newlyn (ODN).
- Date and time in GMT.
- Groundwater_temperature_and_levels.csv contains temperature and water level data for boreholes.
- Empty cells indicate no data.

## Data structure and supporting metadata
- Plot_locations.csv contains borehole locations; Plot_locations_metadata.rtf provides metadata for borehole locations.
- Groundwater_temperature_and_levels.csv comprises 26 columns (dateTime plus Temp_X.Y and Water_level_X.Y for each borehole).

## Quality control
- Visual inspection of plotted time series used for quality assurance.
