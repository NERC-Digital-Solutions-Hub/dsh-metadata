# Details of data structure

- Purpose and scope: outlines the data structure for the vegetation survey conducted at Clocaenog, including how data series are organized and documented to support reuse and governance.

- Data series and scope: describes the vegetative data collection, likely covering sampling design, temporal coverage, spatial extent, and the relationship between datasets within the project.

- Data dictionary and variables: defines each variable, including names, definitions, data types, units, allowed values or codes, and missing value indicators to ensure consistent interpretation.

- Data schema and relationships: explains how data are structured (e.g., tables or records for plots, quadrats, species, and measurements) and how these elements relate (keys, joins, hierarchical relationships).

- Data provenance and processing: documents data sources, data transformation steps, cleaning procedures, and any processing workflows that convert raw data into analyzed datasets, including versioning.

- Metadata and documentation: specifies metadata standards and how documentation is stored, accessed, and cited to enable discoverability and proper use.

- Data quality and validation: outlines quality checks, validation rules, and mechanisms to assess completeness, accuracy, and consistency of the data.

- Access, sharing, and governance: covers data permissions, licensing, accessibility for collaborators, and governance roles responsible for stewardship and updates.

- Implications for data leadership: provides a framework to ensure data assets are discoverable, interoperable, and aligned with broader data strategy; supports user needs, monitoring of data gaps, and planning for future data collection and integration.

- Recommendations and next steps: suggests actions for aligning this data structure with broader data systems, maintaining metadata quality, and fostering coordination with partners and other datasets.
