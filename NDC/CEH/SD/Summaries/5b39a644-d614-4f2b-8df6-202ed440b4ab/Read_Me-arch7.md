# Clocaenog_supporting_documentation_Data series.rtf - Supporting documentation SD_Vegetation_survey_Clocaenog.rtf - Details of data structure

## Overview
- Two referenced documents: supporting documentation for the Clocaenog data series and a file detailing the data structure for the vegetation survey in Clocaenog.

## GIS relevance
- Provides metadata and data-structure information essential for organizing, validating, and mapping vegetation-related GIS datasets.
- Supports consistent data integration across datasets and end-user visualization.

## Likely contents (what to expect)
- Methodology and survey design for vegetation data.
- Data dictionaries and definitions of variables/attributes.
- Coordinate reference systems, spatial formats, and data schemas.
- Data quality notes and provenance (sources, revisions, timestamps).

## How to use for data products
- Refer to metadata for data preparation, cleaning, and transformation.
- Align datasets using the defined structure to enable accurate mapping and analysis.
- Inform end-user documentation and map design with standardized attribute definitions.

## Practical considerations
- Ensure data series are kept in sync with the structure guidelines.
- Use the data dictionary to interpret fields correctly in GIS workflows.
- Verify compatibility of formats and coordinate systems when merging with other layers.
