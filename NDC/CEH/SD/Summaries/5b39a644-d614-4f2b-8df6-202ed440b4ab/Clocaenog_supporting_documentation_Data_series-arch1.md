# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment in Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years.
- Established in 1998; site powered by solar and wind; upland moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with notable Vaccinium myrtillus and Empetrum nigrum.
- Experiment design: 9 plots total (4 m x 5 m): 3 warming, 3 drought, 3 control (shaded to mirror treatment structure). Each treatment replicated across three plots; arrangements organized in blocks.

## Beginning (site, habitat and treatments)

- Habitat and flora: typical wet upland heath; heather >60% of biomass; soil: humo-ferric podzol with variable eluvial (E) and illuvial (Bh) horizons.
- Treatments:
  - Drought (D): retractable polyethylene roof over plots; reduces rainfall by ~20% overall by excluding about 80% of rain during growing season. Timing: originally May–September (1999–2011); since 2012, April–October. Not operated in winds >10 m s-1.
  - Warming (W): retractable aluminum mesh curtains that reflect 96–97% of infrared radiation; reduces night heat loss by ~64%. Roofs retract after rain to preserve rainfall; operated to maintain warming during night with a 15-minute dark period trigger. Rainfall reduction ~14% annually. Not operated in winds >10 m s-1.
- Treatments details and timing are documented in Tables 1–2 (site characteristics; drought and warming timings across years).

## Middle (data scope, collection, and methods)

- Site information:
  - Location coordinates: Clocaenog Forest, 53°03′19″N, 03°27′55″W.
  - Soil: humo-ferric podzol; typical upland moorland profile.
  - Annual rainfall around 1411 mm; mean air temperature ~8.0°C; mean soil temperature in controls ~7.5°C.
  - Total N deposition ~20–25 kg N ha⁻¹ yr⁻¹.
- Climate treatments and plots:
  - 3 warming plots, 3 drought plots, 3 control plots (4 m x 5 m each).
  - Drought implemented May–Sept (later April–Oct) over specified years; warming operated nightly with rain-trigger retraction to retain rainfall data integrity.
- Equipment and data processing:
  - On-site Automated Weather Station (AWS) and plot-based micro-meteorological sensors.
  - Data collected across multiple domains (meteorology, soil, vegetation, greenhouse gas fluxes, and soil/biogeochemical variables).
  - Data quality control via visual inspection; initial AWS height changed from 1 m to 4 m due to theft.
  - Many data types stored in the CEH data portal; some legacy datasets may reside outside the EIDC; contact CEH Bangor for access details.

- Data types and datasets (summary of data collected and methods):
  - AWS meteorological data: daily, minute-averaged sensors (air temp, RH, rainfall, wind, solar and net radiation, PAR, pressure).
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily soil and air temperature, soil moisture (various methods over time; TDR sensors installed 2008 onward).
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: storage rain gauge (biweekly) for site rainfall; rain chemistry (pH, NO3–, Cl–, SO4²⁻, DOC, ammonium) via Dionex ion chromatography and TOC analyses.
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to compute plot-level rainfall reductions relative to site rainfall.
  - Water table depth: 2009 onward using permeable tubes; biweekly measurements.
  - Soil respiration: both Fortnightly and automated campaigns (1999–present); multiple systems (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100; calibration details provided); results in mg CO2-C m⁻² h⁻¹.
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): static chamber measurements; gas chromatography analyses; sampling at 0, 15, 30 minutes.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measurements in 2002–2004 and 2011 with different chamber systems; includes photosynthesis estimates adjusted for biomass.
  - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003) using leaf cuvettes and CIRAS-2.
  - Vegetation survey data (plant biomass) via pin-point method (1998–2012; also destructive calibration efforts in 1998–2000); conversion from pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibration factors.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI indices from ground-based spectrometer (2001–2004; 2000–2001, 2003–2004).
  - Vegetation phenology, annual growth and pathogens: shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, and pathogen observations (species: Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum).
  - Vegetation chemistry: carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates; based on green and litter samples.
  - Litterfall: monthly to biannual collections (1999–2002); conversion to g m⁻² and C/N analyses.
  - Root biomass: multiple methods across years (2003, 2004, 2008, 2011) including soil cores and WinRhizo analysis.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012) with DOC differences and correction factor to estimate microbial biomass carbon.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: paired cores with initial and final measurements; NH4+/NO3– analyzed; 1998–2004 sporadic measurements.
  - SOM/SOC and bulk density: soil core analyses; organic vs inorganic horizons; conversions to g m⁻².
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and suction samplers; biweekly sampling; analyses for pH, NO3–, Cl–, SO4²⁻, DOC, ammonium.

- Overall aim for analysts: use the diverse, multi-year, multi-variable dataset to analyze climate-change responses in upland moorland by comparing drought, warming, and control conditions, accounting for local site variability, data gaps, and units/measurement changes over time.
