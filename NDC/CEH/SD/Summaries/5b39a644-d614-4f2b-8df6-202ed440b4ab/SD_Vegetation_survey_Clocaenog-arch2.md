# Details of data structure for 'Vegetation survey_Clocaenog.csv'

## Overview
- Supplement to the supporting documentation for data series related to Clocaenog vegetation.
- Contains one spreadsheet with 22 columns representing plot-level plant biomass data per unit area, detailed by species over time.

## Data Structure

- Columns 1-12: Plot-level plant biomass data per unit area by species over time
  - Column 1: Year (1998–2012)
  - Column 2: Plant species
  - Column 3: Biomass type indicator (total biomass vs. only living biomass)
  - Columns 4-12: Biomass measurements for experimental plots 1–9

- Columns 13-22: Plot-level total plant biomass data per unit area over time
  - Column 13: Year (1998–2012)
  - Columns 14-22: Total biomass measurements for experimental plots 1–9

- Data completeness: Empty cells indicate missing data.

## Temporal and Spatial Coverage
- Timeframe: 1998–2012
- Spatial scope: Clocaenog area (vegetation survey context)

## Relevance for Environmental Analysis
- Enables tracking of species-specific and total biomass changes over time at multiple plots.
- Supports assessment of environmental health, habitat changes, and policy-relevant monitoring at plot and time scales.

## Data Quality and Access Considerations
- Data should be verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as part of standard monitoring workflows.
- Datasets are intended to be stored and made accessible through appropriate data portals and supporting documentation.
