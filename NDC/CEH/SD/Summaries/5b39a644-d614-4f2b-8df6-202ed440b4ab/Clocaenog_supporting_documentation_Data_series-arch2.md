# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

## Overview
- Automated climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, to simulate drought and warming conditions expected in the next 20–30 years.
- Upstream upland moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather); site established in 1998.
- Treatments use automated roof/curtain systems powered by solar and wind; aims to standardise monitoring of environmental health and policy-relevant outputs over time.

## Climate change treatments and experimental design
- Treatments and replication
  - Two treatments: drought (D) and warming (W), each with three replicates (plots 4 m x 5 m).
  - Three control plots mirroring shading from treatment structures (total n = 9 plots).
- Drought treatment
  - Operated May–Sept (1999–2011); since 2012 Apr–Oct.
  - Retractable polyethylene roof reduces rainfall by ~20% (underestimates during small events; excludes ~80% of rainfall during drought window).
- Warming treatment
  - Retractable aluminium mesh curtains cover plots to reduce nighttime heat loss; reflective to infrared radiation.
  - Curtains retract during rain to preserve rainfall; overall ~14% annual rainfall reduction.
  - Curtains inhibited by high winds (>10 m s^-1) to prevent damage.
- Design notes
  - Treatments are arranged in replicates with experimental scaffolding for shading controls.
  - Site characteristics include sub-alpine moorland soil and plant community structure detailed in the documentation.

  - Appendix includes detailed plot and quadrat layouts.

## Data collection and datasets (categories and examples)
- AWS meteorological data
  - Daily measurements (1999–present) from on-site automated weather station (AWS).
  - Variables: air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, air pressure, net radiation, solar radiation, PAR, wind speed/direction.
  - Instrumentation: 1–4 m mast after 2007; high-frequency (minute) data logged as hourly averages.
- Micro-meteorological plot data
  - Daily plot-level soil and air temperature; soil moisture measurements.
  - Depths: 5, 10, 20 cm for temperature; TDR-based soil moisture since 2008.
- Rainfall and rainfall chemistry
  - Storage rain gauge (site-level) with biweekly sampling; rainfall chemistry analyzed (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4).
- Throughfall data
  - Plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to derive percent change relative to site rainfall for each treatment.
- Water table depth
  - Biweekly measurements using permeable tubes down to bedrock (started 2009).
- Soil respiration
  - Fortnightly measurements (historic methods) and automated daily-weekly campaigns (2013–2014) using soil collars and IRGA/Li-COR systems.
  - Output: CO2 flux (mg CO2-C m^-2 h^-1) with cross-method conversions.
- Trace gas measurements (CH4 and N2O)
  - Static chamber method on the same collars as soil respiration; sample times 0.25, 15, 30 minutes; GC analysis.
- Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE)
  - Measurements in 2002–2004 and 2009–2011 with different chamber systems; adjustments for biomass variability in flux calculations.
- Photosynthesis
  - Sporadic measurements (2001–2003) using leaf cuvettes and CIRAS IRGA; standardization for leaf mass and light conditions.
- Vegetation biomass (Pin-point survey)
  - 1998–2012 surveys in three quadrats per plot; pin hits converted to biomass via calibration; biomass conversion factors per species.
- Canopy reflectance
  - Canopy NDVI and PRI from ground-based spectrometer (2000–2004); spectral bands 400–950 nm; measurements taken near solar noon.
- Vegetation phenology, growth and pathogens
  - Spring phenology and annual growth for C. vulgaris, V. myrtillus, E. nigrum; incidence of herbivory and fungal infection tracked.
- Vegetation chemistry
  - Elemental composition (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg) and structural components (lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates) in green and litter material.
- Litterfall
  - 1999–2002 monthly collection; later sampling less frequent; data converted to g litter m^-2 and subsampled for C/N analyses.
- Root biomass
  - 2003–2004, 2008, 2011 cores; methods include manual root extraction and WinRHIZO analysis.
- Soil microbial biomass
  - Chloroform fumigation method (2000, 2001, 2012).
- Nitrogen mineralisation
  - 1998–2004 core-based incubation with KCl extraction for NH4 and NO3.
- SOM, SOC and bulk density
  - Core analyses to determine soil organic matter, soil organic carbon, and bulk density; converted to g m^-2.
- Soil solution and leachate chemistry
  - Lysimeters and tension lysimeters (1998–2008) with pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC analyses.

## Data processing and quality
- Data quality control largely based on manual visual checks in Excel; historical and legacy methods documented.
- Some datasets are not stored in a single portal (EIDC) and may be incomplete or post-June 2015; multiple data streams may require contacting data custodians.
- Throughfall calculations involve data screening and, if necessary, infilling by year-average reductions.

## Data accessibility and custodians
- Not all data are stored within the EIDC; smaller or post-2015 datasets may be outside standard portals.
- For access details or clarifications, contact the CEH Bangor team: Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) or Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk).

## Key considerations for analysts
- Standardised monitoring outputs include pulsed climate manipulation data, plot-level and site-level rainfall, soil respiration, trace gas fluxes, NEE, vegetation biomass and chemistry, litterfall, root and microbial biomass, and soil solution chemistry.
- Data are suitable for cross-year trend analyses, treatment effect comparisons, and integration with other environmental datasets, with careful attention to methodological changes over time and data availability constraints.
- Given legacy data practices, cross-checks with data custodians are advisable for conversion factors, unit consistency, and any gaps or infillings in time series.
