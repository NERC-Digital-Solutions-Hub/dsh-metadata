# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- The Climoor site is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years. It was established in 1998 and targets an upland moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather) with a mix of shrubs, grasses, bryophytes, and lichens. The site is solar- and wind-powered and comprises replicated drought and warming treatments plus controls.

- Purpose and scope of the documentation
  - Provides metadata and methodological details for a wide range of abiotic and biotic datasets collected on site.
  - Documents data collection methods, sensors, sampling frequencies, data processing steps, and conversion factors used to derive standardized fluxes and biomass measures.
  - Notes that not all data are stored in a single central repository (EIDC) and provides contact points for access.

- Climate change treatments
  - Drought (D): Replicated on 3 plots; timing generally May–September (1999–2011) and April–October (since 2012); drought achieved with retractable polyethylene roofs that exclude rainfall (~20% annual reduction; ~80% reduction of rainfall during the growing season). Curtains are not operated in winds >10 m/s. Timing varies by year (Table 2).
  - Warming (W): Replicated on 3 plots; night-time warming using retractable aluminum mesh curtains that reduce infrared loss. Roof retraction occurs when rain is detected to avoid rainfall loss; average annual rainfall reduction ~14%. Curtain operation limited by wind conditions.
  - Experimental layout: 9 plots in total (three each for warming, drought, and control), arranged in blocks.

- Site and environmental context
  - Location: Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales (grid SJ019519; 53.055°N, -3.465°W).
  - Ecosystem: Wet upland heath with species including Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum,Deschampsia flexuosa and bryophytes; soils are humo-ferric podzols with variable eluvial and illuvial horizons.
  - Growing season and climate variables are influenced by the local maritime climate, with detailed site characteristics (Table 1) covering temperature, rainfall, soil properties, nutrient deposition, and biomass.

- Data and measurements (types, datasets, and cadence)
  - AWS meteorological data: daily, 1999–current, includes temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar radiation, net radiation, PAR, wind.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily, 1998–current, soil and air temperatures, soil moisture at multiple depths.
  - Rainfall and rainfall chemistry: site-level storage rain gauge (biweekly) and biweekly chemistry analyses (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4).
  - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall (biweekly); used to derive treatment-percent changes applied to site rainfall data.
  - Water table depth: measured biweekly from 2009 onward using permeable tubes.
  - Soil respiration: fortnightly measurements (1999 onward) with collars; methods evolved (CIRAS-2, LI-COR 8100, automated LI-8100 with chamber).
  - Trace gases (CH4 and N2O): measurements using static chambers with gas chromatography; multiple measurement periods (1999–2000, 2007–2009).
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE): measurements in 2002–2004 and 2011 with different chamber systems; includes adjustments for biomass variations in flux calculations.
  - Photosynthesis: infrequent measurements (2001–2003) using CIRAS-2 with standardized light conditions.
  - Vegetation biomass (Pin-point method): annual surveys (1998–2012, and later years); pin hits mapped to species and biomass using calibration factors.
  - Canopy reflectance: NDVI and PRI derived from ground-based spectrometry (2001–2002, 2003–2004).
  - Phenology, annual growth, and pathogens: measurements of shoot elongation, budburst, leaf counts, and signs of herbivory/pathogen infection (1999–2009, with various years for different species).
  - Vegetation chemistry: elemental analyses (C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg), lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates on green and litter material (1998–current).
  - Litterfall: collectors deployed; collected 1999–2002 monthly, later less frequent; data converted to g m-2 and analyzed for carbon and nitrogen.
  - Root biomass: cores and extraction across several years (2003, 2004, 2008–2013) with varying methodologies.
  - Soil microbial biomass: chloroform fumigation methods (2000–2001, 2012).
  - Nitrogen mineralisation: incubation cores with KCl extraction to derive NH4+ and NO3− rates (1998–2004).
  - SOM, SOC, and bulk density: derived from soil cores linked to N-mineralisation study; bulk density calculations and conversions to g m-2.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry: lysimeters and tension lysimeters; pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4 analyses (1998–2008).

- Data processing, standardization, and conversion notes
  - Flux conversions: raw data from different instruments converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1 or related units; specific conversion factors provided (e.g., 0.272727 multiplier for g CO2 m-2 h-1 to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1; complex gas-law based conversions for µmol m-2 s-1 to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1).
  - Biomass adjustments: NEE and photosynthesis adjusted for biomass differences inside flux chambers using above-ground biomass data from pin-point surveys and calibration factors.
  - Pin-hits to biomass: species-specific calibration factors (Table 6) used to convert pin hits to biomass (g m-2); moss, Calluna, Vaccinium, Empetrum, Deschampsia, and other taxa have species-specific slopes and R-squared values.
  - Vegetation surveys: pin-pin quadrat method with fixed quadrats and base pegs to ensure spatial consistency; data quality checks include ratio-based correction for missing pins (e.g., 300 pins expected; if fewer observed, data adjusted by ratio).
  - Throughfall adjustments: plot-level rainfall changes calculated as a percent difference from site rainfall and applied to site rainfall to estimate treatment-specific rainfall.
  - Legacy data and QA: some datasets flagged as legacy with occasional gaps; best-practice documentation may be incomplete or not fully aligned with current standards.
  - Data availability: not all data are stored within the European Distributed Infrastructure for CEH data centre (EIDC) past June 2015; contact CEH Bangor researchers for access.

- Data accessibility and contacts
  - Not all datasets are stored in a single repository; for more details and access, contact Sabine Reinsch (sabrei@ceh.ac.uk) or Bridget Emmett (bae@ceh.ac.uk) at CEH Bangor.
