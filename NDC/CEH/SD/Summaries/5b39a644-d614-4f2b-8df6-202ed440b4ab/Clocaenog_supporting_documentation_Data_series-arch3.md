# Climoor field site in Clocaenog forest Supporting documentation for data

- Climoor is a climate change manipulation experiment at Clocaenog Forest, North East Wales, using automated roof technology to simulate drought and warming over the next 20–30 years.
- The site comprises replicated drought and warming treatments plus controls, across 9 plots (3 per treatment) in an upland moorland ecosystem dominated by Calluna vulgaris (heather), with a diverse plant community and variable soil (humo-ferric podzol).
- Data collection spans 1997–2014 (and ongoing for some datasets), covering a wide range of abiotic and biotic measurements to support environmental monitoring and policy-relevant evaluation.

## Climate change treatments and site characteristics

- Treatments
  - Drought: retractable polyethylene roof over plots during growing seasons, reducing rainfall by ~20% (varying by year; some events missed by sensor limits). Operated May–Sept (1999–2011), then Apr–Oct since 2012. Curtains do not operate in winds >10 m s-1.
  - Warming: retractable aluminium mesh curtains reducing infrared loss at night; automated by light sensor and rainfall-triggered retraction to limit rainfall loss (average ~14% annual rainfall reduction). Curtains also restricted by winds.
- Experimental design
  - 9 plots in total: 3 warming (W), 3 drought (D), 3 controls (C); arranged in 3 blocks with replication across treatments.
- Site information
  - Location: Clocaenog Forest, Wales (53°03′19″N, 3°27′55″W).
  - Ecosystem: wet upland heath; dominant species includes Calluna vulgaris; typical growing season June–August; winter dormancy.
  - Climate baseline (1997–2014): mean air temp ~8.0°C; mean soil temp in control ~7.5°C; mean annual rainfall ~1411 mm; total N deposition ~20–25 kg N ha-1 yr-1.

## Data collection and types of datasets

- Data management and governance
  - An automated weather station (AWS) and plot-level sensors provide meteorological and microclimate data; numerous abiotic and biotic datasets collected across years.
  - Some data not stored in a central data repository (EIDC) and require direct contact with data managers for access or details.
  - Supporting documentation exists for each dataset; ongoing QA and data processing steps described; legacy data may have incomplete or non-standard documentation.
- Datasets and measurements
  - AWS meteorological data: daily measurements (1999–present) including temperature, humidity, rainfall, solar/radiation, net radiation, wind.
  - Micro-meteorological plot data: daily plot-level soil and air temperatures, soil moisture (1998–present; using various methods since 1998).
  - Rainfall data
    - Site-level storage rain gauge: biweekly measurements; rainfall chemistry samples stored and analyzed (pH, NO3, Cl, SO4, DOC, NH4+).
    - Throughfall data: plot-level rainfall collected biweekly; used to derive plot rainfall by applying percent differences relative to site rainfall.
  - Hydrology
    - Water table depth: measured biweekly from 2009 onward using permeable tubes.
  - Soil respiration and trace gases
    - Fortnightly soil respiration (1999–present) using soil collars; transitioned across measurement devices (CIRAS-2, LICOR 8100, automated LI-COR system); fluxes converted to mg CO2-C m-2 h-1.
    - Trace gases CH4 and N2O: measured with static chambers; sampling at 0.25, 15, 30 minutes; analyzed by GC; calibration with standards.
  - Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE)
    - Measured in selected years (2002–2004, 2011) with Perspex chambers and different analyzers; adjustments for biomass using above-ground biomass measurements.
  - Photosynthesis
    - Infrequent measurements (2001–2003; 2001 for E. nigrum) using leaf cuvettes and CIRAS-2; included leaf mass for area normalization.
  - Vegetation biomass and structure
    - Vegetation survey data (pin-point method) across multiple years (1998–2012, and beyond); three quadrats per plot; 100 pins per quadrat; conversion from pin hits to biomass using species-specific calibration.
  - Canopy reflectance
    - Ground-based spectral measurements (NDVI and PRI) from 400–950 nm; measurements around solar noon; calibration with a grey standard.
  - Phenology, growth and pathogens
    - Phenological development tracked for Calluna vulgaris, Vaccinium myrtillus, Empetrum nigrum; shoot elongation, budburst, leaf production, and pathogen signs recorded annually in select years.
  - Vegetation chemistry
    - Chemical analyses of green and senesced material for C, N, P, K, Ca, Mg, lignin, tannin, alpha-cellulose, carbohydrates; annual sampling.
  - Litterfall
    - Litter traps (12 collectors) in three quadrats; monthly collection 1999–2002; later less frequent; litter dried and weighed; samples analyzed for C and N.
  - Root biomass
    - Root biomass measured from soil cores using multiple methods across years (2003–2011); manual root extraction and subsequent analysis; some core-based methods and imaging (WinRHIZO) used.
  - Soil microbial biomass
    - Chloroform fumigation method in 2000, 2001, 2012; DOC measured to estimate microbial biomass C.
  - Nitrogen mineralisation
    - Incubation cores from 1998–2004; NH4+/NO3- analysis; net mineralisation rates derived by comparing initial vs final cores.
  - SOM, SOC and bulk density
    - SOM and SOC derived from soil cores; bulk density calculated to convert to g m-2 basis.
  - Soil solution and leachate chemistry
    - Lysimeters and tension samplers installed 1998; biweekly samples analyzed for pH, NO3-, Cl-, SO4 2-, DOC, NH4+.

## Data processing, normalization and quality notes

- Data processing and unit conversions
  - Multiple instruments over time required careful unit conversions (e.g., soil respiration from g CO2 m-2 h-1 to mg C m-2 h-1; CH4/N2O flux calculations; NEE conversions).
  - Biomass and soil measurements often require calibration factors and biomass adjustments for accurate flux scaling.
- Metadata, provenance and governance
  - Some datasets include explicit method details and supporting documentation; others are legacy datasets with incomplete documentation of processing steps.
  - Data access is sometimes restricted or requires direct contact with named researchers (e.g., Sabine Reinsch, Bridget Emmett) or CEH Bangor.
  - Throughfall and other derived-data methods include explicit procedures for handling missing data (plot exclusions, infill by year averages) to maintain comparability, but may reduce replication in some years.
- Data gaps and limitations
  - Legacy data may lack full metadata; some measurements were added or replaced with newer instruments over time, creating potential inconsistencies across years.
  - Not all data are stored centrally; some datasets reside outside the main repository, requiring outreach to data custodians for access.

## Appendix and site layout

- Appendix covers site layout and quadrat arrangement (Lysimeters, Pin quadrats, Soil suction samplers) and a 2012 Climoor plot layout with quadrat coordinates.
- Plot and quadrat references underpin consistent re-sampling across years and documentation of measurement areas.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks

- Demonstrates an integrated, multi-parameter monitoring approach combining abiotic and biotic data to evaluate climate manipulation experiments.
- Provides explicit treatment definitions, replication, and temporal scheduling essential for policy-relevant monitoring design.
- Highlights challenges relevant to monitoring governance:
  - Need for robust metadata and documentation to ensure data reuse and interpretation.
  - Importance of data provenance, quality control, and standardized data processing workflows.
  - Barriers to data access (legacy datasets, centralized storage gaps) and the necessity of clear data stewardship and governance.
  - Methods for deriving plot-level insights from site-level measurements require careful normalization and transparent methodological decisions.
- Useful as a reference for building or auditing monitoring frameworks that rely on long-term, multi-disciplinary environmental datasets with explicit treatment responses and metadata for policy evaluation.
