# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2) Period April 2014 - June 2015

## Context and aims
- Focus: carbon quantification in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar, with special attention to belowground/root biomass (BGB).
- Rationale: BGB is a significant portion of total forest carbon (up to about 40%) and is often understudied due to measurement challenges.
- Objectives: 
  - Perform direct BGB measurements on selected trees to obtain accurate estimates.
  - Compare different BGB quantification methods.
  - Calculate BGB per tree to develop allometric models for stand-level carbon stocks.
  - Align data with broader REDD+ and ecosystem services initiatives.
- Outcome focus: datasets archived for environmental information systems and used to model root biomass and AGB alongside BGB.

## Study area and sampling design
- Location: CAZ, humid tropical forest in eastern Madagascar (370,032 ha).
- Zone of Interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
- Zone selection for BGB measurements: Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2) selected based on preliminary AGB density variation; Lakato and Didy considered for context.
- Site selection strategy: sites were chosen within ZOIs to capture AGB density variation, with attention to access and protected-area restrictions.
- Target of analysis: closed-canopy forest within the four ZOIs, focusing on direct-root biomass measurements.

## Target trees and site criteria
- Based on prior inventory (Manual N°1) including species, DBH classes, and heights; AGB per tree estimated with Chave et al. (2014) allometry.
- Selection criteria:
  - Two ZOIs retained for direct BGB measurements.
  - Sites categorized by AGB (high, medium, low) to ensure representativeness; approximately 33% of sites per category.
  - Dominant species per site and DBH classes used to choose target trees.
  - DBH classes: large (≥20 cm), medium (10–<20 cm), small (5–<10 cm).
- Total target trees: 54 selected (2 ZOIs × 3 sites/ZOI × 3 species/site × 3 DBH classes/species).

## Field methods for belowground biomass (BGB)
- Two main methods used to estimate BGB:
  - Voronoi polygon method
  - Pits method
- Voronoi polygon method
  - Concept: define the root influence area around a target tree using neighboring trees; roots outside the polygon are balanced by those inside.
  - Experimental design: select neighboring trees within the polygon; record DBH and heights; measure distances; compute polygon extent from DBH proportions; calculate polygon area from triangular components.
  - Data collection: for each polygon, select target trees across DBH classes; excavate and separate roots into FR (fine), MR (medium), CR (coarse), plus stump; sample roots by soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and include CR0 (coarse roots above soil).
  - Ramifications: measure length, horizontal/vertical diameters at ends, compute mean diameter, and weigh each ramification; collect samples for lab analysis.
- Pits method
  - Description: excavate roots in three pits around the target tree (1 m² pits at triangle vertices, center at the tree, 10 m distance to vertices, 120° angles).
  - Data collection: as for Voronoi, sort roots by diameter categories, weigh, and sample for lab work.
- Depths and root categories: roots categorized as FR, MR, CR; additional CR0 above soil; soil horizons considered 0–10, 10–30, 30–50 cm.

## Laboratory works
- Drying: samples oven-dried at 75°C until constant weight; typical durations ~48 hours for FR and MR, longer for CR and stump.
- Outcome: oven-dry weights used to compute total dry root biomass per target tree.

## Calculation of root biomass and aboveground biomass
- Root biomass
  - Voronoi method: sum dry weights across root categories and scale by polygon area to estimate total root biomass per target tree.
  - Pits method: aggregate dry weights from pits to estimate total root biomass per target tree.
  - Subsequent step: develop allometric models to extrapolate BGB to stand-level biomass (Mg.ha⁻¹).
- Aboveground biomass (AGB)
  - Direct measurement: after selecting the target tree, measure fresh weights of AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) to supplement biomass estimates.
  - AGB and BGB data inform allometric model development for comprehensive carbon stock assessment.

## Data management and outputs
- Data archiving: all datasets generated are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Outputs: development of allometric models for BGB (root biomass) and AGB; potential mapping and reporting of carbon stocks to support ecosystem services and REDD+ initiatives.
- Map- and GIS-relevant outputs: basis for spatial carbon stock representations (e.g., AGB density, BGB contributions by DBH class) across ZOIs and sites.

## Conclusion and relevance
- The manual documents the rationale and detailed methodologies for direct root biomass measurement in CAZ, with emphasis on belowground carbon stocks and method comparisons.
- Expected outcomes include robust allometric equations for BGB and AGB, improved understanding of root carbon contribution in humid tropical Madagascar forests, and data readiness for REDD+ reporting and ecosystem service assessments.
