# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Period: April 2014 - June 2015; Update: February 2017
- Context: Part of the p4ges project exploring payment for global ecosystem services to alleviate poverty in eastern Madagascar; focus on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ); emphasis on belowground biomass (BGB) within the five IPCC pools (Aboveground biomass AGB, Belowground biomass BGB, Litter, Dead Wood, Soil Organic Carbon).

## Aim and scope

- Primary aim: quantify root/belowground biomass (BGB) in CAZ with direct measurements, develop allometric equations, and compare methods to enable accurate BGB and carbon stock estimates.
- Rationale: BGB is substantial (up to ~40% of total biomass) but often understudied; prior estimates relied on Root:Shoot ratios; this manual advances direct measurement by subdividing BGB into stump, coarse roots (CR), medium roots (MR), and fine roots (FR).
- Output goal: generate robust BGB data at the tree level to support stand-level estimates and future allometry; in parallel, collect AGB data for integrated biomass assessment.

## Study area and sampling frame

- Area: humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar; CAZ spans about 370,032 ha.
- ZOIs (Zones of Interest): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
- Selection criteria: altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soil type, deforestation history, access.
- Focused land use: Closed Canopy forest within CAZ for direct BGB measurements.

## Target selection and sampling design

- Selection focus: Closed Canopy forest within the four ZOIs; aim to directly measure root biomass and develop BGB allometry.
- Zones selected for direct BGB measurements: Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2) based on stand-level AGB density.
- Sites per zone: 3 sites per ZOI; tree species per site: 3 dominant species; DBH classes per species: large (≥20 cm), medium (10–20 cm), small (5–10 cm).
- Target trees: 54 trees in total, chosen to maximize representation across zones, sites, species, and DBH classes; eligibility constrained by field access and protected-area rules.

## Field methods for root biomass (BGB)

- Two main methods tested:
  - Voronoï polygon method
  - Pits method
- Voronoï method (preferred for tropical contexts)
  - Delimits root influence area around a target tree using neighboring trees’ DBHs and distances.
  - Field steps: identify target tree, record DBH/H for target and neighbors, measure distances, delineate polygon, estimate area by triangulation, then excavate roots within polygon across soil horizons.
  - Root categories collected per target: FR (<2 mm), MR (2–10 mm), CR (≥10 mm), plus stump; roots from neighboring trees distinguished from target tree roots.
  - Soil horizons: 0–10 cm (topsoil), 10–30 cm (subsoil), 30–50 cm (deep soil); CR0 captured above soil.
- Pits method
  - Three pits (1 m² each) arranged as an equilateral triangle around the target tree (center) at 10 m distance; used as a secondary approach.
  - Roots excavated, sorted into FR, MR, CR, washed, weighed, and sampled for lab analysis.
  - Noted to potentially underestimate BGB in humid tropical forests; used for comparison.

## Laboratory processing and measurements

- Sample processing: oven-dry at 75°C until constant weight; typical drying times are ~48 hours for FR/MR and longer for CR/stump.
- Dry weights used to compute total dry biomass for each root category per target tree.
- Voronoï method: root biomass per tree combined with polygon area to estimate root biomass per site; data contribute to developing tree- and stand-level allometries.

## Aboveground biomass (AGB) data collection

- Concurrent measurement with BGB: after selecting target trees, direct weighing of AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves).
- AGB allometry: tree-level AGB estimated using Chave et al. 2014 allometric equation, which uses wood density (WSG), DBH, and height (H):
  - AGB = 0.0673 × (WSG × DBH² × H)^0.976
- Site-level AGB per site summed and upscaled to Mg·ha⁻¹.

## Data management and outputs

- Data archiving: all datasets generated during the methodology are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Data use: direct measurements of BGB and AGB provide inputs for developing biomass allometric models and robust carbon stock estimates supporting REDD+ and ecosystem service evaluations in Madagascar.
- Parallel work: integration with WP1 (remote sensing, sampling design), WP2 (hydrology), WP4 (carbon), and WP5 (biodiversity) within the p4ges project.

## Conclusions and implications

- The manual documents a comprehensive approach to directly measuring belowground biomass in a humid tropical forest, emphasizing:
  - The importance of BGB for total carbon stock, and the potential to significantly improve carbon inventories with direct measurements.
  - The development of robust BGB allometry for better stand-level carbon quantification.
  - The value of comparing Voronoï-based and pit-based methods, with Voronoï preferred for representativeness in complex tropical forests.
- Ongoing data processing aims to finalize allometric models for both root biomass and AGB, contributing to sustainable ecosystem management and REDD+ initiatives in the CAZ region.
