# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context and aims
  - p4ges project in eastern Madagascar investigates carbon stock, focusing on belowground biomass (BGB) within the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ).
  - BGB is a significant portion of total forest biomass and is often understudied; this manual emphasizes direct measurement of root biomass and comparison of methods to develop accurate tree- and stand-level carbon estimates.
  - Objectives include: direct BGB measurement for target trees, comparison of BGB quantification methods, calculation of tree-level BGB (kg.tree-1) to build allometry for stand-level (Mg.ha-1), and integration with aboveground biomass (AGB) data.

- Study area and data scope
  - Area: humid tropical CAZ, eastern Madagascar, ~370,032 ha.
  - Four Zones of Interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4); selection based on biophysical criteria and deforestation/access considerations.
  - Focused land-use: Closed Canopy forest; BGB direct measurements conducted in ZOI2 (Andasibe) and ZOI3 (Anjahamana).

- Data collection design and targets
  - Targeted inventory to select target trees across zones/sites/species/DBH classes.
  - Tree categories: large DBH ≥ 20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm.
  - Total of 54 target trees selected for direct BGB measurements: 2 ZOIs × 3 sites × 3 species × 3 DBH/class per species.
  - Dominant species per site used to ensure representation.

- Field methods for belowground biomass (BGB)
  - Two complementary methods to estimate BGB around target trees:
    - Voronoi polygon method
      - Uses spatial partitioning around a target tree to define the root influence zone, considering neighboring trees.
      - Data collection per polygon: target tree, neighboring trees (DBH, species), distances, and a set of root measurements.
      - Root data collection within each polygon: excavation of soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and roots categorized as stump, CR (coarse roots, ≥10 mm), MR (2–10 mm), FR (<2 mm); CR0 (roots above soil) also recorded.
      - Ramification measurements for coarse roots (length, diameters, weight) to enhance accuracy.
      - Fresh weights captured in field; samples sent to lab for dry weight after washing.
      - Final polygon area calculated from triangular decomposition; total root biomass per tree derived from summing components.
      - One or two triangles per polygon are sampled for representative trees across DBH classes.
    - Pits method
      - Three 1 m² pits arranged in an equilateral triangle around the target tree (center at tree, vertex distances 10 m, 120° apart).
      - Excavation and sorting of roots into FR, MR, CR across three depths, with washing, weighing, and lab samples as in Voronoi method.
      - Aimed to provide a comparison and validation for root biomass estimates.

- Aboveground biomass (AGB) measurement
  - Direct measurement of AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) on target trees after cutting, following established protocols (Picard et al., 2012).
  - Fresh weights recorded for AGB components; data collected in parallel with BGB work to enable integrated biomass and allometric modeling.

- Laboratory processing
  - Samples dried in an oven at 75°C until constant weight (typically ~48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
  - Dry weights used to compute component-specific biomass; field weights and polygon area data integrated to yield total root biomass per tree.

- Data calculations and modeling
  - BGB at tree level derived by summing oven-dry weights of all root components within each method; results scaled to correspond with polygon area (Voronoi) or pit area (Pits).
  - AGB per tree estimated directly from field measurements; stand-level AGB derived by summing tree biomasses and upscaling using species- and site-specific allometry.
  - Allometric model development planned to convert measured BGB and AGB to stand-level carbon stocks:
    - AGB allometry reference: Chave et al. (2014) model used to estimate tree-level AGB from DBH and wood density parameters.
    - BGB allometry to be derived from direct measurements to enable stand-level carbon estimates.
  - Carbon quantification emphasized across five IPCC pools, with special attention to belowground carbon stock.

- Data management, outputs, and archiving
  - All datasets resulting from the field and lab work are intended for publication and integration into allometric models for root and aboveground biomass.
  - Root biomass and related measurements (stump, CR, MR, FR) and their corresponding DBH/class, species, site, zone, and depth information form the core data structure.
  - Datasets archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) for long-term preservation and accessibility.

- Data quality, challenges, and considerations
  - Field constraints include time, costs, access restrictions, and protection status within CAZ, influencing site and target-tree selection.
  - Root biomass studies in humid tropical forests are complex, time-consuming, and require careful separation of target-tree versus neighboring-tree influences (addressed via Voronoi method and careful sampling design).
  - Lab processing requires extended drying times for certain root classes; standardized drying and weighing protocols are essential for comparability.
  - The integrated data workflow supports the development of robust allometric models and enhances understanding of belowground carbon stocks to inform REDD+ and ecosystem service analyses.

- End goals and relevance for data products
  - Produce robust, field-validated BGB and AGB estimates to quantify total carbon stocks in CAZ.
  - Develop and validate allometric equations for root biomass and aboveground biomass, enabling scaling from trees to stands (Mg.ha-1).
  - Generate data products such as tree-level and site-level biomass estimates, biomass density maps, and zone-based comparisons to inform policy and REDD+ initiatives.
  - Ensure datasets are well-documented, standardized, and archived for reuse by researchers and decision-makers.
