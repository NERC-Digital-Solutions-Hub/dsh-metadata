# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon)

- Context and aims
  - Part of the p4ges project: exploring pay-for-ecosystem-services at international scale to alleviate poverty.
  - WP4 focuses on carbon stock assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena Corridor (CAZ), Madagascar, with particular emphasis on belowground biomass (BGB).
  - Objectives include direct BGB measurement on selected trees, comparison of BGB quantification methods, and development of tree- and stand-level biomass allometry to enable carbon stock estimation at larger scales.
  - All generated datasets are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC) to ensure data availability and traceability.

- Study area and scope
  - Humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar; ca. 370,032 ha.
  - Four zones of interest (ZOIs) considered; field work focused on closed canopy land-use sites within ZOIs Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2) for direct BGB measurements.
  - BGB assessment covers five IPCC carbon pools; this manual concentrates on belowground/root biomass (BGB).

- Target selection and sampling design
  - Target trees chosen from four dominant species across zones, sites, and diameter classes.
  - Tree size categories: large DBH ≥ 20 cm, medium 10–20 cm, small 5–10 cm.
  - In each ZOI, at least 3 sites were selected to capture variation in AGB; overall, 54 target trees were selected for direct BGB measurement (2 ZOIs × 3 sites × 3 species × 3 DBH classes).
  - Selection relies on prior forest inventory data and estimates of AGB per site using allometry.

- Field methodologies for root biomass (BGB)
  - Two main direct methods:
    - Voronoï polygon method
      - Uses spatial partitioning around the target tree to allocate root areas, accounting for neighboring trees.
      - Field steps include: identifying target tree, cataloging neighboring trees, measuring DBH and distances, delimiting Voronoï polygon, and excavating roots within polygon.
      - Roots are categorized as stump, coarse roots (CR, ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR, <2 mm) across soil horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm; CR0 includes above-soil roots).
      - Ramifications (root branches) are measured (length, diameters, weight) to improve allometric estimations.
      - Collected roots are washed, weighed, and samples taken for lab analysis.
    - Pits method
      - Three 1 m² pits placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle around the target tree (center point), 10 m from the tree, 120° apart.
      - Roots excavated, sorted into FR, MR, CR, washed, weighed, and sampled for lab analysis.
      - Considered less suitable for humid tropical forests and may underestimate BGB.

  - Laboratory work
    - Oven-dry at 75°C until constant weight; typical durations ~48 hours for FR and MR, longer for CR and stump.
    - Dry weights are used to compute total tree-level root biomass per method.

  - Aboveground biomass (AGB) measurement (direct)
    - Simultaneously conducted; fresh weights of AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) measured directly after tree felling.
    - Data integrated with BGB data for allometric modeling.

- Data processing and allometry
  - AGB at tree level estimated using Chave et al. (2014) allometric equation, enabling upscaling to stand-level (Mg·ha⁻¹).
  - BGB at tree level derived from direct measurements; results feed into development of allometric models to estimate stand-level BGB.

- Data governance and dissemination
  - Datasets generated through field and laboratory work are archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
  - Collaboration with CIRAD and ESSA-Forests supports methodological development and knowledge transfer.
  - Outputs include field methods, laboratory protocols, and calculations intended to produce robust allometric models and carbon stock estimates, with implications for REDD+ and ecosystem-service-based poverty alleviation.

- Conclusions and relevance
  - The manual documents comprehensive methods for direct BGB measurement and AGB assessment in a tropical forest context.
  - Expectation to publish allometric models for root biomass and aboveground biomass, contributing to improved carbon stock estimates and informing policy and monitoring frameworks for ecosystem services and forest carbon management in Madagascar.
