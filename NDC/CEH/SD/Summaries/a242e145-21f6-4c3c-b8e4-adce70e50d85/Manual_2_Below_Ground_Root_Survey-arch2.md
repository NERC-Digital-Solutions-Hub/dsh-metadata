# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Context and aim
  - Part of the p4ges project: Can paying for global ecosystem services reduce poverty?, focused on carbon assessment in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), eastern Madagascar.
  - Emphasizes belowground biomass (BGB) as a significant but understudied carbon pool (up to ~40% of total biomass) and seeks direct measurement rather than relying solely on indirect methods.
  - Objectives: (i) perform direct BGB measurements on target trees, (ii) compare different BGB quantification methods on the same trees/sites, and (iii) develop tree- and stand-level BGB estimates and allometric equations for future quantification.
  - All datasets generated are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

- Study area
  - Location: humid tropical forest in CAZ, eastern Madagascar; ~370,032 ha.
  - Four zones of interest (ZOIs): Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4).
  - Selection criteria included altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soil type, deforestation history, and access.
  - For direct BGB measurements, two ZOIs were prioritized: Anjahamana (ZOI3) with higher AGB density and Andasibe (ZOI2) with lower density.

- Process for selection of target trees
  - Focused on Closed Canopy forest within the four ZOIs.
  - Used prior forest inventory data (from Manual n°1) to identify species, DBH classes, and height; estimated AGB per tree using a Chave et al. 2014 allometric model.
  - Sites were categorized by AGB density (high/medium/low) to ensure representative sampling; at least 3 sites per ZOI were selected for BGB measurements.
  - Target trees were chosen from four dominant species per site/ZOI, prioritizing the three most represented species; three DBH classes were used: large (DBH ≥ 20 cm), medium (10 ≤ DBH < 20 cm), small (5 ≤ DBH < 10 cm).
  - Total targets: 54 trees (2 ZOIs × 3 sites/ZOI × 3 species/site × 3 DBH/species).

- Description of methods developed in the field
  - Two main field approaches for BGB around each target tree:
    - Method of Voronoï polygon
      - Purpose: estimate root biomass within the root influence area of the target tree, balancing root inputs from neighboring trees.
      - Experimental design: field delimitation uses target tree and up to four neighboring trees with measured DBH and distances to define a Voronoï polygon; area is computed from triangular components.
      - Data collected per polygon: target tree and neighboring trees’ species, DBH, height, distances; calculation of area and allocation fractions; sampling of root categories.
      - Root sampling: within each polygon, one small tree triangle and two triangles for larger trees are excavated; roots are categorized into stump, coarse roots (CR, diameter ≥ 10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR, < 2 mm); roots sampled by soil horizon (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and CR0 above soil.
      - Measurements in the field: root weights (fresh) and ramification details (lengths, diameters at ends, mean diameters, etc.) for better biomass estimation.
    - Method of pits
      - Description: three pits (1 m² each) arranged in an equilateral triangle around the target tree (center), distance 10 m from the center to vertices; roots excavated and classified as FR/MR/CR across three depths.
      - Rationale: used as a comparative approach; potentially underestimates BGB in humid tropical forests.
  - Field data collection workflow
    - Document target tree and neighboring trees, DBH, height, species.
    - Delimit Voronoï polygon or pits as appropriate.
    - Collect and weigh stump and root categories; collect samples for laboratory analysis.
    - Record ramification measurements for detailed root architecture.

- Laboratory works
  - Samples dried in an oven at 75°C until constant weight (typically ~48 hours for FR/MR; longer for CR and stump).
  - Oven-dried weights used to compute total dry root biomass per target tree and for all root categories.

- Calculation of root biomass and aboveground biomass
  - Root biomass at tree level
    - For Voronoï method: total dry weight of all root components summed and scaled by the area of the surveyed polygon to obtain tree-level biomass; data used to develop allometric equations for stand-level BGB.
    - For pits method: similar aggregation of dried root biomass from sampled pits.
  - Aboveground biomass (AGB)
    - Direct measurement of AGB on target trees (trunk, branches, leaves) in parallel with root sampling.
    - AGB per tree estimated using allometric equations (Chave et al. 2014) that incorporate variables such as diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), and wood density (WSG), then upscaled to site and hectare levels.
  - Data integration
    - Results from both root and AGB measurements feed into developing robust allometric models for AGB and BGB, enabling stand-level carbon stock estimates.

- Conclusion
  - Data generation ongoing toward the development of allometric models for root biomass and aboveground biomass.
  - The root biomass knowledge supports carbon stock assessments in Madagascar’s humid tropical forests and aligns with REDD+ monitoring and policy objectives.
