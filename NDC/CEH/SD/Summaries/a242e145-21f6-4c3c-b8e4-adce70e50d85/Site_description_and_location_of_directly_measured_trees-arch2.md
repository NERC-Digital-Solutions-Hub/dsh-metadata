# DATA HEADER INFORMATION for Site_description_and_location_of_direct_measured_trees.csv

## Overview
- Records information on the characteristics of the target tree environment.
- Part of the ESPA programme and P4GES project; DOI provided.
- Acknowledgement required for products derived from these data (Laboratoire des Radio Isotopes, Université d'Antananarivo).

## Data structure and key fields
- Zone of Interest (ZOI): Categorical, with codes ZOI1 Lakato, ZOI2 Andasibe, ZOI3 Anjahamana, ZOI4 Didy; field and materials resources = botanist.
- Location: Text string describing the village name where the target tree was collected.
- Code_Site: Text string code identifying the site where the target tree was collected.
- Species: Text string; local name of the species.
- Code_target_tree: Text string; code for each target tree linked to site, species, and diameter class.
- Diameter class: Categorical; L = Large (DBH > 20 cm), M = Medium (10 < DBH < 20 cm), S = Small (5 < DBH < 10 cm).
- Longitude/Latitude: Numeric; GPS coordinates in WGS84 (EPSG 4326).
- Altitude: Numeric; ellipsoidal height in meters.
- Slope: Numeric; slope in degrees.

## Data quality, processing, and outputs
- Data are collected, verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed as part of standardised analysis.
- Outputs are designed to categorize environmental health against standards and to be presented in clear formats (reports, maps, charts).

## Data management and accessibility
- Datasets should be stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Data provenance and linkage to related datasets (e.g., manual reference to Below Ground Root Survey) are noted.

## Use and purpose for analysts
- Supports monitoring the environment by providing a consistent, standardised description of the target tree environment for environmental health assessment and policy performance over time.
- Enables replication, comparison across sites, and integration with other environmental datasets.

## Particular challenges and opportunities
- Challenge: increasing the value of datasets by combining them with other relevant data (avoiding single-use).
- Challenge: enabling others to access the underlying data used to create final outputs.
