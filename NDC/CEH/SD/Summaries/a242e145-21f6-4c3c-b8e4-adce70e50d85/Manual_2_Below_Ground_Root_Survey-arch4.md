# ESPA p4ges PROJECT Work Package Carbon (WP4-Carbon) (Manual n°2)

- Period: April 2014 - June 2015; Update: February 2017
- Purpose: Develop and apply methods to quantify belowground root biomass (BGB) and carbon stock in the Ankeniheny Zahamena corridor (CAZ), Madagascar, as part of the project Can paying for global ecosystem services reduce poverty? (p4ges). Focus on direct BGB measurement, comparison of methods, and development of allometric models to enable stand-level carbon quantification; all generated datasets archived at the Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).

## Context and Objectives
- Aims to quantify carbon stock in belowground biomass (BGB), a major but often under-studied component (representing up to ~40% of total biomass in some tropical forests).
- Examines BGB by subdividing into stump, coarse roots (CR, ≥10 mm), medium roots (MR, 2–10 mm), and fine roots (FR, <2 mm).
- Primary objectives:
  - Conduct direct BGB measurements on selected trees to obtain accurate estimates.
  - Compare different BGB measurement methods on the same trees/plots.
  - Calculate tree-level BGB (kg per tree) to develop allometric equations for stand-level carbon quantification (Mg C ha-1).
- Context emphasizes relevance for biodiversity, carbon accounting, and REDD+ initiatives in eastern Madagascar.

## Study Area and Sampling Design
- Location: Humid tropical forest within CAZ (eastern Madagascar); CAZ comprises ~370,032 ha.
- Zone of Interest (ZOI) selection: Lakato (ZOI1), Andasibe (ZOI2), Anjahamana (ZOI3), Didy (ZOI4) based on altitude, slope, bioclimate, dry season length, soil type, deforestation history, and access.
- Target zones for direct BGB measurements: ZOIs Anjahamana (ZOI3) and Andasibe (ZOI2) due to their contrasting biomass densities.
- Sites and sampling: Within each retained ZOI, sites were ranked by aboveground biomass (AGB) and categorized into high/medium/low AGB bands to ensure representative sampling.
- Target trees: 54 trees total selected based on zone, site, dominant species, and DBH class (large DBH ≥ 20 cm; medium 10–20 cm; small 5–10 cm) across 2 zones, 3 sites per zone, 3 species per site, and 3 DBH classes per species.

## Data Collection Methods
- Field methods focused on direct measurement of belowground biomass around chosen target trees using two approaches:
  - Voronoï polygon method
  - Pits method
- Voronoï polygon method
  - Concept: Delimit an area around the target tree based on distances to neighboring trees to apportion root biomass to the target tree.
  - Experimental design: Target tree (T) with up to four neighboring trees (Ni1–Ni4) arranged by clockwise order; measure DBH for T and neighbors and distances between trees; determine the polygon area from geometric calculations.
  - Data collected per specimen: species names, DBH, height, neighbor DBHs, distances, and the relative size contribution of neighbors (xi%) to derive the final polygon delimitation.
  - Root data collection within the polygon: select triangles representing different tree sizes (1 small triangle for 5–10 cm DBH; 2 triangles for 10–20 cm and ≥20 cm DBH); excavate soil in three horizons (0–10 cm, 10–30 cm, 30–50 cm) and separate FR, MR, CR (including CR0 above soil). Distinguish roots of the target tree from neighboring trees.
  - Measurements: root ramification length, diameters (horizontal and vertical at ends), mean diameters, and weights; collect samples for lab analysis.
- Pits method
  - Design: three 1 m² pits forming an equilateral triangle around the target tree, centered 10 m from the tree, to excavate all roots within pits.
  - Data collected: same root categories (FR, MR, CR) and depths; roots washed, weighed, and sampled for lab analysis.
- Laboratory work
  - Oven-dry samples at 75°C until constant weight (approximately 48 hours for fine/medium roots; longer for coarse roots and stump).
  - Determine oven-dry weights to obtain dry biomass for all root components.
- Aboveground biomass (AGB) collection
  - In parallel, after selecting target trees, directly weigh AGB components (trunk, branches, leaves) to obtain fresh biomass data, complementing BGB measurements.

## Data Processing and Biomass Calculations
- Root biomass at tree level
  - Use oven-dry weights and scale to the surveyed area (Voronoï polygon or pit area) to estimate total root biomass per target tree.
  - Voronoï method: calculate polygon area from triangular components; use this area to estimate tree-level root biomass and develop allometric models.
  - Pits method: aggregate root biomass from excavated pits; acknowledge potential underestimation in humid tropical forests.
- Stand-level biomass estimation
  - Develop allometric equations using tree-level BGB data to extrapolate stand-level BGB (Mg ha⁻¹).
  - Aboveground biomass estimated using direct measurements and allometry (Chave et al., 2014) to compute AGB per site and per hectare.
- Integrated data objective
  - Create robust models to quantify carbon stock across both aboveground and belowground pools, supporting broader carbon accounting goals (e.g., REDD+).

## Data Management, Provenance, and Archiving
- Data and datasets generated through the methodology are archived at Environmental Information Data Centre (EIDC).
- Documentation includes glossary, abbreviations, units, and a detailed table of contents illustrating study structure, methods, and calculations.
- Emphasis on reproducibility: field protocols, measurement methods, and calculation formulas are documented for future verification and model development.

## Key Findings, Implications, and Next Steps
- The manual emphasizes the importance of directly measuring BGB to improve carbon stock estimates in tropical forests, particularly in Madagascar.
- Expected outputs include publication-ready data and the development of allometric models to relate tree diameter and other metrics to BGB and stand-level carbon stocks.
- Results will contribute to sustainable management and REDD+ initiatives by enhancing understanding of carbon stored below ground in CAZ forests.
