# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and context
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey 2007, the latest evolution of the ITE Land Classification used since 1978.
  - Emphasises that the methodological framework is tightly linked to its predecessors and essential for understanding time-series change detection.

- Core concept: stratified sampling with the ITE Land Classification
  - The ITE Land Classification provides a stratified framework to ensure representative sampling across Britain’s ecological variation.
  - Stratification is based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to create land classes that capture ecological differences.
  - Sampling uses 1 km squares as the sampling unit; a centre square is classified and then surrounding squares are allocated to classes to form a comprehensive stratified grid.

- Early development and approach (1978–1987)
  - 32 initial land classes established using a centre-square approach within a 15 x 15 km grid, plus four surrounding squares, resulting in about 6,040 classified squares.
  - Aimed to minimize bias by combining stratification with random sampling; eight samples per land class were selected for the national survey.
  - Outputs focused on habitat areas and landscape changes, with results published in early 1980s literature.

- 1984 survey adjustments
  - Expanded sampling within each land class to 12 squares (total 384) to improve estimates.
  - Recognized opportunity to refine sampling allocation by class size for better national estimations.

- 1990 survey and land classification expansion
  - Land Classification revised to use data from all 1 km squares (not just a subset), with urban and sea corrections.
  - 508 squares surveyed; included repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978 and extended data collection.
  - Began linking to a land cover map of GB derived from satellite imagery.

- 2000 survey: broader, country-focused estimation
  - Motivation to enable separate country estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) and to improve regional/local estimations.
  - Land Classification expanded to better reflect country-specific reporting; introduced sub-division and aggregation of classes to create 40 strata.
  - Added samples to ensure adequate representation of all classes within each country unit.
  - England/Scotland Wales-specific adjustments led to revised country maps and sampling distribution.

- Wales-focused adjustments and 2007 refinements
  - Since devolution, demand for Wales-only reporting prompted country-unit specific adjustments.
  - Created country-unit versions of land classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and expanded Wales’ class count to improve Wales-specific estimates.
  - Increased Welsh samples to ensure a minimum representation in each Welsh class; England samples adjusted due to Welsh additions.
  - Introduced an uplands module (30 additional squares) to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Survey scope and outputs
  - CS2000 and CS2007 data sets expanded to support separate country reporting and upland-focused estimates.
  - Outputs include field survey data, habitat area estimates, and national estimates reported across England & Wales, Scotland, and Wales-specific contexts.
  - The accompanying documentation provides detailed tables of sample squares, strata areas, and sampling rates per class and per country.

- National estimates and methodological notes
  - National estimates are sensitive to the Land Classification used; later guidance preferred consistency with the latest classification for internal surveys, while cross-survey consistency may favor the earlier standard.
  - Wales and Scotland require country-specific sampling schemes; Isle of Man squares were replaced to maintain country-focused representation.
  - The approach aims to balance statistical precision with practical sampling constraints across diverse geographies.

- Data governance and knowledge sharing
  - Throughout, the strategy emphasizes transparent documentation of the classification changes, sampling design, and the implications for time-series comparability.
  - Acknowledgements and references indicate ongoing collaboration among DETR/DECC, CEH, and other researchers to sustain methodological rigor.

- Implications for data leaders
  - Demonstrates the need for adaptable, country-aware stratification in long-running data programs.
  - Highlights challenges of maintaining time-series consistency amid reclassification and jurisdictional changes.
  - Underlines the importance of clear metadata, explicit sampling designs, and data products (maps, quadrat data, habitat estimates) that support cross-country policy and environmental reporting.
