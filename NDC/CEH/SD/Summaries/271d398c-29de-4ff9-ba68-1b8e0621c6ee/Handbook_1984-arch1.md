# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish a quality baseline for monitoring habitat changes and land use across Great Britain.
  - Revisit original sites to assess changes since 1977/78 and compare ground survey with aerial photography (ITE 899).
  - Increase statistical confidence by surveying an expanded sample and enabling partial replacement sampling in the future.

- Sampling design and scope
  - 384 squares total (12 squares from each of 32 land classes) across Great Britain.
  - Each square is 1 x 1 (map units) and surveyed in 1984; exceptions apply where original squares could not be surveyed.
  - Squares selected to cover land cover, land use, and habitat categories compatible with prior surveys and grid-based objectives.
  - An additional four squares per land class planned to visit to strengthen baseline and sampling flexibility.

- Planning and field logistics
  - Teams from six ITE research stations conduct surveys; liaison with Merlewood for coordination.
  - Each square planned to take about one day; several planning approaches considered to minimize travel and overtime.
  - Travel and field-visit efficiency are emphasized to avoid double trips; multiple options exist (single-day travel, overnight stays, or short multi-square trips).

- Equipment and field resources
  - Minimal equipment required: recording booklets (FABs), 1:10,000 maps, films, pens, navigation aids, identity cards, clipboards, weather gear, reference materials, and camera.
  - Equipment allocation managed by teams; on-hand items include maps, FABs, photos, and field instructions.

- Data collection and recording
  - Primary task is mapping and recording on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a standardized coding system.
  - Data items are recorded with numeric codes; codes can be combined in boxes on recording forms to represent multiple attributes.
  - Boundaries, land use, habitat and cover types, and other features are mapped with a priority on clarity and field-logged decisions.
  - The smallest mapable unit is defined on the data sheets; surveyors must record even field corners and edges.

- The Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
  - FAB pages organize data into a consistent, codified structure across sections:
    - Cover and series/location information
    - Ownership and landowner/tenant details
    - Farmer/Landowner Information
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal features
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation and land covers
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees
    - Boundaries
    - Recreation
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications
    - Photography (five slides per square with precise geolocation of views)
  - Instructions emphasize legibility, use of pencil when possible, and documenting partial qualities (e.g., mosaic vegetation) with proportional codes.
  - Colour conventions and coding schemes provided to manage dense data without clutter.

- Ownership, permissions, and stakeholder interactions
  - Obtain permissions to access all parts of the square before surveying.
  - Record ownership and tenant details; rate cooperativeness of owners to identify potential future survey opportunities.
  - A farmer/landowner information sheet guides non-intrusive, conversational data collection.

- Physiography, inland water, and coastal data
  - Detailed codes for cliffs, rocks, peats, soils, peat works, erosion, land levelling, ditches, drainage, rivers, canals, ponds, lakes, shorelines, and related features.
  - Coastal and inland water features are mapped and coded to reflect current conditions and landscape context.

- Agriculture and natural vegetation
  - Comprehensive cover-type codes (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, various crop types).
  - Species lists for major grasses and forage species; vegetation proportions and typical associations.
  - Field-level qualifiers for land use (e.g., stock types, silage vs. hay, produce for sale, fish farming) and crop recognition guidance.

- Forestry, woodland, and trees
  - Woodland units recorded with cover types, age classes, and management status (unmanaged, planted, natural regeneration, underplanting, coppice).
  - Distinctions between trees, scattered trees, hedgerow trees, belts, copses, lines of trees, and woodland edges.
  - Tree density, species, age, height classes, and signs of regeneration recorded with structured codes.
  - Special codes for boundaries within woodland and for features like fences and gates.

- Boundaries
  - Boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, stockproof boundaries) and descriptive notes.
  - Boundaries mapped in relation to curtilages and land use; gaps and replacements encoded to reflect condition and stockproof status.
  - Boundary descriptions provide additional context where simple codes are insufficient.

- Recreation and built environment
  - Recreation designation for formal and informal use of land; school fields and public access areas included.
  - Buildings, structures, and communications: mapping of built cover types, gardens/grounds, public spaces, roads, tracks, footpaths (exclusive and shared), railways, embankments, bridges, tunnels, signs, and other infrastructure.
  - Colour-coding and symbols help differentiate residential, agricultural, commercial, public service, educational, religious, and institutional uses.

- Photography and post-survey procedures
  - Five photographs per square to capture representative land cover and features; precise recording of photograph locations and directions required.
  - After surveying, review is recommended to minimize omissions; prefer keeping original FABs rather than transposing data onto new maps unless absolutely necessary.
  - Completed FABs and data batches communicated to Merlewood; data handling emphasizes careful transmission and record-keeping.

- Data quality, interpretation, and potential challenges
  - Field decisions rely on surveyors’ judgment; plans allow for qualifiers and notes when classifications are uncertain.
  - The handbook acknowledges data gaps, accessibility challenges, and the need to unify data across different sources and formats.
  - The project emphasizes consistency, traceability of data sources, and the potential need for metadata and discoverability in later data portals or repositories.
