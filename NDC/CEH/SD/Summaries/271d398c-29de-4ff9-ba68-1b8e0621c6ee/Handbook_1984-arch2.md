# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Purpose and Context
- Documents a field methodology for a GB ecological baseline as part of Project 424 (Ecological Survey of Great Britain).
- Builds on a 1976–78 program that produced 32 Land Classes from 1 km grid squares; subsequent sampling expanded to 384 squares (12 per class) to cover all GB, with exceptions where original squares were unavailable.
- Aims to assess changes by ground survey and aerial photography (ITE 899), establishing a quality baseline for future monitoring of habitats and land use.
- Data and outputs are intended to be stored, standardised, and comparable with previous surveys, and presented as maps, charts, and reports.

## Sampling Design and Aims
- Sampling grid comprises 384 squares, representing 32 land classes; 12 squares per class across Great Britain.
- Additional four squares per class may be added to boost statistical confidence and enable partial replacement sampling in the future.
- Each survey square is surveyed by integrated teams from six ITE research stations, with liaison support from Merlewood.
- The design prioritises consistency, broad comparability with past work, and enabling downstream data integration.

## Planning and Logistics
- Each square requires a dedicated field survey day or more, with planning to minimise revisits due to travel time.
- Costing assumes travel-based surveying (no overnight subsistence) and encourages efficient routing (e.g., one square per day, or clustered squares with limited overnight stays).
- Three planning approaches are suggested: daily travel from stations, one-night stays for two squares, or longer stays for multiple squares.

## Equipment
- Minimal, map- and data-recording focused: FABs (Field Assessment Booklets), 6" maps, photographs, navigation and identification gear, weather gear, pencils, clipboards, and basic reference materials.
- Equipment is designed for rapid field mapping and standardized data capture rather than measurement-heavy work.

## Field Procedures
- Arrival: quick survey area scan, identify access issues, and acquaint with the area.
- Permissions: obtain access to all parts of the square before surveying; essential for legality and goodwill.
- Survey route: plan a suitable route to achieve full square coverage.
- Post-survey review: read back records for omissions and ensure clear presentation.

## Permissions and Access
- Gaining permission is crucial to avoid wasted effort if access is refused mid-survey; prior contact is common but may cause delays.
- A farmer/landowner information sheet is used to support engagement.
- Ownership data sheets track land units and ownership status; a form of farm/owner interaction coding captures cooperative engagement.

## Data Recording and Coding
- Mapping-centric data collection on 6" (1:10,000) maps using a structured, codified system.
- Data are encoded with numeric and alpha codes to represent land cover, habitat, boundaries, and other features; codes are designed to be combined into single annotations to reduce clutter.
- Field decisions should be made in situ; field notes or qualifying comments are encouraged when necessary.
- Boundaries and features are coded clearly on the map, with perpendicular boundary marks to denote types and widths; smallest mappable unit is defined to standardize mapping effort.

## FAB: Field Assessment Booklet
- Each square’s data is consolidated into a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) alongside its 6" maps.
- FAB sections include: Series number, Location, Ownership, Farmer/Landowner Information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, Buildings/Structures/Communications, and Photography indices.
- Guidelines emphasize neatness (pencil where possible), mosaic recording (where necessary), use of color coding for complex areas, and explicit notation of recent changes.

## Data Items by Theme (Key Sections)
- Ownership: capture ownership and tenancy status; use a scoring system for owner/cooperation to gauge survey accessibility and potential follow-up.
- Farmer/Landowner Information: qualitative background interviews to supplement maps; aim to interview a principal landholder when possible.
- Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed categories for cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, lakes, ponds, rivers, canals, drainage, springs, and shore features.
- Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: cover-type categories (e.g., amenity grassland, permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, different wetland types, crops) with subcodes for species, usage, and height/coverage. Special attention to curtilages and built-up areas.
- Forestry/Woodland/Trees: tree cover (scattered trees, coppice, copse, woodland/forest), hedgerows, belts, age classes, species, regeneration, underplanting, management state (unmanaged, natural regeneration, plantations), and tree-specific descriptors (height, crown cover, density).
- Boundaries: boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, stockproof lines) with descriptive codes and notes on gaps, descriptions, and boundary condition changes.
- Recreation: formal and informal recreation areas; dedicated spaces and uses noted for landscape context.
- Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, structures, and transport infrastructure; use color coding and descriptive notes to distinguish curtilages, new developments, derelict sites, and vacated areas; includes pipelines, signs, bridges, and other physical infrastructure.
- Photography: five slides per square; precise locations and directions recorded for each shot; front cover photo recommended.

## Color Coding and Visual Aids
- A recommended color palette for map coding is provided to aid readability and post-field interpretation (e.g., residential vs. agricultural curtilages, green for woodland, yellow for residential structures, blue for public services, etc.).

## Photography and Post-Survey Procedures
- Photography is used to document square contexts; five photographs per square from specified viewpoints.
- After surveying, data verification is advised; avoid transposing data unless absolutely necessary; batch submission of FABs to Merlewood is planned for practical transport and processing.
- No reliance on late-stage data transcription unless required; the emphasis is on timely, consistent data transfer to central repositories.

## Outputs and Data Management
- Outputs include maps, charts, and reports that depict environmental health and land-use changes.
- Data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, enabling long-term monitoring and cross-study comparisons.
- The framework supports revisiting and updating baselines as new monitoring cycles begin, facilitating trend detection over time.

## Challenges and Opportunities for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- Increase the value of datasets by integrating with related data (avoiding single-use datasets).
- Improve access to underlying data used to generate outputs, supporting transparency and reuse.
- The standardized, coded FAB framework enables consistent long-term monitoring across regions and time, supporting policy performance assessment and environmental health scrutiny.
