CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview and purpose
- National field survey protocol (1984) to establish a quality baseline for rural environment monitoring.
- Part of Project 424: ecological survey of Great Britain; compares ground survey results with aerial photography to assess habitat/land-use changes over time.
- Aims to identify and document environmental health measures and data suitable for policy scrutiny, decision-making, and future monitoring.
- Emphasizes standardized data collection, data quality, metadata, openness, and governance to enable reuse and comparability with previous surveys (1977/78).

## Sampling design and scope
- Sampling across Great Britain using land classes derived from a multivariate classification.
- 384 squares in total: 12 squares from each of 32 land classes (1x1 grid), surveyed in 1984.
- Each square mapped at 1:10,000 scale; data items chosen to cover practical, comparable, and policy-relevant landscape features.
- Intent to increase statistical confidence and allow partial replacement sampling in future.

## Field organisation and planning
- Teams drawn from six ITE research stations; nominally about 56 squares per team with liaison support.
- Planning considerations include minimizing travel and avoiding double visits; schedule options include daily travel, one-night or multi-day blocks.
- Permissions are essential: obtain access from landowners/farmers before surveying; carry identity and project information; update ownership data sheets.

## Equipment
- Minimal equipment focused on mapping and recording rather than measurement.
- Provided items include: FAB data recording booklets, 6" maps, colour pens, films/cameras, navigation tools, ITE identity card, clipboards, weather gear, and reference materials.

## Suggested field procedure
- On-site orientation: assess access and potential problems; seek permissions for the full square before starting.
- Plan a route to cover the entire square; complete data collection and allow time to review for omissions and clarity.
- Determine and follow the most efficient approach for full square coverage.

## Permissions
- Multiple reasons to secure permissions: legal access, goodwill, and background information from landowners.
- Best practice is to gain permission before survey; in practice, most surveys can obtain access with some prior contact, though this may add delays.
- A farmer/landowner information sheet is provided to guide interactions; surveyors should carry a form of identity and update ownership contact lists.

## Data recording and FABs (Field Assessment Booklets)
- Primary task is mapping; annotating 6" (1:10,000) maps with a standardized set of data codes.
- FABs group data into sections (e.g., ownership, farmer information, physiography, inland water/coastal, agriculture/vegetation, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications, photography).
- Data are encoded using numeric and alpha codes to condense information and link features on the map.
- Decision-making in the field is crucial; surveyors should record best judgments with qualifying notes where necessary.

## Data sheets and coding conventions
- Map features are codified to facilitate synthesis across squares and years.
- Examples:
  - Ownership: identify land parcels by owner; mark tenant versus owner; note owner cooperativeness for follow-up surveys.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: conversational notes to capture background context without over-documented transcripts.
  - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: codes for cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, dunes, lakes, rivers, ponds, springs, drainage, levees, etc.
  - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: detailed cover types (e.g., permanent pasture, upland grassland, moorland, heath, aquatic vegetation, crops), with sub-codes for species, management, and abundance; notes on curtilage boundaries within built environments.
  - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: tree and woodland categories, canopy cover, age, regeneration, plantation vs. unmanaged, underplanting, coppice, belts, hedgerows, and individual tree records; proportions and descriptive features to qualify cover.
  - Boundaries: types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences), descriptions, stockproof status, and gaps filled; emphasis on curtilage boundaries and distinctions between rural and urban boundaries.
  - Recreation: formal and informal spaces and uses (e.g., golf courses, playing fields, trails, information points).
  - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built-cover types, uses (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, religious, institutional), descriptions, new developments, derelict/vacant status, and infrastructure (pipelines, poles, signs, roads, tracks, footpaths, embankments, etc.).
  - Photography: five photographs per square; precise location and direction notes on FAB; aims to capture representative views while minimizing extraneous scenery.
- Colour coding as a practical alternative for complex mapping when coding becomes unwieldy.

## Mapping and spatial conventions
- Minimum mappable unit defined (approximately 0.5 hectare; boundary length around 0.5 km); careful edge coding to ensure entire square is represented.
- Boundaries and land-use transitions recorded consistently; lines and boundaries annotated with perpendicular cues where needed.
- Built features and non-agricultural curtilages appropriately distinguished and mapped to avoid misclassification.

## Post-survey procedures
- After surveying: review FABs for omissions; do not transpose data to new maps unless absolutely necessary.
- Report batches to Merlewood and arrange transport/shipping of completed FABs as soon as practicable.

## Governance, data sharing, and standards
- Data collection designed to support future monitoring and policy evaluation through standardized formats and codes.
- Permissions and data sharing considerations highlighted; underlying data ideally shareable with appropriate governance and metadata.
- The handbook embodies a governance mindset aligned with monitoring framework aims: clear data provenance, reproducibility, and a structured approach to documenting environmental conditions over time.

## Relevance to monitoring frameworks
- Demonstrates how a large-scale environmental monitoring program translates policy-relevant questions into standardized, codified field data.
- Provides a model for balancing data completeness, field practicality, and data quality in a governance-conscious context.
- Illustrates how to manage data availability, metadata, and openness while navigating permissions and stakeholder considerations.
