# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling strategy for Countryside Survey (CS) through 2007.
  - Shows how the ITE Land Classification and a stratified sampling framework have evolved over 30 years to derive national, and country-specific (England/Wales/Scotland) habitat estimates.

- Core idea: stratified, representative sampling
  - Sampling must be representative of wide GB landscapes to avoid bias.
  - Stratification partitions land into discrete strata (Land Classes) based on environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to ensure all parts of the population are sampled.
  - Stratified random sampling reduces risk of sampling extremes and improves precision of national estimates.

- The ITE Land Classification: origins and purpose
  - Early work (mid-1970s) developed a land classification system using environmental variables and a multivariate classification (Indicator Species Analysis, ISA).
  - Core unit: 1 km square; classification of squares into 32 Land Classes initially, based on representative environmental features.
  - Sampling framework used the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid and included four surrounding squares per centre, yielding about 6,039 km2 of classified area and 256 field squares for the 1978 survey.
  - Land Classes defined by average environmental characteristics (e.g., altitude, slope, rainfall).

- CS1978: first nationwide field survey framework
  - 256 squares surveyed (8 per Land Class, across 32 classes).
  - National habitat estimates calculated as: mean habitat area per square in a Land Class × total area of that Land Class.

- CS1984: expansion and refinement
  - Increased sample: 12 squares per Land Class (total 384).
  - Acknowledged that distribution across classes could affect precision; distribution decisions noted as hindsight.

- CS1990: all-squares Land Classification and the 3rd field survey
  - Moved to a Land Classification that attempted to classify every GB square (all squares), using updated data.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeated measurements of features from CS1984 plus existing data.
  - Linked to first Land Cover Map (from satellite imagery) for enhanced context.
  - Result: need to reconcile estimates with a national framework that now spans all squares, not just a sample of the original 1228 centre squares.

- Developments leading to CS2000: regional and country-specific estimates
  - Recognition that separate country-based estimates (England, Scotland, Wales) were required for policy and legislation purposes.
  - Changes introduced:
    - Land Classes subdivided to create country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Reallocation into 40 strata (from 32) to reflect country-unit distinctions.
    - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes in each country (minimum 6 squares per class per country).
    - Wales-focused sub-division of Land Class 17 to refine Wales results.
    - Isle of Man adjustments: replacing Manx squares with England squares for country-unit estimates.
  - Additional upland module added to bolster upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- CS2000: sampling framework and country-unit focus
  - Summary tables show the distribution and numbers of squares across Land Classes, with totals for England & Wales and Scotland.
  - Emphasized reporting on England with Wales and Scotland as separate units, rather than GB-wide estimates only.
  - Created new class maps for England with Wales, and for Scotland, reflecting country-unit sampling.

- CS2007: Wales-specific reporting and Wales-focused refinements
  - Welsh-only reporting demands led to further Welsh sub-divisions (five new country-unit classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
  - The total number of strata increased to 45; 43 additional squares were added in Wales to ensure robust representation of Welsh classes.
  - England did not receive additional squares to compensate for Welsh additions; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained at 4 squares per class.
  - Wales’ sampling included 64 Welsh squares in prior work; CS2007 increased Welsh representation to better support Wales-only estimates.

- Upland habitats module (CS2000 CS2007)
  - Extra module added to sample an additional 30 squares in upland and marginal upland areas of England and Wales.
  - Purpose: improve statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates, particularly for country-unit reporting.

- Current sampling framework and numbers (high-level)
  - England & Wales combined: extensive class subdivisions and a larger total of sample squares to support country-unit reporting.
  - Scotland: separate arrangements maintained for Scotland reporting.
  - Overall sampling rates over time increased from a few hundred squares in CS1978/CS1984 to several hundred per country-unit in CS1990/CS2000/CS2007, with total sample squares in CS2007 around hundreds (depending on class and country-unit considerations).
  - Upland and Wales-focused modules and country-unit subdividing steps were integrated to improve precision for non-GB-wide estimates.

- National estimates and methodological notes
  - There is a deliberate choice between using the latest country-specific Land Classification versus the original 1990 classification for national estimates.
  - For consistency with individual surveys, the latest country-unit classification approach is preferred, but cross-survey comparability can favor the original approach in some contexts.
  - Detailed note provided on the numbers of squares per class across different CS surveys (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and the implications for national estimates.

- Practical implications for data users
  - The sampling framework underpins time-series analysis of habitat change across GB and across country units.
  - Stratification by Land Classes enables robust, comparable estimates at national and country scales, while accommodating devolved governance needs (Wales, England, Scotland).
  - The inclusion of upland modules and country-unit subdivisions enhances precision for regional policy and environmental monitoring.
