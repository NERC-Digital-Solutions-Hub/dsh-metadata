# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

## Overview
- A 1984 field survey methodology for a nationwide ecological baseline in Great Britain.
- Aims to produce standardized, map-based data on land cover, land use, habitats, and landscape features to enable discovery, sharing, and reuse by others.
- Supports governance of large datasets by ensuring consistent data collection, quality, and documentation across many squares and teams.
- Data designed to be comparable with prior surveys and compatible with future change-detection work (e.g., ground vs. aerial photography).

## Scope and Data Products
- Survey design: 384 squares (12 from each of 32 land classes) across Great Britain; 1 x 1 km grid squares selected from a multivariate land-class framework.
- Data captured: land cover, land use, habitat features, physiography, inland water/coastal features, agriculture, natural vegetation, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications.
- Outputs:
  - 6" (1:10,000) maps annotated with coded data.
  - Field Assessment Booklets (FABs) accompanying maps.
  - Five photographs per square to document features and context.
- Data items aligned to landscape objectives and designed to be practical, consistent with previous surveys, and useful for future analyses.

## Data Collection and Standards
- Planning and logistics:
  - Field work organized into teams from six ITE research stations; ~56 squares per team; liaison with Merlewood for a subset.
  - Each square planned for efficient, single-visit completion to avoid duplicative travel; daily travel-based costs assumed.
  - Three planning approaches: single-square-per-day travel, one-night stays for multiple squares, or short-group stays.
- Equipment and field procedures:
  - Minimal equipment; focus on mapping and recording.
  - Required items: FABs, 6" maps, cameras, navigation tools, pens, weather gear, etc.
  - On arrival: assess access and permissions, plan route, complete survey, review coverage, and read back records for omissions.
- Permissions and stakeholder engagement:
  - Obtain access permissions for all parts of each square to avoid wasted work.
  - Engage farmers/owners (targeting the most land within the square) and document ownership/tenancy status.
  - Carry identity and information material; maintain a list of known owners/contacts and update as needed.
- Data recording and coding:
  - Data recorded on maps using predefined numeric codes that can be combined into alpha characters to annotate features.
  - Clear rules for mapping boundaries, edge cases, and complex mosaics; use color codes when necessary to reduce clutter.
  - Decisions in the field are final and must be documented with qualifiers or notes when needed.
- Documentation and reproducibility:
  - FABs organize per-square data; ensure series numbers and locations are recorded consistently.
  - Encouraged to document recent changes using codes and notes to note ongoing or recent developments.

## FAB Structure and Data Items (Key Sheets)
- Ownership (Figure 3)
  - Record ownership of land units within the square; indicate tenants vs. owners; track cooperative helpfulness using coded ratings.
- Farmer / Landowner Information (Figure 4)
  - Non-official questionnaire to capture background information and conversations with farmers; use as background context rather than formal data collection.
- Physiography / Inland Water / Coastal (Figure 5)
  - Detailed codes for cliffs, rocks, boulders, landforms, peat types, erosion, water bodies, ditches, springs, levees, shores, and substrates.
- Agriculture / Natural Vegetation (Figure 6)
  - Covers ground types excluding urban/woodland; codes for amenity grassland, pastures, various grassland types, moorlands, wetlands, crops, fallow/abandoned land, and specific species where relevant.
  - Includes coded qualifiers for crop presence, stock types, and farmed products.
- Forestry / Woodland / Trees (Figure 7)
  - Records trees, woodland, coppice, scrub, belts, hedgerows, individual trees, and regeneration.
  - Uses proportion codes, age classes, and descriptors (e.g., unmanaged, planted, natural regeneration) and includes color-coding guidance for map presentation.
- Boundaries (Figure 8)
  - Document boundary types (walls, fences, hedges, etc.) and descriptions; record stockproof status and gaps filled to improve boundary integrity.
- Recreation (Figure 8)
  - Map and classify recreational features and formal/informal uses (e.g., golf courses, playgrounds, sporting fields, information points).
- Buildings / Structures / Communications (Figure 9)
  - Covers built land cover types, buildings by usage (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional), and associated infrastructure (pipes, signs, roads, tracks, footpaths, etc.).
  - Uses color conventions and descriptive codes for complex or grouped features.
- Photography
  - Five slides per square: plan for viewpoints that best represent square context; precise geolocation and view direction must be recorded on FAB.
- Procedure Subsequence to Survey
  - Post-survey checks to ensure completeness; prefer not to transpose data to new maps; batch submissions coordinated with Merlewood.

## Data Quality, Consistency, and Documentation
- Emphasis on standardized coding and careful in-field decision-making to minimize ambiguities.
- Annotations and comments are encouraged for atypical or uncertain observations.
- Smallest field unit and edge cases must be recorded to preserve spatial precision.
- Visual coding and color conventions are used to manage map readability and complex mosaics.

## Data Governance, Access, and Sharing
- Data lifecycle: field collection, compilation in FABs, batch submission to Merlewood, and practical delivery of completed squares.
- Documentation and metadata are embedded in FABs (ownership, permissions, interview notes, coding schemes) to support future reuse.
- Updates and limitations: note any recent changes or embargoed areas; ensure updated ownership/contact information is captured for future surveys.
- Interoperability: coding schemes are designed to align with prior surveys and to be compatible with aerial/photo baselines for change assessment.

## Particular Challenges (as framed for data stewardship)
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities.
- Timely acquisition of data from diverse landowners and data creators.
- Getting data creators to meet standards (especially metadata).
- Handling multiple systems, formats, and difficult data types; large datasets with transfer constraints.
- Dealing with outdated databases that require bespoke, non-interoperable solutions.

## Reuse and Impact
- Creates a robust baseline for long-term monitoring of rural environments and habitats.
- Enables comparisons between ground surveys and aerial photography (ITE 899) to assess change over time.
- Data are intended to be discoverable and usable by researchers, planners, and conservation stakeholders, with clear provenance and documentation to support reuse.

## Endnotes
- The handbook provides a comprehensive, code-driven framework for field data collection, emphasizing governance, consistency, and traceability to support future data sharing and comparative analyses across time and space.
