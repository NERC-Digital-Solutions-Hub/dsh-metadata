# CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Overview
  - A field survey framework (1984) for recording landscape features across Great Britain using 1:10,000 maps and a standardized Field Assessment Booklet (FAB).
  - Origins from Project 424 ecological survey (1976) and subsequent sampling to establish a baseline and assess changes via ground survey and aerial photography.
  - Data items chosen to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant for grid-based GIS analysis.

- GIS-oriented data framework
  - Mapping and data products
    - Data are collected on 6" (1:10,000) maps and annotated with coded information to produce map-based datasets suitable for GIS.
    - Minimum mapping units: approximately 0.5 hectare area and 0.2 km length per unit; edges and corners of squares must be fully surveyed.
  - Survey grid and sampling
    - 384 squares (12 per class) across 32 land classes (2 x 15 km squares per class, with some exceptions) to cover Great Britain.
    - Teams from six research stations survey squares; emphasis on consistent coverage and data compatibility with earlier work.
  - Data item structure
    - Data items organized into sections corresponding to FAB sheets (physiography, inland water/coastal, agriculture/natural vegetation, forestry, boundaries, recreation, buildings/structures/communications).
    - Categories include land cover, land use, habitat features, physiographic attributes, and species/crop information, with provisions for combinations of codes to represent complex mosaics.

- FAB (Field Assessment Booklet) and coding
  - FAB composition and workflow
    - Sections include: Cover, Ownership, Farmer/Landowner information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, Buildings/Structures/Communications, Photography, and Procedure after survey.
    - Each square’s data are compiled into an FAB, with a series number, location, and owner/interview details.
  - Coding system
    - Use a combination of numeric codes and alpha codes to annotate map features; codes are entered into dedicated boxes to allow compact, machine-readable representation.
    - Complex features (e.g., mosaicked vegetation, boundary types) are encoded as combinations of codes; long or dense areas may be shown with colour conventions to reduce clutter.
    - Boundaries and boundaries within curtilages require careful coding and clear delineation on the map (e.g., boundary types, gaps, and stockproof status).
  - Page-by-page guidance (highlights)
    - Ownership: mark ownership units with owner numbers; record tenant/owner status; note respondent cooperativeness on a scale.
    - Farmer/Landowner: capture contextual information from conversations; use sparingly and summarize where possible.
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal: detailed codes for cliffs, rock outcrops, peat features, erosion, springs, ditches, levees, ponds, rivers, canals, dams, etc.
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation: cover type codes (e.g., Amenity grassland, Permanent pasture, Upland grassland, Moorland, Heath, Aquatic vegetation, Marsh, Crops, Fallow/Abandoned land, Species-specific notes), measurements and heights, production uses, and stock types.
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees: codes for cover types, tree/coppice lines, belts/hedgerows, individual trees, age, density, regeneration, underplanting, plantations, and management status (unmanaged, natural regeneration, etc.).
    - Boundaries: various boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences), descriptions, gaps, and stockproof status.
    - Recreation: formal and informal recreational areas and features.
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications: built cover types, descriptions, new developments, derelict/vacant areas, pipelines, signage, roads, tracks, footpaths, embankments, and other infrastructure; recommended color coding for fast visualisation.
  - Photography
    - Five photographs per square (slides) to capture representative viewpoints; locations and directions must be recorded on the FAB with arrows indicating the camera orientation.

- Data collection process and field practices
  - Planning and logistics
    - Surveying groups split into seven groups; each square expected to take about one day; travel-based planning to maximize efficiency and minimize overnight stays.
    - Permissions are essential to access all parts of each square and to avoid wasted work; prior contact may reduce delays.
  - Equipment
    - Minimal equipment: FABs, square maps, film, colour pens, navigation gear, ITE identity card, clipboards, pencils, reference books, weather gear, and camera.
  - Field procedures
    - On arrival: assess access, identify problems, and orient to area.
    - Obtain permissions for the entire square before starting.
    - Plan a route that enables full coverage; after surveying, review records for omissions and clarity.
  - Data integrity and field decision-making
    - Field decisions should be made in the field; defer decisions only when necessary and record qualifiers where needed.
    - If a square is too complex, use colour coding in the FAB to maintain legibility and map clarity.

- Permissions, ownership, and community engagement
  - Gaining access is crucial; refused access can invalidate already-collected data, though major refusals were rare in historical surveys.
  - A short farmer/landowner information sheet accompanied by identity and background inquiries helps contextualize survey data and may aid future surveys.

- Output, delivery, and post-survey steps
  - Deliverables
    - Completed FABs and 6" map sheets from each square, plus associated photographs.
  - Post-survey workflow
    - After surveying, review and correct the FAB; avoid transposing data to new maps unless essential; batch submission to Merlewood for processing.
  - Data compatibility and archival
    - Data are designed to be compatible with earlier surveys, to facilitate time-series analyses and cross-reference with other datasets.

- Practical considerations and GIS relevance
  - The handbook provides a comprehensive, codified approach to translating field observations into GIS-ready layers with standardized attributes, enabling cross-square and cross-survey comparisons.
  - The emphasis on explicit mapping units, code-based recording, photo documentation, and clear boundary delineation supports robust spatial analyses and data integration across time.
  - While rooted in its 1980s context, the document highlights foundational GIS best practices: standardized schemas, metadata-like structure (FAB sections), field-validated data, and explicit guidance for data quality and provenance.
