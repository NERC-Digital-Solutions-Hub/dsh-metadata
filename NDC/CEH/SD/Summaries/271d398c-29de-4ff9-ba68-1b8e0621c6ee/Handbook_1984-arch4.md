# 1984 May CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENVIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Purpose and scope
  - Establish a quality baseline for changes in Great Britain’s rural environment through a large-scale ecological survey.
  - Part of Project 424 (Ecological Survey of Great Britain); comparing ground survey results with aerial photography (ITE 899) to assess effectiveness of changes over time.
  - Uses a grid of 1 x 1 km squares, categorized into 32 Land Classes; 384 squares were surveyed in 1984 (12 per class) to cover Great Britain.
  - Data items are designed to be practical, compatible with previous surveys, and relevant to landscape objectives; some items allow for additional categories as needed.

- Survey framework and data items
  - Aimed to document land cover, land use, habitat features, and landscape context across GB.
  - Field data organized around a standardized set of themes that can be mapped and coded against 6" (1:10,000) maps.
  - Key themes (data sheets) include Ownership, Farmer/Landowner Information, Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, and Buildings/Structures/Communications.
  - Comprehensive code lists for land cover, species, boundaries, and other features support consistent data recording and later analysis.

- Planning, teams, and logistics
  - Teams from six ITE research stations survey approximately 56 squares each; liaison teams (e.g., Merlewood) assist roving surveys.
  - Each square requires careful planning to balance coverage and travel time; multiple planning approaches (daily travel, overnight stays, or longer blocks) are described.
  - Travel efficiency and avoiding double visits are emphasized to manage costs and scheduling.

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Permissions must be obtained to access all parts of a square; non-compliance would nullify already collected data.
  - Prior contact with farmers/landowners is encouraged; a background information sheet and an identity card help establish goodwill.
  - Ownership information is updated from the 1977/78 survey; tenants (T) and owners (C) are coded appropriately.

- Data capture methods and standards
  - Data collection is described as a mapping exercise using 6" maps, with data codes combining into single alpha characters for efficiency.
  - Boundaries are clearly marked on maps (fences, walls, hedges, etc.) with specific coding conventions for gradual or complex boundary types.
  - The minimum mappable unit is defined (approximate size thresholds provided) to ensure consistent mapping granularity.
  - In-field decisions are made by the surveyor; if a category is unclear, a qualifying note is recorded.

- Data recording tools: FABs and maps
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) is the primary data recording tool; each square is paired with its 6" map.
  - FAB sections include:
    - Cover/Series number and location
    - Ownership (who owns/controls land within the square)
    - Farmer/Landowner Information (friendliness/availability of background information)
    - Physiography/Inland Water/Coastal (e.g., cliffs, peat, water bodies, drainage, etc.)
    - Agriculture/Natural Vegetation (cover types, crops, grassland types, heath, marsh, etc.)
    - Forestry/Woodland/Trees (cover types, tree species, age, plantation vs. natural regeneration, belts, hedgerows, etc.)
    - Boundaries (types, descriptions, stockproof status, gaps)
    - Recreation (formal/informal uses)
    - Buildings/Structures/Communications (built cover types, uses, descriptions, new developments, derelict status, boundaries with gardens)
    - Photographs (five slides per square, with precise location and direction recorded)
  - Color conventions are provided to aid coding when numeric codes become unwieldy.

- Data coding, annotation, and semantics
  - A structured coding system enables combining multiple codes for a single mapped feature (e.g., moorland area with specific vegetation and cover percentages).
  - Boundary and feature coding is designed to be additive and non-ambiguous, with explicit guidance on how to handle mosaic or mixed features.
  - Species and crop codes are detailed, enabling granular reporting of vegetation types, wildlife, and agricultural practices.

- Field procedures and quality assurance
  - Upon arrival, surveyors assess access and plan a route that ensures full square coverage.
  - Permissions are verified before surveying; interview notes are encouraged with a conservative, non-intrusive approach.
  - After recording, surveyors re-check for omissions and ensure clear, legible presentation of data.
  - If essential, data may be transposed to new maps, but this is discouraged to prevent data integrity loss.
  - Post-survey reporting includes notifying Merlewood of batch completions and arranging transport of completed FABs.

- Post-survey processing and outputs
  - Data products comprise annotated 6" maps, FABs, and 5 photographs per square; outputs feed into a national archive for future monitoring.
  - The 1984 dataset provides a baseline for comparing ground survey results with aerial photography and informs ongoing changes in rural environments.
  - The handbook anticipates coordination with wider data networks and aims to support future data sharing and comparative studies.

- Photographs and documentation
  - Five photographs per square are prescribed, capturing representative views while avoiding excessive sky or distant expanses.
  - Exact photo locations and viewing directions must be recorded on the FAB’s map inset to support geospatial traceability.

- Notable emphasis for data leaders
  - Emphasis on establishing a robust, interoperable data framework that links field observations to map-based representations via standardized codes.
  - Focus on long-term data utility, repeatability, and comparability with prior and future surveys.
  - Clear governance around permissions, ownership, and stakeholder engagement to preserve data integrity and goodwill.
  - Designed to be scalable and compatible with other data sources (e.g., aerial imagery) to support comprehensive landscape monitoring and analysis.
