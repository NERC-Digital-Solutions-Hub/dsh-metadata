# 1984 May CHANGES IN THE RURAL ENIRONMENT FIELD SURVEY HANDBOOK

- Overview and purpose
  - A field handbook to guide a nationwide survey of rural environments in GB, linking ground survey with aerial photography (ITE 899) to establish a quality baseline.
  - Data items are chosen to meet landscape objectives, align with previous surveys, and support future data use across topics.
  - Teams aim to assess land cover, land use, habitat, and related features in a standardized way to enable comparisons over time.

- Data model and coding strategy
  - Data collection is map-based: 6" (1:10,000) maps are annotated with a structured set of data codes.
  - A single data recording form (FAB) collects coded information for each square; codes can be combined to represent complex features.
  - Use of alpha-numeric coding schemes to capture multiple attributes (e.g., boundary types, vegetation, land use) on the map.
  - Guidelines emphasize consistency, field judgement, and the ability to annotate mosaics or complex units with appropriate codes.
  - Minimum mappable unit is 1/20 hectare; care to record even small field corners and edges.

- Field planning and survey execution
  - Sample framework: 384 squares (12 per 32 land classes) distributed across six ITE stations; teams rotate with liaison from Merlewood.
  - Each team surveys ~56 squares; planning prioritizes avoiding repeated travel and meeting schedules efficiently.
  - On-site approach emphasizes early assessment, permissions, planned routing to cover the whole square, and post-survey checks.

- Permissions and stakeholder engagement
  - Obtaining access permissions for all parts of each square is essential to avoid wasted effort.
  - Building goodwill with landowners/farmers is important; prior contact can reduce delays but may introduce scheduling challenges.
  - Surveyors carry identity (ITE card) and use an owner/tenant information process to document cooperation and contact.

- Data recording and FAB completion
  - Data are recorded on maps and assembled into the FAB booklet; standard page order is not critical.
  - Emphasis on field decisions: record in the field, qualify or comment on ambiguous cases, and avoid deferring decisions to later processing.
  - Ownership and farmer information are captured to aid future survey planning and stakeholder engagement.
  - Specific sheets (e.g., Physiography, Inland Water/Coastal, Agriculture/Natural Vegetation, Forestry/Woodland/Trees, Boundaries, Recreation, Buildings/Structures/Communications) guide the data items to be captured.
  - Use of colour codes and structured data boxes to manage complex information and keep maps legible.

- Ownership, farmer information, and stakeholder data
  - Ownership: record ownership units, mark tenants (T) and changed ownership (C) since 1977/78.
  - Cooperation rating: a coded scale (0–3) indicating owner/landowner engagement and helpfulness.
  - Farmer/Landowner Information: conduct at least one farmer interview per square when possible; use a structured sheet to capture background dialogue.

- Physiography, inland water, and coastal data (Figure 5)
  - Detailed codes for features such as cliffs, rock outcrops, peat, erosion, dunes, shores, lakes, ponds, rivers, ditches, springs, levees, and drainage signs.
  - Guidelines support combining codes to describe lake shores, river banks, substrates, and related landscape features.
  - Distinctions between natural and artificial features (e.g., rivers canalised, ponds artificial).

- Agriculture and natural vegetation data (Figure 6)
  - Covers ground-cover types across GB (excluding urban and woodland); includes curtilage-specific mapping and built-up area considerations.
  - Extensive cover-type codes (e.g., Amenity grassland, Permanent pasture, Upland grassland, Moorland heath, Aquatic vegetation, Marsh, Cereal crops, Fallows, Abandoned/Neglected land, etc.).
  - Species lists (e.g., grasses, herbs) associated with cover types, and notes on crop conditions, livestock types, and farmed produce.
  - Height and proportion codes to describe vegetation structure and composition.
  - Instructions for handling mixed or mosaic vegetation and for recording within curtilages.

- Forestry, woodland, and trees data (Figure 7)
  - Woodland units and tree coverage: recording of cover types, tree species, age classes, and structural attributes.
  - Categories include Scattered trees, Coppice, Copse, Scrub, Shrub, Lines of trees, Belts, Hedgerows, Individual trees, and certain plantation types.
  - Special codes for tree age, height, density, regeneration, underplanting, unmanaged vs managed, and re-growth from stumps.
  - Guidance on classifying tree height, crown cover, and proportion of canopy to describe composition accurately.
  - Use of color and description codes to qualify tree-related features (amenity, recreation, shelter).

- Boundaries and boundary descriptions (Figure 8)
  - Documentation of boundary types (e.g., mortared walls, hedges, fences) and their lengths in units.
  - Descriptions add contextual information like stockproof status, gaps, and signs of replacement.
  - Boundary mapping supports understanding land parcels and land management.

- Recreation data (Figure 8)
  - Formal and informal recreational uses and facilities; includes information points and access features.

- Buildings, structures, and communications (Figure 9)
  - Built-cover types capture buildings and associated uses (residential, industrial, commercial, public services, educational/cultural, religious, institutional).
  - Descriptions provide more context about use and function; new developments are mapped if not shown on OS maps.
  - Infrastructure features (e.g., pipelines, speed signs) captured with descriptive and boundary data.
  - Transport and access features: roads, tracks (constructed/unconstructed), footpaths, informal barriers, embankments, bridges, tunnels, and other conveyances.
  - Colour conventions are provided to assist map readability and classification.

- Photography and documentation
  - Five photographs per square (slide films) to reflect square-scale features; orientation and location of each photo must be marked on FAB with arrows indicating view direction.
  - First photograph aligns with the FAB front cover.

- Post-survey workflow and data handling
  - After surveying, review all sheets to ensure no feature is omitted.
  - Transcription to new sheets is discouraged; only do so if absolutely necessary to prevent damage to original maps.
  - Batch submission: inform Merlewood when each batch of squares is complete and arrange transport of completed FABs.
  - Emphasis on preserving original maps and data integrity.

- Output and data products (alignment with Data Support goals)
  - Primary outputs are the FABs and annotated 6" maps that encode standardized landscape data.
  - Data products support cross-application analysis, potential dashboards, and self-serve exploration by end users, with emphasis on data quality, consistency, and comparability over time.
  - The handbook provides a comprehensive data dictionary and structured workflow to facilitate integration with other data sources and future analyses.
