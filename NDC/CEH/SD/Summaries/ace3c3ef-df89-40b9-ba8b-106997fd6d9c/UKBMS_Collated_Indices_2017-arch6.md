# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with gratitude to volunteers.
- Purpose: provide annual data on butterfly population status to understand changes in biodiversity and inform policy questions.
- Scale and history: active at over 2,500 sites annually since 1976; data are integrated from multiple components to produce national indices.

## Data collection methods

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km long, recording all species along a 5 m wide belt, typically 26 counts per year, ~2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, timed counts, and egg/larval web counts focusing on specific species or alternative methods.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified-random 1 km squares with two parallel 1 km transects; 2–4 visits per square per year (minimum 2 visits in July/August); ~750 squares sampled annually.
- All components use similar transect methodologies to enable integrated analyses.

## Data processing and trend analysis

- Data are summarized as abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Collated indices for each species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016 update), with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period survey completed at each site.
- Counts from all survey types (Pollard walks, reduced surveys, WCBS) are used to estimate the seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for recording gaps; weighting emphasizes observed data over extrapolated data.

## Quality control

- Field data are recorded on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker, then uploaded to a central database.
- Automated checks flag anomalies (e.g., abnormally high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate data; ongoing review throughout the season.
- Further automated/manual validation checks for out-of-range distributions, unusual abundances, new site records, and data entry errors, with edits made to the main dataset as needed.

## Details of this data download

- Content: annual collated indices of abundance for UK butterfly species with sufficient data, from 1976–2017 (collated indices may be unavailable for some early years due to data gaps).
- Format: CSV file.
- Columns:
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species number
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath reference)
  - YEAR: year of the collated index
  - NO. SITES: number of sites contributing to the index
  - COLLATED INDEX: log10 of the collated index; scaled so the average across the series equals 2
  - YEAR RANK: relative rank of the CI within the species’ series
  - TIME PERIOD: time period used to produce the indices
  - COUNTRY: country of data used for the regional index
- Note: some early years lack collated indices due to insufficient data.
