# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- Purpose and context
  - Organised and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
  - Volunteers contribute data; the scheme provides annual data on butterfly population status to inform biodiversity policy and monitoring.
  - Operates since 1976 with over 2,500 active sites annually; integrates results from multiple components to assess trends.

- Data collection and sampling framework
  - Combines site-based monitoring with random 1km square sampling.
  - Components:
    - Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route transects 2–4 km, 5 m recording band, ~26 counts per year (April–September), ~2,000 sites.
    - Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects and alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts).
    - Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): stratified random 1km squares, two parallel 1-km transects, 2–4 visits per year (750 squares/year), focusing on common habitats like farmland.
  - Data aggregation across components to produce species-level indices.

- Nature of data and trend analysis
  - Uses abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute counts.
  - Site indices reflect a stable proportion of the population; detection varies by species.
  - Collated indices produced with Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (since 2016), weighted by the proportion of the flight period surveyed per site/year.
  - All counts in a season inform the seasonal pattern and extrapolate to account for recording gaps, with greater weight given to observed data.

- Quality control
  - Field data recorded on standard forms and entered online (UKBMS site or Transect Walker) before uploading to a central database.
  - Automated checks flag potential errors; regional transect coordinators review data.
  - Additional validation checks for species distribution, flight period, first-time records at a site, and anomalous abundances.
  - Corrections performed via queries and coordination with recorders/coordinators; ensures data quality and consistency.

- Details of this data download
  - Provides annual collated indices for species with sufficient data from 1976–2017 (some early years excluded for certain species due to data limits).
  - Data delivered as a CSV file.
  - Key columns: SPECIES CODE, SPECIES, COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so mean = 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
  - Species names follow Fauna Europaea (v2.2) and common names follow Emmet & Heath references.
