# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

- The UKBMS is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, the British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, with significant contributions from volunteers.
- It provides annual data on butterfly population status from a wide-scale site-based monitoring program plus randomly selected 1 km squares, enabling policy-relevant biodiversity status and trend insights.
- The scheme has monitored UK butterfly abundance since 1976 and, currently, involves over 2,500 actively recorded sites each year.
- Results from different components are analyzed together to generate national and species-specific trend indices.

## Data collection and components

- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed-route 2–4 km transects, 5 m wide band, recording all species weekly from April to September (about 26 counts/year), at roughly 2,000 sites.
- Reduced effort surveys: single-species transects, alternative methods, timed counts, and counts of eggs/larval webs for specific species.
- Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS): same transect methodology as Pollard walks but used in 1 km squares; approximately 750 squares annually, with 2–4 visits per square (2 visits in July/August recommended; spring visits encouraged).

## Data nature and trend analysis

- Data are abundance indices (relative measures) rather than absolute population sizes.
- Site indices reflect a constant proportion of butterflies present; detectability varies by species.
- Collated species indices are built using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) method (2016) with site-year weighting based on the proportion of the flight period surveyed, prioritizing observed data over extrapolated data.
- The method uses all counts in a season to model seasonal patterns and fill gaps, producing robust annual indices.

## Quality control

- Field data are collected on standard forms and entered online via the UKBMS data entry site or Transect Walker.
- Automatic checks flag potential errors (e.g., unusually high counts, records outside known flight periods).
- Regional transect coordinators validate data; multiple automated and manual validation steps check distribution ranges, flight periods, first-time site records, and abnormal values.
- Edits to the main UKBMS dataset are made after queries and coordination with recorders where needed.

## Details of this data download

- Contains annual collated abundance indices for species with sufficient data from 1976–2017 (earlier years may lack collated indices for some species).
- Provided as a CSV file.
- Columns include:
  - SPECIES CODE, SPECIES (Latin name), COMMON NAME, YEAR, NO. SITES, COLLATED INDEX (log10, scaled so the average equals 2), YEAR RANK, TIME PERIOD, COUNTRY.
