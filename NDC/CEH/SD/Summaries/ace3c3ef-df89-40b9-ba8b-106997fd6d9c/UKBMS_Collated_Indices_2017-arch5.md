# About the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme

## Overview
- The UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme (UKBMS) is organized and funded by Butterfly Conservation, the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, British Trust for Ornithology, and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.
- It relies on volunteers to collect annual data on butterfly population status.
- Data come from site-based monitoring and random 1km square sampling, with three components: standard fixed-route transects (Pollard walks), reduced-effort surveys, and the Wider Countryside Butterfly Survey (WCBS).
- The scheme has monitored UK butterfly populations since 1976 and operates across over 2,500 active sites annually.
- All components’ results are analyzed together to assess trends in butterfly populations.

## Data collection framework
- Standard butterfly transects (Pollard walks): fixed routes at sites, recording all species within a 5m band, typically 2–4 km, 26 counts per year, weather-appropriate conditions; ~2,000 sites sampled yearly.
- Reduced-effort surveys: single-species transects or alternative methods (timed counts, egg/larval web counts) focusing on select species.
- WCBS: stratified-random one-km squares with two parallel 1-km transects; 2–4 visits per square, sampling ~750 squares per year.
- Data collection uses standard forms; data entered online or via Transect Walker software before being uploaded to the central database.
- Site-level regional coordinators validate and QA data continuously throughout the season.

## Data and trend analysis
- Uses abundance indices based on counts from transects and sites; indices are relative measures of population size.
- Collated indices for each species are produced using the Generalised Abundance Index (GAI) with weighting to reflect the proportion of the flight period surveyed at each site/year.
- All seasonal counts across components are used to estimate annual seasonal patterns and to extrapolate gaps, with greater weight given to observed data.

## Quality control
- Field data are entered on standard forms; automated checks flag potential errors (e.g., implausible counts, out-of-season records).
- Regional transect coordinators review data; ongoing validation throughout the season.
- Additional automated and manual validation checks identify records outside known distribution, unusual abundances, or anomalies; corrections are made via queries and, where needed, discussions with contributors.

## Data download details
- This download includes annual collated indices of abundance for UK butterfly species with sufficient data, covering 1976–2017 (some early years excluded due to insufficient data).
- Data provided as a CSV file with columns:
  - SPECIES CODE: unique species number
  - SPECIES: scientific name (Fauna Europaea, version 2.2)
  - COMMON NAME: vernacular name (Emmet & Heath)
  - YEAR: year of the Collated Index
  - NO. SITES: number of sites contributing to the index
  - COLLATED INDEX: Collated Index expressed as Log10; scaled so the average equals 2
  - YEAR RANK: yearly rank of the Collated Index for the species
  - TIME PERIOD: time period used to derive the indices
  - COUNTRY: country of data used for the regional index
