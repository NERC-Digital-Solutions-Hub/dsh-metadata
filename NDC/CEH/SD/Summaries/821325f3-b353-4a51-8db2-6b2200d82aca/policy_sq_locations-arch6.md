# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Policy to maximise public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Governance and funding
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE.
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- UKCEH acts on behalf of NERC to manage exceptional releases; annual reporting on access applications.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future landowner permission.

## When and how locations can be released
- Four-digit grid references (identifying 10 km × 10 km grid squares) may be released under licence for approximate location needs.
- Six-digit grid references may be released only if UKCEH can perform pre-processing analysis to avoid external release; in very exceptional cases, external release under licence may be allowed if IP/confidentiality of the requester is equally or more protected.
- Spatial data within survey squares (maps of habitats/linear features) could enable locating a square and are subject to the same exceptional-access terms as six-digit references.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals.
- Licences are granted for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at project end.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must demonstrate project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have lower IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; similar licensing terms apply, with an explicit prohibition on identifying precise square locations.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, approves exceptional releases and issues licences (hardcopy) with appropriate clauses.
- Licences must be signed by an authorised senior representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, decisions are made under statutory Act/Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical use, CS partners may need pre-processing analysis support; UKCEH aims to assist within reasonable demand; other organisations are considered case-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential data users consult UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; UKCEH involvement may vary and can be negotiated per case.
