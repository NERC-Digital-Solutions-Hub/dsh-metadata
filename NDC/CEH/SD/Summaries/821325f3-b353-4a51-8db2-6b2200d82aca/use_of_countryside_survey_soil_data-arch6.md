# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

- Overview
  - Soils sampled in Countryside Survey (CS) across years 1978, 1998, 2007, and rolling surveys starting in 2019.
  - Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) guided the number of samples needed to detect significant change.
  - 2018 pilot; 2019 marked the start of a rolling survey aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

- Study design and sampling
  - Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates; they may reflect different land uses, soil types, etc.
  - Some X-plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty in original placement; each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Same repeat identifier implies the same location; exact sampling positions are typically ~2–3 m apart within a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- X-plots and repeat identifiers
  - Each CS square contains up to 5 X-plots; repeats are identified to track changes over time.
  - Relocation or destruction is accommodated while preserving the ability to link data to the correct location via the repeat ID.

- Sampling procedures by year
  - Depth of sampling: top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample); variations exist by year.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling CS surveys use soil cores hammered into the soil and pulled out.
  - 1978 used a soil pit with sampling from the top 15 cm from the pit side.
  - Some cores may be shallower than 15 cm due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and dimension measurements were made (notably in 2007 for a subset).

- Measurements and laboratory analyses
  - 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling surveys (2018/19–2023): multiple cores per X-plot; different cores have different measurements; samples are homogenised before pH and LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (not by ISO bulk density method).
  - No chemical analyses by soil horizon reported; some cores include measurements like black cores and mineralization.
  - Core photos and detailed measurements of core dimensions were undertaken in 2007 for some cores.
  - A full description and implications are provided in Emmett et al. (2008).

- Data structure and quality notes
  - Not all measurements are made on all samples; data richness varies by year and core.

- Data analysis and interpretation guidance
  - Analyses should account for land-class structure; ignoring it yields population stock/change, while incorporating it yields weighted national estimates.
  - Bootstrapping is not uniformly used; consider the CS structure in analyses.
  - Recommend a mixed-model approach with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
  - Design-based approaches favor dispersed observations for broader regional estimates; generally only one core per location is taken.
  - For analysis and interpretation, consult UKCEH and review CS publications listed on the CS website.

- Practical notes for data users
  - CS soils data users should consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation.
  - Review existing CS publications exploiting the data for context and methods.
