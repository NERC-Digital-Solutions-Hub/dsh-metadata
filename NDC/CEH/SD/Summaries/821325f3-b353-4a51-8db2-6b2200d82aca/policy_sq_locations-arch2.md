# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Funding/partners: 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC; CS partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Protects the environment and future permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality supports scientific integrity and reliable policy-informed monitoring.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations can be released
- Access may reveal whether survey squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (approximate locations within 10 km grid) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit (precise) locations: UKCEH may pre-process analyses to avoid release; very exceptional external release only if the requester demonstrates legally that their IP is equally or more confidential than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares could enable location identification and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Release conditions and safeguards
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate need.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must not be retained for other organizational purposes.
- End of licensing period requires written destruction confirmation.
- Data should not be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; not to be used to plan visits or check landowner compliance.
- Evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP may be required.
- Four-digit releases have looser IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases and include a clause preventing attempts to derive precise locations.

## Roles and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases per policy.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; licences signed by authorized representatives.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows FOI/Regulatory procedures.
- Annual CS-partner report summarises licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations handled case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before using CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may apply.

## Practical guidance for analysts
- Consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data.
- Plan analyses to avoid revealing precise locations.
- Consider requesting pre-processing to minimise handling of sensitive data.
- Be prepared to demonstrate IP/IP-equivalence confidentiality for six-digit data.
- Understand licensing terms, end-of-license destruction, and data-security obligations.
