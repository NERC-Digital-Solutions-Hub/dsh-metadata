# Sampling design

- The Countryside Survey (CS) soils have been sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019. A pilot occurred in 2018, with rolling 2019–2023 aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating. Power analyses (Emmett et al. 2008) informed the number of samples needed to detect significant change.  
- In 1978 and 1998, the same 256 CS squares were sampled; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, but not all measurements were made on all samples.  
- A rolling survey design is used to accumulate data over time and support national estimates when combined with appropriate analysis.

## Sample location and structure

- Soils are sampled from CS X-plots, with five X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square.  
- X-plots within a square are not replicates; they can represent very different land uses and soil types.  
- X-plots can be relocated across years if a plot is destroyed, access is denied, or certainty of location is uncertain. Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1), indicating square 2, repeat plot 1.  
- Samples from a location may come from the same site but are collected around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot, with approximate repositioning of ~2–3 m from the nominal location.

## Sampling methods

- Soils are sampled from the top 15 cm of the profile (8 cm for the invertebrate sample). In 1998, 2007, and the rolling survey (2018/2019–2023) a soil core is hammered in and pulled out; in 1978 a soil pit was dug to sample the top 15 cm.  
- In some soils, full 15 cm cannot be reached due to stones or shallow soils. Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were recorded in 2007 for some cores. The rolling CS method adopted for subsequent surveys.

## Measurements and data collected

- In 1978, laboratory measurements included pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).  
- From 1998 onward (1998, 2007, rolling survey 2018/19–2023), multiple cores per X-plot were taken, with different measurements per core; however, chemical analyses are not performed by soil horizons and samples are homogenised before pH and LOI measurements.  
- Bulk density was measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require a whole core). A full description and implications are provided in the Emmett et al. 2008 report.

## Statistical analysis and interpretation

- Analyses should account for the land class structure; ignoring land classes can yield stock and change of the population instead of national estimates. When land classes are included, results are weighted by land class to approximate national estimates.  
- Bootstrapping is not always employed; the CS design should be considered, and a mixed model with square as a random factor is recommended to accommodate multiple X-plots within each CS square.  
- Often only one core is taken per location; design-based approaches (where spatial structure is not of primary interest) use dispersed observations to increase regional precision and coverage for national estimates.  
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review published CS data that exploit the dataset (listed on the CS website).
