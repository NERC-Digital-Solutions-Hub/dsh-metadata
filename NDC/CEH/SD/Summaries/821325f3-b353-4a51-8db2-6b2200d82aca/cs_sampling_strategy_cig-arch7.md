# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the sampling framework used for Countryside Survey field components up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification developed over three decades to stratify GB ecological surveys.
  - Emphasizes continuity with earlier surveys and explains how concepts evolved to meet policy and regional needs.

- Key concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological variation.
  - ITE (Indicator Species Analysis) land classification used as the stratification system.
  - Field sampling units centered on 15 x 15 km grids, focusing on 1 km squares for detailed survey.
  - National estimates derived by combining per-square habitat areas with land-class area proportions.
  - Data products are map-based, supporting GIS analysis and change detection over time.

- The ITE Land Classification: origin and purpose
  - Began in the 1970s to classify land using environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate) rather than species alone.
  - Initial approach classified a subset of GB 1 km squares (center squares of a 15 x 15 km grid); surrounding squares were assigned to classes as well.
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to group areas into 32 Land Classes, later expanded and refined.

- Evolution by survey year
  - 1978: First GB ecological survey using 32 Land Classes from 1228 centre squares; eight samples per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984: Land-use focus; sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); maintained use of the 1978 Land Classification for national estimates.
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) extended classification to all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB; results used the updated, all-squares classification.
  - 1998: Revised Land Classification to support Scotland reporting; number of Land Classes increased to 40; total survey squares expanded to 569.
  - 2000: Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000) introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales; Scotland) and a refined sampling framework with country-unit versions of Land Classes; 40 strata reinterpreted as 40+ categories; additional upland modules considered.
  - 2007: Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007) implemented Wales-only reporting enhancements; added country-unit subdivisions (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45; Wales received targeted sampling (minimum 6 squares per Welsh class); upland habitat sampling expanded; England adjustments accounted for Welsh additions.

- Sampling framework details
  - Core sampling unit: 1 km square; centre squares defined within a 15 x 15 km grid; surrounding squares allocated to the same land-class framework.
  - Stratification approach: multiple determining factors beyond altitude to capture regional ecological differences; aims to reduce sampling bias and ensure representation of diverse land-use types.
  - Data outputs: Land Classes described by environmental characteristics; sampling distribution shown in class maps; national estimates computed per Land Class and extrapolated to the corresponding land-area.

- Separate country estimates and country-unit evolution
  - CS1990 used a GB-wide Land Classification extended to Scotland, England, Wales, and Isle of Man but treated country estimates as aggregates of class means.
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England with Wales; Scotland) with sub-division of classes and aggregation where necessary to ensure adequate representation per country.
  - Wales received explicit enhancements due to devolved governance needs; 43 additional Welsh squares were added to ensure robust Wales-only estimates; some English classes retained smaller sample counts.

- Upland module and statistical focus
  - CS2000 introduced an upland module to improve habitat estimates in uplands of England and Wales.
  - This module added 30 squares and targeted sampling in upland and marginal upland Land Classes.

- Data interpretation and national estimates
  - Historically, national estimates could be derived using either the latest (country-specific) Land Classification or the original 1990 classification for cross-survey consistency.
  - The report notes that changing the underlying classification affects the comparability of stock estimates; preference is given to the latest classification for consistency within a survey, while acknowledging cross-survey comparability challenges.

- Table and figure references (conceptual)
  - Figures illustrate Land Class maps across versions (original 1978; 1990 revision; 2000 country-unit maps; 2007 country-unit maps).
  - Tables summarize the numbers of squares surveyed per Land Class, per country, and across surveys, illustrating sampling rate changes (e.g., 1:x values) and strata distributions.

- Practical implications for GIS specialists
  - The sampling strategy provides a lineage of land-class layers that underpin time-series analyses and spatial change detection.
  - Class definitions and country-unit adjustments must be tracked to maintain comparability across surveys.
  - Outputs include class maps, sample square footprints, and per-class habitat estimates that can be joined with ancillary environmental layers (climate, geology, elevation) for GIS work.
  - Upland modules introduce additional, targeted datasets for higher-resolution analyses in upland areas.
