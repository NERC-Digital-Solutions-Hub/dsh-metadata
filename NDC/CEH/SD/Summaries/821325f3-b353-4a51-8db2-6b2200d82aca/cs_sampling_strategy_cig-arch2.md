# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework used by Countryside Survey up to 2007.
- Builds on three decades of development of the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative, time-series we can compare across surveys.
- Emphasises stratified, random sampling within environmental land classes, linkage to national estimates, and updates to accommodate country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) and upland habitats.
- Details data preparation, outputs (reports, maps, charts), and dataset management (storage and portal uploads).

## Core concepts and approach
- ITE Land Classification as the stratification framework:
  - Classifies land into discrete environmental types (32 original classes, later expanded).
  - Uses environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, land use, etc.) to create strata for sampling.
- Stratified random sampling to ensure representativeness and minimize bias:
  - Sampling units are 1 km squares (centre squares of a grid; later expanded with surrounding squares for classification).
  - Aims for enough samples per class to support robust national estimates.
- Time-series integrity:
  - Methodology is designed to maintain comparability across surveys, even as the Land Classification evolves.

## Evolution of the sampling framework by survey

- 1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to form 32 land classes from environmental data across 1 km squares.
  - Centre squares (1228 classified); surrounding four squares also classified.
  - Final stratified sample: 8 squares per class, total 256 squares.
  - National habitat area estimates derived from mean habitat area per class x land-class area.

- 1984 (Second GB Land Use Survey)
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (32 classes), including eight previously visited.
  - Total sample: 384 squares.
  - Results published later; continued use of the 1978 Land Classification as basis for national estimates.

- 1990 (CS1990 – All Squares Land Classification)
  - Land Classification revised to incorporate data from all 1 km squares in GB.
  - 508 squares surveyed; repeat vegetation quadrats from 1978; addition of Land Cover Map (from satellite imagery).
  - Results published in Countryside Survey 1990 main report.

- 1998 (CS1998 -> CS2000 – Revised Land Classification)
  - Land Classification extended to classify every square in GB; major components (climate, geology, physiography) used as surrogates for full detail.
  - CS2000 introduced separate country estimates (England & Wales vs. Scotland) due to policy reporting needs.
  - Adjustments included subsampling to reflect new classes; 40 strata created.
  - Additional modules and sample allocations ensured adequate representation across new classes.

- 2000 (CS2000 – Separate country estimates)
  - England & Wales, and Scotland estimates made from country-specific samples.
  - Class subdivisions and aggregations created to maintain representation by country; 19 extra squares added; more balanced sampling across new classes.
  - Upland habitat module introduced to improve estimates for upland regions.

- 2007 (CS2007 – Wales-focused reporting and Wales-only adjustments)
  - Wales required dedicated reporting; Welsh squares increased, but England samples adjusted to maintain precision.
  - New country-unit sub-divisions added (5 new Welsh classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) increasing strata to 45.
  - Additional Welsh squares (43) to ensure minimum representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares due to Wales-focused sampling.
  - Revised maps of Land Classes for England with Wales and Scotland; Wales becomes the most densely sampled country unit.

## The ITE Land Classification and class-level details
- Original development (1970s–1980s):
  - 32 Land Classes described by themes such as undulating country, lowland arable, coastal variants, moorlands, and mountainous regions.
- Evolution:
  - 1990: Land Classification updated to enable all GB squares to be classified; urban and sea corrections incorporated.
  - 1998–2000: Land Class count expanded (up to 40) and then further refined (to 45 with Wales-specific subdivisions) to support country-specific estimates.
- Practical implications:
  - Changes in classification affect consistency of national estimates; preference is to use the latest classification for within-survey consistency while noting cross-survey comparability concerns.
  - Figures and tables in the document illustrate land-class maps and sample-square distributions over time.

## Uplands and country-specific reporting
- Uplands module (CS2000): 30 additional squares placed in upland land classes to improve statistical accuracy for upland habitats in England and Wales.
- Wales-focused reporting (CS2007): introduction of country-unit land classes and additional Welsh samples to ensure Wales-specific habitat status and change information.

## Data handling, outputs, and accessibility
- Data lifecycle:
  - Data are collected, verified, quality assured, cleaned, and transformed to produce outputs such as habitat area estimates, change statistics, and land-class maps.
- Outputs:
  - Reports, maps, and charts that present environmental health and habitat status.
- Data management:
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals to enable continued access and secondary use.

## Implications for environmental monitoring and policy
- The sampling strategy provides a robust, time-series framework to monitor countryside habitats and land-use changes.
- The evolving Land Classification supports policy needs for country-specific reporting (England & Wales, Scotland) and upland habitat assessment, while maintaining a coherent basis for national estimates.
- Users should account for classification changes when comparing estimates across surveys; the document notes the trade-off between updating classifications for precision and maintaining cross-survey consistency.
