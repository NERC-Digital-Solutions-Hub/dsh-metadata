# Countryside Survey Soils 2007: Method development, power analyses and protocols

## Overview
- Describes long-term soil sampling methods used by Countryside Survey (CS) to monitor environmental condition and policy-relevant change.
- Covers sampling design, locations, sampling procedures, measurements, and statistical analysis decisions.
- Notes evolution to a rolling survey starting in 2019, with pilot in 2018, aiming to sample ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.
- Emphasizes data quality, standardised methods, and guidance on appropriate analysis; data archiving and accessibility through CS/UKCEH portals.

## Sampling design
- Historical scope: soils sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007 (and rolling 2018/2019–2023).
- In 1978 and 1998, the same 256 CS squares were sampled; in 2007, soils were collected from all 591 CS squares, with not all measurements on all samples.
- Power analyses conducted to determine sample sizes needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
- Rolling survey planning established in 2019 to measure about 100 squares per year for five years, then repeat.

## Sample location
- Sampling from CS X-plots; each CS square contains 5 randomly spaced X-plots.
- X-plots within a square are not replicates due to differing land uses, soils, etc.
- Some plots relocated over time due to destruction or access; each location has a unique repeat ID (e.g., 2RPT1), linking samples to a location rather than exact point coordinates.
- Within a sampling location, cores are taken near permanently marked 2 m x 2 m plots (approx. 2–3 m apart across plot corners).

## Sampling
- Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for invertebrate sample); methods evolved over years.
- 1998/2007 rolling survey used soil cores; 1978 used a soil pit in which the top 15 cm was sampled.
- In some soils, full 15 cm could not be collected due to stones or shallow soils.
- Core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were made in 2007 for selected cores (black cores and N mineralization cores).
- Rolling CS survey adopted the 15 cm core approach.

## Measurements
- 1978: pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) only.
- 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
- 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/2019–2023): multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements per core.
- No chemical analyses by horizons; samples homogenised before pH and LOI.
- Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (not using ISO bulk density method due to core constraints).
- Full methodological details and implications described in Emmett et al. 2008.

## Statistical analysis
- Analyses should account for statistical structure and land-class effects; ignoring land classes yields stock/change of the population rather than weighted national estimates.
- Bootstrapping not universally applied; CS structure should be considered in analyses.
- Recommend mixed models with square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
- Design-based approach: when spatial structure is not of interest, dispersed observations increase efficiency and regional coverage for national estimates.
- Users are advised to consult UKCEH before analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications available on the CS website.

## Data management and accessibility
- Emphasizes storing created datasets and uploading to appropriate portals; consult UKCEH guidance and CS website for data use and publications.
