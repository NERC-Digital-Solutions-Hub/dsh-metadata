# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and the anonymity of survey square locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Data and partners
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH).
- Confidentiality applies to square locations to protect sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Preserves sampling integrity and landowner consent, essential for future surveys and robust environmental policy guidance.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## Release circumstances and precision
- Approximate location: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify the 10 km grid containing each square.
- Precise location: six-digit grid references only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; UKCEH may perform pre-processing to avoid releasing locations externally.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry similar confidentiality considerations and may be released only under the same exceptional terms.

## Licensing conditions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store it securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences are finite, project-specific; data must be destroyed at the end of the licensing period.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If required, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same IP-confidentiality level as six-digit releases.
- License terms include a clause preventing attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and governance
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
- UKCEH provides annual reports detailing licence applications and decision grounds.
- For internal CS-partner use, reasonable pre-processing support is expected; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult with UKCEH before using data covered by this policy; this may involve collaborative or paid support, negotiated case-by-case.
- Decisions and approvals follow statutory Act/Regulations processes if access is denied.
