# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

- Aim: maximize the public value of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity; applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Programme and partners: 2018/2019–2024 rolling programme funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE; 2007 partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

 Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys and scientific integrity.
- Public interest justification; requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

 Under what circumstances locations may be released
- Approximate locations: four-digit grid references may be released under licence to identify which 10 km x 10 km grid square contains CS squares.
- Precise locations (six-digit grid references): only in very exceptional circumstances; UKCEH may carry out pre-processing to avoid release; otherwise, release requires demonstrating via legal terms that the external data carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
- Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps): treated like location data and released only under the same exceptional terms and licensing.
- Four-digit releases: licensed for specific projects with less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases and include safeguards to prevent locating exact squares.

 Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are finite in time and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
- No third-party dissemination that could reveal square locations; no use to plan visits or monitor landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the higher IP confidentiality standards of six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise square locations from the data.

 Responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows Act and Regulations procedures and supports the decision.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decision grounds.
- To support practical use, UKCEH may pre-process data for CS partners within reasonable timescales; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential users are advised to consult with UKCEH before using data covered by this policy; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
