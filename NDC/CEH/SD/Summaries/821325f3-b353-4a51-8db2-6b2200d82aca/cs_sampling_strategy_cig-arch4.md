# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007)

- The document describes the evolution of the Countryside Survey’s field sampling strategy and the ITE Land Classification it uses as the stratification framework, tracing developments from 1978 to 2007 and explaining how these changes affect sampling design, country-level reporting, and data consistency.

## Key concepts and purpose

- The sampling framework is built on stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across Great Britain.
- The ITE Land Classification groups land into discrete classes based on environmental attributes, serving as the basis for sampling strata and for estimating national and regional habitat and land-use features.
- Over time, classifications were revised to better support country-specific reporting (England, Wales, Scotland) and to improve precision for upland habitats and other policy-relevant units.
- Data quality considerations include how changes in classification affect consistency of national estimates and decisions about which classification to use for different survey periods.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification and sampling framework

- Early concept (pre-1978) and the importance of stratification to obtain representative samples of ecological variation.
- Original Land Classification (mid-1970s):
  - 1 km squares used as sampling units.
  - 32 Land Classes created by classifying centre squares (1228 classified; plus surrounding squares for a total of 6039).
  - 8 samples per class, total of 256 squares, surveyed for vegetation and soils.
- Countryside Survey 1984:
  - Sampling increased to 12 squares per class (total 384).
  - Framework still based on the 1978 Land Classification; results published later.
- Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990):
  - Land Classification revised to cover all 1 km squares in GB (more comprehensive, with urban/sea corrections).
  - 508 squares surveyed; repetition of 1984 quadrats; inclusion of a Land Cover Map from satellite imagery.
  - Resulted in a transition from the original grid-based approach to a broader all-squares framework.
- Developments leading to CS1990 and beyond:
  - Recognition that GB-wide classification needed to be extended to classify every square, with surrogates for climatic/geologic factors when full data were not feasible.
  - Comparisons between the original 1228-square classification and new attempts showed 62% exact correspondence, with most misclassifications staying within neighboring classes; overall class means were preserved.
- Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000):
  - Introduced separate country estimates (England+Wales vs Scotland) due to devolved policy needs.
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (creating 40 strata) and aggregated where necessary to maintain representation.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes; upland habitat sampling module added to improve precision for upland estimates.
  - Wales received more intensive sampling to support Wales-only reporting; adjustments in England followed to maintain comparability.
- Welsh-only reporting and CS2007:
  - Wales required independent Welsh reporting; adjustments included new country-unit subdivisions (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and an expanded 45 strata framework.
  - Wales gained additional squares to ensure minimum representation in new Welsh classes; England adjustments were made to maintain overall balance.
  - The England, Wales, Scotland sampling maps and class distributions were updated to reflect these changes.

## Summary of survey steps and country-specific adaptations

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey):
  - 32 classes from 1228 centre squares; 8 squares per class (256 total) surveyed.
  - National habitat estimates produced by combining mean habitat area per square with the area of each Land Class.
- CS1984 (Second Field Survey):
  - 12 squares per class (384 total); continued use of the 1978 classification for national estimates.
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification and Third Field Survey):
  - Land Classification updated to include all GB squares; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Inclusion of a Land Cover Map; repeat of 1984 quadrats; urban and sea corrections applied.
  - National estimates calculated using the 1990 classification (with some square-class changes observed).
- CS2000 (Revised Land Classification and Fourth Field Survey):
  - Introduction of separate country estimates (England+Wales vs Scotland) with country-specific class subdivisions (40 strata).
  - 19 additional squares added to ensure representation of new classes; 11 additional squares to balance England and Wales.
  - A dedicated upland habitat module was added to improve upland estimate precision.
- CS2007 (Revised Land Classification and Fifth Field Survey):
  - Wales-only reporting requirement led to Wales-focused sampling adjustments (5 new Welsh sub-classes; total 45 strata).
  - Additional Welsh squares added (minimum of 6 per Welsh class); two Welsh classes in England retained with 4 squares per class due to relative precision considerations.
  - Wales received increased sampling intensity to support country-specific reporting, with updates to the England/Scotland framework accordingly.

## Data quality, reporting, and national estimates

- National estimates can be produced using either the latest country-specific Land Classification or the original 1990 classification; the 2006 scoping study favored using the latest country-specific classification for consistency within a country, while a single cross-survey approach favored consistency across surveys.
- Table 4 (not reproduced here) shows how sample sizes vary under the original 1990 classification versus the updated classifications, highlighting the impact of classification changes on cross-period comparability.

- Timeline recap (core developments):
  - 1978: Initial Land Classification with 32 classes; 8 squares per class.
  - 1984: 12 squares per class; framework expanded but based on 1978 classification for national estimates.
  - 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; national estimates aligned with revised classification.
  - 1998/CS2000: Separate country estimates introduced; 40 classes; upland module added; more squares to ensure representation.
  - 2007/CS2007: Wales-specific reporting formalized; 45 strata; enhanced Welsh representation and class subdivisions; upland survey considerations embedded.
