# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
- Aims to maximise public benefit from CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Funded by NERC for the 2018/2019–2024 rolling program; 2007 partners include UKCEH, Defra, NE, WG, SG, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Confidentiality rationale
- Locations are confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing permission to survey land.
- Confidentiality considered to be in the public interest; requests are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under applicable law.

## When and how locations may be released (and precision levels)
- General access allows determining if survey squares fall within predefined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km grid) may be released under licence when approximate location suffices.
- Six-digit grid references are only released in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external requests must show high-level IP confidentiality that cannot be processed by UKCEH.
- Spatial data within squares (maps of habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional release terms as six-digit locations.
- Licences for four-digit references prohibit attempts to identify precise square locations.

## Conditions of release (licensing terms)
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate purpose.
- Licences are finite in duration and project-specific; data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- End of licence: written confirmation that data remained secure and has been destroyed.
- No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to prove project management standards equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have lighter IP safeguards than six-digit releases; users must not attempt to infer precise locations.

## Licensing governance and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
- License approvals/denials governed by the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations; appeals/justifications provided.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- For practical workflow, UKCEH may perform pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- It is recommended that potential data users consult with UKCEH before committing to use CS location data; involvement may be collaborative or paid, negotiated case-by-case.
- Internal CS partnership processes aim to be responsive to reasonable pre-processing needs to support practical use.

## Practical implications for Data Stewards
- Enforce confidential access controls, licensing, and retention/destruction requirements.
- Maintain metadata documenting data sensitivity, licensing terms, and period of access.
- Coordinate with UKCEH and NERC for governance, approvals, and annual reporting.
- Guide data creators/sharers on permissible data releases and required safeguards.
- Facilitate pre-processing analysis where feasible to avoid unnecessary releases while supporting legitimate research needs.

## Stakeholders and contacts
- Primary authorities: UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) and CS partners.
- Data users: organisations requesting licence for four-digit or six-digit location data under the defined terms.
- Oversight: annual reporting by UKCEH; case-by-case handling for non-partner requests.
