# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Aims to maximise public interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and site anonymity.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.
- Rolling program 2018/2019–2024 funded by NERC (award NE/R016429/1) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability.

## Confidentiality rationale and stakeholders
- 2007 CS partners include UKCEH (as part of NERC), Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.
- Locations kept confidential to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, essential for survey integrity, environment protection, and future landowner permission.
- Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

## When and how locations may be released
- Data access can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10 km x 10 km) may be released under licence.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require UKCEH to perform pre-processing analysis to avoid release; only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances with legal demonstration that comparable IP data carries equal/higher confidentiality.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps, linear features) could identify a square and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit data.

## Licence terms and restrictions
- Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with a legitimate project need.
- Licences are for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at end of license.
- No data or derived outputs may be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
- Four-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the same level of IP confidentiality as six-digit releases; license clauses still prohibit attempts to pinpoint exact square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, makes decisions on exceptional releases.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences for four-digit, six-digit, and spatial data, with clauses reflecting policy; licences require sign-off by a senior authorized representative of the licensee.
- If approval is denied, decisions follow FOI/EP Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and rationale.
- Moderate-demand internal pre-processing support may be provided to CS partners; external requests handled case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly advised to consult UKCEH before committing to work with CS location data; collaboration or payment arrangements may be negotiated case-by-case.

## Implications for GIS work
- Enables map-based analyses at a coarse 10 km scale (four-digit references) while preserving confidentiality for precise locations.
- Requires adherence to licence terms, including secure handling, restricted access, and destruction after projects.
- For finer-resolution needs, involve UKCEH early to explore permissible pre-processing or exceptional-access paths.
