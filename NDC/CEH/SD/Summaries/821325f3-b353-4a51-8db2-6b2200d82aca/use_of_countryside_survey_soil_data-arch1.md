# Sampling design

- Overview
  - Countryside Survey soils were sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019. The sampling scope varied: 256 squares in 1978/1998, 591 CS squares in 2007, and a rolling survey beginning in 2019 aiming to measure about 100 squares per year for five years before repeating. A pilot occurred in 2018.
- Sample location
  - Soils are taken from CS X-plots, with 5 X-plots randomly spaced within each CS square. X-plots are not replicates due to differing land uses, soil types, etc. Some plots are relocated over time due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty in original locations. Each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1) indicating square, repeat plot, and that repeat plot; samples from the same identifier come from the same location, though exact sampling points may be 2–3 m apart.
- Sampling
  - Depth: top 15 cm of soil (8 cm for the invertebrate sample). 1998, 2007, and rolling survey used core samples; 1978 used a soil pit. Full 15 cm depth can be impeded by stones or shallow soils. In 2007, core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken for two of the four cores.
- Measurements
  - 1978: laboratory measurements limited to pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI).
  - 1998, 2007, and rolling survey (2018/19–2023): multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements; samples homogenised before pH and LOI measurements. Bulk density was measured in 2007 and again in 2018/19–2023, but not using ISO bulk density methods (which would require an entire core).
- Analysis considerations
  - Statistical analyses should account for CS structure. Without incorporating land class structure, results reflect stock and change of the population; with land-class weighting, results become national estimates of stock and change.
  - Bootstrapping is not consistently used; a mixed model with square as a random factor is advised to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
  - For design-based approaches where spatial structure is not of primary interest, a dispersed set of observations can improve overall precision and regional coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH before analysis and to review CS publications listed on the CS website.
