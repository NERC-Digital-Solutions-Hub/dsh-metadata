# Sampling design

- Aims and timeline
  - Countryside Survey soils sampled in 1978, 1998, 2007, and 2019 to monitor changes over time.
  - Early years used fixed sampling frames (1978/1998: same 256 squares; 2007: all 591 CS squares with varying measurements).
  - Power analyses conducted to determine sample sizes needed to detect significant change (Emmett et al. 2008).
  - Pilot survey in 2018; rolling survey from 2019 aiming to measure ~100 squares per year for five years before repeating.

- Sample locations and structure
  - Sampling from CS X-plots, with 5 plots per CS square.
  - X-plots within a square are not replicates and may differ in land use or soil type.
  - Plots can be relocated due to destruction, access issues, or uncertainty, but each location has a unique repeat identifier (e.g., 2RPT1).
  - Same location is intended to be revisited across years; within-square sampling points are about 2–3 meters apart around a permanently marked 2 m × 2 m plot.

- Sampling depth and methods
  - Soils collected from the top 15 cm (8 cm for the invertebrate sample) in 1998, 2007, and the rolling survey 2018/2019–2023.
  - 1998/2007/rolling surveys used a hammered soil core; 1978 used a soil pit to access the top 15 cm.
  - Some cores were not fully 15 cm due to stones or shallow soils; core photographs and measurements of core dimensions were taken in 2007 for some cores.

- Measurements and lab analyses
  - 1978: only pH and loss-on-ignition (LOI) measured.
  - 1990: some soil mapping conducted.
  - 1998/2007 rolling survey: multiple cores per X-plot with different measurements across cores; no chemical analyses by horizons; samples homogenised before pH/LOI.
  - Bulk density measured in 2007 and 2018/19–2023 (not via ISO bulk density method).
  - Detailed methodology and implications documented in Emmett et al. 2008; a full methods description is available.

- Data analysis and interpretation
  - Analyses should account for land class structure; ignoring land class structure yields stock/change of the population, whereas accounting yields national estimates weighted by land classes.
  - Bootstrapping not always used; the CS structure should be considered, with at least a mixed model using square as a random factor to account for multiple X-plots within each CS square.
  - Design-based approach: when spatial structure is not of interest, a dispersed set of observations improves overall precision and regional coverage.
  - Users are advised to consult UKCEH prior to analysis and interpretation and to review CS publications listed on the CS website.
