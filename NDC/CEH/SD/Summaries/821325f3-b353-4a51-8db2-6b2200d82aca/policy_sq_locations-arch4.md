# Policy of the Countryside Survey (CS) partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of survey sites.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Rationale, governance, and background
- CS squares are confidential to preserve representativeness of sampling and landowner goodwill, essential for future surveys, environmental integrity, and permission from landowners.
- Requests for information are handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC and the CS partners under the UK Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004.
- 2018/2019–2024 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability); 2007 partners include NERC, UKCEH, Defra, NE, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, FC, CCW, SNH.

## Release and precision levels
- Location data can be released at varying precision:
  - Four-digit grid references (identifying the 10 km x 10 km grid square) may be released under licence when approximate location is valuable.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations) require that pre-processing analysis be performed by UKCEH to avoid direct release; exceptionally, locations may be released externally under licence only if the requester proves in legal terms that their data/models carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality and are subject to the same exceptional-release terms as six-digit location data.
- In all cases, approximate releases must not enable precise location derivation.

## Conditions of release (licence terms)
- Licensees must preserve confidentiality, store data securely, and restrict access to authorised individuals.
- Licences are finite, for specific projects, and data must not be retained beyond the licence period.
- Upon licence expiry, licencees must confirm data destruction in writing.
- No data or derived information should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; if in doubt, consult UKCEH.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees may need to show project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have similar licensing terms but do not require the higher IP-protection criteria of six-digit releases; a clause prevents attempts to derive precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses; approvals are signed by a senior authority from the licensee organisation.
- If approval is denied, UKCEH follows statutory procedures under the Act and Regulations.
- UKCEH provides CS partners with an annual report detailing applications and decision rationales.
- To practicalise usage, UKCEH aims to support internal pre-processing for CS partners within reasonable timeframes; external requests are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult with UKCEH before committing to CS location data usage; collaboration or guidance from a UKCEH science lead may be appropriate, with negotiation on involvement or payment on a case-by-case basis.
