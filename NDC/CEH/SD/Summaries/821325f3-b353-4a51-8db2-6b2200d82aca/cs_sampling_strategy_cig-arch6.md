# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212 Revised by C.M.Wood CEH Lancaster, Library Avenue, Bailrigg, Lancaster. LA1 4AP September 2011

- Purpose and scope
  - Documents the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) 2007 and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification used to stratify GB sampling.
  - Emphasises that current methodology is built on three decades of prior work and remains connected to earlier time-series data.

- Core concepts
  - Stratified, random sampling to ensure representative coverage of ecological and land-use variation.
  - ITE Land Classification: environmental attributes (e.g., altitude, geology, climate) drive classification of land into discrete classes, forming the basis for strata.
  - Sampling targets: proportional representation of classes to support national and country-level estimates; enabling regional and local analyses.

- Development timeline and key changes
  - The Beginning (early 1970s)
    - Move from local to national ecological sampling using stratification to reduce bias.
  - The first Land Classification system (mid- to late-1970s)
    - 1 km square sampling unit; 1228 classified centre squares with 4 surrounding squares attributed by ISA (Indicator Species Analysis); 32 land classes described by environmental means.
    - 256 samples (8 squares per class) for the 1978 national survey.
  - 1984: Second field survey (land use focus)
    - 12 squares per land class (total 384); framework based on 1978 classification; highlights for national estimates’ precision.
  - 1990: Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) and all-squares Land Classification
    - All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; linkage to first Land Cover Map of GB.
    - Maintained a consistent framework but incorporated urban/sea corrections; initial expansion toward national-level estimates.
  - Developments leading to CS2000
    - Recognition that some land classes were under-represented after extending classification to all GB squares.
    - Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) by sub-dividing classes and adjusting sampling to improve country-specific accuracy.
    - 40 strata (vs. 32) and additional squares to ensure representative coverage, plus upland habitat sampling module.
  - CS2000: separate country estimates and uplands module
    - Sub-divided land classes into country-unit versions (England+Wales; Scotland).
    - Aggregations where a country had few squares in a class to maintain representation.
    - 19 additional squares to ensure adequate representation of new classes; 11 further squares to balance England and Wales sampling rates.
    - Uplands module added 30 squares for better Wales/England upland estimates.
  - CS2007: Welsh-only reporting and further refinements
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to additional Welsh class subdivisions (5 new Welsh-specific classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Total strata increased to 45; 43 extra Welsh squares added to ensure minimum representation; some English classes reduced to 4 squares per class, deemed acceptable for English estimates.
    - England, Wales, and Scotland mapping updated to reflect revised land classes and country-specific sampling frames.

- Data outputs and estimation approach
  - National estimates
    - Calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
  - Country estimates
    - Derived from squares within each country unit (England+Wales; Scotland) using the country-specific Land Classes.
  - Comparability and consistency
    - Notes that changing the land classification can affect national estimates; CS uses the latest classification for internal consistency, but the original 1990 classification may be used for cross-survey comparability when needed.
  - Tables and figures
    - Tables summarize the number of squares surveyed per class and per survey (CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) and the sampling rates.
    - Figures map the Land Classification maps and the distribution of sample squares across the UK.

- National and international context and outputs
  - The document situates CS sampling within a long history of ecological and land-use classification work in Great Britain.
  - Output emphasis includes habitat status and change information for policy and environmental management, with country-specific reporting aligned to devolved governance (England, Wales, Scotland).
