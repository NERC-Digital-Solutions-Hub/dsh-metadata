# Experimental design overview and collection methods:

- Study purpose and scope
  - Data represent abundances of invertebrates collected from pitfall traps within eight FADOE rings subjected to diesel exhaust, ozone, or both pollutants over two summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019).
  - Full experimental layout and system configuration described in Ryalls et al. 2022 Environmental Pollution 297:118847.

- Experimental setup
  - Eight 8 m-diameter rings arranged in an octagonal formation within a field of wheat, with at least 30 m between rings.
  - Rings fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, both, or natural air (control) during the two seasons.
  - Rings moved to an adjacent wheat field after the 2018 season and resown in November 2018 for the 2019 sampling.

- Sampling and collection details
  - Invertebrates collected from pitfall traps in September 2018 and September 2019 (locations: lat/long provided for each year).
  - Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol with detergent to reduce surface tension; samples filtered through mesh by two field researchers before transfer to 50 mL centrifuge tubes.
  - Samples stored at -20 °C prior to classification.

- Data structure and variables
  - Taxonomic identification: highest taxonomic resolution possible, recorded as 'Taxon' (Column A) with corresponding abundances as 'Abundance' (Column B).
  - Temporal and experimental metadata:
    - 'Year' (Column C)
    - 'Run' (Column D): two sampling runs per year, each lasting one week
  - Spatial/experimental identifiers:
    - 'Ring' (Column E): ring number
    - 'Treatment' (Column F): D (diesel), O (ozone), D+O (diesel and ozone), CON (control)
    - 'Trap' (Column G): six traps per run, distributed within each ring
  - Taxonomic context:
    - 'OrderOrClass' (Column H): order or class of the invertebrate
    - 'Function' (Column I): functional group or feeding guild for each taxon

- Data handling and processing
  - Invertebrates classified under a microscope to the highest achievable taxonomic resolution.
  - Abundance data linked to specific run, trap, ring, and treatment for downstream analyses.
  - Detailed provenance noted (ring movements between fields, sampling locations) to support data traceability.

- Considerations for data governance and reuse
  - Metadata should capture exact ring, trap layout, treatment assignments, sampling dates, and storage conditions to enable discovery and reuse.
  - Reference to full methodology and layout in Ryalls et al. (2022) for comprehensive context and reproducibility.
