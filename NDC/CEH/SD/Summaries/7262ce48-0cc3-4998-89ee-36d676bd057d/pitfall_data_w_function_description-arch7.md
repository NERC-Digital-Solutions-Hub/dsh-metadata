# Experimental design overview and collection methods:

## Overview
- Invertebrate abundances were collected from pitfall traps within eight Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
- Rings were fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, or both pollutants during two full summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019).
- Sampling occurred in September 2018 (location: 51.482853, -0.897749) and September 2019 (location: 51.482374, -0.895855) after moving rings to an adjacent wheat field in November 2018.
- Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol with detergent; samples were filtered and stored in -20 °C prior to classification.

## Experimental design and layout
- 8 rings, each 8 m in diameter, arranged in an octagonal formation within a wheat field, with at least 30 m between rings.
- Each ring assigned to one of four treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O), diesel exhaust + ozone (D+O), and control (CON; natural air).
- Two rings were assigned to each treatment, totaling four rings per year across the eight rings.
- Within each ring, six traps per run were dug and evenly distributed.
- Sampling runs: two per year, each run lasting one week.

## Data structure and fields (GIS-relevant columns)
- Taxon (Taxon): highest taxonomic resolution attainable.
- Abundance (Abundance): count of individuals per taxon.
- Year (Year): 2018 or 2019.
- Run (Run): first or second sampling per year.
- Ring (Ring): ring identifier.
- Treatment (Treatment): D, O, D+O, or CON.
- Trap (Trap): trap number (1–6) within each run.
- OrderOrClass (OrderOrClass): taxonomic order or class.
- Function (Function): functional group or feeding guild.

## Spatial and temporal details for GIS
- Spatial context: rings arranged in an octagon with specified spacing; sampling locations mapped to given latitude/longitude coordinates for each year.
- Temporal context: two yearly sampling events (Sept 2018 and Sept 2019) across two growing seasons with two runs per year.

## Data handling and collection procedures
- Field collection: pitfall traps opened twice per year, each run lasting one week.
- Specimen processing: invertebrates classified under a microscope to the highest taxonomic resolution possible.
- Sample preservation: post-collection processing involved filtering and freezing at -20 °C prior to taxonomic classification.
