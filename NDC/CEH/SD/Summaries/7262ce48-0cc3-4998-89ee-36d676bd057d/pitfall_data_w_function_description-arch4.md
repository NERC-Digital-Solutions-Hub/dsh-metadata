# Experimental design overview and collection methods

## Overview
- Data describe abundances of invertebrates from pitfall traps within eight FADOE rings.
- Rings were fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, or both during two summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019).
- Full methodological details correspond to Ryalls et al. 2022 Environmental Pollution 297:118847.

## Experimental layout
- Eight 8 m-diameter rings arranged in an octagonal formation within a wheat field, with at least 30 m between rings.
- Rings were moved to an adjacent wheat field after the 2018 sampling, sown November 2018, with the second year of collections in September 2019.
- Each ring assigned a number; two rings per pollution treatment: diesel (D), ozone (O), diesel + ozone (D+O), and control (CON).

## Data collection methods
- Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol and detergent to reduce surface tension.
- Samples filtered through mesh, collected into 50 mL tubes, and stored at -20 °C prior to classification.
- Sampling occurred in September of each year (2018 and 2019).

## Data structure and variables
- Taxon (highest taxonomic resolution possible) recorded as Taxon (Column A) with Abundance (Column B).
- Year (Column C) and Run (Column D) captured for each sampling event.
- Ring (Column E) identifies the ring; Treatment (Column F) indicates D, O, D+O, or CON.
- Trap (Column G) denotes one of six traps per run within each ring.
- OrderOrClass (Column H) and Function (Column I) provide taxonomic order/class information and feeding guild.

## Location and sampling specifics
- Sampling occurred in two years at defined field coordinates (latitude/longitude provided for each sampling episode).
- Six traps per run were dug and evenly distributed within each ring.

## Data quality and provenance
- Specimens classified under a microscope to the finest practical taxonomic resolution; detailed metadata and structure described with the dataset.
- Data linked to the broader experimental design and layout described in the cited publication for full context.
