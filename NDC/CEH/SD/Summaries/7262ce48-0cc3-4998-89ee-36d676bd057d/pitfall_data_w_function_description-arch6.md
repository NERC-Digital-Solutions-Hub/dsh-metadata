# Experimental design overview and collection methods:

## Overview
- Data on abundances of invertebrates collected from pitfall traps within eight Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
- Rings were fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, or both pollutants during two full summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019).
- Field layout: eight 8 m-diameter rings in an octagonal formation within a wheat field, separated by at least 30 metres.
- Sampling occurred in September 2018 in the initial field; rings were moved to an adjacent wheat field (sown November 2018) for the second year (September 2019).

## Experimental setup and field methods
- Each FADOE ring assigned a number; two rings per treatment (diesel exhaust D, ozone O, diesel+ozone D+O, and control CON) across four treatments.
- Six traps per run were dug within each ring and evenly distributed.
- Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol with detergent to reduce surface tension; samples were filtered and collected in 50 mL tubes, then stored at -20 °C prior to classification.
- Sampling runs occurred twice per year, each run lasting one week.

## Data structure and variables
- Taxon (highest taxonomic resolution achieved) recorded as Taxon (Column A).
- Abundance of each Taxon (Column B).
- Year (Column C): 2018 or 2019.
- Run (Column D): sampling session within a year.
- Ring (Column E): ring identifier.
- Treatment (Column F): D, O, D+O, or CON.
- Trap (Column G): six traps per run within each ring.
- OrderOrClass (Column H): taxonomic order or class.
- Function (Column I): functional group or feeding guild.
- Geographic coordinates recorded for sampling points in September 2018 and 2019.

## Timeline and data scope
- Two collection years: 2018 and 2019, with sampling conducted in September each year following preparatory summer environments.
