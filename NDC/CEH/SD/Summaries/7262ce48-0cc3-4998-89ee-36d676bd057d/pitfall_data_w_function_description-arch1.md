# Experimental design overview and collection methods:

- Purpose and study context
  - Quantify abundances of invertebrates collected from pitfall traps in eight Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
  - Rings were fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, or both, plus a control (natural air) across two summer seasons.
  - Full layout details are described in Ryalls et al. 2022 Environmental Pollution 297:118847.

- Experimental design
  - Ring setup: eight 8 m-diameter rings arranged in an octagonal formation within a wheat field, with at least 30 m between rings.
  - Pollution treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O), diesel exhaust + ozone (D+O), and control (CON).
  - Temporal aspect: rings moved to an adjacent wheat field for the second year (November 2018 sowing; September 2019 sampling).
  - Sampling periods: two full summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019) with sampling in September of each year.

- Data collection and sample processing
  - Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol plus detergent; contents filtered through mesh, collected into 50 mL tubes, then frozen at −20 °C prior to classification.
  - Fieldwork conducted by two researchers; samples classified under a microscope to the highest possible taxonomic resolution.

- Data structure and variables (as recorded)
  - Taxon (A): taxonomic label for each organism identified.
  - Abundance (B): count of individuals per Taxon.
  - Year (C): 2018 or 2019.
  - Run (D): two sampling runs per year, each lasting one week.
  - Ring (E): ring identifier (1–8).
  - Treatment (F): D, O, D+O, or CON.
  - Trap (G): six traps per run within each ring.
  - OrderOrClass (H): taxonomic order or class classification.
  - Function (I): functional feeding guild for each Taxon.

- Geographic and metadata details
  - Sampling locations: September 2018 at latitude 51.482853, longitude -0.897749; September 2019 at latitude 51.482374, longitude -0.895855.
  - Full methodological details provided in referenced study.
