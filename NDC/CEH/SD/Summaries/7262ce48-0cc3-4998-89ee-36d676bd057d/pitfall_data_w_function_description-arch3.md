# Experimental design overview and collection methods:

- Study aim and setup
  - Invertebrate abundances collected from pitfall traps within eight Free-Air Diesel and Ozone Enrichment (FADOE) rings.
  - Rings fumigated with diesel exhaust, ozone, or both pollutants during two summer seasons (April–October 2018 and 2019).
  - Rings arranged in an octagonal formation within a wheat field, with at least 30 m between rings.
  - Each year, rings were relocated to an adjacent wheat field (new location sown November 2018) for the second year of sampling.

- Treatments and replication
  - Four pollution treatments: diesel exhaust (D), ozone (O), diesel exhaust and ozone combined (D+O), and control (CON; natural air).
  - Two rings assigned to each treatment, totaling eight rings.

- Sampling protocol
  - Pitfall traps contained 500 mL of 20% propylene glycol with detergent to reduce surface tension.
  - Samples collected in 50 mL tubes, filtered, and stored at -20 °C prior to classification.
  - Sampling occurred in September 2018 and September 2019 (two field campaigns per year).

- Data collection and structure
  - Invertebrates identified to the highest possible taxonomic resolution (Taxon).
  - Abundance recorded per Taxon (Abundance).
  - Metadata dimensions:
    - Year (2018 or 2019)
    - Run (two collection periods per year; one week each)
    - Ring (identifier for each of the eight rings)
    - Treatment (D, O, D+O, CON)
    - Trap (six traps per run within each ring)
  - Taxonomic and functional data captured:
    - OrderOrClass (taxonomic order or class)
    - Function (functional group or feeding guild)

- Data structure and documentation
  - Data organized into columns: Taxon (A), Abundance (B), Year (C), Run (D), Ring (E), Treatment (F), Trap (G), OrderOrClass (H), Function (I).
  - Full experimental layout and system configuration are detailed in Ryalls et al. 2022 (Environmental Pollution 297:118847).

- Relevance to monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates integration of experimental design with systematic data collection to inform environmental health monitoring.
  - Highlights importance of clearly defined metadata (treatment, year, run, ring, trap, taxon, function) for data usability and comparability.
  - Illustrates data handling steps (collection, filtration, storage, taxonomic classification) that affect data quality and reproducibility.
  - Emphasizes the need for transparent documentation of methods to support data governance and potential data sharing.
