# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

## Overview
- A field manual for woodland classification and habitat surveying intended to yield map-based data products for GIS and related analyses.
- Documents a standardized workflow to describe sites, plots, habitats, flora, soils, and management.
- Each survey covers a site with 16 sampling plots, plus site-level habitat descriptions; data are designed for long-term storage and punching into databases.

## Key Data Products for GIS
- Site-level habitat and land-use descriptions (Site Description and Habitats Form).
- Plot-level attributes (Plot Description and Habitats Form) including slope, aspect, vegetation attributes, and micro-habitat details.
- Ground flora presence/absence data across multiple quadrat sizes with cover estimates, plus bryophyte collections.
- Tree, sapling, and shrub measurements (DBH, height, species, spatially distributed by plot quarters).
- Soil profile data (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis, horizon descriptions, horizon depths, underlying material) with standardized horizon codes.
- Marginal land use and boundary types to support landscape-scale classification.
- Management indicators (planted vs. natural regeneration, coppicing, stumps, brashing/pruning) to aid historical land-use mapping.
- Rich metadata for data quality and provenance (plot and site codes, recorder initials, dates, etc.).

## Sampling Design and Location
- Site layout: each site contains 16 ground-truth plots arranged around a center point; nested square plotting with five progressively larger quadrats culminating in a 14.14 m × 14.14 m plot (200 m²).
- Sampling points (1–16) are marked on a 22" site map; location is determined using pre-defined control points, map bearing, and pace-based ground-out procedures.
- Two critical goals in point-location:
  - Accuracy within about 20 meters of the true point.
  - Minimization of subjective bias in point selection and walking path.

## Data Collection Workflow
- Four main data streams per plot (with two sets of samples per site):
  a) Ground flora: presence/absence for five increasing quadrats; percent cover/abundance estimates for the largest quadrat; comprehensive bryophyte collection (noting that bryophytes are recorded as a whole plot rather than by sub-quadrat size).
  b) Trees, saplings, and shrubs: DBH for stems >5 cm (trees); saplings and shrubs recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); height of the largest tree measured; dead trees noted.
  c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined habitat attributes; slope and aspect measured; ground-profile sketch and a topographic description.
  d) Soil data: small pit to the top 25–30 cm, plus a screw auger for deeper horizons; composite topsoil sample (top 10–15 cm); horizon-by-horizon soil description using a standardized horizon scheme (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C/underlying material) with targeted attributes (pH, LOI, mechanical analysis, texture, color, structure, moisture, etc.).
- Site Description and Habitats Form: a separate, comprehensive form for the entire site, capturing landscape-scale attributes and margins (L, M) and boundary types.
- Reference materials: Appendices provide herbarium procedures, examples of completed forms, plot and site description instructions, soil data collection guidance, and equipment checklists.

## Soil Data and Interpretation
- Practical approach due to scale: measure a limited set of physical/chemical properties (pH, loss on ignition, coarse mechanical analysis) and describe soils using horizon-based attributes.
- Horizon framework:
  - Aoo (organic litter), Ao (organic-mineral mix), Ai/A1 (leached/eluviated horizons), A2 (leached/ eluviated), B1/B2 (deposition and weathered mineral layers), C/Underlying Material.
  - Emphasis on horizon depth, color, texture, structure, moisture, and horizon transitions.
  - Special notes on gleying, podzolic processes, and calcareous soils (including parent material and potential mosaic with podzolic types).
- Documentation targets: depth to horizon boundaries (using from-to measurements), horizon-specific attributes (texture, color, structure, moisture), presence of organic layers, deposition layers, underlying material, and any evidence of disturbance or disturbances in profile (ploughing, erosion, etc.).

## Data Quality, Standards, and Workflow Hygiene
- Early testing and iteration are encouraged for prototypes; emphasis on unbiased, repeatable data collection.
- Clear separation of site-level and plot-level data to prevent data ambiguity; ensure site and plot numbers are consistently recorded.
- Public and landowner relations are considered important; consent and access procedures should be managed tactfully; if permission cannot be obtained, alternatives are provided.
- Data packaging guidance: complete data sheets, label and bag specimens/samples, staple sheets together, and ship in pre-labeled boxes with careful weight limits.

## Practical Outputs for GIS Specialists
- A structured, hierarchical dataset linking:
  - Site-level habitat and land-use categories.
  - Plot-level physical attributes (slope, aspect, topography) and habitat codes.
  - Species occurrences with presence/absence and, where possible, abundance estimates across multiple plot scales.
  - Tree and shrub census data (DBH, height, species) with spatially explicit notes (quarters) to support biomass or structure mapping.
  - Soil horizons and basic soil properties across plots to enable soil-type mapping and pedological interpretation.
  - Management history indicators to support historical land-use mapping.
  - Boundaries and marginal land-use descriptors for landscape-scale GIS delineations.
- The forms and coding scheme (site and plot attribute codes) are designed to facilitate data punching into GIS-ready databases and subsequent spatial analyses.

## Equipment and Documentation
- Comprehensive field kit: plotting equipment (center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes, measuring tools, soil auger, mattock, trowel, and herbarium materials.
- Documentation: site and plot recording forms, herbarium sheets, and soil data sheets, plus appendices with detailed instructions and example forms.

## End Notes
- The handbook provides a complete, transferable methodology for woodland classification surveys, emphasizing map-based data outputs suitable for GIS, rigorous sampling design, standardized data capture, and a strong emphasis on data quality and practical field constraints.
