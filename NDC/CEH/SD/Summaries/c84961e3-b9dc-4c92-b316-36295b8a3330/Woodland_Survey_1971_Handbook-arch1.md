# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- A practical guide for surveying woodland sites to classify habitats, describe plant and soil communities, and support ecological analysis through standardized data collection.

## Purpose and Scope

- Establish a systematic, replicable method to survey woods, record ground flora, trees, saplings, shrubs, soil profiles, and site habitats.
- Produce data suitable for analysis of correlations, patterns, and potential management implications across many sites (e.g., 1648 plots referenced in the methodology).
- Emphasize data quality, compatibility, and the ability to share and reuse datasets with clear metadata.

## Survey Design and Access

- Pre-survey planning: prepare an outline plan to minimize travel and accommodate access constraints; use multiple sites from a common base when possible.
- Permissions: obtain entry permissions; follow regional instructions; if permission is refused, switch to backup sites provided by Merlewood.
- Public relations: explain purpose to landowners; assure that surveys are not about compulsory purchase; maintain goodwill to facilitate access.
- Site information: receive advanced site information indicating responsibility for permission; adapt to special access rules as needed.
- Handling restricted sites: if access is blocked, use Merlewood-provided information and proceed with backups.

## Sampling Layout and Point Localization

- Site mapping: use road maps and 22" site maps to locate survey sites; determine access points to minimize walking distance.
- Sampling points: each site contains 16 ground-sampling points (marked on the 22" map).
- Location accuracy and bias: objective is locating points within a 20 m radius of the true position; use a control point on the ground, orient maps with compass, and pace out the distance to the sample point.
- Ground-truthing without bias: select control points that minimize subjective bias; do not deviate from predetermined pacing directions.

## Data Collection: Structure and Order

- Recording sequence per site:
  - (a) Ground flora: presence/absence of species in five progressively larger quadrats; estimate percent cover for the largest quadrat.
  - (b) Trees, saplings, shrubs: diameter at breast height (DBH) for all stems >5 cm; height of the tallest tree; saplings and shrubs measured in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) of the plot.
  - (c) Plot description and habitats: presence/absence of defined habitat attributes; documentation of slope, aspect, and topography.
  - (d) Soil data: small pit and auger borings at plot center; composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm) collected; soil data recorded.
- Ordering note: ground flora data should be collected first to avoid disturbance; trees/saplings and soil data follow; plot descriptions and site descriptions accompany the data collection.

## Plot Layout and Recording Details

- Plot design: center point with a random orientation mechanism; four corner poles define successive plots expanding from 2 x 2 m up to larger areas; distance strings and markers indicate half-diagonal measurements for subsequent plots.
- Quadrat sizes: start with a small 2 x 2 m plot and progressively enlarge to cover larger areas, ending with a full 14.14 x 14.14 m plot (approximately 200 m2); corner pegs move outward to delineate each larger plot.
- Data collection within plots:
  - Ground flora: record presence/absence of all vascular plants and bryophytes; collect bryophyte specimens for herbarium (complete bryophyte sampling is focused on vegetation on the soil; bryophytes on tree bases, logs, rocks, or habitats are noted but not fully enumerated as bryophytes per se).
  - Ground flora cover: estimate percent cover for each species in the full plot; code for office use to support later data entry.
  - Trees, saplings, shrubs: record species and DBH for stems >5 cm; diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) are used for saplings and shrubs; height of the tallest tree is recorded.
  - Plot description and habitats: record slope, aspect, and a ground-profile sketch; capture dominant habitat attributes and their spatial distribution within the plot.
  - Soil data: collect from a center pit and adjacent auger borings; obtain a composite topsoil sample (10–15 cm); record depth, horizon characteristics, and associated soil properties.
- Finalization: after completing all data and samples for a site, re-check forms, bag and label samples, and prepare for shipment.

## Ground Flora, Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs: Data Details

- Ground flora (2 x 2 m to full plot):
  - Record presence/absence of species in five quadrat sizes; estimate cover/abundance for the largest quadrat.
  - Collect bryophyte specimens separately as a comprehensive herbarium collection.
- Trees, saplings, shrubs:
  - Trees: record species and DBH for stems >5 cm; treat dead trees or dead stems with a distinct designation.
  - Saplings and shrubs: record in diagonally opposite quarters; same data as trees (species, DBH for stems; height for saplings as applicable).
  - Height: measure the height of the largest tree in the plot (use appropriate height instrument).
- Plot descriptions and habitats:
  - Record a range of attributes (e.g., slope, aspect, ground features, microhabitats) using predefined attribute codes (see Appendix IV for definitions).
  - Include a site-specific sketch of the ground profile along the maximum slope line.

## Site Description and Habitats

- A separate, comprehensive Site Description and Habitats form is completed for each site.
- The form records larger-scale landscape features, site management history, and habitat mosaics that are not fully captured by individual plots.
- Attributes are organized with code numbers to facilitate data handling and cross-form consistency (site form and plot form use related but distinct code series).

## Soil Data: Sampling, Description, and Interpretation

- Rationale: survey-scale soil data (1648 plots) requires a limited, consistent set of measurements plus a numerical soil description to support analysis.
- Field measurements:
  - pH and loss on ignition.
  - Mechanical analysis: a simplified assessment of sand/silt/clay fractions.
  - Retention of sub-samples for potential future analyses.
- Soil profile interpretation (horizons):
  - Ao (organic litter layer) and Al (leached organic-mineral mix) horizons descriptions.
  - A2 horizon (eluviated layer) and B horizon (deposition and weathered mineral layer, subdivided into Bl and B2).
  - C horizon (underlying material) when visible.
- Data entry: horizon-by-horizon forms capture depth (from-to in cm), horizon thickness, color, texture, structure, moisture, and presence of deposition or gleying; document transitions between horizons and any unusual or disturbed profiles.
- Practical notes:
  - If a horizon is not present, mark as not applicable.
  - Where auger depth is limited, indicate the depth reached and bracket notes for underlying material.
  - Use a standardized language and codes to ensure consistent interpretation across analysts.

## Habitat and Vegetation Coding

- The instrument includes extensive coding for habitats, vegetation structure, and plant communities (e.g., forest types, clearings, glades, rocky knolls, hedges, streams, ponds, etc.).
- Includes categories for marginal land use, boundary types, and human-made features (walls, embankments, quarry/relic sites, etc.).
- Subcategories cover forest management histories (planted hardwoods, coppice, pollards, stumps new/old, etc.), and vegetation strata (groves, bramble, nettle, grasses, ferns, etc.).
- The forms provide codified options for birds, mammals, and other fauna signs, enabling integrated ecological interpretation.

## Data Handling, Quality Assurance, and Documentation

- Data integrity: ensure that all site and plot numbers are recorded at the top of each form; verify completeness before shipment.
- Equipment and sample handling: check that all equipment is logged back, samples are properly labeled, and soil/bryophyte samples are boxed and labeled according to site/plot.
- Documentation: the handbooks include Appendices with example forms (Appendix II–VI), herbarium instructions, and an equipment list to standardize field procedures.
- Metadata and reuse: data are designed to be discoverable and usable with metadata and standardized codes; practitioners are encouraged to upload datasets with sufficient documentation.

## Equipment and Logistics

- Field kit includes: plot marking equipment (center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, measuring tapes (30 m and other scales), tapes for plotting, calipers, hypsometer, labels, and sample bags.
- Field sheets, herbarium sheets, and labeling materials; apparatus for soil sampling (mattock, trowel, auger) and sample transport.
- A structured workflow supports returning equipment and samples, verifying completeness, and packaging up for shipment.

## Appendices and Examples

- Appendix I: Instructions for collecting herbarium specimens.
- Appendix II–V: Examples of completed ground flora, tree/sapling/shrub forms, plot/site description forms, and soil data forms.
- Appendix VI: Equipment checklists.
- The document provides sample field sheets and a grid for cross-referencing site, plot, and habitat information to facilitate data punching and subsequent analyses.

## Implications for Data Analysts

- Provides a richly structured, standardized dataset capturing flora, trees, soils, and habitats across woodland sites.
- Enables correlations between ground flora, woody vegetation structure, soil properties, and habitat types at multiple scales (plot and site).
- Designed to support predictive modelling and landscape-level ecological interpretation, with careful attention to data quality, provenance, and metadata.

- Note: The handbook is dense with procedural detail and field coding. Successful data analysis relies on consistent adherence to the sampling layout, recording rules, horizon interpretation, and coding schemes outlined in the appendices.
