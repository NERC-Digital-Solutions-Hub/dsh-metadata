# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardized woodland survey methodology for classifying woodland types and documenting habitats.
  - Records for each site include ground flora, trees/saplings, plot/descriptions of habitats, soil data, and site-level context.
  - Outputs designed for data analysis and later data punching into a unified dataset; robust herbarium specimens required for species verification.

- Survey design and access
  - Each site uses a predefined plan with permission to access obtained prior to surveying; if permission is denied, back-up sites are used.
  - Information about sites provided in advance; if access is restricted, follow back-up instructions.
  - Efficient fieldwork emphasizes minimizing travel and using existing tracks; avoid disturbing surrounding landowners.
  - Determination of access points to minimize walking distance; navigation relies on 22" site maps with 16 sampling points per site.
  - Locating sampling points aims for accuracy within ~20 meters, using a fixed control point, map orientation, and predetermined paces.

- Sampling framework: sites, plots, and quadrats
  - Each site comprises multiple plots organized on a 14.14 m x 14.14 m grid; sampling points are defined on the site map.
  - For each site: 16 plots are surveyed; each plot contains four nested quadrats:
    - 2 x 2 m (4 m2)
    - 5 x 5 m (25 m2)
    - 10 x 10 m (100 m2)
    - 14.14 x 14.14 m (200 m2)
  - The survey progresses from ground flora to trees/saplings, then to plot description and soils, with flexibility in order to suit field conditions.

- Data collection and recording: per-plot data
  - Ground Flora (within each plot):
    - Record presence/absence of vascular plants and bryophytes across the quadrats, with a full bryophyte collection from the complete plot.
    - Provide percent cover or abundance estimates for the largest quadrat; total cover should approximate 100% with multi-layered vegetation considered.
    - Herbarium specimens collected for unidentified or rare species; use field codes for later data punching.
  - Trees, Saplings, and Shrubs:
    - Trees: all stems >5 cm DBH within the full plot; record species, DBH, and height; note dead trees.
    - Saplings and shrubs: recorded in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3) with similar measurements; also record height where applicable.
    - The tallest tree measured with a height instrument; tallest within the plot used if multiple are present.
  - Plot Description and Habitats:
    - Presence/absence of habitat attributes (slopes, aspects, microhabitats, etc.) with detailed definitions in Appendix.
    - Include a ground-profile sketch along the line of maximum slope and a narrative in the comments.
  - Soil Data:
    - Collect soil from a central pit and auger borings; create a composite top 10–15 cm sample.
    - Limited set of soil properties to enable large-scale data collection:
      - pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay), and other basic measurements.
    - Use a standardized workflow to interpret horizons (A0, A1, A2, B1, B2, C) with horizon-specific attributes (e.g., colour, texture, structure, moisture).
    - If depth is beyond auger reach, note and bracket accordingly; retain sub-samples for future analyses.
  - Site Completion for each plot:
    - Ensure all forms are complete and correctly labeled; check samples in and equipment accounted for.
    - Additional site-level data captured on a separate Site Description and Habitats form.

- Site Description and Habitats
  - A comprehensive Site Description and Habitats form captures site-scale context and attributes, enabling cross-plot interpretation.
  - Plot-level attributes are harmonized with site-level attributes via code sequences; consistency between Site and Plot forms is checked.

- Herbarium collection
  - Each site team leader must prepare and submit a herbarium collection to demonstrate accuracy of species records.
  - Obtain type specimens for all species in quadrats; collect flowering material when possible and label specimens clearly with field codes.
  - If in doubt, collect a specimen and classify later; maintain comprehensive labeling to avoid data loss.

- Soil data analysis and interpretation (Appendix)
  - A limited, scalable soil data approach combines physical/chemical measurements with a numerical soil description system.
  - Major woodland soil types in Britain include Podzols (and related podzolic soils) and calcareous soils; soil interpretation emphasizes horizon development (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) and horizon properties.
  - Practical procedures for horizon delineation, texture, colour, structure, moisture, and rock content are provided to guide field and subsequent laboratory work.
  - The profile interpretation supports classification of soil types within the context of woodland habitats and site management.

- Equipment and field logistics
  - Field equipment: plotting set (center pole, right-angle gauge, corner poles, distance strings), compasses, tapes, markers, herbarium supplies, auger and mattock, soil sampling bags, labels, insect repellent, and posting materials.
  - Site-specific packing: four cardboard boxes per site for soil and bryophyte samples; ensure secure labeling and weight limits; pre-paid postage labels supplied for sample shipment.

- Access, permissions, and data governance
  - Emphasizes courteous, clear communication with landowners; respect privacy and land use concerns.
  - If permission cannot be obtained, deploy back-up sites and inform the Merlewood organization to provide necessary data (maps, sampling points, etc.).

- Data integrity and workflow
  - The methodology emphasizes minimizing subjective bias in locating sampling points and maintaining consistent data collection across all plots.
  - A structured flowchart and layout for ground flora quadrats guide fieldwork and ensure repeatability.
  - Data are designed to feed into a central database with standardized coding (Site, Plot, Attribute codes) to enable robust analysis and comparability across sites.

- End-to-end process
  - Prepare an outline survey plan and obtain permissions.
  - Visit site and determine optimal access points.
  - Locate 16 sampling points with unbiased methods within 20 m accuracy.
  - Collect data and specimens for ground flora, trees/saplings, plot descriptors, and soils in the specified order.
  - Complete Site Description and Habitats forms for the site, and per-plot Site/Plot forms.
  - Bundle, label, and ship field data, herbarium specimens, and soil samples using the provided packaging and labels.
