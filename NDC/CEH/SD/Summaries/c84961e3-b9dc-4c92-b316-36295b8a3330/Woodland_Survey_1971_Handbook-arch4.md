# NAIIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICAIIDN 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized field method for national woodland classification.
  - Collects four data sets per plot (ground flora, trees/saplings/shrubs, plot description/habitats, soil data) plus site-level data for each site.
  - Typical survey structure: 16 plots per site, each plot 2x2 m up to 14x14 m, total of 1648 plots described across sites; includes herbarium specimens and extensive appendices.

- Access, permissions, and stakeholder relations
  - Emphasizes obtaining permission to survey each site; guidance on engaging landowners tactfully.
  - Highlights public relations as a key Conservancy activity; if access is refused, back-up sites are used.
  - Provides procedure to manage access when ownership is unclear, and stresses advance coordination with Merlewood Regional Office.

- Survey design and planning
  - Pre-survey outline to minimize travel and exploit nearby base locations.
  - Use of road and site maps to locate sampling points; plan routes and base points to reduce disturbance to owners and to optimize efficiency.
  - Equipment and maps supplied ahead of fieldwork; a check-list is provided (Appendix VI).

- Locating sampling points and data accuracy
  - Each site’s 22" (scale) map marks 16 sampling points.
  - Aim: locate points within a 20 m radius of true location; minimize subjective bias in point selection.
  - Detailed step-by-step method to identify a control point, align map/compass, measure, and pace out distances, including slope adjustments and fixed pacing rules.

- Data recording sequence and structure
  - Data collected in a defined order to minimize site disturbance: ground flora first, then trees/saplings/shrubs, then plot/habitat description, then soil data (order can be adjusted if necessary).
  - Four separate recording forms per point, plus two soil samples per point; a flowchart (Figure 1) defines responsibility for data capture.

- Ground flora (2x2 m to 14x14 m quadrats)
  - Record presence/absence and percent cover for vascular plants across five quadrat sizes, plus bryophyte collection from the full plot.
  - Spiral outward search from the smallest to largest quadrat; identify species (codes provided) and collect specimens for herbarium.
  - Bryophytes not recorded in the 2x2 m quadrat; comprehensive vascular plant list with herbarium sampling emphasized for accuracy.

- Trees, saplings, and shrubs
  - Trees: all stems >5 cm diameter within the full plot; record species, diameter at breast height, and live/dead status; measure height of the largest tree.
  - Saplings (height >50 cm but < breast height) and shrubs: recorded only in diagonally opposite quarters (1 and 3); same measurement conventions as trees.
  - Handling of multi-stemmed individuals and coppice indicators; notations for dead/stump conditions.

- Plot description and habitats
  - Record plot-level attributes (slope, aspect, etc.) and a detailed habitat description.
  - Include a ground-profile sketch and a comments column for additional observations.
  - Definitions and criteria for attribute presence are provided in Appendix IV.

- Site description and habitats (per site)
  - A separate, descriptive form captures site-wide features and habitats, including in-between-plot areas.
  - Uses a separate code system to enable integrated data handling with plot-level data.

- Completion and data handling
  - After completing all forms (site and plots), sheets are stapled, labeled, and packed into three boxes per site (soil samples in three boxes; bryophytes/field sheets in the fourth).
  - Boxes are sealed, labeled, and shipped by post; aim to minimize transport burden and preserve samples.
  - Includes cross-checks to ensure no omissions and to verify site/plot numbering.

- Herbarium collection and specimen handling
  - Requires a high-standard herbarium collection with type specimens for all species observed.
  - Field-named identities must be clearly tied to herbarium specimens; specimens are stored with proper labeling and documentation.
  - Emphasizes consistency and avoiding misidentification to ensure data reliability.

- Soil data collection and interpretation (Appendix_VI guidance)
  - Due to scale (1648 plots), only a limited set of soil measurements are taken in the field.
  - Core measurements: pH, loss on ignition, and mechanical analysis (sand/silt/clay); sub-samples preserved for potential later analyses.
  - Soil description uses horizon-based interpretation (Ao, Al, A2, B1, B2, C) to capture pedological processes.
  - Defines major British woodland soil types (podzolic, brown earths, calcareous/podzols) and explains factors driving soil development (climate, drainage, base status, vegetation, time).
  - Provides a structured, horizon-by-horizon method for recording soil profiles, including color, texture, structure, moisture, horizon boundaries, and underlying material.
  - Emphasizes dynamic, immature soils and the possibility of transitional profiles; notes the potential for gleying, iron deposition, and peat formation in hydromorphic conditions.

- Equipment, forms, and data standards
  - Enumerates field equipment and two main data-holding kits (Plot marking equipment, Haversacks, site bag, labels, sample bags, etc.).
  - Field forms include site/plot description, habitat classifications, and a comprehensive code list for consistent data entry.
  - Appendices provide examples of completed forms and instructions for completing site, plot, and soil forms; instructions for herbarium collection (Appendix I) and soil interpretation (Appendix IV, V).

- Data governance implications for Data Leaders
  - Demonstrates a comprehensive, prescriptive approach to data standardization, capture, and quality control in a large-scale field program.
  - Highlights the importance of: standardized forms, clear coding schemes, bias-minimizing sampling procedures, robust metadata (site, plot, date, recorder, equipment), and specimen-based verification (herbarium).
  - Provides a model for data governance: explicit data capture workflows, validation checks, backup procedures, and end-to-end data packaging for distribution and archival.
  - Addresses data access/permission considerations, data provenance, and cross-site consistency—relevant to building coordinated data systems across networks of partners.

- Appendices and references
  - Appendix I: Herbarium collection instructions.
  - Appendix II–VI: Examples of forms, soil methods, and equipment checklists.
  - Flow charts and example forms included to illustrate practical data capture and organization.

- Key takeaways for data strategy
  - A rigorous, scale-appropriate framework for systematic woodland classification and habitat/soil data collection.
  - Emphasis on data quality, traceability, and reproducibility through standardized procedures and documentation.
  - A proven approach for handling large field datasets with multi-layered data (flora, fauna, soil, habitat) and associated specimen data.
