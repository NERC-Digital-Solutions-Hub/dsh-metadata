# NATIONAL WOODLANDS CLASSIFICATION 1971 HANDBOOK OF FIELD METHODS

- Purpose and scope
  - Provides a standardized, repeatable field methodology to survey woodlands and classify environmental conditions for monitoring environmental health and policy performance over time.
  - Aims to produce comparable data formats (site, plot, habitat, soil, flora, fauna) that can be audited and compared across time and sites.

- Who uses it and how
  - Field teams verify, quality assure, clean, and transform data from established sources.
  - Outputs include presence/absence, abundance estimates, habitat descriptions, and soil profiles; data are stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

- Planning, permissions, and access
  - Prepare an operations plan to minimise travel and coordinate access with regional staff.
  - Obtain permission from landowners/occupants; use tact and public relations to facilitate access.
  - Provide owners with a brief description of the survey purpose and address concerns; have backup sites ready if access is refused.
  - Maintain clear communications to avoid misinterpretation that surveys aim to purchase or alter ownership.

- Survey design and site access
  - Sites are located using road maps and required site maps; determine the best access points to minimise walking distance while respecting boundaries.
  - Each site uses a 22" map with 16 sampling points; points are located with careful attention to accuracy and reduced subjective bias.
  - Locate sampling points with a procedure: identify a nearby control point, orient the map, measure bearing (correct for magnetic variation), pace out the distance, and mark the point precisely.

- Data collection framework (per sampling point)
  - Four data sets plus two samples per point, collected in a preferred order to minimise disturbance:
    - Ground flora: presence/absence in five quadrat sizes (from 2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m) with percent cover and abundance estimates; collect bryophytes as a comprehensive plant sample from the plot; collect herbarium specimens as required.
    - Trees, saplings, and shrubs: measure tree stems >5 cm DBH in all four plot quarters; record saplings and shrubs in diagonally opposite quarters; note dead trees/stems; record the tallest tree height.
    - Plot description and habitats: record habitat attributes (slope, aspect, etc.) and other plot-level characteristics; include a sketch of ground profile for the maximum slope line.
    - Soil data: extract samples from the centre, dig a small pit to expose the top 25–30 cm, and use an auger to reach deeper horizons; collect a composite top 10–15 cm sample; record horizon boundaries and basic soil characteristics.

- Data recording and workflow details
  - Data collection order recommended: ground flora first (to limit trampling effects), followed by trees/saplings/shrubs, soil data, and finally plot descriptors.
  - Plot layout: a centre post, right-angle gauge, corner poles, and distance markers delineate nested quadrats (2x2 m up to 14.14x14.14 m).
  - Data sheets and forms: standardized forms for ground flora, trees/saplings, plot description/habitat, soil data, and site description/habitat; ensure consistent coding (Appendices provide codes and examples).
  - Specimens and identification: collect herbarium specimens for all observed species when possible; label with codes and verify identifications with an herbarium.

- Site and plot documentation
  - Site Description and Habitats form: documents site-wide attributes and habitat types; used to capture 16 plots’ site-level context.
  - Plot Description and Habitats form: reduced version focusing on plot-level attributes; attributes share a sequential coding scheme with the site form to facilitate data integration.
  - Post-survey handling: staple forms, bag and box packing, label correctly, and dispatch promptly (pre-paid labels supplied).

- Soil science and interpretation (overview)
  - A pragmatic approach to soil data: limited set of physical/chemical measurements (pH, loss on ignition, mechanical analysis) plus a numerical soil description using horizon-based attributes.
  - Conceptual soil types in Britain: Podzolic soils (acid, leached, often podzolic horizons) and calcareous soils (base-rich, alkaline), with transitions to hydromorphic and skeletal soils depending on drainage and parent material.
  - Horizon interpretation framework: using labeled horizons (Ao, Al, A2, B1/B2, C, underlying material) to describe organic matter, leaching, deposition, texture, color, moisture, and structure.
  - Practical notes: auger depth typically up to 70 cm; if horizons extend beyond reach, bracket measurements accordingly; record the depth to underlying material and sample horizon boundaries with depth (cm).

- Data quality, storage, and reuse
  - Emphasises accuracy and avoidance of subjective bias in point localization; bias is minimized through predetermined mechanical locating procedures.
  - Data should be comprehensive, correct, and ready for long-term storage; data are intended to be reused and shared, enabling cross-site and temporal comparisons.
  - Documentation and back-up procedures are highlighted (checklists, equipment tracking, and post-survey organization).

- Appendices and field tools
  - Appendices provide: herbarium collection instructions, examples of completed forms, plotting layouts, soil data forms, and equipment checklists.
  - Equipment inventory includes two field haversacks, plotting gear, measurement tools, soil sampling gear, labels, maps, and packing supplies.

- Relevance to Analysts Monitoring the Environment
  - Delivers a robust, standardized data framework for environmental monitoring programs.
  - Focuses on data provenance, QA, and the ability to compare across sites and over time.
  - Encourages data accessibility and sharing by structuring outputs and providing explicit data handling and storage steps.
