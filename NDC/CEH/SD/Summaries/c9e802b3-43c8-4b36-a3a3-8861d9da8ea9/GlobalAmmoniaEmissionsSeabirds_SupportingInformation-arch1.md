# Ammonia Global Emissions from Seabirds (AGES) version 1

## Overview
- Global estimates of ammonia (NH3) emissions from seabird colonies.
- Includes three emission scenarios to reflect different temperature dependencies.

## Emission Scenarios
- Scenario 1: Emission factors based on mid-latitude measurements applied globally; emissions independent of colony temperature.
- Scenario 2: Emission factors based on thermodynamic temperature dependence (temperature at seabird colonies) using Henry's Law and dissociation equilibria.
- Scenario 3 (best estimate): Limited temperature dependence; mean of Scenarios 1 and 2.

## Data Characteristics
- Spatial resolution: 0.1 degree latitude/longitude grid cells.
- Units: Mg NH3 per grid cell per year.
- Data precision: rounded to 2 significant figures.

## Publication and Citation
- Data should be cited with the publication: S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless and M. A. Sutton (2012) The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies. Atmospheric Environment (in press) DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052

## Use and Interpretation for Analysts
- Facilitates sensitivity analyses by comparing emissions under different temperature-dependence assumptions.
- Useful for informing models of global NH3 emissions and potential downstream effects on atmospheric processes.

## Accessibility and Provenance
- Version 1 dataset; must cite the associated publication when using the data.
