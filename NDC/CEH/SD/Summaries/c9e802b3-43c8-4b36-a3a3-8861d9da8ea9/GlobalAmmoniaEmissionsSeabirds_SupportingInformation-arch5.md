# Ammonia Global Emissions from Seabirds (AGES) version 1

## Overview
- Global NH3 emissions estimates from seabird colonies.
- Three scenarios describing emission factors and temperature dependence.
- Spatial resolution: 0.1 degree (lat/lon); units: Mg NH3 per grid cell per year; data rounded to 2 significant figures.
- Version 1; annual emissions per grid cell.
- Must cite the related publication when using the data.

## Data content and scenario details
- Scenario 1: Emission factors based on mid-latitude measurements applied across all areas, independent of colony temperature.
- Scenario 2: Emission factors with thermodynamic temperature dependence (dependent on temperature at seabird colonies; uses Henry’s Law and dissociation equilibria).
- Scenario 3: Best estimate; limited temperature dependence (mean of Scenarios 1 and 2).

## Provenance and methodology
- Emissions are produced for three defined scenarios to capture temperature dependence effects.
- Best estimate (Scenario 3) combines the approaches from Scenarios 1 and 2.

## Metadata and documentation requirements
- Documentation should include: scenario definitions, spatial resolution (0.1°), unit (Mg NH3 gridcell-1 year-1), annual time frame, rounding to 2 sig figs, and provenance of methods.
- Publication to be cited: S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless and M. A. Sutton (2012) The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies. Atmospheric Environment (in press) DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052.

## Data governance, sharing, and updates
- Upload to relevant data portals and catalogue data holdings.
- Document lineage: methodology, assumptions, and any transformations performed (quality assurance, cleaning, etc.).
- Track data availability, potential embargoes, and update mechanisms for new versions.

## Quality assurance and data handling
- Authors/curators should QA, clean, and transform data before sharing.
- Ensure consistency in metadata across scenarios and clear linkage to the publication.

## Practical considerations for data stewards
- Ensure complete representation of user needs across scenarios and provide clear guidance on scenario selection.
- Manage interoperability across datasets (consistent grid, units, and time aggregation).
- Prepare for updates or new versions with robust versioning and archival practices.
- Explicitly document and communicate any limitations or caveats related to the three scenarios.
