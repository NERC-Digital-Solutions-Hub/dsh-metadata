# Ammonia Global Emissions from Seabirds (AGES) version 1

## Overview
- Provides estimates of ammonia (NH3) emissions from seabird colonies worldwide.
- Emissions are presented under three distinct scenarios to capture different temperature dependencies and uncertainties.
- Spatially explicit data at fine resolution for global monitoring.

## Scenarios and Methodology
- Scenario 1: Emission factors based on mid-latitude measurements applied globally; emissions independent of temperature at seabird colonies.
- Scenario 2: Emission factors that depend on thermodynamic temperature at seabird colonies, using Henry's Law and dissociation equilibria.
- Scenario 3 (best estimate): Limited temperature dependence, defined as the mean of Scenarios 1 and 2.

## Spatial and Temporal Resolution
- Spatial resolution: 0.1 degree by 0.1 degree grid cells.
- Temporal aspect: Emissions presented as annual values per grid cell (Mg NH3 gridcell-1 year-1).

## Data Details
- Units: Mg NH3 per grid cell per year.
- Data precision: Values rounded to 2 significant figures.
- Grid-based format suitable for mapping and regional/global analyses.

## Publication and Citation
- Any use of the data must quote the publication:
  S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless and M. A. Sutton (2012) The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies. Atmospheric Environment (in press) DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052

## Implications for Environmental Monitoring
- Provides standardized, comparable NH3 emission estimates suitable for integration with other environmental datasets.
- Useful for assessing policy performance and environmental health trends when combined with seabird distributions, climate data, and other emissions data.
- Facilitates cross-scenario comparisons to understand uncertainties in seabird-associated NH3 emissions.

## Notes for Use
- Version 1 indicates an initial dataset; users should consider updating with future iterations as more data or methods become available.
- Encouraged to store and share underlying data and metadata to enable reuse and verification, aligning with common monitoring practices.
