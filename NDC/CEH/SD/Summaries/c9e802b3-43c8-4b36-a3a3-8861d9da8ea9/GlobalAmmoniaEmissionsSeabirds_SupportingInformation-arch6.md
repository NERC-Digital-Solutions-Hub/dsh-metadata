# Ammonia Global Emissions from Seabirds (AGES) version 1

## Data summary
- NH3 (ammonia) emissions estimates for seabird colonies across three scenarios.
- Spatial resolution: 0.1 degree latitude/longitude grid.
- Emissions reported as Mg NH3 per grid cell per year.
- Data values rounded to two significant figures.
- Scenario 3 is the best estimate, representing limited temperature dependence by taking the mean of Scenarios 1 and 2.

## Data details
- Scenario 1: Emission factors based on mid-latitude measurements applied globally; independent of local colony temperature.
- Scenario 2: Emission factors depend on thermodynamic temperature at seabird colonies; uses temperature dependence via Henry's Law and dissociation equilibria.
- Scenario 3: Best estimate; combines Scenarios 1 and 2 by averaging.
- Publication context: The dataset is described in the paper titled “The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies” by S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless, and M. A. Sutton (2012), published in Atmospheric Environment (in press), DOI: 10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052.

## Citation and usage
- Any use of the data must quote the associated publication: S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless and M. A. Sutton (2012) The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies. Atmospheric Environment (in press) DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052.

## Notes and considerations for data use
- The data are organized on a uniform 0.1-degree grid and provided per grid cell per year.
- The best-estimate emissions (Scenario 3) reflect a balance between temperature-insensitive and temperature-dependent approaches.
- Users should ensure proper attribution to the cited publication when incorporating the data into analyses or products.
