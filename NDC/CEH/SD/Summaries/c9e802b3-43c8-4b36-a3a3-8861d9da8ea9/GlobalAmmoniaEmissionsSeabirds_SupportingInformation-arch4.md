# Ammonia Global Emissions from Seabirds (AGES) version 1

## Overview
- Provides NH3 emissions estimates from seabird colonies under three emission-scenario approaches.
- Data are designed to support understanding of global seabird-related ammonia outputs and their sensitivity to temperature dependence.

## Data content and structure
- Spatial resolution: 0.1 degree latitude/longitude grid cells.
- Units: Mg NH3 per grid cell per year.
- Data values are rounded to two significant figures.

## Emission scenarios
- Scenario 1: Emission factors based on mid-latitude measurements applied globally, independent of colony temperature.
- Scenario 2: Emission factors that depend on temperature at seabird colonies, incorporating thermodynamic temperature dependence using Henry's Law and dissociation equilibria.
- Scenario 3: Best estimate; limited temperature dependence, calculated as the mean of Scenarios 1 and 2.

## Metadata, usage, and citation
- Any use of the data requires citation of the related publication.
- Publication to be cited: S. N. Riddick, U. Dragosits, T. D. Blackall, F. Daunt, S. Wanless and M. A. Sutton (2012) The global distribution of ammonia emissions from seabird colonies. Atmospheric Environment (in press) DOI:10.1016/j.atmosenv.2012.02.052

## Data quality and stewardship considerations
- Multiple scenarios provide sensitivity analysis and help assess uncertainty due to temperature effects.
- Versioning noted as version 1; future updates may exist to reflect new data or methods.
- Emphasizes the need for clear metadata and provenance to support discoverability and correct attribution.

## Relevance for Data Leaders
- Demonstrates an explicit, multi-scenario approach to environmental emissions data, encouraging evaluation of how factors like temperature influence results.
- Highlights the importance of rigorous citation, metadata quality, and documentation to enable reuse across teams and networks.
- Illustrates how high-resolution, gridded environmental data can be integrated into broader data strategies for policy, ecology, and atmospheric studies.
