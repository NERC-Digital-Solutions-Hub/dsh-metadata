# Topographic change dataset for the Antamok River catchment, Itogon, Philippines during Typhoon Mangkhut (2018) using r.avaflow v2.4

## Overview
- Collection performed through numerical simulations using the free software r.avaflow, v2.4.
- Generates maps of topographic change for the Antamok River catchment in Itogon, Philippines, during Typhoon Mangkhut in 2018.

## Data captured
- Change of topography indicating deposition (positive values) and erosion (negative values).
- Units are metres.

## Validation / Quality control
- Data checked against observed channel widening limits using remote sensing observations before and after the Typhoon event.
