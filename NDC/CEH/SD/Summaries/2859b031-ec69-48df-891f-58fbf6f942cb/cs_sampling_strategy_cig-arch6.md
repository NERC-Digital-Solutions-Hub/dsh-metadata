# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey (up to 2007) Revised and Updated from: 'The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey', C.J. Barr, September 1998. DETR CONTRACT No. CR0212

## Overview
- Describes the field survey sampling framework and the evolution of the ITE Land Classification up to Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007).
- Links ecological sampling to a stratified land-class framework to enable robust national and country-specific estimates.
- Emphasises the need to understand changes over time and to maintain compatibility with earlier time-series data.

## Core concepts: Stratification and sampling design
- Use of stratified random sampling to avoid bias and ensure representativeness across ecological variation.
- Stratification is based on the ITE Land Classification, which groups land by environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.).
- Sample units are 1 km squares; central square is classified and surrounded by four adjacent squares to reflect local variability.
- National estimates are derived from class means multiplied by class area; enabling comparability over time.

## Evolution of the ITE Land Classification
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 32 classes created from environmental data; basis for a national stratified survey.
- 1984: Sampling expanded to 384 squares (12 per class).
- 1990: All GB 1 km squares classified; Land Classification revised to reflect broader dataset; 508 squares surveyed; introduction of Land Cover Map linkage from satellite data.
- 1998: Land Classification expanded to 40 classes to improve regional and local estimations.
- 2000 (CS2000): Land Classes subdivided to enable separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); 40 to 45 strata; added 19–43 additional squares; upland module introduced to improve upland habitat estimates.
- 2007 (CS2007): Wales-specific reporting formalised; further subdivision into country-unit classes (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45; additional Welsh squares required for balance; some English classes retained with fewer squares to manage resources.

## Survey framework by era: sample sizes and country focus
- 1978 CS: 256 squares total (8 per Land Class); foundational stratified sampling.
- 1984 CS: 384 squares (12 per class).
- 1990 CS: 508 squares; all GB squares classified; added urban/sea corrections; Land Cover Map linkage established.
- 2000 CS2000: 569 total sample squares across GB (England, Wales, Scotland); introduction of separate country estimates and upland sampling; 40 strata expanded to 40+.
- 2007 CS2007: 591 total GB squares; England 288, Wales 107, Scotland 196; 45 strata with Wales-specific sub-classes and revised class representations.

## Separate country estimates and uplands
- CS1990 onward used a Land Classification that crossed country boundaries; later CS2000 introduced country-unit estimates (England with Wales, and Scotland) with class subdivision and reallocation to ensure adequate representation per country.
- Upland habitat module added in CS2000 to bolster statistical accuracy for upland England and Wales estimates.

## Welsh and upland adjustments
- Wales: in CS2000, 5 Welsh sub-classes created; in CS2007, Wales reporting required Wales-only class subdivisions and targeted additional Welsh squares (minimum 6 per Welsh class).
- England: two classes (5e, 15e) left with 4 squares per class in CS2007 due to cost/precision considerations; overall impact deemed modest by scoping studies.
- Uplands: CS2000 included an upland module adding 30 squares in relevant ITE Land Classes for better upland habitat estimates.

## Estimation approach and outputs
- National estimates calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each Land Class multiplied by the total area of that class.
- The evolving classification aimed to preserve consistency across surveys while allowing country-specific reporting.
- Key outputs include Countryside Survey reports for CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007, detailing habitat extent and change.

## Acknowledgements and further reading
- Acknowledgements credited various researchers and statisticians for methodological and graphical contributions.
- References provide foundational literature on the ITE Land Classification, landscape change, and Countryside Survey methodologies.

## Practical implications for data use
- The document outlines a rigorous, time-consistent framework for sampling and classification that supports trend analysis and policy reporting across England, Wales, and Scotland.
- It explains how class definitions, sampling intensity, and country-specific adjustments affect comparability and precision of national estimates.
- For data products, the strategy supports self-serve access to stratified habitat data and facilitates monitoring changes in countryside habitats over multiple survey rounds.
