# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while protecting future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square locations and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.
  - 2019 rolling program funded by NERC; governance partners listed (UKCEH, Defra etc.).

- Why locations are confidential
  - Preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill.
  - Protect future survey integrity, environmental protection, and permission to survey land.
  - Confidentiality serves the public interest; requests handled under FOI Act or Environmental Information Regulations.

- When locations may be released and at what precision
  - Approximate locations: four-digit grid references (identifies 10x10 km grid squares) can be released under licence.
  - Precise locations: six-digit grid references only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; external processing by UKCEH recommended to avoid release.
  - Spatial data within squares (habitat maps, etc.) can pose identification risk and are release-controlled under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.

- Specific conditions of release
  - Licensees must maintain confidentiality, store data securely, and limit access to named individuals with legitimate project needs.
  - Licences are finite in duration, for specific projects; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at licence end.
  - No third-party release that could compromise location confidentiality; data not to be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees must demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - 4-digit releases have similar terms but do not require the highest IP-confidentiality level; a clause prevents attempting to derive precise square locations.

- Responsibilities and governance
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides exceptional releases; issues hardcopy licences with relevant clauses.
  - Senior-authority sign-off required from licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, decision follows Act and Regulations; annual reporting to CS partners about access applications and decisions.
  - Practical support: UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within CS partnership; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Recommendation to consult UKCEH before committing to data use to define requirements and use; collaboration or payment terms vary by case.
