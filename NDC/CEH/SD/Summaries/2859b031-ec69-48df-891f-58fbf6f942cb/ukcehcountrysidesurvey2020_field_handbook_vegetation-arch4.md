# UKCEH Countryside Survey 2021

- Purpose and approach
  - This vegetation field protocol handbook documents data collection for the UK-SCaPE/UKCEH Countryside Survey summer 2021.
  - Data are collected digitally using ESRI Survey123 (Vegplots) and Collector apps, with paper plot maps and photos as supporting relocation aids.
  - The goal is to record presence/abundance of vegetation across plots to quantify long-term countryside changes by habitat type and landscape location.

- Data system, collection, and accessibility
  - Data are captured digitally and centrally submitted to a central database; offline data capture and later syncing are supported.
  - Plot relocation relies on a combination of GPS geopoints, plot sketch maps, and multiple plot photos to enable repeatability over time.
  - Plot maps may be paper or digital; photos should include plot number/type and a stable nearby reference feature to aid re-finding.
  - Data standards and metadata are embedded in the workflow (plot header, habitat classifications, nest-level species data, and comprehensive notes).

- Plot design and types
  - Plot types: X plots (vegetation, 200 m2) and XX plots (2x2 m soil/nest plots).
  - X plots are laid out as five predetermined random positions within a survey square; 2x2 m soil plots are nested within the larger vegetation plot.
  - If a plot cannot be relocated, it may be recorded as Not Found and replaced with a new plot; relocation tolerances are described (greater tolerance in homogeneous habitats, tighter in heterogeneous areas).
  - In some cases, plots may be moved to avoid damage (e.g., entering arable fields near crops).

- Plot relocation and records
  - Repeated plots rely on a combination of plot maps, GPS, photos, and reference features; metal plates or stakes historically mark locations, though plates may be buried or displaced.
  - If a previously recorded plot cannot be relocated satisfactorily, mark as Not Found or Not Appropriate (e.g., land use changes). Replacement plots may be created in newly accessible areas, with a priority to repeat older plots first.
  - When a plot lands on water or unsafe land, relocate to suitable land within the same sector; if no suitable land exists, the plot is not recorded.

- Data capture workflow and forms
  - Plot header information (Page 1): square number, plot type, plot number, Plot ID, surveyors, and relocation status (Found, Not Found, New Plot Replacement, etc.).
  - Plot relocation notes: location accuracy, geopoint capture, and relocation justification; using in-app location tools to adjust coordinates when necessary.
  - Broad habitat and Priority Habitat fields (at plot level and for wider polygons) to support habitat-based analyses and reporting.
  - Major tree disease indicators (if trees are present).
  - Plot map status: Plot Map drawn/edited/redrawn with notes when amended.
  - Nest data collection (Page 3 for vegetation nests; Page 4 for bryophytes and lichens where applicable): nested quadrats within the 200 m2 X plot (Nest 0 through Nest 5 for 200 m2; Nest 1 for 4 m2 soil plots).
  - Species recording: recursive, nested-nest recording for vascular plants; complete bryophyte/lichen guidelines and restricted moss list; all taxa recorded to the species level where possible, with procedures for handling unidentified or uncertain identifications (other and photo options).
  - Cover estimates: percentage covers (nearest 5%) for each species, including ground features (litter, wood, rock, bare ground, water, bryophytes); total cover should sum to about 100% (or higher where layered vegetation is present).
  - Additional data: notes on disturbances, soil sampling, and any peculiarities observed during recording.

- Plot sketch maps and photography
  - Plot sketch maps: precise, to-scale representations showing GPS point, reference features, distances, and bearings; north arrow included; maps may be revised if necessary and photographed for QA.
  - Plot photos: two to three photos per plot, focusing on features that will aid relocation (nearby, stable landmarks) and including plot number/type; back-of-photo labeling helps identification in subsequent surveys.

- Species identification guidance and data integrity
  - Areal plots (200 m2 vegetation) record all species across nested nests; soil plots (4 m2) record species within the nest and total plot.
  - Aggregations/combinations: certain taxa are recorded as combinations when species-level IDs are uncertain; if species is known, use the specific name.
  - Bryophytes and lichens: limited to the bryophytes/lichens listed in the protocol, with total bryophyte cover prioritized; a defined moss list is provided for reference.
  - Data integrity: the software enforces required fields and flags missing data before submission; blank or duplicate entries may be possible and should be checked.

- Data submission, storage, and QA
  - Online submission via Send Now to central database is possible when online; offline work saves as Drafts or Outbox and can be uploaded later.
  - If resubmitting, use Copy to new survey to permit editing of certain fields; include notes indicating the correct version.
  - Auto-save functionality reduces data loss; QA checks ensure required fields are completed prior to submission.

- Appendices and reference materials (supporting data leadership)
  - Appendix I: Collector and Survey123 generic reference guides for installation and use (including main app components such as Map, Collect, Measurable tools, and My Surveys).
  - Appendix II: Random numbers between 0 and 1 (used for plot randomization and allocation references).
  - Appendix III: Plot types recorded in previous surveys and the historical mapping of plots (Are you recording Large X plots or Soil X plots, etc.).
  - Appendix IV: Habitat descriptions and Priority Habitats (extensive classification system covering Broad Habitats from woodlands and grasslands to urban and coastal habitats, with detailed notes on calcareous and acid grasslands, bog, fen, marsh, reedbed, urban broad habitats, and montane habitats).
  - Habitat key and priority habitat guidance are provided to support consistent habitat allocation for reporting and biodiversity assessments.

- Key challenges and data-leadership considerations
  - Ensuring consistent data collection across dispersed, heterogeneous habitats and diverse user needs.
  - Managing data fragmentation and ensuring data discoverability through plots, maps, photos, and standardized metadata.
  - Maintaining data quality and comparability over time via repeatable relocation methods, standardized nest recording, and defined taxonomic lists.
  - Balancing rigorous data standards with practical field constraints, including access issues and habitat-specific relocation tolerances.
  - Coordinating data across teams and networks to support an effective, shared data system for long-term countryside monitoring.
