# UKCEH Countryside Survey 2021

## Overview and Purpose
- Standardises vegetation data collection to monitor environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Uses established data sources, quality assurance, and transformed datasets to enable cross-time comparisons.
- Data outputs include plots, habitat types, and landscape-level vegetation information; datasets stored and uploaded to appropriate portals.

## Data Collection Framework
- Two main plot sizes and nested structure:
  - 200 m² vegetation plots (X plots) with nested subplots (Nest 0 to Nest 5) to census vegetation progressively from small to full plot.
  - 4 m² soil plots (XX) nested within X plots for soil-focused data.
- Repeated plots across surveys to quantify change; exact relocation relies on GPS, sketch maps, and plot photos.
- Plot markers (aluminium plates or wooden stakes) aid relocation; metal detectors provided; if not found, relocation is based on sketch maps and photos.
- Random allocation within squares; new plots allowed only in accessible, permission-granted non-urban land.

## Plot Types and Layout
- Areal plots: 200 m² (14.14 m x 14.14 m) with nested 1 m², 2 m², 4 m², and 1 m² components within nests.
- X plots (vegetation) vs XX plots (soil):
  - X plots: five predetermined random positions per square (X1–X5).
  - Soil squares: smaller 2×2 m nests within the larger X plot; used for soil sampling.
- Layout and recording specifics:
  - Nest 0: 1 m²? (detailed nesting as per protocol) with initial species list and cover estimates.
  - Nest 1 onward: additional species recorded as the nest area expands; total cover sums to approximately 100% for each species.
- Nesting and data capture:
  - Nest 0 contains the innermost 2 × 2 m square; Nest 5 covers the full 14.14 × 14.14 m area.
  - Species lists use drop-downs with auto-type options; if unknown, "Other" with free text or photo for later ID.
- Plot orientation and measurement:
  - 200 m² plot oriented to North/South and East/West with strings; nest markers indicate positions.
  - GPS readings taken at specified corners (south corner for X plots); coordinates recorded with averaging and accuracy checks.

## Plot Relocation, Documentation, and Notes
- Plot relocation decisions (Found, Not Found, New Plot, Not Appropriate, Access Denied, Too Dangerous) recorded in the data entry form.
- Accuracy allowances depend on habitat homogeneity; more strict relocation may be required in heterogeneous habitats.
- If a previous plot cannot be relocated satisfactorily, record as Not Found and create a replacement plot.
- Plot maps can be edited or redrawn; edits documented with pencil marks and initials/date.

## Plot Recording in Veg Plots (Data Entry and Pages)
- Page 1 (Plot header information): site name, recorders, slope, aspect, location, photos; automatically entered Square, Plot Type, Plot Number, and Plot ID where applicable.
- Plot relocation details: Found, Not Found, New Plot replacements; automatic geopoint capture if GPS available; notes on disturbance.
- Broad Habitat and Priority Habitat fields:
  - Broad habitat at plot and wider polygon levels; Priority Habitat fields to capture PH designation.
  - Tree disease indicators if trees present.
- Plot Map: whether a plot map is drawn, edited, or redrawn; plotting features and reference features noted.
- Page 2 (Plot-specific headers): plot-type relevant data (e.g., soil sampling for X plots); barcode scanning for soil bags.
- Page 3 (Entering species): nested nests with comprehensive species lists; “Other” option for unidentified species; photo button for unknowns.
- Completion and submission: built-in checks ensure required fields are filled; options to send data online or save offline as Drafts/Outbox; auto-save protects against crashes.

## Recording Vegetation and Bryophytes
- Vegetation: nested plots with species presence and percent cover; major bryophytes recorded (restricted to listed mosses and bryophytes); emphasis on vascular plants, sedges, and grasses.
- Bryophytes and Lichens: limited to the mosses and lichens listed in the protocol; Sphagnum categories prioritized.
- 200 m² X plot detailing:
  - Nest 0 to Nest 5: incremental recording of species as the census expands outward.
  - Total cover estimates compiled for all species across all nests; notes on unidentified species and re-identifications.
- 4 m² X plot (Soil):
  - Similar approach to Nest 1 with nested sampling and total cover calculations; emphasis on soil-associated vascular plants and ground flora.

## Data Entry Details and Helpers
- Auto-type lists reduce entry effort; free-text option for unknowns with follow-up IDs.
- Photo and sketch maps:
  - Plot photos capture a nearby stable feature to help relocation; each plot photo tagged with plot number and type.
  - Sketch maps must show GPS read, measured distances, compass bearings, north arrow, and plot identifiers; photos of edited or redrawn maps taken for record.
- Nest-specific data entry:
  - Nest 0 has total covers and a comprehensive species list.
  - Nest 1 onwards captures new species only if present; otherwise “No additional species in nest.”
  - Final Totals: total cover per species across all nests, ensuring data consistency.

## Data Submission, Quality Assurance, and Storage
- Online submission via central database when survey is complete.
- Offline workflows: Drafts and Outbox for unsent forms; auto-save reduces data loss risk.
- Copy to new survey option required for editing certain fields after submission.
- QA reminders prompt data completeness before final submission.

## Plot Types and Recording Rules
- Plot types per square:
  - X (Vegetation) plots: 200 m² with nested sampling; five X plots per square in designated random positions.
  - XX (Soil) plots: 4 m² nested inside X plots.
- Location within square: plots moved inside square boundaries if necessary; if crossing edges, ensure placement remains representative of prior habitat type.
- Five-sector overlay for X plots to locate new positions when land is scarce; movement away from crops to avoid trampling is advised.

## Habitat Classification and Descriptions (Appendix IV)
- Broad Habitats (examples):
  - Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland, Coniferous Woodland, Boundary/Linear Features, Arable and Horticulture, Improved Grassland, Neutral Grassland, Calcareous Grassland, Acid Grassland, Bracken, Dwarf Shrub Heath, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Standing Water (rare in X plots), Montane Broad Habitat, Inland Rock, Urban.
  - Includes detailed notes on typical species, community classifications (NVC), and PH associations.
- Priority Habitats:
  - Limestone pavement, Inland rock outcrop and scree, Calcareous and acidic grasslands, Bracken, Purple moor grass and rush pastures, Reedbeds, Bog-related habitats, Montane and coastal types, Urban edge habitats.
- Habitat Key and PH associations used to guide classification for BAP reporting and polygon-level assignments.
- Guidance for describing habitat after disturbance (e.g., clearfell areas) to reflect current vegetation rather than future land-use intentions.

## Practical Considerations for Analysts
- Emphasises consistent data formats, quality assurance, and long-term dataset value through integration with other environmental data.
- Encourages access to underlying data by stakeholders and downstream users.
- Provides a robust workflow for standardized monitoring, documenting, and sharing environmental health indicators over time.
