# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- A historical overview of the Sampling Strategy and ITE Land Classification used for Countryside Survey field surveys in Great Britain, from 1978 through 2007, with revisions up to 2011.
- Core idea: use a stratified, random sampling framework (ITE Land Classification) to ensure samples represent ecological variation across GB; field surveys gather habitat, land-use, and landscape features.
- Central concept: land classification acts as the sampling framework and as the basis for national and country-level estimates of habitats and features.

## Key Concepts and Evolution

- Stratification and representativeness
  - Stratified sampling reduces bias by dividing land into discrete strata (land classes) and sampling within each stratum.
  - Early work used Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) to group 1 km squares into 32 Land Classes.

- Land Classification development timeline
  - 1978: First GB-wide Land Classification using 1 km squares; 8 samples per class (256 total) to estimate national habitat areas.
  - 1984: Second field survey; expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); national estimates still tied to the 1978 classification.
  - 1990: All-squares Land Classification; expanded sampling to 508 squares; linked to first Land Cover Map of GB; recalibrations to apply to all GB squares.
  - 1998: Revised Land Classification; separate reporting for Scotland; number of Land Classes increased to 40; 569 squares surveyed in CS1998.
  - 2007: Further revision to accommodate Wales-only reporting; class sub-divisions created for England and Wales (5 new Welsh sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total of 45 strata; 591 squares surveyed in CS2007; Welsh sampling strengthened with 43 additional Welsh squares.

- Country-specific reporting and sampling
  - Post-1998 changes enabled separate country estimates (England with Wales and Scotland).
  - Wales-specific needs led to Wales-focused class subdivisions and additional Welsh sampling; adjustments kept England sampling largely steady.

- Uplands module
  - CS2000 introduced an uplands module (30 extra squares) to improve estimates for upland habitats in England and Wales.

## Survey Details and Data Management Implications

- Survey scales and sample sizes
  - 1978: 256 total squares across 32 Land Classes (8 per class).
  - 1984: 384 squares (12 per class).
  - 1990: 508 squares (all GB squares classified; several squares shifted class).
  - 1998: 569 squares; separate Scottish reporting; Land Classes increased to 40.
  - 2007: 591 squares; Wales-focused adjustments; Land Classes increased to 45; additional Welsh squares.

- Class maps and crosswalks
  - Land Classification maps evolved (e.g., England with Wales and Scotland maps in CS2000/CS2007).
  - When comparing estimates across surveys, the classification version used matters; crosswalks and note about using latest classification for consistency within a survey were advised.

- National estimates methodology
  - National estimates are derived from mean habitat area per square within each Land Class, multiplied by the total area of that Land Class.
  - This approach relies on stable, documented classifications and careful handling of class extent changes across surveys.

- Data provenance and documentation
  - Reports and tables document how sample squares are allocated, how classes are subdivided, and how estimates are computed.
  - Important to preserve versioned Land Class maps, the exact survey year, and the country scope when reusing data.

## Data Governance Considerations for Data Stewards

- Classification versioning
  - Maintain clear records of the Land Classification version used for each survey (1978, 1984, 1990, 1998, 2000, 2007).
  - Provide crosswalks or notes when comparing results across surveys with different classifications.

- Country-specific reporting
  - Ensure separation of England with Wales and Scotland estimates where requested; track Wales-only adjustments and sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) for Wales.

- Uplands and module extensions
  - Document supplementary modules (e.g., uplands in CS2000) and how they impact statistical precision and habitat estimates.

- Data completeness and transfer
  - Track the number of squares per class and per country, noting any losses or additions between surveys to understand changes in precision.
  - Ensure that datasets associated with each survey year include the relevant Land Classification maps, class definitions, and any country-specific aggregations.

- Metadata and traceability
  - Include metadata detailing:
    - Survey year and geographic scope (GB, England & Wales, Scotland, Wales-only when applicable)
    - Land Classification version and class definitions
    - Number of sample squares and sampling rate per class
    - Methods used to estimate national/habitat statistics
