# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Overview
- Purpose: maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risk to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Scope: applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

## Background
- 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) under UK-SCaPE programme.
- 2007 CS partners include CEH (NERC), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, and SNH.

## Why locations are confidential
- To preserve sampling site representativeness and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and future survey permissions.
- Requests handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under FOI Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

## When and how locations may be released
- Location data can indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence for approximate locations.
- Six-digit grid references (precise locations) are only considered in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; UKCEH may process externally to avoid release, and only if IP/data confidentiality requirements are comparable or higher than CS data.
- Spatial data within squares (e.g., habitat maps) could indirectly identify square locations and thus are subject to the same exceptional terms as six-digit references.

## Specific conditions of release
- Licensees must maintain confidentiality, secure storage, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate need.
- Licences grant access for finite periods tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the period.
- No data should be released to third parties that could compromise square confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to monitor individual landowners.
- If requested, licensees may need to demonstrate project-management standards at least equivalent to the Joint Code of Practice for Research (JCOP).
- Four-digit releases have looser IP-confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases; still, license terms prohibit attempts to deduce precise square locations.

## Responsibilities and process
- UKCEH, as CS data owners, makes exceptional-release decisions on behalf of NERC.
- UKCEH issues hardcopy licences containing confidentiality clauses, signed by a senior authorised representative.
- If approval is denied, the decision follows statutory Act and Regulations procedures.
- UKCEH provides an annual report to CS partners detailing applications and decisions.
- For internal CS-partner use, UKCEH aims to provide pre-processing analysis within reasonable timeframes, subject to moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
- Partners and potential data users are strongly encouraged to consult UKCEH before committing to data use; collaboration or payment arrangements are negotiated case-by-case.

## Practical guidance
- Potential licensees should engage with UKCEH to define requirements and use of the data.
- Pre-processing support may be available through UKCEH, depending on collaboration or payment arrangements.
