# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- A historic, data-driven framework used to sample and classify Great Britain’s countryside for ecological and land-use change analysis, evolving from 1978 to 2007.
- Central concept: use a stratified, random sampling design built on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative national, regional, and country-specific estimates.

## Core concepts and methodology

- Stratified sampling to reduce bias and ensure representative coverage of varying land types and ecological conditions.
- ITE Land Classification: an environmental stratification system created from environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to group land into land classes.
- Sampling unit: 1 km x 1 km squares. To manage data, the strategy uses a central square from a 15 x 15 km grid, with surrounding squares also classified.
- Analytical approach: classification-based estimation. National estimates are derived from mean values within each land class multiplied by the land area of that class.
- Early classification technique: Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used to cluster quadrats into vegetation/environmental classes, later extended to land-scale classifications.

## Chronology of the Countryside Survey (CS) sampling strategy

- CS1978 (Initial Land Classification and Field Survey)
  - ISA used on 1228 centre squares to create 32 land classes.
  - 8 sample squares per land class surveyed (256 total).
  - Resulted in national estimates by aggregating class means times class areas.
- CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
  - 12 sample squares per land class (384 total).
- CS1990 (All Squares Land Classification; Third Field Survey)
  - Expanded to classify all 1 km squares in GB; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Land Classification revised; results published with expanded dataset and first Land Cover Map linkage.
- CS1998–CS2000 (Land Classification revisions for regional/local estimates)
  - Local/regional accuracy improvements led to a revised land classification, enabling better regional and local estimates.
  - Aimed to classify every square using major climatic, geological, and physiographic surrogates; 62% class correspondence with the original, with neighbouring-class alignment preserved in practice.
  - CS2000 introduced country-unit reporting (England & Wales as a unit and Scotland separately) and expanded the sampling to ensure adequate representation of newly defined classes.
- CS2007 (Welsh-only and England/Scotland refinements)
  - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to country-unit subdivisions and additional Welsh samples.
  - Created five new country-unit land classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total strata increased to 45.
  - Wales received 43 additional squares to ensure a minimum of 6 squares per Welsh class; some English classes reduced to 4 squares due to precision trade-offs.
  - England adjustments were made to maintain usefulness of English-class data; Wales and Scotland gained more targeted representation.
  - A dedicated upland module added 30 squares in upland/marginal upland areas to improve upland habitat estimates.

## Country-specific estimates and sampling framework

- Separate country estimates introduced to provide England & Wales, Scotland, and (for Wales) Wales-only reporting needs after devolution.
- Structural changes:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to reflect country-specific realities.
  - Aggregation of underrepresented sub-classes within a country to maintain usable sample sizes (resulting in 40 strata originally, then 45 with Wales adjustments).
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new country-specific classes (minimum 6 squares per class in Wales; some English classes retained at 4 due to precision considerations).
- Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with England squares when appropriate for England/Wales reporting.

## Upland module and Wales-focused developments

- CS2000 uplands module: added 30 squares in uplands and marginal uplands to improve precision of upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.
- CS2007 adjustments specifically address Wales-only reporting needs, with Wales becoming the most intensively sampled country unit in terms of proportional sampling.

## Outputs, data handling, and references

- Tables and figures (e.g., Tables 2 and 3, Figures 4–7) illustrate the distribution of sample squares, the revised land-class maps, and the sampling framework across England, Wales, and Scotland.
- The strategy documents the evolution of sample sizes by class and country unit across surveys, as well as the rationale for adjustments to maintain statistical reliability for country-specific estimates.
- National estimates discussion notes that changing the basic land classification affects consistency of stock estimates; two approaches exist for GB estimates: use the latest classification (best for internal consistency of a survey) or the original classification (best for cross-survey consistency).

## Summary of the progression

- 1978: 256 squares across 32 land classes; eight samples per class.
- 1984: 384 squares; increased sampling per class.
- 1990: All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; national estimates aligned with 1990 Land Classification.
- 2000: CS2000 revisions introduce country-unit reporting, 40 strata expanded to 40/45 with sub-divisions and additional squares; separate country estimates considered.
- 2007: Wales-focused subdivisions and additional Welsh samples; five new country-unit classes; upland module added; total strata increased to 45; adjustments balance representation across England, Wales, and Scotland.
