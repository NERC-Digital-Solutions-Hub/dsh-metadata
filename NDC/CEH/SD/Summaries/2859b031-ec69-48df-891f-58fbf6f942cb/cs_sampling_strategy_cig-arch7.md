# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Describe the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) and how it has evolved with the ITE Land Classification to support national and country-specific habitat/land-use estimates in Great Britain and Wales.

- Core concept: Use a stratified, random sampling design centered on the ITE Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of ecological and land-use variation across GB and its constituent countries.

- Key idea of stratification: Divide land into discrete strata (land classes) so sampling captures diverse ecological and management contexts, reducing bias from purely random sampling.

- Grounded method: The ITE Land Classification provides the stratification structure; initial development used environmental attributes (altitude, geology, climate, etc.) to form 32 classes, then expanded/revised across surveys.

- Evolution overview:
  - 1978 (Initial CS): 1 km squares used as sampling units; eight samples per land class; total 256 squares; 32 land classes derived from 1228 centre squares with surrounding squares allocated to classes.
  - 1984 (Second CS): sampling expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total); continued use of land-class framework.
  - 1990 (CS1990): All GB squares classified; 508 squares surveyed; land-class framework updated to support regional/local estimates; linked with the first Land Cover Map of GB.
  - 1998/CS1990 onward: Land Classification expanded to allow Scotland reporting; increasing number of classes (up to 40) to improve regional representativeness.
  - 2000 (CS2000): Introduction of separate country estimates (England with Wales, Scotland); land-class sub-division into country-unit classes (leading to 40 strata, later 45); additional sampling (e.g., uplands module) to improve accuracy for upland habitats; 19 extra squares added to ensure adequate representation of new classes.
  - 2007 (CS2007): Wales-only reporting recognized; Welsh-specific adjustments implemented (new country-unit sub-classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w); total Welsh sampling increased to improve Wales-only estimates; overall 43 additional Welsh squares; England adjustments to maintain balance.

- Land Classification specifics:
  - Original: 32 land classes described by environmental attributes.
  - 1990 revision: attempted classification of all GB squares; some squares reclassified, requiring reliance on surrogates where necessary.
  - 1998/2000: Land Classes expanded (up to 40) to support Scotland reporting and later Wales reporting.
  - 2007: Sub-division into country-unit classes increased strata to 45, with Wales getting dedicated sub-classes.

- Country and upland adjustments:
  - England, Scotland, and Wales: sampling framework adapted to produce country-level estimates; Isle of Man removed from country-unit estimates and replaced with new GB Squares where needed.
  - Wales: Wales-specific adjustments in CS2007 to enable Wales-only reporting; dedicated Welsh classes introduced; increased Welsh sampling to ensure minimum representation per class.
  - Uplands module: additional 30 squares added in CS2000 to improve habitat estimates in upland areas of England and Wales.

- Outputs and reports:
  - Early results linked to the ITE Land Classification and national estimates published in various reports (e.g., CS1990 main report; CS1990/1993 outputs; later CS2000 and CS2007 outputs).
  - CS2007 Preparations included Wales-focused reporting and refined country-specific sampling maps (England with Wales and Scotland class maps updated accordingly).

- Data interpretation and notes:
  - Creation of national estimates can depend on whether estimates use the latest country-specific classifications or the original (1990) classification; consistency considerations are discussed.
  - The report documents detailed tables of sample squares by class and country, illustrating how sampling coverage changed over time and how sampling rates varied by class and country.

- Practical takeaway for GIS and data users:
  - The Sampling Strategy underpins how GB and Wales/Scotland estimates of habitats and land use are produced, with a clear lineage of stratification by refined land classes and country-specific adjustments.
  - The evolving Land Classification and sampling framework are central to understanding the spatial coverage, data representativeness, and comparability across CS surveys (1978–2007).
