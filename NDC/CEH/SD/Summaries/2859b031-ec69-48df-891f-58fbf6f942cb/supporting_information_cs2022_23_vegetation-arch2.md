# Countryside Survey

- A long-running UK study (since 1978) auditing natural resources to detect gradual environmental changes over time.
- Since 2019, UKCEH Countryside Survey (UKCEH-CS) uses a rolling monitoring program to maximise site coverage, enable year-on-year comparisons, and buffer against climate fluctuations.

## Aim and approach

- Provide a consistent, ecosystem-based assessment of environmental health across soils, vegetation, streams, habitats, and landscape features.
- Combine multiple metrics analyzed together to understand size, location, causes, and consequences of change.
- Produce outputs (reports, maps, charts) that support monitoring of environmental policy performance and health over time.
- Maintain standardized data collection, quality assurance, and data storage for reuse and scrutiny.

## Rolling design and sampling

- Five-year survey cycle targeting 500 1km squares in GB; about 100 squares visited per year.
- Squares are randomly selected and stratified by the Land Classification of Great Britain; urban (>75% urban land) or marine (>90% sea) squares are excluded.
- The design preserves a long-running core time series by including the original 256 squares from 1978, and additional squares added from early surveys (1990 cohort).
- The rolling program aims to maximise site visits while monitoring year-on-year changes across a national scale.

## Methods and quality assurance

- Data collected by trained field surveyors following standardized protocols (Smart et al., 2020), with intensive training to ensure consistency.
- Field teams are supervised, with ongoing project oversight to maintain data quality.
- 10% of plots are re-surveyed for quality assurance; the same assessor conducts QA surveys and analyses from 1990 onward for consistency.
- Independent validation confirms plot location assignments and habitat classifications (JNCC broad and priority habitats).

## Data and file details

- Vegetation data for 2022 and 2023 collected and stored as two CSV files:
  - Vegetation plots: plot metadata (plot location, type, habitat codes, country, county, environmental zones, land classification codes, etc.).
  - Vegetation plot species list: species presence, nest-level or cover data, and related metrics (e.g., cover percentages for multiple nests and total cover).
- Taxonomy follows Stace (1997) for plant nomenclature.
- Data columns include year, square ID, plot ID, plot type, habitat classifications, country, county, land classification numbers, and related descriptors.
- Distribution maps (e.g., 2022–2023 1km squares) support spatial interpretation while protecting data confidentiality.

## Outputs and policy relevance

- Generates indicators for national and subnational levels, enabling assessment of environmental health and change over time.
- Supports policy-relevant metrics by integrating soil and vegetation data within an ecosystem framework.
- Results are disseminated through reports, maps, and charts, with datasets stored in appropriate data portals for access and reuse.

## Challenges and opportunities

- Increasing the value of datasets by integrating Countryside Survey data with other relevant datasets (moving beyond single-use applications).
- Improving access to underlying data used to create final outputs, enabling broader scrutiny and secondary analyses.

## Reference context

- The program draws on foundational methodologies, classifications (e.g., ITE Land Classification), habitat guides, and the UK Biodiversity Action Plan references, with continued development through CEH and UKCEH publications and field handbooks.
