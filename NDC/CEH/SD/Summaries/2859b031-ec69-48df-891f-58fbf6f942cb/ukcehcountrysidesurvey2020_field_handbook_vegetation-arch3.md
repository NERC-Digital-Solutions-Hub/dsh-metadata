# UKCEH Countryside Survey 2021

- Overview
  - Long-term vegetation monitoring to quantify countryside changes by habitat type and landscape location.
  - Collects plot-level header data, species presence/abundance, cover, plot relocation aids (sketch maps, photos), and plots data in digital formats for clear analysis and reporting.
  - Emphasizes openness and data governance: share underlying data, ensure metadata quality, and present findings via reports, charts, or dashboards.

- Data collection framework and methods
  - Two plot scales:
    - Vegetation plots: 200 m2 (14.14 x 14.14 m) with nested 1 m2, 2 m2, 4 m2, and related sub-nests up to nest 5 for full coverage.
    - Soil plots: 2x2 m squares nested within the vegetation plots.
  - Plot types in each 1 km square:
    - X plots (vegetation): five predetermined random positions per square.
    - XX plots (soil): small 2x2 m nests within the larger X plot context.
  - Relocation is central: relies on GPS, plot sketch maps, and photos to re-find plots across surveys.
  - Areal plots and additional plot types are defined to cover various habitat contexts; plots may be moved or replaced if land use changes.

- Plot relocation, new plots and field procedures
  - Markers: aluminium plates or wooden stakes to aid relocation; plates may be buried or moved over time; metal detectors provided.
  - If a plot cannot be relocated within a reasonable time, mark as Not Found and create a replacement plot as needed.
  - New plots may be added within squares (excluding urban areas and restricted land); aim for precise location with sketch maps, photos, and GPS.
  - Relocation decisions consider habitat heterogeneity and potential relocation error; small errors are acceptable in homogeneous habitats, larger errors may invalidate repeat analyses.

- Data capture workflow and tools
  - Tools: ESRI Collector for navigation and plot location; Survey123 for data entry; data can be collected offline and submitted later.
  - Data entry flow:
    - Plot header information (site, recorder, location, slope, etc.) automatically populated if re-editing an existing plot.
    - Plot relocation status and contextual notes (found, not found, new plot, not appropriate, etc.).
    - Geopoint captured via offline GPS; accuracy indicated via location panels and a fullscreen map option.
    - Broad Habitat and Priority Habitat fields (at plot and polygon levels) to capture habitat context.
    - Plot maps: drawn or edited; photos attached; plot sketch maps generated for relocation.
  - Nest data entry:
    - Nest 0: records species presence and percent cover for the innermost 2x2 m area; total cover estimates across nest 0.
    - Nests 1–5: progressively larger nests to capture additional species as the plot area increases to 200 m2.
    - Bryophytes: limited to specified mosses and bryophyte categories; emphasis on vascular plants but bryophytes recorded where possible.
  - Submitting data:
    - Online: use Send Now; copy to a new survey to enable editing; offline: Save Drafts or Outbox and submit when online.
    - Auto-save features reduce data loss; data governance and QA checks occur before submission.

- Data quality, metadata, and governance
  - Protocol requires documenting completeness and reasons for any missing data or plot loss.
  - Metadata and data sharing are prioritized to enable verification and future reuse.
  - Data transformations and clear presentation (charts, dashboards) are part of the standard output.
  - Governance processes guide data storage, sharing, and upkeep to maintain standards over time.

- Habitat classifications and biodiversity components
  - Broad Habitat (BH) and Priority Habitat (PH) classifications guide habitat allocation and reporting.
  - A comprehensive habitat key describes 18+ broad habitats (e.g., Broadleaved Mixed and Yew Woodland, Coniferous Woodland, Arable & Horticulture, Grassland types, Bracken, Heaths, Fen/Marsh/Swamp, Bog, Standing Water, Montane, Inland Rock, Urban, Supra-Littoral and Maritime habitats, Saltmarsh, Mudflats, etc.).
  - PH and BH guidance supports Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) reporting and habitat management decisions.
  - The document provides detailed descriptions and examples for each habitat type, including notes on conversion, management implications (e.g., how to record clearfell scenarios), and specific community classifications (NVC equivalents).

- Appendices and practical references
  - Appendix I: Collector & Survey123—generic reference guides and practical notes on installing and using the apps, including map navigation, data collection, and offline/online workflows.
  - Appendix II: Random number table (used for plot allocation in historical contexts).
  - Appendix III: Plot types recorded in previous surveys by square, including Areal, X plots, Soil plots, and targeted habitats.
  - Appendix IV: Habitat descriptions and Priority Habitat details to support consistent habitat allocation across surveyors.
  - Version history and contact details for vegetation protocol support are included.

- Key takeaways for policy monitoring
  - Provides a standardized, repeatable framework for long-term environmental health monitoring through vegetation plots.
  - Emphasizes transparent relocation, robust metadata, and public data sharing to enable policy evaluation and future decision-making.
  - Integrates modern data collection tools (Collector and Survey123) with rigorous field protocols (plot design, nesting methodology, and habitat classification) to ensure data quality and comparability over time.
  - Addresses practical challenges common to monitoring programs, including data gaps, access issues, organizational silos, data transformation needs, and communicating complex findings clearly.
