# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose and scope
  - Describes the field survey sampling framework for Countryside Survey GB, up to 2007.
  - Builds on the ITE Land Classification, used to stratify sampling since the 1978 survey.
  - Designed to monitor habitat areas and land use over time to inform policy and decision-making.

- Core methodology: Land Classification and stratified sampling
  - Use a stratified, random sampling approach to ensure representative sampling across environmental land classes.
  - Early approach: classify a subset of 1 km squares into land classes, survey a fixed number of squares per class, and estimate national habitat areas by combining class area with mean class-specific habitat metrics.
  - The concept began with central squares of a 15 x 15 km grid across GB; surrounding four squares were allocated to the same class to create a representative sample.

- Chronology of major developments
  - CS1978 (Initial Land Classification)
    - Indicator Species Analysis (ISA) used on environmental attributes to create 32 land classes from 1 km squares (centre squares of a 15 x 15 km grid).
    - Classified set included 6,039 squares; 2,039 (approx.) additional surrounding squares categorized; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class) in a stratified, random design.
    - National estimates calculated as the mean habitat area per square within each land class times the land-class area.
  - CS1984 (Second Field Survey)
    - Expanded to 12 squares per land class (384 total).
  - CS1990 (All Squares/3rd Field Survey)
    - Land Classification revised to classify data from all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed.
    - Continued collection of features from CS1984 and a repeat of vegetation quadrats.
  - CS1998/CS2000 (Revised Classification and Country Reporting)
    - Recognised need for country-specific estimates (England with Wales, Scotland) and better upland reporting.
    - Land Classification extended to enable country-unit reporting; introduced sub-divisions and aggregations to create about 40 strata.
    - Additional samples allocated: 19 extra squares for Wales, 11 extra for England to balance class representation; Isle of Man adjustments.
    - Implemented separate country estimates (England with Wales; Scotland) and prepared revised class maps for England with Wales, and Scotland.
  - CS2007 (Welsh Considerations and Wales-Only Reporting)
    - Wales-specific reporting requirements led to sub-division of land classes into country-unit versions (creating five new classes: 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w).
    - Strata increased to 45; added 43 Welsh squares to ensure adequate representation of new Welsh classes.
    - England adjustments: no additional English squares beyond those needed; two English classes (5e, 15e) remained with 4 squares each.
    - Welsh-class revisions and UK-wide maps updated accordingly.
  - Uplands module
    - CS2000/CS2007 included an uplands module adding 30 squares in upland/marginal-upland ITE Land Classes to improve habitat estimates in uplands.

- Country reporting and sampling distribution
  - To support country-specific environmental policy and legislation, sampling was adapted to provide England with Wales reporting together and Scotland reporting separately.
  - Land Classes were subdivided into country-unit versions; class aggregation used where numbers were very small to maintain representation.
  - Wales received focused augmentation to improve Wales-only estimates; Isle of Man squares removed from country-unit estimates.

- Uplands focus
  - An additional module placed in upland and marginal upland land classes to increase statistical accuracy for upland habitat estimates in England and Wales.

- Data outputs and interpretation
  - Results summarized in tables and figures (sampling numbers, strata, and sampling rates) across surveys.
  - Emphasis on maintaining comparability over time while adapting to policy-driven reporting needs.
  - Notes on methodological choices for national estimates: changing land classifications affects comparability; for within-survey consistency, latest classification preferred; for cross-survey consistency, there are historical considerations using the original classification.

- Consistency and comparability considerations
  - Changing the basic land-class classification impacts national stock estimates; two approaches are discussed:
    - Use the latest classification for GB consistency within a survey.
    - Use the original classification for cross-survey comparability.
  - The document provides comparative tables illustrating how sample sizes per class evolved across CS1978, CS1984, CS1990, CS2000, and CS2007.

- Outputs, acknowledgments, and further reading
  - Acknowledgments note contributions from individuals and institutions.
  - References and bibliography provide foundational sources and related methodological work on the ITE Land Classification and Countryside Survey series.

- Practical implications for monitoring frameworks
  - Demonstrates how to balance long-term time-series consistency with evolving policy needs via adaptive stratification and country-specific reporting.
  - Illustrates the importance of transparent documentation of classification changes, sampling allocations, and the rationale for additional sampling in underrepresented classes or regions.
  - Highlights the role of upland modules to improve targeted habitat estimates and policy relevance.
