# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

## Purpose and Context
- Provides the field sampling framework for Countryside Survey (CS) and explains how the ITE Land Classification has evolved to underpin long-term environmental monitoring in Great Britain.
- Demonstrates how samples are designed to be representative, enable time-series analysis, and produce national, regional, and country-specific estimates of habitat and land-use features.
- Emphasizes standardised methods, data provenance, and the linkage between classification, sampling, and national estimates.

## Core Concepts
- ITE Land Classification: a stratified environmental classification used to divide GB into land classes that capture ecological and physiographic variation.
- Stratified random sampling: sampling squares (1 km x 1 km) are drawn from each land class to ensure representation of all habitat types.
- Sample unit and surrounding area: a centre 1 km square is classified; four surrounding squares are also classified to the same land class, forming a defined sampling frame.
- Indicator Species Analysis (ISA): historically used to create initial land classes from vegetation plots; later replaced by environmental surrogates for full GB coverage.
- National estimates: calculated as the mean habitat area per square within a class multiplied by the total area of that class, enabling national scale inference.

## History and Development (CS milestones)
- 1978 (Initial Land Classification): 32 land classes; 256 squares surveyed (8 per class); focus on vegetation quadrats and soils.
- 1984 (Second Field Survey): sampling expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); shift toward land use and habitat mapping.
- 1990 (All Squares Land Classification; 3rd Field Survey): classification extended to include all GB 1 km squares; 508 squares surveyed; linkage to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 (Revised Land Classification; 4th Field Survey): number of classes raised to 40; Scottish reporting enabled; total 569 squares surveyed.
- 2007 (Revised Land Classification; 5th Field Survey): Welsh reporting added; classes increased to 45; total 591 squares; adjustments to support Wales-only estimates and Wales-specific sub-classes.

## Framework and Country Implications
- England, Scotland, Wales reporting requirements drive classification adjustments:
  - Land Classes subdivided into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) to support England-with-Wales and Scotland-specific estimates.
  - Class aggregation used where few squares remained in a country for a class, creating 40–45 strata.
  - Additional squares allocated to ensure adequate representation of new/ Wales-specific classes; upland-focused sampling added in CS2000 and CS2007.
- Upland module: CS2000 included an uplands component with 30 extra squares in upland/marginal upland areas of England and Wales to improve habitat estimates in highland regions.
- Wales reporting: CS2007 specifically addressed Wales-only results, increasing Welsh sampling (and Welsh-specific sub-classes) to improve precision for Wales.

## Data Quality, Access, and Comparability
- Standardised data framework aims to improve data quality and enable reuse across time and geography.
- Note on national estimates: changing the basic Land Classification affects cross-survey comparability; for consistent time-series within a survey, the latest classification is preferred, while original classifications are sometimes used for cross-survey consistency.
- Outputs support national, regional, and country-level environmental policy and monitoring; subsequent CS reports (e.g., CS1990, CS2000, CS2007) document methodological choices and sample allocations.

## Implications for Analysts Monitoring the Environment
- The Countryside Survey sampling strategy provides a rigorous, scalable framework for monitoring habitat and land-use change over time.
- Key strengths include representative stratification, explicit handling of country-specific reporting, and planned upland modules to address under-sampled areas.
- Practitioners should account for changes in Land Classification when comparing estimates across survey years, and consider both latest-classification within surveys and original classifications when assessing longitudinal consistency.
- The strategy emphasizes the value of underlying data and transparency in methods to support broader data access and reuse.
