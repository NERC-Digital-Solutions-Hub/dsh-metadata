# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

## Purpose and scope
- Aims to maximise the public utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and anonymity of site locations.
- Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data are publicly accessible.

## Context and governance
- 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability): NE/R016429/1.
- Original 2007 CS partners include: NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.
- UKCEH acts on behalf of NERC to manage exceptional releases and licensing decisions.

## Why locations are confidential
- Confidentiality preserves representativeness of sampling sites and landowner goodwill.
- Essential for scientific integrity, environmental protection, and continued access to land for future surveys.

## When and how locations may be released
- Four-digit grid references (10x10 km) may be released under licence to indicate whether squares fall within predetermined areas (Country, County, ITE Land Class, Environmental Zone).
- Six-digit grid references are only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; must show that IP/data to be used is equally or more confidential than CS data and processed by UKCEH to avoid release.
- Spatial data within squares (habitats, features) carry equivalent confidentiality and follow the same exceptional terms as precise location data.
- In all cases, releases are controlled and must not enable identification of exact square locations.

## Licensing terms and conditions
- Licences must preserve confidentiality, be stored securely, and restricted to named individuals for approved purposes.
- Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed or securely retained only for the approved purpose.
- No data or derivatives should be released to third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
- Location data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
- If requested, licensees must provide evidence of project management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
- Four-digit releases have less stringent IP requirements than six-digit releases.
- License clauses prohibit attempts to derive precise square locations from supplied data.

## Roles and responsibilities
- UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues licences; licenses must be signed by authorized senior personnel.
- If release is denied, UKCEH follows the UK Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations processes.
- UKCEH provides annual reports to CS partners detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
- Support for internal CS use (pre-processing analyses) may be provided within reasonable timeframes; other requests assessed case-by-case.
- Partners are advised to consult UKCEH before using data covered by the policy; collaboration or payment arrangements negotiated case-by-case.
