# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Maximise public-interest utility of CS spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and site anonymity.
  - Policy applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data is publicly accessible.

- Context and governance
  - 2019 rolling program funded by NERC (UK-SCaPE National Capability).
  - 2007 CS partners include NERC (CEH), Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, SNH.
  - Confidentiality is to preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, safeguarding future surveys and policy-relevant environmental information.

- Release and access levels
  - Four-digit grid references (10x10 km grid) may be released under licence for areas of interest.
  - Six-digit grid references require exceptional justification; UKCEH may process to avoid external release, or release only under strict licence if IP protections are deemed equal or higher.
  - Spatial data within survey squares (e.g., habitat maps) carry equivalent confidentiality considerations and are subject to the same exceptional-approval terms.
  - In some cases, pre-processing analysis by UKCEH can be used to avoid releasing precise locations.

- Conditions of release
  - Licences must preserve confidentiality, restrict access to named individuals, and be tied to specific projects.
  - Licences are time-limited; data must be destroyed and confirmation provided at project end.
  - No data or derived information should be shared with third parties that could compromise location confidentiality.
  - Location data must not be used to inform visits to CS squares or to check landowner compliance.
  - If requested, licensees may need evidence of project-management standards at least equivalent to JCOP.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality criteria than six-digit releases.

- Responsibilities and process
  - UKCEH (on behalf of NERC) decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences.
  - Licences must be signed by a senior authorised official from the licensee organisation.
  - If approval is denied, UKCEH supports the decision under the Act and Regulations.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report detailing licence applications and decision grounds.
  - UKCEH can provide pre-processing support within CS partnership demand; case-by-case for other organisations.
  - Partner organisations are advised to consult with UKCEH before using data; collaboration or paid support may be arranged.

- Practical implications for data leaders
  - Align data access policies with governance to protect sampling integrity and landowner relationships.
  - Balance data utility with confidentiality, ensuring licensing and destruction requirements are met.
  - Coordinate with UKCEH/NERC for licensing decisions, pre-processing options, and annual reporting.
  - Consider compliance with public information laws (FOIA/Environmental Information Regulations) in decision-making.
