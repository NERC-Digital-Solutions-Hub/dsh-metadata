# Policy of the Countryside Survey partners on access to survey square locations

- Purpose and scope
  - Aims to maximise the public utility of Countryside Survey (CS) spatial data while minimising risks to future surveys and landowner anonymity.
  - Applies only to survey square location data and spatial data within survey squares; all other CS data remain publicly accessible.

- Context and partners
  - 2019 rolling program funded by Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) as part of UK-SCaPE National Capability (award NE/R016429/1).
  - CS partners (as of 2007) include CEH, Defra, Natural England, Welsh Government, Scottish Government, NIEA, Forestry Commission, CCW, Scottish Natural Heritage.

- Why locations are confidential
  - To preserve sampling representativeness and landowner goodwill, both essential for future surveys, scientific integrity, environmental protection, and ongoing policy relevance.
  - Requests for information handled by UKCEH on behalf of NERC under the Freedom of Information Act and Environmental Information Regulations.

- Access levels and release conditions
  - Four-digit grid references: can be released under licence to identify the 10x10 km grid containing each CS square.
  - Six-digit grid references (precise locations): only in VERY EXCEPTIONAL circumstances; applicants must show that their data/IP needs carry equal or higher confidentiality than CS data; UKCEH may preprocess analyses to avoid releasing locations.
  - Spatial data within squares (maps, habitats): could indirectly reveal square locations; released only under the same exceptional terms as six-digit data.
  - Four-digit releases have less stringent IP confidentiality requirements than six-digit releases.

- Licence terms and data stewardship
  - Licensees must keep data confidential, store securely, and restrict access to named individuals with legitimate project need.
  - Licences are finite and tied to specific projects; data must be destroyed at the end of the licence period.
  - No data or derivatives should be shared with third parties that could compromise square confidentiality; data must not be used to plan visits or to check landowner compliance.
  - Licensees may need to provide evidence of JCOP-equivalent project management standards.
  - Four-digit releases include a clause preventing attempts to derive exact square locations.

- Process, responsibilities, and governance
  - UKCEH, on behalf of NERC, decides on exceptional releases and issues hardcopy licences with appropriate clauses.
  - If approval is denied, procedures under FOI/Environmental Information Regulations are followed.
  - UKCEH provides an annual report detailing licence applications, decisions, and grounds.
  - For internal CS partners, UKCEH aims to provide reasonable pre-processing support within moderate demand; requests from other organisations are case-by-case.
  - Partners are encouraged to consult UKCEH before using data covered by this policy; collaboration or payment arrangements are negotiated case-by-case.
