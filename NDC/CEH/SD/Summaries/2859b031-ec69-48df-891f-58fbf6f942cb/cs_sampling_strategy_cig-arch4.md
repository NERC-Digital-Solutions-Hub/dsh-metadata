# The Sampling Strategy for Countryside Survey

- Purpose: Describe the field survey sampling framework used for Countryside Survey (CS) through 2007 and how it evolved from the ITE Land Classification over 30 years.
- Core idea: Use a stratified, random sampling design based on an environmental Land Classification to ensure representative coverage of Great Britain’s countryside and to support robust national and sub-national estimates.

## Key concepts and data system

- ITE Land Classification: An environmental stratification system that groups land into discrete classes (originally 32, later expanded to 40, then 45 for Wales adjustments) to guide sampling and national estimations.
- Stratified random sampling: Within each land class, samples are drawn randomly to avoid bias and ensure representative coverage of ecological and land-use variation.
- Sample unit: 1 km2 squares; the centre square of a 15 x 15 km grid was used in early work, with surrounding squares classified to extend representativeness.
- Survey fundamentals: For each class, a target number of squares is sampled to provide reliable national estimates; field surveys collect vegetation, soils, land use, habitat maps, and related features.

## Evolution by survey year and methodological changes

- 1978 – Initial Land Classification and Field Survey
  - ISA (Indicator Species Analysis) used to classify 1 km squares into 32 Land Classes from environmental data.
  - Selected 256 squares (8 per class) for field survey across GB; habitat areas estimated from mean values per class.
- 1984 – Second Field Survey
  - Sample expanded to 12 squares per class (384 total); results based on the original 1978 Land Classification.
- 1990 – All Squares Land Classification (CS1990)
  - Land Classification revised to classify every GB square; 508 squares surveyed.
  - Repeated data collection from 1978 framework plus added features linked to the first Land Cover Map of GB.
- 1998 – Revised Land Classification (CS1998)
  - Classification expanded to 40 classes to support Scotland reporting; survey of 569 squares.
  - National estimates aligned with the updated classification; introduced separate reporting of Scotland.
- 2000 – Countryside Survey 2000 (CS2000)
  - Addressed policy needs for England & Wales vs. Scotland reporting; adjustments to enable country-unit estimates.
  - Sub-division of Land Classes into country-unit versions (e.g., 5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) creating 45 strata.
  - Additional squares added to ensure adequate representation in Wales; reallocation to maintain representation across countries; Wales became more heavily sampled than England or Scotland.
  - Separate upland habitat module added to improve estimates for upland England and Wales.
- 2007 – Countryside Survey 2007 (CS2007)
  - Further adjustments to Wales-only reporting; introduced additional Welsh sub-classes (5w, 6w, 7w, 15w, 18w) and 43 extra Welsh squares to ensure minimum representation in Welsh classes.
  - England adjustments: two English classes (5e, 15e) retained at 4 squares per class due to precision considerations.
  - Result: 45 strata with enhanced Welsh representation; the revised England-Wales-Scotland framework used for reporting.

## Country reporting and Wales upland emphasis

- Separate country estimates: Implemented to deliver England & Wales and Scotland-specific results, in response to devolved policy needs.
- Welsh reporting enhancements: Welsh-specific Land Class subdivisions and additional samples to improve Wales-only precision; dedicated upland sampling to improve country-relevant estimates.
- England: some reductions in sample counts for certain classes were acceptable given scoping study guidance and precision considerations.

## Data quality, consistency, and governance considerations

- Classification changes affect comparability: Transitioning between land classifications can influence national stock estimates; guidance favors using the latest country-specific classification for internal consistency, while acknowledging cross-survey consistency needs.
- Representation and sampling balance: The move to country-unit classifications and additional Wales samples aimed to ensure adequate representation across all classes within each country unit.
- Upland emphasis: Additional upland modules improved statistical accuracy for upland habitats, addressing prior under-sampling in these areas.
- Coverage and updates: The strategy continually adapts to policy needs and structural changes in classification to maintain relevant, policy-aligned data outputs.

## Outputs and usage

- National and country-level estimates: Calculated using class-level areas and square-level data, enabling habitat and land-use statistics for GB and its constituent countries.
- Repeated measures: The long-running, time-series design supports change detection and trend analysis across survey cycles.
- Accessibility and dissemination: Findings underpin Countryside Survey final reports (e.g., 1990 main report, 1993 CS1990 outputs, 2000 CS2000, 2007 CS) and related environmental policy assessments.

## Practical implications for data leadership

- Design integrity: A robust, stratified sampling framework anchored in a consistent land-classification system is essential for representative data and trustworthy trend analysis.
- Temporal comparability: When classifications change, maintain a clear strategy for cross-year comparability and documentation of classification versions used in estimates.
- Country-specific needs: Align sampling framework with devolved policy requirements by implementing country-unit classifications and ensuring adequate class representation within each country.
- Data governance: Maintain thorough metadata on land-class definitions, country subdivisions, and sampling rates to support discoverability, quality assessments, and future reuse.
