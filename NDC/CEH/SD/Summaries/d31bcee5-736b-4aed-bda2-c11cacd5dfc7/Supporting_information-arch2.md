# Plant and carabid beetle surveys and bird surveys in fenced reforestation sites in the Scottish Highlands

- Aim and purpose
  - Use standardized biodiversity data to assess environmental health and the value of native reforestation in the Scottish Highlands.
  - Provide outputs suitable for policy scrutiny over time, using clear formats (plots, maps, tables) and ensuring data are stored and accessible.

- Context and motivation
  - The Highlands are thought to have been extensively forested in the past; forest cover declined thousands of years ago due to human/climatic factors.
  - Native forest expansion is a policy priority, particularly for Caledonian Pineforest restoration.
  - Current barriers to regeneration include overgrazing by deer, which suppresses tree establishment.

- Study design and sites
  - 14 fenced native reforestation sites established between 1990 and 2012 in Glen Affric and Glen Moriston.
  - Sites fenced to exclude grazing (primarily deer); some areas have residual grazing by feral boar and sheep.
  - Reforestation plots planted with native Caledonian Pineforest species from local seed sources; site planting methods included hand screefing and machine mounding.
  - Matched reference plots:
    - Unforested, grazed
    - Unforested, ungrazed
    - Mature Caledonian pineforest (at five plots across three sites)
  - Data collected for plants and carabid beetles in 2018; birds in 2019.
  - Sampling pairs: five pairs of ungrazed and grazed plots within mature forest to reflect target habitat; reforestation plots paired with nearest unforested plots to control for topography and elevation.

- Plot layout and sampling design
  - Plant and carabid surveys: 10 × 10 m plots; 50 m radius plots for birds.
  - Treatments represented in all combinations except reforestation × grazed (not present due to deer pressure).
  - Bird surveys conducted in a subset of 10 of the 14 reforestation sites; two surveys per plot, weather noted.
  - Mature forest plots: five plots (grazed and ungrazed) across two sites, separated by at least 500 m between plots to ensure independence.
  - Plot locations and sampling dates were designed to allow comparisons across habitat states (reforestation, unforested, mature) and grazing statuses (grazed, ungrazed).

- Data collection methods
  - Plants
    - Surveyed 22 June – 5 July 2018.
    - Three randomly placed 1 × 1 m quadrats per plot; full plot inventory for species not found in quadrats.
    - Vascular plants identified to species; non-vasculars to genus or morphospecies; pressure on certain taxa for identification.
    - Abundance recorded as a percentage cover using the DOMIN scale.
  - Carabid beetles
    - Surveys 7 June – 18 August 2018.
    - Six pitfall traps per plot (two traps per plant quadrat).
    - Traps filled with 1:3 propylene glycol:water; collected at multiple intervals; specimens identified to species.
    - Voucher specimens deposited in Oxford University Museum of Natural History.
  - Birds
    - Surveys conducted during two windows in 2019 (late May to early June).
    - 15-minute surveys per plot, 6 AM – 11:30 AM, with two surveyors covering roughly half the plot each.
    - Birds identified visually or by song/call; recordings noted for weather and survey conditions.
    - One mature ungrazed plot at site 15 not surveyed in the first period due to logistics; two surveys conducted at other plots, with occasional missing records indicating no birds observed.

- Data structure and available datasets
  - plant_carabid_plot_locations.csv: plot-level locations and treatment metadata; pitfall trap dates and collection dates.
  - bird_plot_locations.csv: bird plot locations and treatment metadata; weather notes for bird surveys.
  - plants.csv: plant species presence and percent cover (three 1 m quadrats per plot); additional species in plot; DOMIN scores; seedling frequency.
  - carabids.csv: carabid species frequencies per plot; time of sampling; species names.
  - birds.csv: bird species frequencies per plot; date, time, distance from plot center; how observed.
  - Data collection timeline and fieldwork details are embedded in methods, with dates spanning 2018 (plants, beetles) and 2019 (birds).
  - Location data use a structured coding system for sites, plots, years, and plot types; some fields are placeholders or NA where not applicable.

- Data accessibility and quality
  - Data are organized to compare across habitat states (reforestation, unforested, mature) and grazing status.
  - Standardised collection and recording procedures enable cross-site comparisons and potential data integration with other biodiversity datasets.
  - Clear documentation of sampling methods, plot layout, and data fields supports data quality assurance and reuse.

- Challenges and opportunities for data value
  - Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by integrating with additional environmental datasets (e.g., climate, deer density, habitat structure).
  - Improving access to underlying data to enable broader analyses and secondary use by researchers and policy-makers.

- Appendix and authorship
  - Roles of authors in experimental design, background information, data collection, and field facilitation are documented (e.g., Emily Warner, Andy Hector, Owen Lewis, Nick Brown, etc.).
