# Supporting information for arable crop yield data for the Hillesden Experimental Platform, UK collected between 2006 and 2011

## Overview
- Location: Hillesden Estate, Buckinghamshire, central England (900 ha total).
- Environment: heavy clay soils, relatively flat topography, 2–3 m hedgerows along field boundaries.
- Farming context: large, homogeneous arable fields with a simple rotation (autumn-sown first wheat followed by break crops such as oilseed rape or field beans, then back to wheat); conventional inputs used to maximise yield.
- Experimental aim: assess effects of converting varying proportions of arable land to wildlife habitat to support biodiversity, pollinators, and natural pest enemies, against a Business as Usual (BAU) control.

## Experimental Design
- Timeframe: September 2005–2011 randomized block experiment.
- Structure: five contiguous replicate blocks (150–180 ha each). Within each block, three treatments randomly assigned to discrete field groups (total ~50–60 ha per group):
  - BAU control: fields cropped to the edge; no land removed from production.
  - ELS (Entry Level Stewardship): 1% land converted to wildlife habitat at field edges/corners.
  - ELS extra (ELSX): additional habitats with greater land removed (total 6% out of production), including multiple 0.5 ha patches with diverse wildflowers, grasses, and seed-bearing plants for biodiversity and leverage for pollinators and natural enemies.

## Data Collection and Measures
- Yield data: measured annually (2005–2011) for three crops in each field (n=56) using the onboard Quantimeter yield meter on a CLAAS Lexion 580+ harvester; accuracy stated >97%.
- Calculation of yields:
  - Yield per field per year summarized to tonnes.
  - Two yield metrics:
    - Yield/ha based on cropped area (area remaining after habitat creation).
    - Yield/ha based on whole field area (including habitat-created areas).
- Standardisation: field yields divided by year-specific regional averages from Defra (for winter wheat and oilseed rape); national average used for field beans due to lack of regional data.

## Data Structure and Column Definitions
- Year: year of data collection (YYYY).
- Block: replicate identifier (1–5) within the randomized design.
- Treatment: cross-compliance, ELS, or ELSX.
- Field Name: field identifier.
- Field Area: total field area (ha) from farm records.
- Crop: crop type (winter wheat, oilseed rape, field bean).
- Quantity: total yield (tonnes) per field.
- Yield/ha: crop yield per hectare.
- Defra SE regional average yield t/ha: published regional average yield per crop/year.
- Ratio: Hillesden yield relative to Defra regional average.
- Notes: description of how average yield data were derived.

## Particular Considerations for Environmental Monitoring
- The dataset enables comparison of ecological intensification (habitat creation) effects on production while maintaining a standardized, cross-year format.
- Standardization to Defra regional averages supports scrutiny of environmental health and policy performance over time.
- Data design supports broader integration with other environmental datasets and facilitates data access and reuse by downstream analysts.
