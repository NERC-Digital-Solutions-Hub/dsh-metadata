# Palaeoecological proxy data recovered from lake sediments, surface soil and moss pollsters within the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador

## Overview
- Multi-proxy palaeoecological dataset from eastern Andean cloud forest, Ecuador, covering late Quaternary to modern times.
- Proxies included: pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), micro-charcoal, macro-charcoal, loss-on-ignition (LOI), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
- Field sites: Napo Province (Lake Huila and Vinillos cliff section) and contemporary moss/soil/moss polster samples (M1–M5); ages span from ~45–42 ka (Vinillos) to modern, with Lake Huila ~1 ka to recent.
- Purpose: to understand how ecosystem dynamics were driven by anthropogenic, physical and climatic factors over time.
- Analysis conducted 2014–2015 at The Open University (UK); data provided as 14 CSV files.

## Files Included
- 14 CSV data files:
  - Huila_LOI.csv, Vinillos_LOI.csv
  - Modern_NPP.csv, Huila_NPP.csv, Vinillos_NPP.csv
  - Huila_Pollen.csv, Vinillos_Pollen.csv
  - Huila_Microcharcoal.csv, Vinillos_Microcharcoal.csv
  - Huila_Macrocharcoal.csv, Vinillos_Macrocharcoal.csv
  - Huila_XRF.csv, Vinillos_XRF.csv

## Sampling Regime
- Lake Huila: coring with Livingstone piston; overlapping cores up to 2.09 m; sample handling and cold storage.
- Vinillos cliff section: two sections (A and B); sampling every 5 cm through organic layers; discrete bulk samples from tephra layers.
- Modern samples: moss polsters (M1–M2), surface soil (M3–M4), and lake surface sediment (M5); collected at ground level and stored cold.

## Proxy Data and Methods
- Palynology (pollen and NPP): organic sediments processed with standard prep (KOH, HF, Acetolysis); tephra samples processed with density separation; Lycopodium spore marker added for concentration calculations; counts to a minimum of 300 terrestrial pollen grains per sample; taxonomic identification to the finest possible level; NPPs identified using broad literature references; new NPP morphotypes assigned (OU-prefix) and published elsewhere.
- Micro-charcoal: counted on the same slides as palynomorphs; 200x magnification; fragments 5–100 μm; 50 random fields; concentrations expressed as fragments per 1 cm³ of sediment.
- Macro-charcoal: deflocculated, sieved, and counted from 1 cm³ of sediment (>100 μm) under a low-power microscope.
- LOI: sediment dried, combusted at 550°C (4 h) and 950°C (2 h); organic carbon inferred from weight loss.
- XRF (major elements): analysis on tephra layers and internal standards to determine SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5; glass discs prepared for analysis.

## Metadata and Coding
- Metadata table (Table 3) documents column headings and codes, including:
  - Sample_location, Sample_number, and where samples were recovered or which standard was used.
  - Preparation methods for palynomorphs (e.g., hydrofluoric acid, density separation).
  - NPP morphotype prefixes (OU, LH, V, HdV, IBB, UG, TM) and their meaning.
- Clear documentation supports reproducibility, data provenance, and cross-dataset comparability.

## Relevance to Monitoring Frameworks
- Demonstrates a robust, multi-proxy approach to reconstruct environmental drivers over time, informing environmental health indicators and policy evaluation.
- Highlights the importance of:
  - Comprehensive metadata and standardized processing methods to enable data sharing and reuse.
  - Quality assurance and transparent data governance when opening datasets for public scrutiny.
  - Integration of historical (palaeo) data with modern samples to contextualize current environmental health.
- Provides a template for assembling, validating, and disseminating monitoring data that can inform future decision-making in environmental management.

## Challenges and Considerations for Monitoring Authors
- Ensuring metadata completeness and clarity to verify data meet standards across users and time.
- Balancing public data sharing with the need to protect sensitive or high-resolution information.
- Maintaining up-to-date data and consistency in processing methods to avoid comparability issues.
- Addressing data silos by documenting provenance and promoting cross-institutional data sharing and governance.

## Implications for Policy and Practice
- Long-term ecological context supports policy decisions on land use, forest management, and climate adaptation in montane Andean ecosystems.
- The dataset underscores the value of transparent data governance and accessible, well-documented datasets for ongoing environmental monitoring and evaluation.
