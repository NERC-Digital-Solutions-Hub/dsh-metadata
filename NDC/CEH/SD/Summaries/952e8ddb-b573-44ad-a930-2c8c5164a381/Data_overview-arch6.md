# Overview

- Purpose: Palaeoecological proxy data from the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador to understand ecosystem dynamics driven by anthropogenic, physical, and climatic influences through the late Quaternary.
- Data types included: pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), micro-charcoal, macro-charcoal, loss-on-ignition (LOI), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
- Collection and analysis timeline: field sampling conducted in 2012–2013; laboratory analyses completed in 2014–2015 at The Open University (UK).

## Sampling Sites and Samples

- Study areas:
  - Lake Huila, Ecuador (age range: 1 ka to recent) — lake sediment core samples.
  - Vinillos cliff section — two sections (A upper, B lower) with sediment/tephra layers.
  - Modern samples: moss polsters (M1–M2), surface soils (M3–M4), and a lake surface sediment (M5).
- Location and sampling details:
  - Table 1 provides sample locations, coordinates, substrate type, altitude, and modern vegetation.
  - Table 2 summarizes field samples and subsampling counts for each site.
- Core and section sampling regime:
  - Lake Huila: Livingstone corer on a floating platform; overlapping cores, longest core Huila-E to 2.09 m.
  - Vinillos cliff: sampling every 5 cm through organic layers; discrete samples from volcanic tephra layers.
  - Modern samples: collected at ground level; stored at 4°C.

## Proxy Data and Methods

- Palynology (pollen and NPP):
  - 1 cm³ organic sediments processed with standard prep (KOH, HF, acetolysis).
  - Tephra samples processed with density separation due to high siliciclastic content.
  - Lycopodium tablet spore addition used to determine palynomorph concentrations.
  - Pollen and NPP counted to a minimum of 300 terrestrial pollen grains per sample; taxa identified to the highest possible taxonomic rank.
  - NPP morphotypes coded with prefixes (OU, LH, V, HdV, IBB, UG, TM) per literature.
- Micro-charcoal:
  - Counts on slides prepared for palynomorphs; 200x magnification; charcoal fragments counted in 50 random fields; expressed as fragments per 1 cm³ of sediment.
- Macro-charcoal:
  - Sediments deflocculated, sieved >100 μm; counts from 1 cm³ per sample under 20x; identified by form and reflectivity.
- LOI (Loss on Ignition):
  - LOI procedure: drying at 40°C, ignition at 550°C (4 hours) for organic matter, then 950°C (2 hours) for carbonates; organic matter expressed as percentage of dry weight.
- XRF (X-ray fluorescence) major elements:
  - Analyses performed on tephra layers and internal/external standards.
  - Glass disks produced and measured for SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5.
  - Instrumentation: ARL 8420+ dual goniometer wavelength-dispersive XRF spectrometer at The Open University.
- Metadata and data coding:
  - Table 3 documents column headings and codes (e.g., Sample_location, Sample_number; prep methods; NPP morphotype prefixes).
  - Descriptions clarify processing methods (hydrofluoric acid vs. density separation) and morphotype references (OU, LH/V, HdV, IBB, UG, TM).

## Data Structure and Accessibility

- Data structure:
  - Each data type has a dedicated CSV (e.g., Huila_LOI.csv, Vinillos_NPP.csv, Modern_Pollen.csv, etc.), enabling cross-dataset integration.
  - Metadata notes and column descriptions provided to support data reuse and interoperability.
- Usage potential:
  - Enables paleoenvironmental reconstructions, cross-site comparisons, and integration with other regional datasets.
  - Supports self-serve analysis through clearly labelled variables and standardized counting/preparation methods.

## Laboratory and Equipment Details

- Processing laboratory: The Open University (UK).
- Microscopy: Nikon Eclipse 50i used for counting palynomorphs.
- Charcoal and LOI analyses followed established protocols cited in references (e.g., Faegri & Iversen, 1989; Heiri et al., 2001).

## References and Standard Methods

- Methods and identifications aligned with a broad set of palaeoecological references for pollen, NPP, charcoal, LOI, and XRF techniques (cited within the document).
