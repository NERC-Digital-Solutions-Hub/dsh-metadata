# Palaeoecological proxy data from the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador

- Purpose and scope
  - Palaeoecological proxy data recovered from lake sediments, surface soil, and moss pollsters in the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador.
  - Aimed at understanding how ecosystem dynamics were driven by anthropogenic, physical, and climatic factors through the late Quaternary.
  - Data include multiple proxies to reconstruct past environments: pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), micro-charcoal, macro-charcoal, loss-on-ignition (LOI), and XRF major element data.

- Study sites and sampling context
  - Lake Huila (Napo province, eastern Andean flank)
    - Age range: 1 ka to recent
    - Substrate: lake sediment archive
    - Elevation: 2608 m
    - Modern vegetation: pasture
  - Vinillos cliff section (cliff exposure)
    - Age: ~45–42 ka
    - Substrate: cliff sediment archive
    - Elevation: 2090 m
    - Modern vegetation: secondary forest
  - Modern samples from multiple substrates
    - M1–M5 (modern)
    - Substrates include moss polsters, surface soils, and lake surface sediment
    - Elevations: ~1798–2611 m
    - Modern vegetation: various (secondary/riparian forest)

- Field sampling regime and sample characteristics
  - Lake Huila: Livingstone corer with piston modification; core lengths up to 1 m; overlapping cores; longest core Huila-E ~2.09 m.
  - Vinillos cliff: two sections (A and B); sampling every 5 cm through organic layers; discrete bulk samples from tephra layers.
  - Modern samples: collected by hand; stored at 4°C until processing.
  - Sample counts (typical): Huila cores analyzed for pollen (28), NPP (26), micro-charcoal (26), macro-charcoal (50), LOI (23); Vinillos logged pollen (26), NPP (26), micro-charcoal (29), macro-charcoal (33), LOI (50), geochemistry (4); modern samples (M1–M5) for pollen, NPP, micro- and macro-charcoal, LOI, and geochemistry as applicable.

- Proxy data and laboratory methods
  - Palynology (pollen and NPP): organic sediments processed with standard KOH, HF, acetolysis; tephra samples processed with density separation; Lycopodium spikes added for concentration calculations; slides mounted in glycerol and counted at 400–600x.
  - Non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP): identified using extensive literature; new morphotypes recorded with OU prefix (Open University) and described in Loughlin et al. (2018); prefixes LH and V indicate morphotypes not meeting persistence/abundance thresholds.
  - Micro-charcoal: counted on pollen slides; 200x magnification; fragments 5–100 μm; concentrations expressed as fragments per cm³ of sediment.
  - Macro-charcoal: deflocculated, sieved (>100 μm), counted per cm³ at 20x; used Bogorov tray for counting.
  - LOI: sequential drying and burning (40°C dry, 550°C organic matter burn, 950°C carbonate burn) to estimate organic and carbonate content; results expressed as percent dry weight.
  - XRF (major elements): analyzed tephra layers and internal standards using glass discs and a wavelength-dispersive XRF spectrometer to determine SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5.

- Data structure, metadata, and nomenclature
  - Metadata and codes describe sampling, preparation, and analysis methods:
    - NPP prefixes: OU (Open University morphotypes), LH/V (distinct morphotypes not meeting filters), HdV (Hugo de Vries-Laboratory), IBB (Institut Botànic de Barcelona), UG (Universiteit Gent), TM (Université Toulouse-le Mirail).
    - Table 3 explains selected column headers and codes (e.g., Sample_location, Sample_number, Preparation_method).
  - Taxonomic resolution: pollen and NPP identified to the highest possible taxonomic level using reference materials and pollen atlases; a broad literature base used for NPP identification.

- Data governance, quality, and accessibility
  - Samples stored at The Open University in a cold room (4°C) until required.
  - Laboratory methods adhere to established standards and literature, enabling reproducibility and cross-study comparison.
  - The dataset provides a multi-proxy, well-documented data package with explicit methods, sample coverage, and processing details, facilitating reuse and integration into broader data ecosystems and networks.

- References and methodological context
  - Cited foundational methodologies and prior work for palynology, non-pollen palynomorphs, tephrochronology, LOI, and XRF analyses.
  - Key methodological sources include Faegri & Iversen (1989), Moore et al. (1991), Stockmarr (1971), Heiri et al. (2001), Thomas & Haukka (1978), and a suite of palynological and paleoenvironmental studies cited in support of identification and interpretation.

- Relevance for data leadership and data stewardship
  - Demonstrates robust data curation: multi-proxy data with clear sampling design, standardized lab workflows, and explicit metadata.
  - Emphasizes data discoverability and reuse through well-documented file naming, metadata conventions, and explicit references to morphotype coding and data provenance.
  - Highlights the importance of timeliness, accessibility, and interoperability across data types (pollen, NPP, charcoal, LOI, XRF) for cross-functional use in policy, research networks, and collaborative data ecosystems.
