# Palaeoecological proxy data from the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador

## Overview
- Palaeoecological proxy data were recovered from lake sediments, surface soil, and moss pollsters in the eastern Andean cloud forest of Ecuador (late Quaternary focus).
- Proxies included: pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP), micro-charcoal, macro-charcoal, loss-on-ignition (LOI), and X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
- Field work conducted in 2012–2013 (Napo province); laboratory analyses completed in 2014–2015 at The Open University, UK.
- Aimed to understand how ecosystem dynamics were driven by anthropogenic, physical, and climatic factors over time.

## Study area and sampling
- Location: Napo province, eastern Andean flank of Ecuador (montane cloud forest) as illustrated in sample-location figure.
- Sampling regimes:
  - Lake Huila: 128 cm sediment core; the longest core Huila-E reached 2.09 m; coring used Livingstone corer from a floating platform.
  - Vinillos cliff section: two sections (A and B); sampling every 5 cm through organic layers; discrete bulk samples from tephra layers.
  - Modern analogs (M1–M5): moss polsters (M1–M2), surface soil (M3–M4), lake surface sediment (M5).
- Ages:
  - Lake Huila: ~1 ka to present.
  - Vinillos section: ~45–42 ka.
  - Modern samples: contemporary (M1–M5).

## Field and laboratory methods
- Palynology (pollen and NPP):
  - Organic sediments processed using standard prep (potassium hydroxide, hydrofluoric acid, acetolysis).
  - Tephra processed with density separation due to siliciclastic content.
  - Exotic marker Lycopodium spores added to determine concentrations.
  - Slides mounted in glycerol; counting at 400× and 600×.
  - Pollen/NPP identified to the highest possible taxonomic level; reference materials and atlases used.
  - Counting continued until at least 300 terrestrial pollen grains per sample.
- Non-pollen palynomorphs (NPP):
  - Identified with literature and established morphotype prefixes (OU, LH, V, HdV, IBB, UG) as described in related publications.
- Micro- and macro-charcoal:
  - Micro-charcoal: counted on palynology slides; 200× magnification; charcoal fragments 5–100 μm; 50 random fields; expressed as fragments per 1 cm³ of sediment.
  - Macro-charcoal: deflocculated in KOH, sieved (>100 μm); counted per 1 cm³ sediment under microscopy.
- LOI (loss-on-ignition):
  - Drying at 40°C, then sequential combustion at 550°C (4 h) and 950°C (2 h).
  - Mass loss converted to percentage of dry weight to estimate organic carbon and carbonate content.
- XRF (major element analysis):
  - Performed on tephra layers (Lake Huila) and Vinillos tephra layers, plus internal standards.
  - Glass disks analyzed with ARL 8420+ XRF to obtain SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O, K2O, P2O5.

## Data structure and metadata
- Data files include detailed sample information (locations, depths, substrates, modern vegetation, ages).
- Table 3 (metadata descriptions) clarifies:
  - Sample_location, Sample_number
  - Preparation methods (e.g., HF acid, density separation)
  - Descriptions for NPP morphotypes and mapping of prefixes (OU, LH, V, HdV, IBB, UG) to published references

## Relevance for environmental monitoring and policy performance
- Provides long-term, multi-proxy records of environmental change and drivers (anthropogenic, climate, volcanic tephra) enabling assessment of ecosystem health over the late Quaternary to present.
- Uses standardized, well-documented laboratory and field procedures, facilitating data quality assurance, reproducibility, and integration with other datasets.
- Outputs are designed for clear communication via standard formats (CSV) and can be incorporated into monitoring dashboards, trend analyses, and policy evaluation frameworks.
- Aims to enhance data value by enabling access to underlying raw data and by enabling cross-dataset analyses (e.g., combining palynology with geochemistry and charcoal records).

## Notes on accessibility and usage
- Data are organized into clearly named CSV files with accompanying methodological metadata, enabling reuse by analysts for environmental monitoring, paleoenvironmental reconstructions, and cross-site comparisons.
- The dataset aligns with the Aims of environmental-monitoring analysts: verify and transform data from established sources, apply standardized methods, and present outputs (including maps/charts) while ensuring datasets are stored in appropriate repositories.
