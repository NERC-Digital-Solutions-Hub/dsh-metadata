# The Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)

- A field handbook and data-collection instrument for the Countryside Survey week-by-week Lowland Heath survey, designed to standardise data collection, minimise observer bias, and enable repeatable monitoring of habitat change.

## Aim and scope (for Data Stewards)

- Ensure consistent, high-quality data on land cover, boundaries, and vegetation to support monitoring and policy analysis.
- Provide a replicable methodology aligned with CS1990 standards, enabling updates and cross-site comparisons.
- Cover 80 stratified 1 km squares across England with two-person survey teams, collecting both map-based data and field-quad vegetation data.

## Data collection workflow and governance

- Sampling design
  - Stratified sample of 80 1 km squares; survey spread across southern to northern England.
  - Each square surveyed by a two-person team; average one team-day per square, with more time for lowland heath squares.
- Team logistics and permissions
  - Central Survey Leader coordinates permissions; survey teams obtain landowner access in advance.
  - Guidelines for handling permission withdrawal, partial access, or new site replacement.
- Daily process and QA
  - End-of-day checks to ensure complete, legible data; no back-entry unless essential.
  - FABs transported to Merlewood Research Station; emphasis on data integrity and traceability.
- Compliance and governance
  - Identity, ownership, and stakeholder information collected and mapped for each square.
  - Emphasis on standardised procedures to support future resurvey and data provenance.

## Field equipment and logistics

- Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, 1:10,000 maps, aerial photos, field handouts, marker plates, measuring tools, etc.).
- Surveyor-provided items (clothing, personal gear, camera, field books).
- Aerial photographs used as aids but not altered in the field.

## Field procedures and data capture

- General field survey approach
  - On arrival: surveyors assess site, plan routing to cover the whole square, note barriers or access issues.
  - Aerial imagery used as ground-truthing aids; photographs secured and returned after use.
  - Emphasis on consistent recording across observers; standardise approach via the Field Handbook QA.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) structure
  - Front and ownership pages; farmer/landowner information; land cover map and recording form; boundaries map and recording form; historical features; up to 25 quadrat recording forms; map pages.
  - All pages to be completed neatly; series numbers and locations clearly logged.
- Ownership and access
  - Detailed ownership mapping for each square; scoring of owner cooperativeness for potential future surveys.
  - Guidance on what to do if access is limited or withdrawn.

## Land cover and boundary recording (codes and methodology)

- Data capture via two sheets per square
  - Land cover sheet (1:10,000 map) for a 25-point grid plus quadrat data in lowland heath areas.
  - Boundaries sheet to describe boundaries (hedges, fences, walls, banks, watercourses, urban boundaries, etc.).
- Coding system
  - Codes derived from CS1990; primary codes describe dominant land-cover or boundary type, with secondary qualifiers as needed.
  - Up to three primary codes allowed per feature; codes linked in logical sequences (e.g., land cover then adjacent boundary).
  - For each point, a string of codes is entered to reflect land cover and nearby boundary information.
- Field rules and interpretation
  - Guidance on where points fall on linear features and how to record land cover and boundaries accordingly.
  - Special handling for built environments, curtilages, and non-physical boundaries.
- Documentation and quality
  - FABs include serialized pages: ownership, land cover map, boundaries map, historical features, quadrat forms, and maps.
  - Clear instructions on completing codes, mapping, and drawing connections between points and boundaries.

## Vegetation recording and quadrats

- Quadrat placement and purpose
  - Quadrats (2 x 2 m) placed at 25 points within lowland heath landscapes to capture acid-soil indicative vegetation.
  - Permanent quadrat marking to enable future resampling; two metal marker plates placed diagonally (SE and NW corners).
- Vegetation recording framework
  - Standardised 200-species list for herb, grass, bryophyte, moss, and lichen recording.
  - Quadrats capture species presence and cover using 5% intervals; unlisted species recorded separately.
  - The header on recording sheets captures environmental context (slope, aspect, shade, soil type, and general description).
- Orientation and laying out quadrats
  - Establish ground markers, lay out quadrat with reference to a central point, and record orientation and distances with tapes and compass bearings.
  - Diagonals measured to ensure a square shape; quadrats tied to precise locations for the future resurvey.
- Data capture and species identification
  - Surveyors should aim for species-level identification; if uncertain, record to the nearest taxon or use accepted combinations (as per CS1990 standards).
  - The sheet includes a long list of common species with abbreviated codes and associated full names to aid consistency.

## Data storage, management, and future use

- Data permanence and resurvey
  - Permanent quadrat marking ensures the ability to re-locate plots in future surveys.
  - Detailed sketches, maps, and coded data support long-term monitoring and trend analysis.
- Data quality and standardisation
  - The Field Handbook emphasizes standardised terminology, coding, and methodology to minimise observer bias.
  - QA processes and explicit field guidelines help ensure consistent, comparable data across observers and years.

## Additional elements and supplementary data

- Archaeological features
  - A map is provided for noting and describing archaeological features within each square.
- Documentation and photography
  - Photographs with scale included for vegetation plots; direction and position of photos documented on the sketch map.

## End-of-survey procedures

- Post-survey steps
  - Review FABs for completeness and clarity; address omissions if feasible.
  - Return FABs promptly to Merlewood; ensure data integrity and traceability for downstream analyses.

## Key challenges and considerations for Data Stewards

- Ensuring complete alignment with user needs while preserving standardisation across sites.
- Managing data interoperability with prior CS1990 datasets and future updates.
- Handling variations in land ownership, access, and multi-system land-use contexts.
- Maintaining robust QA to minimise observer bias and ensure reproducibility of results.
- Facilitating timely data availability for policy and research use through consistent data pipelines and documentation.
