# Lowland Heath Field Handbook (Draft 1992)

- Purpose and scope
  - Standardize data collection for landscape-type surveys to support monitoring change, policy, and environmental management.
  - Emphasizes replicable, objective data with a strong QA program to reduce observer bias.
  - Focuses on lowland heath as the first landscape type; other types (river valleys, calcareous grasslands, coasts, uplands) are defined for later surveying.
  - Aims for products that enable analysis and self-service use (maps, codes, quadrats, and vegetation data).

- Survey design and data approach
  - Stratified sample of 80 1-km squares, spanning southern England to northern sites (Leeds and Penrith).
  - For each square:
    - Describe land cover and boundaries at 25 regular points.
    - Record vegetation in 2 x 2 m quadrats at each lowland heath point.
  - Use Countryside Survey 1990 (CS1990) codes for land cover and boundaries; produce coded data strings for each map.
  - Permanent quadrats are established and marked for potential later resurvey; QA and standardization are central to data quality.

- Field data collection and Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
  - Each square generates a Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) combining a land cover map, boundaries map, ownership, and quadrat data.
  - FAB pages must be neat and legible to support later analysis; each FAB includes:
    - Front cover with square/location info and ownership status
    - Farmer/landowner information and cooperation assessment
    - Land cover and boundaries recording forms
    - Historical features and 25 quadrat forms
  - Ground position, map grids, and ownership details are recorded to support subsequent sampling and follow-up surveys.

- Ownership, permissions, and access
  - Permissions are required to access land; early contact with landowners is encouraged.
  - If access is partially granted, rules apply to whether the square can be surveyed.
  - Survey teams must confirm permissions before surveying; contact the Survey Leader if access is withdrawn.

- Field logistics and equipment
  - Survey teams: two persons per team, working collaboratively; flexible scheduling with limited overtime; travel and lodging arranged by the Survey Leader.
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, maps, aerial photos, marker plates, etc.) and by surveyors (clothing, camera, etc.).
  - Site records and aerial photographs should be protected and returned to Merlewood after surveying.

- Field procedures and data collection guidelines
  - On-site survey approach varies by land type; aim to cover the entire square with a suitable route that minimizes re-visits.
  - Aerial photographs may be used as locating aids but must not be marked or altered.
  - For each 1-km square, 25 ground points are described for land cover and a 20 m boundary length is measured per point (when within 100 m).
  - Special rules apply for points on boundaries, built environments, or linear features (roads/railways).

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) structure and data entry
  - FAB includes:
    - Ownership map with detailed ownership splits and cooperative rating
    - Land cover map and qualitative boundary descriptions
    - Up to 25 quadrat recording forms
    - Quadrats positioned using compass bearings and transects; permanents marked with metal plates for relocation
  - Codes and data entry rules:
    - Land cover and boundary codes follow CS1990 conventions; primary codes link logically to descriptive codes
    - Variables include: land cover type, boundary type, boundary height, and length, along with qualitative notes
    - Each map section lists 25 points (A, etc.) with code strings describing land cover and boundaries
  - Vegetation and species recording
    - Quadrat vegetation is recorded with a standard form listing ~200 common species; cover estimated in 5% increments
    - Species lists include grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens; unlisted species recorded separately
    - Ground flora, shrubs, and trees are described; trees within woodland follow separate woodland codes
    - Permanent quadrats include a sketch map, perpendicular measurements, and photographic documentation

- Vegetation sampling and quadrats
  - Quadrats are placed to sample acid-soil indicative vegetation with potential to become lowland heath under management
  - Orientation, layout, and measurement procedures ensure consistent quadrat placement and repeatability
  - Species identification guidelines emphasize consistency with prior surveys; some species combinations are recorded as taxonomic groups when identification is uncertain
  - Permanent marking and photography protocols ensure future re-surveys can relocate quadrats precisely

- Data coding conventions and examples
  - Land cover and boundary codes combine primary and secondary codes; dominant code governs interpretation
  - Codes cover a wide range of features: grasses, heather, moorland types, agricultural and natural vegetation, and moorland afflictions
  - Tree and woodland coding differentiate individuals, belts, lines, clumps, belts, and forests; canopy cover and age are documented
  - Boundaries include hedges, fences, walls, banks, roads, railways, paths, verges, and track types
  - Built environments and curtilages have dedicated codes; universal and descriptive codes aid cross-site comparability

- Data quality, training, and standardization
  - Observer bias identified as a major source of error; QA programs and a Field Handbook were implemented to standardize recording
  - Surveyors are encouraged to make field decisions on-site; qualifying notes allowed for atypical or doubtful categories
  - The methodology aligns with the 1990 Countryside Survey to enable comparability and integration with broader datasets

- Post-survey procedures and archaeology
  - At day-end, data sheets are reviewed for omissions; FABs are returned to Merlewood promptly
  - Archaeological features are mapped; high points in the landscape are documented with photographs and descriptions

- Outputs and long-term goals for data use
  - Develop methodologies to measure change across landscape types
  - Assess distribution and condition of habitats, including historic features and designation impacts
  - Produce policy-relevant refinements and data products (maps, codes, and standardized datasets) to support planning and environmental management

- Summary of key components to support data support work
  - Standardized field data collection for a stratified sample of 1-km squares
  - Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) as the primary data capture and documentation tool
  - Extensive coding system for land cover, boundaries, vegetation, ownership, and built features
  - Permanent quadrats and comprehensive vegetation recording to enable future monitoring
  - Well-defined permissions, logistics, and QA to ensure data reliability and reusability over time
