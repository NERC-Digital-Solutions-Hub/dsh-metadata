# Field Handbook for Lowland Heath Survey

- Purpose: Provide standardized guidelines for surveying lowland heath as part of the ITE Countryside Survey (England, 1990) to support national land-use and environmental monitoring.
- Scope: Describes objectives, sampling design, data collection methods, tools, data coding, vegetation recording, and post-survey procedures; emphasizes standardization and comparability with Countryside Survey 1990 data.

## Survey Design and Data Architecture

- Sampling design: Stratified sample of 80 1km squares across England, with focus on lowland heath; captures distribution, habitats, historic features, and potential change drivers.
- Per-square sampling: 25 ground points for land cover and boundaries, plus 25 points for boundary description; 2x2m quadrats at heath-indicating points within the square.
- Spatial data products: Data mapped and recorded on 1:10,000 scale FABs (Field Assessment Booklets) and linked to a core CS1990 coding framework for comparability with earlier surveys.
- Timeframe: First landscape-type (lowland heath) surveyed late summer 1992 with other types to follow; project runs 1992–1994.

## Data Collection and Field Procedures

- Team structure and logistics: Two-person survey teams; day-by-day planning guided by a Survey Leader; emphasis on minimizing site revisits; five-night weekly accommodation assumption; travel and time management rules.
- Permissions: Access negotiations with landowners/farmers; ensure permission before surveys; procedures for partial or full access restrictions; identities and owner/cooperation notes recorded in FAB.
- On-site workflow: Preliminary site assessment; plan route to cover entire square; use aerial photos when available; record data neatly and completely; protect and return aerial photos to ITE Merlewood.
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): Central data collection tool combining land-cover maps, boundaries, ownership, and quadrat data; requires neat, legible entries with clear identifiers; FAB pages sequenced but flexible in order.

## Data Collection Instruments and Coding

- FAB contents: Front cover with ownership, square location, and farmer/landowner information; maps for land cover and boundaries; 25-point placement maps; quadrat sheets; and an ownership page.
- Coding system: Use CS1990 land-cover and boundary codes; primary and secondary codes structured to describe land cover and boundaries; up to three primary codes per feature; codes linked to mappable units and dominant land-cover characteristics.
- Boundary and feature codes: Detailed codes for hedges, fences, walls, banks, watercourses, roads, railways, and built environments; include distance measurements and relative positioning (e.g., buffers around features).
- Built environments and curtilages: Special handling where features lie within or adjacent to urban/rural curtilages; separate treatment for gardens, allotments, car parks, and other urban-adjacent features.
- Data integrity: Emphasis on field decision-making and avoiding post-hoc lab classification; if doubt arises, qualifiers or comments should accompany recorded entries.

## Vegetation Recording and Quadrat Method

- Quadrat placement: 2x2m quadrats at selected points within lowland heath; centre defined by a mapped point; permanent marking for resurvey purposes using metal plates and stakes; photos taken for reference.
- Vegetation recording: Standardized sheet collects slope, aspect, shade, soil type, and a list of vascular plants, bryophytes, and lichens with percent cover in 5% increments; unlisted species also captured.
- Species identifications: Expectation to identify to species level where possible; use predefined 200 common species list; provision for combinations where precise ID is difficult (consistent with CS1990 practice).
- Data capture quality: Contains a detailed, printer-friendly template with a field-by-field guide to ensure consistency and reproducibility across survey teams.
- Permanent marking: Quadrats must be permanently marked and documented to enable future resurvey; all locations sketched on the back of the sheet with distances, angles, and bearings.

## Data Quality, Standards, and Management

- QA and standardization: Lessons from earlier surveys (observer bias, recording consistency) lead to formal QA processes and a comprehensive Field Handbook to standardize approach.
- Data discoverability and metadata: Ownership, permissions, and survey metadata recorded on FAB; maps and quadrat coordinates retained for future re-survey and cross-study comparability.
- Data lifecycle: Return FABs to Merlewood promptly; ensure accurate transcription and storage of field data; maintain traceability from field observations to coded datasets.

## Taxonomy, Species Lists, and Documentation

- Species lists: 200 common species used in field sheets; grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens cataloged with abbreviated codes for field efficiency; unlisted species added as needed.
- Documentation and references: Guidelines align with CS1990 codes and practices to facilitate comparability with the Countryside Survey program; field notes and sketches accompany coded data.

## Post-Survey Procedures

- Daily debrief: Review data sheets for completeness and omissions; address any access or recording issues promptly.
- Data submission: Transmit FABs back to ITE Merlewood; ensure proper packaging and transport; preserve original maps and notes; photographs archived with plot references.

## Archaeological and Additional Notes

- Archaeological features: A map is provided for noting any archaeological features within the square; photograph and describe noteworthy features for Lancaster University’s Archaeology Unit as appropriate.

- Closing statement: The document emphasizes standardization, rigour, and reproducibility to build a consistent, comparable dataset for monitoring changes in England’s lowland heath landscape.
