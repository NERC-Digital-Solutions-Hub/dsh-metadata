## Overview
- The document describes an environmental monitoring framework that uses data to demonstrate the condition of the environment in a consistent, time-based format for evaluating environmental health and policy performance.
- It implies responsibilities for organizations with set monitoring duties and relies on topic expertise and standardized approaches.

## Data Handling and Quality Assurance
- Emphasizes understanding and sourcing required data from established sources.
- Requires verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation of data before analysis.

## Analysis and Outputs
- Data are analyzed using standardized methods to produce outputs such as categorizing environmental health against established standards.
- Findings are presented in clear formats, including reports, maps, and charts.

## Data Management and Accessibility
- Created datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals.
- Aims to enable access to the underlying data used to generate final outputs, supporting transparency and reuse.

## Challenges and Opportunities
- Increasing the value of monitoring datasets by combining them with other relevant data rather than using them in isolation.
- Ensuring others can access the underlying data that underpins final outputs.
