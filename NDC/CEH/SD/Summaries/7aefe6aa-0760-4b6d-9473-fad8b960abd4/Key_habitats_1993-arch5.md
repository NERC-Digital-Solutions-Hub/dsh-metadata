# Data Stewards

## Overview
- Work for organisations or networks with large datasets
- Ensure appropriate data governance is in place
- Understand good data management practices and collaborate with data creators/sharers, guided by user needs

## Aims
- Ensure datasets meet appropriate standards
- Ensure datasets are stored, shared, and kept up to date
- Datasets are readily discoverable and usable by others

## How they meet their aims
- Understand user needs to ensure shared datasets are usable; may adopt a publishing mindset
- Collaborate with data creators to meet standards (accuracy, consistency, metadata, format); provide guidance and tools
- Identify data availability and limitations (disclosure risks, proprietary issues, embargoes)
- Receive data (sometimes needing follow-up)
- Quality assure, clean, and transform datasets before sharing
- Ensure sharing limitations are respected; implement systems for updates
- Upload datasets to relevant portals and catalogue data holdings
- Document work performed on datasets (where applicable)

## Key Responsibilities
- Align datasets with user needs to support discoverability and reuse
- Support data creators in applying standards and metadata practices
- Manage data acquisition, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation
- Monitor and enforce data sharing permissions and update processes
- Facilitate data publication to portals and catalogues
- Document data handling processes and lineage when appropriate

## Challenges
- Incomplete understanding of user needs and priorities
- Delays or difficulties in obtaining data
- Data creators not meeting standards, including metadata requirements
- Operating across multiple systems and formats, including difficult ones
- Handling large datasets that are hard to transfer
- Dealing with outdated databases requiring bespoke, non-interoperable solutions
