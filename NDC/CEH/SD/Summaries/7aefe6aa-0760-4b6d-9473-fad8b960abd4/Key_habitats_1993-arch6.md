# Data Support

## Aim and scope
- Support others in exploring data and obtaining useful insights by finding, combining, analyzing data, and creating data products for others to explore readily.
- Apply data analysis and communication skills to support data use across a broad range of topics.
- Often work for organisations with less specialised remits (e.g., local councils or private companies).

## Who they are
- Individuals with data analysis and communication skills who support a broad range of topics rather than deep specialisation.
- Often employed in less specialised organisations, supporting policy work and sometimes communicating data publicly.

## How they meet their aims
- Understand the ask: clarify what is needed and why, and determine the best approach.
- Find and verify sufficient data; may seek help from topic experts.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data; combine datasets.
- Analyze patterns to identify significant features.
- Create self-serve products (dashboards, pivot tables) or reports and charts; provide usage guidance.
- Promote outputs, gather feedback, and develop products further; share early prototypes.
- Advocate for better data creation.

## Key outputs and deliverables
- Data products enabling self-serve exploration (dashboards, pivot tables).
- Reports, charts, and guidance on using the outputs.
- Early prototypes and evolving outputs based on stakeholder feedback.

## Notable challenges
- Time spent understanding the ask due to limited data consideration in wider teams.
- Working with patchy data across a wide range of formats.
- Accessing data across different systems.
- Communicating complex information simply.
- Promoting outputs to encourage wider use and reuse.

## Text section interpretation
- The Text section appears garbled and OCR-heavy, with numerous symbols and fragmented phrases.
- Contains references that resemble domain data (e.g., natural terms, inundation, potential species names, and habitat notes), suggesting data categories a Data Support professional might encounter.
- Highlights data quality and interoperability challenges (noise, inconsistent formatting, incomplete metadata), underscoring the need for rigorous cleaning, metadata, and normalization in data preparation.
