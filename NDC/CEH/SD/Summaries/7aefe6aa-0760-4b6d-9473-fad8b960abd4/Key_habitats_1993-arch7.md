## Aim
- To create data products, primarily using map-based formats, that allow their intended audience to comprehend and explore relevant information readily.

## Who they are
- Data analysts focused on Geographical Information Systems (GIS).
- They create map-based visualisations for various audiences (policy colleagues, clients, public).

## How they meet their aims
- Understand audience needs by working closely with end users throughout the process.
- Find and verify data appropriate for their purposes.
- Quality assure, clean, and transform data, combining datasets, often bringing together data at different resolutions.
- Analyse data to identify significant features and decide how to present them.
- Present data in map formats using GIS to show spatial features clearly.
- Test early prototypes and iterate based on feedback; iterative development is important.

## Key Challenges
- Reacting to requests that don't consider data difficulties rather than proactively prioritising.
- Data is held in many places.
- Lack of data, especially at appropriate resolutions.
- Lack of consistent data standards.
- Large or complex datasets are not packaged into manageable chunks.
- The work needed to clean and transform the data.
- Developing teams with sufficient skills.
