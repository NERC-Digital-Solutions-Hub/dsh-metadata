# A July 1992 Draft August 1992

- Aims and context
  - Land use research aims: classify land by capability/quality, assess sustainability and consequences of land use, test suitable combinations, monitor change, and inform environmental, social, and economic policy.
  - The Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) and ITE have conducted GB-wide data collection surveys (1977/78, 1984, Countryside Survey 1990) using the ITE Land Classification System.
  - Countryside Surveys provide general countryside data; to complement them, DOE commissioned targeted surveys of habitats seen as under threat, aligning with five Landscape Types defined by the Countryside Commission Stewardship Scheme.

- Landscape Type focus and project timeline
  - Objectives are defined for each Landscape Type; the project will assess distribution, habitat and historic feature quantity/quality, the effect of current designations on preservation, and develop models to predict changes (e.g., climate, policy).
  - The first Landscape Type is lowland heath (survey planned for late summer 1992; report 1993; project completes 1994). The survey will extend to sites with potential to become lowland heath.
  - Approach aims to be broadly objective and compatible with Countryside Survey methods to relate rarer habitats to wider countryside changes.

- Survey design and scope
  - A stratified sample of 80 1-km squares across England (over half in the south; extending to Leeds and Penrith in the north).
  - Each square surveyed by a two-person team; on average one team-day per square (more time for lowland heath sites).
  - Logistics and staffing: flexible planning; no initial overtime but time off in lieu may be granted for large overtime; early start and efficient site visiting to minimize travel; accommodation planned five nights per week; weekly coordination by the Survey Leader.

- Equipment and permissions
  - Merlewood-provided: Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), aerial photographs, site maps (1:10,000), project handouts, marker plates, weatherproof clipboards, hammer, measuring tape, navigation gear, cameras, first aid, etc.
  - Surveyors-provided: personal gear (clothing, rucksack), reference books, cameras, binoculars.
  - Land access permissions required; early contact with landowners/farmers; permissions reviewed weekly; if access is withdrawn, reallocation to replacement square; partial permissions may allow limited surveying with specific rules.

- Field survey procedures
  - Survey approach depends on land type and access; a recommended procedure exists to maximize coverage and consistency.
  - Use of aerial photographs as aids; protect and preserve aerials; mark locations with reference to prominent features; coordinate with landowners as needed.

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
  - Each square uses a combined FAB and 1:10,000 map to gather land cover and boundaries data, plus vegetation quadrat data (lowland heath only) at 25 designated points.
  - Neat, legible completion is essential for later data analysis.
  - FAB structure includes: square series number, ownership information, farmer/landowner details, land cover map, boundaries map, historical features map, and up to 25 quadrat forms.
  - Ownership and access: record ownership details, tenancy, and cooperation level of landowners; ownership data used for background but not analysis constraints.

- Recording land cover and boundaries (lowland heath focus)
  - In each of 80 squares, describe land cover and the nearest boundary at 25 fixed points (and record vegetation in 2x2 m quadrats within the heath landscape).
  - Land cover and boundary data coded using CS1990 codes; boundaries include hedges, fences, walls, banks, watercourses, coastline, etc.
  - Ground rules for points on linear features or built environments guide where and how land cover and boundary information is recorded.
  - Two FAB sheets per square (land cover and boundaries) and a 1:10,000 map with 25 points.

- Codes, data structure, and data entry
  - Codes may be drawn from the CS1990 lists; primary codes must be used, with secondary codes for qualifiers; complex vegetation mosaics may require multiple codes but should be logically ordered (dominant code first).
  - Land cover mapping uses mappable units (minimum 400 m2); units defined by constancy of codes.
  - The surveyor makes field decisions; field notes or comments permitted for atypical/doubtful categories.

- Vegetation recording and quadrats (lowland heath)
  - Quadrats placed at points within potential acid-soil heath vegetation; target species selected to indicate acid soils and heath potential.
  - Quadrats laid out with precise geometry to ensure reproducibility and relocation in future surveys; permanent marking using two metal plates is emphasized.
  - Vegetation recording form captures header data (slope, aspect, shade, soil), plus a list of common species with presence and cover estimates in 5% increments; unlisted species recorded separately.
  - Quadrat data include sketches showing plot layout and measurement references; photographs (print films) captured for each vegetation plot.
  - Permanent quadrat marking and photography are stressed to enable future resurvey.

- Species identification and recording conventions
  - Aim to record to species level where possible; where difficult, record to the nearest taxon or use accepted species-combinations to maintain consistency with prior CS surveys.
  - A standard list of approximately 200 common species (grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens) is used; combinations are allowed when separation is not feasible.
  - Grasses: standardized 2-code notation for many common grass taxa (e.g., Agrostis species).
  - Forbs, woody species, sedges, rushes, and ferns: extensive cross-referenced codes provided (examples include Betula, Calluna, Juncus, Carex, Potentilla, etc.).

- Vegetation data collection details
  - A standardized recording sheet collects: plot header (environment, slope, aspect, shade, soil), 200 common species entries, and any unlisted species with cover percentages.
  - A detailed description and sketch accompany each plot; quadrats must be located and measured with care to maintain spatial accuracy across resurveys.
  - Permanent marks, location sketches, compass bearings, and photographic records are required for each quadrat.

- Forestry, boundaries, and built features
  - Separate sections cover forestry/woodland/tree coding, boundary types (walls, fences, hedges, banks), and built features (residential/industrial/recreational buildings, roads, verges, tracks, rights of way, and designated areas).
  - Boundaries and boundaries-related descriptions include stockproof status, gaps, maintenance history, and evidence of bracken or other vegetation impacting the boundary.
  - Special attention to urban-rural boundary designation and curtilage definitions; curtilages require specific treatment in recording.

- Archaeological features and post-survey procedures
  - An Archaeological Features section provides space to map features of interest and photograph notable sites.
  - Post-survey procedures emphasize checking for omissions, potential data transposition only when necessary, and timely transport of FABs back to Merlewood for processing.

- Documentation and authorship
  - The document is authored by Colin Barr (July 1992) and serves as the Field Handbook for the lowland heath component within the Countryside Survey framework.

- Practical outcomes for analysts
  - Provides a standardized, repeatable data-collection framework enabling robust analyses of land cover, boundaries, and heath-associated vegetation.
  - Facilitates modeling of landscape change, assessment of designation effects, and development of methodologies to measure change over time.
  - Emphasizes data provenance, QA, and metadata (codes, mapping units, and sample design) to support discoverability and reliable downstream analysis.
