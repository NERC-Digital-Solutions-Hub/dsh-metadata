# Changes in Habitat Survey of Lowland Heath Field Handbook (Draft July 1992)

- Aims and scope
  - Standardizes field data collection to support map-based data products for GIS users.
  - Builds on ITE Countryside Survey CS1990 methodology to monitor distribution, quantity, and quality of lowland heath habitats and associated features.
  - Seeks reproducible, objective data to relate rarer habitats to broader countryside changes and support policy guidance.

- Survey design and scope
  - Stratified sample of 80 1 km squares across England (majority in south; extends to Leeds and Penrith in the north).
  - For each square:
    - Describe land cover and boundaries at 25 fixed ground points.
    - Record vegetation in 2 x 2 m quadrats at 25 points that fall within lowland heath landscapes (identified by acid-soil indicators).
  - First landscape type (lowland heath) to be surveyed late summer 1992; others in 1993; project ends in 1994.
  - Aims include assessing distribution, documenting habitats and historic features, evaluating designation effects, developing predictive models, and refining policy protections.

- Field data collection and QA
  - Emphasis on standardization to minimize observer bias; QA program implemented; a comprehensive Field Handbook is essential.
  - Field data are captured on Field Assessment Booklets (FABs), combining the FAB pages with 1:10,000 scale maps for each square.
  - Emphasis on completing FABs neatly and unambiguously to enable later analysis.

- Field procedures and logistics
  - Each survey team consists of two people; flexible work arrangements; aim to minimize site revisits; no overtime initially (time off in lieu for large overtime).
  - Five nights per week accommodation assumed; travel planning to optimize efficiency; weekend work allowed with rest rules.
  - Permissions: obtain landowner access in advance; if access is withdrawn or partial, apply rules to determine survey viability or alternatives.
  - Aerial photographs may be used as ground-truthing aids but must be protected and not altered.

- Equipment and responsibilities
  - Equipment provided by Merlewood (FABs, site photos, 1:10,000 maps, markers, clipboards, measuring tools, etc.) and by surveyors (clothing, personal gear, maps, camera, etc.).
  - Aerial photos, markers, cameras, and field recording materials are standard parts of data collection.

- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB) structure
  - FAB comprises: front cover, ownership map, farmer/landowner information, land cover map, boundaries map, historical features map, and up to 25 quadrat recording forms.
  - Ownership and access: document landowner contacts, ownership numbers, and cooperation level; use codes to indicate cooperativeness.
  - Recording land cover and boundaries: 25 points per square; describe land cover and the nearest boundary within 100 m; boundaries include hedges, fences, walls, banks, watercourses, etc.
  - Rules for points on linear features and boundaries: specify land cover 10 m away from the boundary or move to the center of the nearby land cover as appropriate.
  - Mapping and coding: use CS1990 land cover and boundary codes; each point’s data stored as coded strings under the map; primary and secondary codes used to describe complex mosaics, with a preference for the dominant code first.

- Vegetation and quadrat methodology
  - Quadrat placement and orientation: quadrats centered on ground points; SE corner designated; tape and canes used to outline the 2 x 2 m square; measurements and diagonals recorded for accuracy.
  - Vegetation recording: record 200 common species on a standardized sheet; estimate cover in 5% increments; unlisted species recorded separately; include bryophytes and lichens; permanent quadrat marking with two metal plates for future resurvey.
  - Data fields on FAB for vegetation: slope, aspect, shade, soil type, and a sketch map showing plot layout and marker positions.
  - Photos: photograph each vegetation plot with scale and landmarks; include plot number and shot direction on sketch map.

- Codes and data organization
  - Land cover codes: apply to the mappable unit (minimum 400 m2); multiple codes allowed to describe mosaic, but the dominant cover code typically carries precedence.
  - Boundary and vegetation codes: use combinations of primary codes to describe land cover and boundaries; avoid over-accumulating codes; ensure codes reflect logical relationships (e.g., cover before species).
  - Species and vegetation lists: a curated list of ~200 species (grasses, forbs, woody species, bryophytes, and others) is provided for consistent identification; glyphs and abbreviations used to fit sheet space.
  - Quadrat data: detailed guidance on archiving, ownership, and species identification to maintain consistency across observers and future resurvey efforts.

- Data management and post-survey
  - After survey days, carefully review FABs for omissions; avoid re-transcribing data unless essential.
  - Transport FABs back to ITE Merlewood promptly; use standardized processes to preserve data integrity for analysis.

- Archaeology and designations
  - A map for recording archaeological features is included; note features of potential interest to archaeology units; photograph features with scale where relevant.

- Key contextual notes for GIS specialists
  - The handbook is designed to produce standardized, map-ready data suitable for integration into GIS workflows, enabling spatial analyses of land cover, boundaries, and heath-related vegetation.
  - It emphasizes reproducibility, QA, and compatibility with previous CS1990 data for longitudinal analyses.
  - It provides a comprehensive, code-driven framework for capturing detailed landscape information at both coarse (1 km square) and fine (2 x 2 m quadrat) scales, including field-validated metadata (ownership, permissions, site conditions) and extensive vegetation inventories.
