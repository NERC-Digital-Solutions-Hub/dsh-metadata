# A July 1992 Draft Augugt 1992

## Overview
- A field handbook for monitoring changes in the British countryside, focused on lowland heath and related landscape types.
- Builds on previous ITE Countryside Surveys (1977/8, 1984, 1990) to provide standardized data collection, quality assurance, and repeatable methodologies.
- Aims to characterize landscape distribution, habitat quality, historic features, and effects of designations; develop models to predict changes (e.g., climate, policy) and propose policy refinements; and develop change-measurement methodologies.
- Emphasizes objective, reproducible procedures that align with Countryside Survey standards to enable long-term monitoring and cross-survey compatibility.

## Objectives and Scope
- For each Landscape Type (starting with lowland heath and expanding to others):
  - Assess England-wide distribution.
  - Survey habitats and historic features; determine quantity/quality.
  - Evaluate the impact of current designations on preservation.
  - Develop conceptual models to predict changes and design effective protections.
  - Refine policies to enhance protection.
  - Develop methodologies to measure change over time.
- First Landscape Type (lowland heath) to be surveyed in late summer 1992; report due 1993; project runs through 1994.
- Approach chosen for broad objectivity and comparability with Countryside Surveys; address observer variation through standardization and QA.

## Sampling and Survey Design
- Stratified sample of 80 1-km squares across England, with emphasis in the south but extending to the north.
- Each square surveyed by a two-person team; each square roughly one team-day, with variability for habitat complexity.
- Survey logistics prioritize ground coverage efficiency and minimizing site revisits; accommodation and travel arrangements managed to optimize time and cost.
- Data collection is designed to be compatible with existing CS1990 coding and mapping systems.

## Data Collection and Field Procedures
- Field Assessment Booklet (FAB): combines land cover maps, boundaries, and quadrat data for each square; essential that FABs are completed neatly for analyzability.
- Field procedures cover:
  - On-site acclimation, permissions, route planning to enable full square coverage.
  - Use of aerial photographs and ground-truthing for site location and contextual reference.
  - Systematic data recording at 25 fixed points per square and 2×2 m quadrats within lowland heath areas.
  - Marking permanent quadrats for future resurvey, including two metal marker plates and a detailed ground sketch.
- Emphasis on consistency and minimizing observer bias; QA processes and a Field Handbook to standardize interpretation and recording.

## Field Assessment Booklet (FAB)
- FAB structure includes: front cover, ownership, farmer/landowner information, land cover map, boundaries map, historical features map, and up to 25 quadrat recording forms.
- Each page must be clearly labelled with the square series number; use of pencil recommended; codes used to indicate recent changes when possible.
- Recording rules and conventions for land cover, boundaries, and the relationship between points, boundaries, and adjacent land use are specified to ensure consistent mapping.

## Vegetation Recording and Quadrat Method
- Quadrats: 2×2 m quadrats placed at 25 designated points within the lowland heath landscape; quadrats selected to reflect acid-soil vegetation with potential to develop into lowland heath under management.
- Vegetation data collected using a standardized sheet, including:
  - Header attributes: slope, aspect, shade, soil type, and site description.
  - Species list (about 200 common GB taxa); percent cover estimated in 5% increments.
  - Unlisted species recorded; sketch of plot layout and measurement details provided.
  - Permanent marking, photography, and precise location methods to enable future resurvey.
- Emphasis on capturing dominant species, canopy structure, and multi-layer vegetation where present.

## Land Cover, Boundaries, and Boundary Codes
- Detailed coding system for land cover and boundaries (CS1990-derived codes) to describe the mapped units and their boundaries.
- Points: 25 fixed sample points per square used to record land cover types and the nearest boundary (within 100 m) where applicable.
- Boundaries include hedges, walls, fences, watercourses, banks, and urban-adjacent features; rules specify how to describe land cover near boundaries and how to record if located on a boundary.
- Codes used in an ordered, logical sequence to link land cover with boundary attributes and to enable reconstruction of vegetation mosaics and boundary histories.
- Special emphasis on built environments, curtilages, and the distinction between long-term features and temporary or transitional features.

## Species List and Recording Conventions
- Comprehensive list of common grasses, forbs, bryophytes, and lichens for field identification and coding.
- Species codes correspond to established vegetation groups; where a species is not listed, unlisted species are recorded with its name and percentage cover.
- Focus on reproducibility with the CS1990 field code framework and cross-reference with the broader ITE/CS datasets.

## Equipment, Permissions, and Logistics
- Equipment: field kits provided by Merlewood (FABs, maps, aerial photos, marker plates, measuring tools, cameras, etc.) and items to be supplied by survey teams (personal gear, books, binoculars).
- Permissions: access to land must be secured in advance; early contact with landowners and land managers is encouraged; if permission is withdrawn, a replacement square is provided; partial permissions trigger specific rules about site surveying.
- Survey teams: two-person units, flexible schedules, no overtime (unless offset by time off in lieu); careful record-keeping of hours and travel arrangements.

## Post-Survey Procedures and Archival
- After each survey day, data sheets are reviewed for completeness; FABs transported to Merlewood promptly.
- Post-survey documentation includes archaeological features where relevant and photographs of notable findings.
- Permanent quadrat marking and meticulous documentation are emphasized to ensure future resurvey capability.

## QA and Data Value for Monitoring
- Recognition that observer bias is a major source of uncertainty; standardized recording protocols and QA programs are essential to produce reliable trend data.
- The Handbook aims to maximize data quality, reproducibility, and comparability with previous Countryside Surveys, enabling time-series analyses and integration into policy monitoring and environmental health assessments.
- Data are intended to be stored and uploaded to appropriate portals, supporting transparency and broader data accessibility for downstream analysis and cross-dataset fusion.

## Practical Implications for Analysts
- Provides a rigorous, standardized framework for collecting and organizing environmental monitoring data across landscape types, enabling consistent temporal analyses.
- Supports integration with national survey data (Countryside Surveys) to evaluate landscape change, designation effects, and policy outcomes.
- Emphasizes data quality, traceability, and the ability to reuse datasets by linking land cover, boundary, and vegetation data through a uniform coding system.
- Highlights the importance of making underlying data accessible to others to maximize the value and utility of monitoring datasets.
