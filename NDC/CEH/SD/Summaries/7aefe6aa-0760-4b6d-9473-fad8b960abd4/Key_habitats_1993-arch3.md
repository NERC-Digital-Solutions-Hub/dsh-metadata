# Monitoring Frameworks

- Aim
  - Identify environmental health measures for scrutinising and evaluating policy, and for informing future decisions.
  - Typically held by managers in government departments or environmental quangos responsible for deciding on and implementing monitoring approaches.

- Who they are
  - Managerial professionals within government departments or environmental quangos tasked with choosing and delivering monitoring strategies.

- How they meet their aims
  - Engage with stakeholders and experts to understand which measures provide useful insight.
  - Learn from others to avoid duplication and to adopt best practices.
  - Locate and verify available data; address metadata gaps by contacting data originators.
  - May add metadata to datasets; public sharing of underlying data is often a barrier.
  - Commission new data to fill gaps; establish quality, openness, and data management standards at the source.
  - Ensure data are quality assured, cleaned, transformed, analyzed, and that findings are communicated clearly (reports, charts, dashboards).
  - Disseminate outputs; consult stakeholders; ensure underlying data are shared appropriately; implement data governance processes.

- Key challenges
  - Lack of data, including data of adequate quality.
  - Limited access to data, including timeliness.
  - Silos within and between organisations hinder collaboration.
  - Public sharing requirements for datasets can impede use of existing data.
  - Keeping data up to date can deter data sharing.
  - Inadequate metadata hampers verification against requirements.
  - Data formats often require effortful transformation to be usable.
  - Communicating complex findings clearly.
  - Establishing and maintaining data governance to ensure datasets meet standards, are stored, shared, and kept up to date.
