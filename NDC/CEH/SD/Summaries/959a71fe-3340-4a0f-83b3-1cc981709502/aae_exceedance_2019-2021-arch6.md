# Introduction

- 1x1 km data sets summarise Average Accumulated Exceedance (AAE) of acidity and nutrient nitrogen critical loads due to acid and nitrogen deposition for 2019–2021.
- AAE combines habitat-level exceedances, exceeded habitat area, and total habitat area within each 1x1 km grid square; computed by first calculating AE (exceedance × exceeded habitat area) and then AAE = AE / total habitat area.
- Two datasets:
  - Acidity AAE: acid_aae_2019-2021.tif
  - Nutrient nitrogen AAE: nutn_aae_2019-2021.tif
- Values are in keq ha-1 year-1; nutrient nitrogen AAE can be converted to kg N ha-1 year-1 using 1 keq ha-1 year-1 = 14 kg N ha-1 year-1.

- The data are based on UK methods for calculating critical loads and exceedances, with summary statistics published in annual Trends Reports and UK Biodiversity Indicators. Freshwater data (based on catchments) are not included in the 1x1 km grid AAE calculations.

- Datasets include two rasters with different spatial coverage reflecting habitat distributions sensitive to acidity (for AAE) and eutrophication (for AAE).

- Data are provided in British National Grid (EPSG:27700), each with a single band.

- Quality control aligns with UNECE CLRTAP methods; detailed methodology is documented in the UK Methods Report (Hall et al., 2015).

- Users should interpret exceedances as long-term potential impacts under steady-state assumptions; reductions in deposition do not imply immediate ecological recovery due to time lags.
