## Overview
- A stratified survey of ecological and soil states aimed at mapping covariation between vegetation and edaphic characteristics.
- Focuses on covariation patterns across boreal sites in Yukon (2013) and Northwest Territories (2014), Canada.
- Data cover fine-scale measurements across 24–30 × 1 m² plots per site, including vegetation structure, moss/organic layers, and soil moisture.

## What was collected
- Leaf Area Index (LAI)
  - Tree canopy LAI (LAI Tree)
  - Understory LAI (LAI U)
- Ground and soil layers
  - Moss thickness
  - Organic matter (OM) thickness
  - Combined OM and moss thickness
- Soil moisture
  - Surface moisture (upper moss/soil layer, ~0–6 cm)
  - Deeper moisture (approximately 11–16 cm below moss/soil surface)
- Topography and soil properties
  - Slope (degrees)
  - Active-layer thaw depth (ALT)
  - Temperature confirmation at thaw boundary (0 °C) during ALT measurement
- Additional site features
  - Elevation
  - Vegetation zone and description
  - Disturbance/hydrology status
  - Permafrost zone

## Methods
- LAI Tree
  - Measured with a Nikon D5000 DSLR and hemispherical lens; nine photos per plot taken ~1 m above plots.
  - Processed with CAN-EYE; LAI2000 output used for comparability; sky conditions thresholded by the same researcher to standardize results.
- LAI U
  - Measured with LI-COR LAI2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer; one measurement above and four measurements around a 20 × 20 cm square at plot center.
  - Sky conditions controlled with a narrow 90° cap; shading applied when conditions warranted.
- Plant height
  - Maximum understory vegetation height measured at five points (four corners + center of a 0.5 × 0.5 m quadrat); mean used in analyses.
- Moss thickness
  - Moss and organic material section carefully removed; thickness measured from moss surface to base of decomposed dead moss.
- Surface and deeper soil moisture
  - Surface moisture measured in the upper ~6 cm with a ThetaKit probe (accuracy ~1% for 0–50% VMC; measurements reflect moss layer moisture).
  - Deeper moisture measured at ~11 cm depth (volume ~11–16 cm below surface); four measurements per plot averaged.
- OM and moss depth
  - OM thickness measured with a soil corer; moss thickness subtracted to obtain mineral/organic interface depth.
- Slope
  - Assessed with a 50 cm wooden plank along the steepest gradient; angle measured with a bubble-level digital inclinometer.
- ALT (Active Layer Thickness)
  - Measured with a stainless steel rod; probe inserted until frozen soil encountered; temperature verified to be at or near 0 °C.
  - Plots with temperatures > 0 °C excluded from analysis.

## Temporal coverage
- Vegetation sampling occurred in August 2013 (Yukon) and August 2014 (NWT)
- Soil sampling window ranged from mid-August to early September 2013 and 2014, with some sites recorded in late July for vegetation

## Data structure and usage
- The dataset is designed to enable analysis of relationships between vegetation structure and soil/edaphic properties at fine spatial scales.
- Data can support investigations into active-layer dynamics in boreal permafrost regions and broader environmental monitoring and policy performance assessments.
- Variables are standardized for cross-site comparisons and linked to broader findings on vegetation–soil interactions in boreal ecosystems.
