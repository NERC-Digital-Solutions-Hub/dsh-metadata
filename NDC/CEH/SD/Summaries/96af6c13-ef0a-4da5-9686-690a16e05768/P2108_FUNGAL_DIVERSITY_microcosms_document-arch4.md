# Function and taxonomic diversity of mycorrhizas in grassland.

## Context and aims
- Part of the NERC Soil Biodiversity Thematic Programme (established 1999) focused on understanding soil biota diversity and the functional roles of soil organisms.
- Investigates arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity and how plant communities influence AM diversity and community composition in grassland microcosms.
- Combines field-origin plant assemblages, controlled microcosm experiments, and molecular fingerprinting to assess AM diversity in grassland contexts.

## Experimental design and setup
- Establishment of grassland microcosms using rendzina soil from Sourhope/Derbyshire sites, housed in acrylic boxes (600 × 600 mm, 150 mm deep).
- Treatments: bare soil; monoculture of Carex flacca (sedge); monoculture of Festuca ovina (grass); and a 12-species mixture representing sedges, grasses, and forbs.
- Each microcosm treated to maintain plant assemblages (randomized placement, regular weeding, clipping to 25 mm).
- Plant materials sourced from limestone grassland; four replicates per treatment (16 microcosms total).
- Bioassay component introduced in 2000 using Plantago lanceolata as a responsive AM host.

## Bioassay and sampling
- Plantago lanceolata seedlings grown for 12 weeks in controlled conditions and transplanted into three of the microcosm treatments.
- Root systems harvested, washed, and stored for DNA analysis.
- The bioassay aims to reveal AM fungal diversity hosted by the plantlets across different plant community treatments.

## Molecular analysis and data processing
- AM fungal diversity assessed within Plantago lanceolata roots using T-RFLP (terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism) of the SSU rRNA gene.
- PCR targets: partial SSU rRNA gene using universal primer NS31 and AM fungal-specific primer AM1 to amplify ~550 bp fragments.
- Digestion with two restriction enzymes (HinFI and Hsp92II) to generate multiple TRFs for better discrimination.
- Fragment analysis performed on an ABI377 sequencer with GeneScan sizing; only fragments between 45 and 450 bp are considered.
- Reproducibility checked with duplicates; data presented as presence/absence of TRFs (no consideration of TRF peak heights for this dataset).
- Dataset focuses on species richness (T-RFs present) rather than evenness.

## Data structure and dataset details
- Dataset: 1005 - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity dataset (Microcosm experiment at Sheffield University).
- Data captured per sample: MICROCOSMID, TREATMENT (soil and plant community context), SPECIES (plant assemblage), BAND1-60 (presence/absence of 60 TRFs).
- Data type notes: textual descriptions for sample types and treatments; TRF presence/absence encoded as 1/0.
- Data type and formatting validated through quality checks; TRF identification limited to presence/absence across samples.

## Quality control and governance
- Quality control procedures include numeric range checks, formatting checks, and logical integrity checks.
- Data are provided with caveats: no warranty on accuracy or fitness for purpose; liability for usage not assumable by NERC.
- Data include provenance information and reference to supporting materials (handbooks and related publications).
