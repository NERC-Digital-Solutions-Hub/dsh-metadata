# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

## Overview
- LCM2023 is UKCEH’s Land Cover Map for 2023, the eleventh in the series.
- Product suite comprises seven geospatial datasets: three for Great Britain and Northern Ireland (GB and NI) including a 10 m Classified Pixel dataset, a Land Parcel dataset, and a 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset; plus a 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
- 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats) mapped by automatic classification of Classification Scenes using Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images and Context Rasters.
- Classification uses Bootstrap Training with a Random Forest classifier; aim is to enable annual, comparable mapping to support change detection and environmental decision-making.
- Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 83% at full thematic detail.

## Data products and formats
- 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
  - Pixel-level classification with two bands (GB) or three bands (NI): most-likely UKCEH Land Cover Class and associated class probability/confidence.
  - Keeps full 10 m detail (not generalised by the Land Parcel Framework) to preserve fine features; validation performed against the 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel dataset.
- Land Parcel datasets
  - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework; includes parcel-level attributes (gid, hist, mode, purity, conf, n, agg, etc.).
  - GB and NI versions available; coordinate systems GB 27700 and NI 29903.
- 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
  - Rasterised per parcel into 25 m pixels; three attributes carried (mode, conf, purity).
- 1 km summary rasters
  - Summary products aggregating 25 m rasters to 1 km: dominant class (21-class and 10-class aggregates) and percentage cover (21-class and 10-class aggregates).
  - Percent values are integer-rounded; totals may not sum exactly to 100 due to rounding and coastal gaps.
- Context and seasonal data inputs
  - Seasonal Composite Images (Sentinel-2, 10 m) plus Context Rasters used in classification (GB and NI).
- Datasets are described with DOIs for citation; a full dataset list and metadata are provided in the appendices.

## How the data are produced
- Seasonal Composite Images
  - Sentinel-2 surface reflectance, four seasonal periods, 10 m resolution; occasional gaps from cloud are tolerated.
- Context Rasters
  - 10 m layers capturing terrain and proximity information (height, aspect, slope; distance to buildings, roads, tidal water, freshwater, foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh).
  - Separate masks for GB and NI to aid disambiguation near coastlines and in urban areas.
- Classification Scenes and tile strategy
  - GB: 32 Classification Scenes (tiles ~100 x 100 km) trained and classified independently to manage regional phenology.
  - NI: single Classification Scene with a 49-band input (from the 40-band Sentinel-2 seasonal image plus NI context rasters).
- Bootstrap Training
  - Automatic training data generated from historic LCM maps (LCM2020–LCM2022); pixels with >80% probability and consistent class across three years are used.
  - Training data balanced across classes using sampling with replacement to avoid dominance by common classes.
- Random Forest classification
  - Bespoke UKCEH software integrates WEKA with PostGIS and GDAL; outputs include class membership probabilities.
- UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Generalised land parcels (~0.5 ha MMU) used to group 10 m pixels, enabling change detection and a stable geographic unit for analysis.

## Validation and data quality
- Validation
  - 33,107 validation points across 21 classes, combining field surveys, inventory data, and expert validation points.
  - Reported overall accuracy: 83% (full thematic detail).
- Known issues
  - Some polygons missing from vector land parcel products, causing nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised parcels (negligible effect on 1 km rasters; 10 m pixels unaffected).
  - Differences in method across years may produce map changes beyond actual land-cover change.

## Spatial framework and data management
- UK Land Parcel Spatial Framework
  - Existing since LCM2007; parcels are feature-based units dominated by a primary land-cover type.
  - Parcels help reduce noise and enable straightforward change detection, but parcel identifiers (gid) differ from LCM2015; cross-year parcel-id comparison by spatial overlap may not be direct.
- Coordinate systems
  - GB: British National Grid (EPSG: 27700)
  - NI: Irish Grid (TM75, EPSG: 29903)
- Data volumes and extents
  - GB and NI 10 m and 25 m products; parcel counts and extents documented in the dataset metadata.

## Usage, citation, and access
- Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; users should cite the corresponding dataset and Marston et al. (2023/2024) where applicable.
- Disclaimer
  - Some annual differences reflect changes in production methods; users should consider method changes when interpreting year-to-year differences.
- Appendices provide in-depth notes on Land Cover Classes, Broad Habitats definitions, dataset inventories, validation matrices, and color recipes for map visualization (including color-blind friendly options).
