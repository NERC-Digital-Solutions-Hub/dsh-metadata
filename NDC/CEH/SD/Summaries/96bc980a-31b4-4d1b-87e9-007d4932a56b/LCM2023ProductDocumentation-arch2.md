# The UKCEH Land Cover Map for 2023

- Purpose and scope
  - UKCEH LCM2023 is a national land cover map produced annually, comprising seven datasets for Great Britain and Northern Ireland: three 10 m products (classified pixels, land parcels, and rasterised land parcels), plus a 1 km summary raster product covering GB and NI.
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes (based on Biodiversity Broad Habitats) mapped from Sentinel-2 Seasonal Composite Images with Context Layers to reduce spectral confusion.
  - Aim is to enable consistent monitoring of environmental state and change over time, supporting change detection and policy evaluation with annual updates.
  - Formal validation reports an overall accuracy of 83% at full thematic detail.

- Data products and structure
  - 10 m Classified Pixel datasets (GB and NI)
    - GB: two-band product (class identifier, associated probability/confidence).
    - NI: three-band product.
    - High-detail 10 m pixels are not generalized by the Land Parcel framework to preserve small features and narrow landscape elements; validation was conducted against the 25 m rasterised dataset.
  - Land Parcel datasets
    - Generated by intersecting 10 m classified pixels with the UKCEH Land Parcel Spatial Framework to create parcel-level attributes.
    - Parcels (~0.5 ha MMU) are designed to represent discrete land units and reduce classification noise; useful for time-series comparisons.
  - 25 m Rasterised Land Parcel datasets
    - Rasterized version of the Land Parcel dataset, featuring three bands: dominant land cover (_mode), confidence (_conf), and purity (_purity).
  - 1 km Summary rasters
    - Summary products summarising 25 m data to 1 km pixels:
      - Dominant cover at 1 km (for classes and aggregates) – 1 band each.
      - Percentage cover at 1 km for classes (21 bands) and for aggregates (10 bands).
    - Percentage values are integers and may not sum exactly to 100% due to rounding and coastal area considerations.

- Spatial coverage and coordinate systems
  - Great Britain: British National Grid (OSGB 27700)
  - Northern Ireland: Irish Grid (TM75 IRELAND 29903)
  - GB parcel counts: ~6.74 million; NI parcels: ~0.90 million
  - Pixel resolutions: 10 m (pixels), 25 m (rasters), 1 km summaries

- Data production workflow
  - Seasonal Composite Images
    - Derived from Google Earth Engine using Sentinel-2, resampled to 10 m; four seasonal composites (Jan–Mar, Apr–Jun, Jul–Sep, Oct–Dec) with 10 spectral bands (and additional red-edge bands).
    - Occasional cloud gaps are handled automatically; classifier tolerates partially missing spectral information.
  - Context Rasters
    - 10 m context layers to reduce spectral confusion (GB: height, aspect, slope, distances to buildings/roads/tidal water/freshwater, foreshore, woodland, saltmarsh; NI: height, aspect, slope, urban mask, distances to coast/roads/water, foreshore, tidal water).
  - Classification Scenes and Bootstrap Training
    - GB: 32 Classification Scenes (tiles ~100 x 100 km) to cover land surface; NI: single 49-band Classification Scene for NI.
    - Bootstrap Training automatically generates training observations from historic LCM maps (2020–2022) and combines them with current seasonal composites.
    - Random Forest classifier used; training samples balanced across classes (10,000 per bag) to avoid dominance by common classes.
    - The Bootstrap Training dataset uses pixels with >80% probability classified as the same class across three prior years.
  - Validation and accuracy
    - Validation set comprises 33,107 points across 21 classes, drawn from national surveys and bespoke validation points.
    - Reported overall accuracy: 83% (full thematic detail).
  - Data and software
    - Production relies on a bespoke workflow integrating Weka, PostGIS, and GDAL; all open-source components.

- Known issues and cautions
  - A small number of polygons are missing from vector land parcel products, resulting in nodata areas in the 25 m rasterised land parcels; negligible impact on 1 km summaries. The 10 m classified pixels dataset remains unaffected.
  - Methods are continuously evolving; annual outputs may reflect changes in methodology in addition to real land-cover change.

- UKCEH Land Cover Classes and BAP Broad Habitats
  - 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes are aligned, but not identical, to Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP) Broad Habitats; see Appendix for detailed mappings and notes on potential spectral confusion.
  - UKCEH classes are capitalised when referring to defined classes; BAP Broad Habitats are italicised when referred to in context.
  - Generalized Land Parcel classes are provided for users needing less thematic detail; Table 1 shows relationships between aggregate classes, BAP Broad Habitats, and UKCEH classes.

- How to use the outputs
  - Outputs provide standardized, time-series-ready data to monitor land-cover state and change over time, enabling comparisons across years and integration with environmental indicators.
  - See Appendix 3 for official dataset names and Appendix 4 confusion matrices for a detailed view of classification performance.
  - Color recipes and QGIS symbology are provided (Appendices 5 and 6) to facilitate visualization of 21 UKCEH Land Cover Classes, including color-blind friendly options.

- Accessibility and citation
  - Each LCM2023 dataset has a DOI; guidance to cite Marston et al. (2023–2024) for production methods and each dataset’s DOI is provided.
  - Full dataset list includes 10 m classified pixels (GB and NI), land parcel products, 25 m rasterised land parcels (GB and NI), and 1 km summary rasters.

- Practical context for environmental monitoring
  - Annual production enhances temporal comparability, supports change detection, and distinguishes random classification errors from persistent real-world change.
  - The combination of high-detail 10 m pixels and parcel-based aggregation enables both fine-scale analysis and robust, stable time-series monitoring for policy evaluation and environmental health assessment.
