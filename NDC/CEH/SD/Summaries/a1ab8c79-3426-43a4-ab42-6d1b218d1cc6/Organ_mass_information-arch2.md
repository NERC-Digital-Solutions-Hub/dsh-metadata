- Data quality, processing and outputs:
  - Data understanding, verification, quality assurance, cleaning, and transformation are part of the workflow.
  - Analyses use standardized methods and produce outputs such as reports, maps, and charts.
  - Datasets are stored and uploaded to appropriate data portals; underlying data should be accessible.

- Practical challenges and opportunities:
  - Increase the value of datasets by integrating with other relevant data rather than using them in isolation.
  - Facilitate access to the underlying data used to create final outputs for transparency and reuse.
